Purpose of Regulatory Action a. Rationale for the Regulatory Action In this final rule the Secretary of the Depa rtment of Health and Human Services (the 13 Secretary) will specify Stage 2 criteria beginning in 2014 that e ligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) must meet in order to qualify for an incentive payment, as well as introduce change s to the program timeline and detail Medicare payment adjustments. Recommendations on Stag e 2 criteria from the Health IT Policy Committee (HITPC), a Federal Advisory Committee th at coordinates industry and provider input regarding the Medicare and Medi caid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs were substantially adopted, with consid eration of current program data for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. Our current program data is derived from two sources. First, data elements from the registration and attestation process of thos e providers who have already registered and attested to Stage 1 of meaningf ul use. This includes demographic information about the provider, the Certified EHR Tec hnology (CEHRT) used by the provider and their performance on the meaningful use objectives and measures. Second, we have information from thousands of questions providers submitted about the EHR Incentive Programs. These questions provide insights into the difficulties faced by pr oviders and also into the areas of the EHR Incentive Programs that warra nt additional clarification. b. Legal Authority for the Regulatory Action The American Recovery and Reinvest ment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) amended Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) to authorize incentive payments to EPs, eligible hosp itals, and CAHs, and Medicare A dvantage (MA) organizations to promote the adoption and meaningful use of CEHRT. Sections 1848(o), 1853(l) and (m), 1886(n), a nd 1814(l) of the Act pr ovide the statutory basis for the Medicare incentive payments made to meaningful EHR users. These statutory provisions govern EPs, Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations (for certain qualifying EPs and 14 hospitals that meaningfully use CEHRT), subsect ion (d) hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) respectively. Sections 1848(a)(7), 1853(l) and (m), 1886( b)(3)(B), and 1814(l) of the Act also establish downward payment adjustments, beginning with calendar or fiscal year 2015, for EPs, MA organizations, subsect ion (d) hospitals and CAHs that are not meaningful users of CEHRT for certain associat ed reporting periods. Sections 1903(a)(3)(F) and 1903( t) of the Act provide the st atutory basis for Medicaid incentive payments. (There are no payment adjustments under Medicaid). For a more detailed explanation of the statutory basis for the EHR incentive payments, see the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44316 through 44317). 2. Summary of Major Provisions a. Stage 2 Meaningful Us e Objectives and Measures In the Stage 1 final rule we outlined Stag e 1 meaningful use criteria, we finalized a separate set of core objectives and menu objectives for EPs, elig ible hospitals and CAHs. EPs and hospitals must meet the measure or qualify for an exclusion to all 15 core objectives and 5 out of the 10 menu objectives in order to qualify for an EHR incen tive payment. In this final rule, we maintain the same core-menu structure for the program for Stage 2. We are finalizing that EPs must meet the measure or qualify for an exclusion to 17 core obj ectives and 3 of 6 menu objectives. We are finalizing that eligible hospitals and CAHs mu st meet the measure or qualify for an exclusion to 16 core objectives and 3 of 6 menu objectives. Nearly all of the Stage 1 core and menu objectives are retained for Stage 2. Th e \"exchange of key clinical information\" core objective from Stage 1 was re-evaluated in favor of a more robust \"trans itions of care\" core objective in Stage 2, and the \"Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information\" objective was removed because it was replaced by a \"view online, download, and 15 transmit\" core objective. There are also multiple Stage 1 objectives that were combined into more unified Stage 2 objectives, with a subsequent rise in the measure th reshold that providers must achieve for each objective that has been retained from Stage 1. b. Reporting on Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs are requi red to report on specified clinical quality measures in order to qualify for incentive pa yments under the Medica re and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. This final rule outlines a process by which EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will submit CQM data el ectronically, reducing the associated burden of reporting on quality measures for providers. EPs will submit 9 CQMs from at least 3 of the National Quality Strategy domains out of a potenti al list of 64 CQMs acr oss 6 domains. We are recommending a core set of 9 CQMs focusing on adult populations with a particular focus on controlling blood pressure. We are also recommending a core set of 9 CQMs for pedi atric populations. EPs should report on these recommended CQMs if they ar e representative of th eir clinical practice and patient population. Eligible hospitals and CAHs will submit 16 CQMs from at least 3 of the National Quality Strategy domains out of a poten tial list of 29 CQMs across 6 domains. For the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use must submit thei r CQM data via attestation, and those beyond their first year must submit their CQM data electronically via a CMS- designated transmission method. For EPs, this includes an aggregate electronic submissi on or a patient-level electronic submission through the method specified by the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) that would provide one submission for credit in both the PQRS and Medicare EHR Incentive Program. For eligible hospitals and CAHs, this includes an aggregate elec tronic submission or a patient-level data submission through the me thod similar to the Medicare EHR Incentive 16 Program Electronic Reporting Pilot, which is proposed for extension in the CY 2013 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (O PPS) proposed rule (July 30, 2012, 77 FR 45188). For electronic submissions, patient-level data must be submitted using the Quality Reporting Data Architecture (QRDA) Category I format, and aggregate-level data must be submitted using the QRDA Category III format. c. Payment Adjustments and Exceptions Medicare payment adjustments are required by statute to take effect in 2015. We are finalizing a process by which payment adjustme nts will be determined by a prior reporting period. Therefore, we specify that EPs and eligib le hospitals that are meaningful EHR users in 2013 will avoid payment adjustment in 2015. Also, if such providers first meet meaningful use in 2014, they will avoid the 2015 payment adjust ment, if they are able to demonstrate meaningful use at least 3 months prior to the end of the calendar (f or EPs) or fiscal year (for eligible hospitals) and meet the registration and attestati on requirement by July 1, 2014 (for eligible hospitals) or Oct ober 1, 2014 (for EPs). We also are finalizing exceptions to these pa yment adjustments. This final rule outlines four categories of exceptions based on (1) the lack of availability of internet access or barriers to obtaining IT infrastructure; (2) a time-limite d exception for newly practicing EPs or new hospitals that will not otherwise be able to avoid payment adjustments; (3) unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters that will be handled on a case-by- case basis; and (4) (EP only) exceptions due to a combination of clinic al features limiting a provider's interaction with patients or, if the EP practices at multiple locatio ns, lack of control over the availability of CEHRT at practice locations constituting 50 percent or mo re of their encounters. d. Modifications to Medi caid EHR Incentive Program 17 We are expanding the definition of what c onstitutes a Medicaid patient encounter, which is a required eligibility threshold for the Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. We include encounters for individuals enro lled in a Medicaid program, in cluding Title XXI-funded Medicaid expansion encounters (but not se parate Children's Health Insura nce Programs (CHIPs)). We also specify flexibility in the lookback period for patient volume to be over the 12 months preceding attestation, not tied to the prior calendar year. We are also making eligible approximately 12 additional children's hospitals that have not been able to participate to date, despite meeting all other elig ibility criteria, because they do not have a CMS Certification Number si nce they do not bill Medicare. These changes would take effect beginning with payment year 2013. e. Stage 2 Timeline Delay Lastly, we are finalizing a dela y in the implementation of the ons et of Stage 2 criteria. In the Stage 1 final rule, we established that any prov ider who first attested to Stage 1 criteria in 2011 would begin using Stage 2 criteri a in 2013. This final rule dela ys the onset of those Stage 2 criteria until 2014, which we belie ve provides the needed time fo r vendors to develop CEHRT. We are also introducing a speci al 3-month EHR reporting period, rather than a full year of reporting, for providers attesting to either Stage 1 or Stage 2 in 2014 in order to allow time for providers to implement newly certified CEHRT. In future years, providers who are not in their initial year of demonstrating meaningful use mu st meet criteria for 12-month reporting periods. The 3-month reporting period allows providers flexib ility in their first year of meeting Stage-2 without warranting any delay for Stage-3. This policy is consistent with CMS's commitment to ensure that Stage 3 occurs on sc hedule (implemented by 2016). 18 3. Summary of Costs and Benefits This final rule is anticipated to have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, making it an economically significant rule under the Executive Order and a major rule under the Congressional Review Act. Accordin gly, we have prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis that to the best of our ability presents the costs and benef its of the final rule. The total Federal cost of the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to be $15.4 billion (these estimates in clude net payment adjustments for Medicare providers who do not achieve meaningful use in 2015 and subsequent years in the amount of $2.1 billion). In this final rule we have not quant ified the overall benefits to the industry, nor to EPs, eligible hospitals, or CAHs participati ng in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. Information on the costs and benefits of adopting systems specifically meeting the requirements for the EHR Incentive Programs has not yet been collected and information on costs and benefits overall is limited. Nonetheless, we believe there are substantial benefits that can be obtained by eligible hospitals and EPs, including reductions in medical recordkeeping costs, reductions in repeat tests, decreases in length of stay, incr eased patient safety, and reduced medical errors. There is evidence to support th e cost-saving benefits anticipated from wider adoption of EHRs. TABLE 1: ESTIMATED EHR INCENTIV E PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS IMPACTS ON THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS OF THE HITECH EHR INCENTIVE PROGRAM. (FISCAL YEAR) - (IN BILLIONS) Medicare Eligible Medicaid Eligible Fiscal Year Hospitals Professionals Hospitals Professionals Total 2014 Overview of the HITECH Programs Created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 The American Recovery and Reinvestme nt Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111-5) amended Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) to authorize incentive payments to EPs, eligible hosp itals, and CAHs, and Medicare A dvantage (MA) Organizations to promote the adoption and meaningful us e of CEHRT. In the July 28, 2010 Federal Register (75 FR 44313 through 44588) we published a fina l rule entitled \"Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Progr am,\" that specified the Stage 1 criteria that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs must meet in order to qualify for an incentive payment, calculation of the incentive payment amounts, and other program par ticipation requirements (hereinafter referred to as the Stage 1 final rule). (For a fu ll explanation of the amendments made by ARRA, see the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44316).) In that final rule, we also detailed that the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs will consis t of 3 different stages of meaningful use requirements. For Stage 1, CMS and the Office of the Nati onal Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) worked closely to ensure that the definition of mean ingful use of CEHRT and the standards and certification criteria for CEHRT were coordinated. Current ONC regulations may be foun d at 45 CFR part 170. For Stage 2, CMS and ONC again worked together to ali gn our regulations. In the March 7, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 13698), we publishe d a proposed rule that specified the potential Stage 2 crite ria that EPs, eligible hospitals , and CAHs would have to meet in order to qualify for Medicare and/or Medica id EHR incentive payments (hereinafter referred 20 to as the Stage 2 proposed rule). In a ddition, the proposed rule --(1) proposed payment adjustments under Medicare for covered profession al services and hospital services provided by EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs failing to de monstrate meaningful use of CEHRT and other program participation requirements; and (2) proposed the revision of certain Stage 1 criteria, as well as criteria that apply regardless of stage. In the April 18, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 23193), we published a document that corrected typographical and tech nical errors in the March 7, 2012 Stage 2 proposed rule. Simultaneously in the March 7, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 13832), ONC published its notice of proposed rulemaking titled Hea lth Information Technology: Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certifica tion Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Perm anent Certification Program for Health Information Technology. The notice of proposed ru lemaking proposed revisions to the initial set of standards, implementation sp ecifications, and certification criteria in ONC's July 28, 2010 final rule as well as the adoption of new st andards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. We urge those interested in this final rule to also review the ONC final rule on standards and implementation specifications fo r CEHRT.

Provisions of the Proposed Regulations and Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments We received approximately 6,100 items of timely correspondence in response to our Stage 2 proposed rule pub lished in the March 7, 2012 Federal Register . We received some comments that were outside the scope of the propos ed rule and therefore ar e not addressed in this final rule. Summaries of the timely public comme nts that are within th e scope of the Stage 2 proposed rule and our responses to those comments are set forth in the vari ous sections of this final rule under the appropriate headings. We have generally or ganized those sections by stating our proposals, summarizing and responding to the timely public comm ents received, and describing our final policy. A. Definitions Across the Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid Programs 1. Uniform Definitions As discussed in the proposed rule, in the Stage 1 final rule, we finalized many uniform definitions for the Medicare FFS, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid EHR incentive programs. These definitions are set forth in part 495 subpart A of th e regulations, and we proposed to maintain most of these defin itions, including, for example, Year,\" and cond, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Payment Year.\" We noted in the Stage 2 proposed rule that our definitions of \"CEHRT\" and \"Qualified EHR\" in corporate the definitions adopted by ONC, and to the extent that ONC's definitions are revised, our definitions would also incorporate those changes. For these definitions, we refer reader s to ONC's standards and certification criteria final rule that is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We did not receive any commen ts on our proposal and will continue to use the existing 22 definitions in part 495 subpart A, except where stated otherwise in this final rule. We stated that we would revise the descri ptions of the EHR reporting period to clarify that providers who are demonstrating meaningful use for the first time would have an EHR reporting period of 90 days regard less of payment year. We proposed to add definitions for the applicable EHR reporting period that would be used in determining the payment adjustments, as well as a definition of a payment adjustment year. A summary of the comments pertaining to the EHR reporting period, the applicable EHR reporting period for determining the payment ad justments, and the definition of a payment adjustment year, as well as our responses to those comments, can be found in sections II.A.3.a and II.D.2 of this final rule. 2. Meaningful EHR User We proposed to include clinical quality meas ure reporting as part of the definition of \"meaningful EHR user\" under \u00a7495.4 instead of as a separate meaningf ul use objective under \u00a7495.6. Comment: A few commenters suggested that this change would create confusion, but the majority supported this change to alleviate confusion caused by the current situation. Many comments discussed the specifics of clinical quality measures. Response : We appreciate the support expressed for the proposal. We continue to believe that separating clinical quality measures from the meaningful use objectives and measures in \u00a7495.6 will reduce confusion and finalize the change as proposed. We address comments on the specifics of clinical quality measures in section II.B of this final rule. While clinical quality measure reporting will no longer be listed as a separate objectiv e and measure in \u00a7495.6, as it is now incorporated in the definition of meani ngful EHR user in \u00a7495.4, it remains a condition for 23 demonstrating meaningful use. We proposed to revise the third paragraph of the definition of meaningful EHR user at \u00a7495.4 to refer specifically to th e payment adjustments and read as follows: \"(3) To be considered a meaningful EHR user, at least 50 pe rcent of an EP's patient encounters during an EHR reporting period for a payment year (or dur ing an applicable EHR reporting period for a payment adjustment year) must occur at a prac tice/location or practices/locations equipped with CEHRT.\" We did not receive a ny comments on this revision and we are finalizing it as proposed. 3. Definition of Meaningful Use a. Considerations in Defining Meaningful Use In sections 1848(o)(2)(A) and 1886(n)(3)(A) of the Act, the Congre ss identified the broad goal of expanding the use of EHRs through the con cept of meaningful use. Section1903(t)(6)(C) of the Act also requires that Medicaid providers adopt, implement, upgrade or meaningfully use CEHRT if they are to receive in centives under Title XIX. CEHRT used in a meaningful way is one piece of the broader HIT infrastructure needed to reform the health care system and improve health care quality, efficiency, and patient safet y. This vision of reforming the health care system and improving health care quality, effici ency, and patient safety should inform the definition of meaningful use. As we explained in our Stage 1 meaningful use rule and again in our Stage 2 proposed rule, we seek to balance the sometimes competi ng considerations of health system advancement (for example, improving health care quality, en couraging widespread EHR adoption, promoting innovation) and minimizing burdens on health care providers given the short timeframe available under the HITECH Act. 24 Based on public and stakeholder input received during our Stage 1 rule, we laid out a phased approach to meaningful use. Such a pha sed approach encompasses reasonable criteria for meaningful use based on curre ntly available technology cap abilities and pr ovider practice experience, and builds up to a more robust de finition of meaningful use as technology and capabilities evolve. The HITECH Act acknowledge s the need for this balance by granting the Secretary the discretion to requ ire more stringent measures of meaningful use over time. Ultimately, consistent with other provisions of law, meaningful use of CEHRT should result in health care that is patient centered, evidence-base d, prevention-oriented, efficient, and equitable. Under this phased approach to meaningful us e, we update the criter ia of meaningful use through staggered rulemaking. We publishe d the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44314) on July 28, 2010, and this rule finalizes the crite ria and other requirements for Stage 2. We currently are planning at least one additional update, and anticipate finalizing the Stage 3 criteria through additional rulemaking in early 2014 with St age 3 starting in 2016. The stages represent an initial graduated approach to arriving at the ultimate goal. The Stage 1 meaningful use criteria, cons istent with other provi sions of Medicare and Medicaid law, focused on electronically capturin g health information in a structured format; using that information to track key clinical conditions and communicating that information for care coordination purposes (wheth er that information is struct ured or unstructured, but in structured format whenever feasible); implementing clinical decision support tools to facilitate disease and medication manageme nt; using EHRs to engage pa tients and families and reporting clinical quality measures and pub lic health information. Stage 1 focused heavily on establishing the functionalities in CEHRT th at will allow for continuous qua lity improvement and ease of information exchange. By having these functiona lities in CEHRT at the onset of the program 25 and requiring that the EP, eligible hospital or CAH become familiar with them through the varying levels of engagement required by Stage 1, we believe we created a strong foundation to build on in later years. Though some functiona lities were optional in Stage 1, all of the functionalities are considered crucial to maximi ze the value to the health care system provided by CEHRT. We encouraged all EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs to be proactive in implementing all of the functiona lities of Stage 1 in order to prepare for later stages of meaningful use, particularly func tionalities that improve patient ca re, the efficiency of the health care system and public and population health. The specific criteria for Stage 1 of meaningful use are discussed in the Stage 1 final rule, published on July 28, 2010 (75 FR 44314 through 44588). We are finalizing certain changes to the Stage 1 criteria in sec tion II.A.3.b. of this final rule. Stage 2: We stated in the Stage 2 proposed rule that our Stage 2 goals, consistent with other provisions of Medicare and Medicaid law, would expand upon the Stage 1 criteria with a focus on ensuring that the meaningful use of EH Rs supports the aims and priorities of the National Quality Strategy. Specifi cally, Stage 2 meaningful use cr iteria would encourage the use of health IT for continuous quality improveme nt at the point of car e and the exchange of information in the most structured format po ssible. Our proposed Stage 2 meaningful use requirements included rigorous expectations for health information exchange including: more demanding requirements for e-prescr ibing; incorporating structured laboratory results; and the expectation that providers will electronically tr ansmit patient care summaries with each other and with the patient to support transitions in care. Increasingly robust expectations for health information exchange in Stage 2 and Stage 3 w ould support the goal that information follows the patient. In addition, as we forecasted in the St age 1 final rule, we proposed that nearly every objective that was optional for Stage 1 woul d be part of the core for Stage 2 26 Stage 3: We anticipate that Stage 3 mean ingful use criteria will focus on: promoting improvements in quality, safety and efficiency leading to improved health outcomes; focusing on decision support for national high priority condi tions; patient access to self-management tools; access to comprehensive patient data through robust , secure, patient-centered health information exchange; and improving population health. For Stage 3, we curre ntly intend to propose higher standards for meeting meaningful use. For example, we intend to propose that every objective in the menu set for Stage 2 be included in Stage 3 as part of the core set. While the use of a menu set allows providers flexibility in setting pr iorities for EHR implementation and takes into account their unique circumstances, we maintain that all of the objectives are crucial to building a strong foundation for health IT and to meeting the objectives of the HITECH Act. In addition, as the capabilities of HIT infrastructure increase, we may raise the thresholds for these objectives in both Stage 2 and Stage 3. In the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44323), we published the following Table 2 with our expected timeline for the stag es of meaningful use. TABLE 2: STAGE OF MEANINGFUL USE CRITERIA BY PAYMENT YEAR AS FINALIZED IN 2010 Payment Year First Payment Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011 Stage 1 Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 2 TBD 2012 Stage 1 Stage 1 Stage 2 TBD 2013 Stage 1 Stage 1 TBD 2014 Stage 1 TBD We proposed changes to this timeline as well as its extension beyond 2014. As we explained in the Stage 2 proposed rule, under the timeline used in Table 2, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH that became a meaningful EHR user for the first time in 2011 would need to begin their EHR reporting period for Stage 2 on January 1, 2013 (EP) or October 1, 2012 27 (eligible hospital or CAH). The HITPC recommende d we delay by 1 year the start of Stage 2 for providers who became meaningful EHR users in 2011. We stated in the proposed rule that Stage 2 of meaningful use woul d require changes to both tech nology and workflow that cannot reasonably be expected to be completed in the time between the publication of the final rule and the start of the EHR reporting periods as listed in Table 2. We noted the similar concerns we have heard from other stakeholders and agr eed that, based on our proposed definition of meaningful use for Stage 2, provide rs could have difficulty impleme nting these changes in time. Therefore, we proposed a 1-year extension of Stage 1 of mean ingful use for providers who successfully demonstrated meaningful use fo r 2011. Our proposed timeline through 2021, which we finalize in this rule with a notation of th e special EHR reporting period in 2014, is displayed in Table 3. We refer readers to section II.D.2 of this final rule for a disc ussion of the applicable EHR reporting period that will be used to dete rmine whether providers are subject to payment adjustments. TABLE 3: STAGE OF MEANINGFUL USE CRITERIA BY FIRST PAYMENT YEAR Stage of Meaningful Use First Payment Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2011 1 1 1 2* 2 3 3 TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD TBD 2014 1* 1 2 2 3 3 TBD TBD 2015 1 1 2 2 3 3 TBD 2016 1 1 2 2 3 3 2017 1 1 2 2 3 *3-month quarter EHR reporting period for Medicare and continuous 90-day EHR reporting period (or 3 months at state option) for Medicaid EPs. All providers in their first year in 2014 use any continuous 90- day EHR reporting period. We explained in the proposed rule that the Medicare EHR incentive program and the Medicaid EHR incentive program have different rules regarding the num ber of payment years 28 available, the last year for which incentives may be received, and the last payment year for initiating the program. The last year for which an EP and an eligible hospital or CAH can begin receiving Medicare incentive payments is 2014 and 2015 respectively. These providers would begin in Stage 1 of meaningful use. Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals can receive a Medicaid EHR incentive payment for \"adopting, implementi ng, and upgrading\" (AIU) to CEHRT for their first payment year, which is not reflected in Ta ble 3. For example, a Medicaid EP who earns an incentive payment for AIU in 2013 would have to m eet Stage 1 of meaningful use in his or her next 2 payment years (2014 and 2015). The a pplicable payment years and the incentive payments available for each program ar e discussed in the Stage 1 final rule. If we anticipate future criter ia beyond Stage 3 of meaningful use, we expect to update Table 3 in the rulemaking for Stage 3, which remains on schedule for implementation in 2016. Comment : We received numerous comments, whic h represented a significant majority of all comments received, on the timing of the stages of meaningful use. Commenters asserted that the timeline is too aggressive and will result in many providers being unable to meet Stage 2 of meaningful use, particularly those who fi rst attested in 2011 and 2012. The most common justification for this claim was the lack of suffi cient time between the publication of this final rule and the time when a provider who first a ttested to meaningful use in 2011 or 2012 would have to begin Stage 2 of meaningful use. Some commenters suggested that the time was insufficient regardless of resource constraints, wh ile others suggested th at currently vendors of CEHRT lack the necessary capacity to make th e necessary upgrades to their CEHRT products and implement them for their customers in tim e. Commenters also pointed to competing priorities and demands on provider time and re sources, such as the transition to ICD-10, the various programs and policies unde r the Affordable Care Act and other priorities that diminish 29 the time and resources that can be devoted to reaching Stage 2 of meaningful use. Commenters offered several suggestions on how to increase the time available between publication of this final rule and the EHR reporting periods in 2014. The suggestions included using a shorter than full year EHR reporting period in 2014, delaying the start of Stage 2 until 2015 and using a shorter than full year EHR reporting period in 2015, and delaying the start of Stage 2 until 2015 with a full year EHR reporting period. Severa l commenters suggested a minimum of 18 months is needed, while others suggested longer periods. Response : While our proposal would provide more than a year betw een the publication of this final rule and the firs t day any provider would start th eir EHR reporting period in 2014 for any stage of meaningful use, we agree that additional time to demonstrate meaningful use in 2014 would be helpful to providers, many of whom will need to upgrade to new technology as well as ensure they are able to meet all of the objectives and measures for Stage 2. In considering what would be an appropriate length of time between publication of this final rule and the start of the EHR reporting periods for providers in 2014 for either Stage 2 or Stage 1, we weighed two primary factors against the commen ts calling for a delay. The first is that by delaying Stage 2 until 2015, the movement towards improved outcomes that is the main goal of meaningful use would be put off by a full year. This full-year delay would have a ripple effect through the timeline of the stages as providers move along their own timelines across the stages of meaningful use. For this reason, we will not delay Stage 2 until 2015, but instead we are using a 3-month EHR reporting period in 2014 as th e first year any provid er would attest to Stage2. The second consideration is the data integrity of meaningful use attestations and clinical quality measure submissions, especially as it rela tes to our efforts towards alignment with other programs such as PQRS, Medicare Shared Saving s Program (SSP), and potentially others. The 30 more robust data set provided by a full year reporting period offers more opportunity for alignment than the data set pr ovided by a shorter reporting peri od, especially compared across years. By altering the reporting period from year to year the data is less comparable from year to year. However, we agree with commenters th at the use of a shorte r EHR reporting period in 2014 is necessary to allow sufficient time for ve ndors to upgrade their CEHRT and for providers to implement it. In an effort to preserve so me data validity with similar Medicare quality measurement programs, we are finalizing 3-m onth quarter EHR reportin g periods in 2014 for certain providers that are beyond their first year of meaningful use, rath er than any continuous 90-day period within the year as for first-tim e meaningful users. For more information on alignment with other programs, we refer reader s to our discussion on clinical quality measures (see section II.B.1. of th is final rule). While commenters generally suggested a sh orter EHR reporting period for the start of Stage 2 in any year rather than just Stage 2 in 2014, we believe that most of the reasons for a shorter period are due to the time constraints for vendor cer tification, upgrades and provider implementation between publication of this final rule and the beginning of Stage 2 in 2014. Any provider starting Stage 2 after 2014 will have more time and therefore most of the constraints are lifted. We acknowledge that not all constraints go away, but we believe that the balance is sufficiently shifted such that th e concerns of data validity a nd program alignment outweigh the few remaining concerns with a full year EHR repo rting period for the provider's first year of Stage 2 if it is after 2014. In addition, since ONC's 2014 Edition certification is for all EHR systems, regardless of the stage of meaningful us e the provider using that system is in, there are far fewer implementation concerns after 2014. Fo r example, if a provider begins Stage 2 in 2015, that provider would have been required to use CEHRT (that was certified to the 2014 31 Edition EHR certification criteria) for the previous year (2014) for Stage 1. Finally, we considered that for the Me dicaid EHR incentive program, EPs work exclusively with the states as they must choos e between either the Medicare or Medicaid EHR incentive program. We do not know whether sh ifting from an EHR reporting period of any continuous 90-days to a 3-month quarter will provide any alignm ent benefits for Medicaid EPs, and it could introduce system complexity for Medi caid agencies. Therefor e, we are maintaining flexibility for states to allow Medicaid EPs to select any continuous 90-day EHR reporting period during 2014 as defined by th e state Medicaid program, or, if the state so chooses, any 3-month calendar quarter in 2014. As nearly al l hospitals participate in both Medicare and Medicaid, we are using the 3-month quarter EHR reporting period for all hospitals to align both programs. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are modifying our proposal with regard to the EHR reporting periods for EPs, e ligible hospitals and CAHs that attest to meaningful use for 2014 for their first year of Stag e 2 or their second year of Stage 1. Our final policy is as follows: For 2014, Medicare EPs wi ll attest using an EH R reporting period of January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2014; April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014; July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014; or October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. For 2014, Medicare and Medicaid eligible hospitals and C AHs will attest using an EHR reporting period of October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013; Ja nuary 1, 2014 through March 31 2014; April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014; or July 1, 2014 thro ugh September 30, 2014. Medicaid EPs will attest using an EHR reporting period of a ny continuous 90-day period between January 1, 2014 and December 1, 2014 as defined by the state Medicaid program, or, if the state so chooses, any 3-month calendar quarter in 2014. 32 b. Changes to Stage 1 Criteria for Meaningful Use We proposed the following changes to the objectives and associated measures for Stage 1: Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) -- In 2013 (CY for EPs, FY for eligible hospitals/CAHs), we proposed that providers in Stage 1 could use the alternative denominator of the number of medication orders cr eated by the EP or in the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) dur ing the EHR reporting period (for further explanation of this alternativ e denominator, see the discussion of the CPOE objective in the Stage 2 criteria section at II. A.3.d. of this final rule). A provider seeking to meet Stage 1 in 2013 can use either the denominator defined in the Stage 1 final rule or the alte rnative denominator to calculate the percentage for the CPOE measure. We also proposed to require the a lternative denominator for Stage 1 beginning in 2014. Comment : Commenters both supported and opposed the new denominator for CPOE. Those supporting the proposed denominator did so for its simplicity and greater accuracy for measuring actual CPOE usage. Those opposing th e proposed denominator did so either because they were concerned with the burden associated with counting paper or other orders that are never entered into the EHR or because of th e potential higher performance required by the proposed denominator. Response : We proposed the alternative denominat or to alleviate th e burden associated with measurement, not to create a higher perfor mance threshold. As we stated in the proposed rule, feedback from many provide rs indicated that the alternativ e denominator was more easily measurable. In response to concerns from commenters, we are fina lizing the alternative 33 denominator for this measure and specify that prov iders at any year in Stage 1 may elect to use either the denominator defined in the Stage 1 final rule or the alte rnative denominator to calculate the percentage for the CPOE measure. In response to comments, we are not requiring that the alternative denominator be used begi nning in 2014, which will give providers who may find it difficult to measure the flexibility to contin ue to use the denominator defined in the Stage 1 final rule. Vital Signs --For the objective of record and chart changes in vital signs, the proposed Stage 2 measure would allow an EP to split the exclusion and exclude blood pressure only or height/weight only (for more deta il, see the discussion of this obj ective in the Stage 2 criteria section at II.A.3.d. of the final ru le). We proposed an identical change to the Stage 1 exclusion as well, starting in CY 2013. We also proposed changing the age limitations on vital signs for Stage 2 (for more detail, see the discussion of this objective in the Stage 2 criteria section). We proposed an identical change to the age limita tions on vital signs for Stage 1, starting in 2013 (CY for EPs, FY for eligible hospitals/CAHs). These changes to the exclusion and age limitations were proposed as an alternative in 2013 to the cu rrent Stage 1 requirements but required for Stage 1 beginning in 2014. Comment : While some commenters suggested th at these changes would be confusing, most commenters supported the changes and indicat ed that they would provide added flexibility for providers who seek to incorporate the recordi ng of this data into th eir clinical workflow. These commenters also noted that the age change reflects best clinical practices. Some commenters suggested removing BM I and growth charts from the measure since there are no best practices on BMI for patients under 3 ye ars of age and since providers who would not record height and weight would not be ab le to provide BMI or growth charts. 34 Response : We appreciate the support for these ch anges and finalize them as proposed. We also note that BMI and growth charts are not required to meet this me asure but are instead a capability provided by CEHRT. Providers who claim the exclusion for height and weight will not have data for CEHRT to create either BMI or growth charts and this will not affect their ability to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : Some commenters request ed clarification on whether providers who provide ancillary services and do not norma lly record any of these elements as part of their regular scope of practice can claim the exclusion. Response : If a provider believes that height and weight and/or blood pressure are relevant to their scope of prac tice, they must record those da ta elements and cannot qualify for the exclusion. We believe that most providers who provide ancillary services can meet the measure of this objective by obtaining this info rmation from a referri ng provider and recording the necessary data in their CEHRT. Comment : Some providers asked for clarif ication on whether providers who only occasionally record height and weight and/or blood pressure are still permitted to claim the exclusions for this measure. Response : We recognize that ther e are situations in which certain providers may only record height and weight and/or blood pressure for a very li mited number of patients (for example, high-risk surgical patients or patien ts on certain types of medication) but do not normally regard these data as re levant to their scope of practice. When a provider does not believe that height and weight and/or blood pressure are typically relevant to their scope of practice but still records these vital signs only in exceptional ci rcumstances, the provider is permitted to claim the exclusions for this measure. 35 After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e finalizing the changes to vital signs as proposed. We are making techni cal corrections to the regulation text at \u00a7495.6(d)(8) and \u00a7495.6(f)(7) to clarify these are a lternatives in 2013 and required beginning in 2014. Exchange Key Clinical Information --As noted in the propose d rule, the objective of \"capability to exchange key clinical information\" has been surprisingly di fficult for providers to understand, which has made the objective difficult fo r most providers to achieve. We solicited comment on several options for this objective that we believed would re duce or eliminate the burden associated with this objective or increase the value of the objective. The first option we considered was removal of this objective. The second option was to requ ire that the test be successful. The third option was to eliminate th e objective, but require that providers select either the Stage 1 medication reconciliation ob jective or the Stage 1 summary of care at transitions of care and referrals objective from the menu set. The fourth option was to move from a test to one case of actual electronic transm ission of a summary of care document for a real patient either to another provide r of care at a transition or refe rral or to a patient authorized entity. We proposed the first option to remove this objective and measure from the Stage 1 core set beginning in 2013 (CY for EPs, FY for eligible hospitals/CAHs), but we also stated we would evaluate all four options in light of the public comments we received. Comment : While we received feedback and su pport from commenters on all of the proposed options, the majority of commenters supported the elim ination of this objective for Stage 1. Some commenters instead supported a more exact definition of data exchange for this measure, and other commenters supported additiona l elements or additional requirements for exchange to be included as part of the measure. Other proposals included implementing a 36 system that would allow case-by-case reporting of data exchange that would allow CMS to measure successes and failures by provider, vendor, and other elements. Response: We appreciate the many suggestions from commenters on clarifying data exchange and/or adding requirements to the measur e. We also appreciate the suggestion of a case-by-case reporting system for data exchange. However, we are concerned that all of these options would not alleviate but actually increase the burden of this measure for providers by requiring them to document and submit substantia lly greater information than is currently required by attestation. While such a burden may be justified, we do not believe it is in this case because the Stage 2 requirements for actual el ectronic exchange of summary of care records create sufficient incentive to begin testing in St age 1 without there being an explicit meaningful use requirement to do so. Because of these co ncerns and in reaction to the opinion of most commenters, we are finalizing th e removal of this obj ective and measure for Stage 1 beginning in 2013. Although some commenters suggested removing this objective earlier, we do not believe the timing of publication of this final rule would allow us to implement such a change and allow consistent reporting for all providers in 2012. Th erefore, this objective and measure will be removed from the Stage 1 criteria beginning in 2 013 (CY for EPs, FY for eligible hospitals and CAHs). View Online, Download, and Transmit -- We proposed for Stage 2 a new method for making patient information availabl e electronically, which would en able patients to view online, download, and transmit their health information and hospital admission information. We discuss in the Stage 2 criteria section at II.A.3.d the \"view online, download, and transmit\" objectives for EPs and hospitals. We noted in the proposed rule that starting in 2014, CEHRT would no longer be certified to the Stage 1 EP and hospital core objectives of providing patients with electronic 37 copies of their health information (\u00a7495.6(d)(1 2) and (f)(11)) or the Stage 1 hospital core objective of providing patients with electronic copies of their discharge instru ctions upon request (\u00a7495.6(f)(12)), nor would it suppor t the Stage 1 EP menu objectiv e of providing patients with timely electronic access to their health inform ation (\u00a7495.6(e)(5)). Therefore starting in 2014, for Stage 1, we proposed to replace these objecti ves with the new \"view online, download and transmit\" objectives. Comment : There were a number of commenters w ho asked for clarifications regarding the requirements of these objectives. Othe r commenters raised c oncerns regarding the implementation of these objectives in both Stage 1 and Stage 2. Response : We discuss the clarifications and co ncerns raised by commenters in our Stage 2 criteria at II.A.3.d regarding th ese objectives. Please refer to those discussions for additional information. Comment : Some commenters support ed this change while ot her commenters disagreed with it. Those who disagreed with the proposed change indicated that providers would not be ready to implement online access to health inform ation in Stage 1, and that it was unlikely that providers could convince more than 50 percent of patients to sign up for online access within the Stage 1 reporting period. These commenters sugge sted eliminating all of the Stage 1 objectives for providing electronic copies of health information or discha rge summaries and not replacing these objectives with the \"view, download, and transmit\" objectives. Response : We disagree that the Stage 1 objecti ves for providing patients with electronic copies of their health information and discha rge instructions should be eliminated without replacing these objectives with the \"view on line, download, and transmit\" objectives. We believe patient access to their health information is an important aspect of patient care and 38 engagement, and we further believe that th e capabilities of CEHRT in 2014 and beyond will enable providers to make this information av ailable online in a way that does not impose a significant burden on providers. We note that only the first measure of the \"view online, download, and transmit\" objectives would be required for Stage 1. This means that providers would only have to make information available online to view online, dow nload, and transmit for more than 50 percent of all unique patients during the EHR reporting period in order to meet the measure. We further clarify that providers are only required to make this information available online to view online, download, and transmit and that patients who do not access the information or would not affect whether or not the provider is able to meet th e measure. For Stage 1, providers are not required to meet the second measure of more than 5 percent of patients view online, download, or transmit to a third party their health or hos pital admission information. Providers are only required to meet the second measure of the objectiv es in Stage 2. However, the exclusions for these objectives are available for providers in St age 1. Therefore, we are finalizing our proposal to replace the existing Stage 1 EP and hospital objectives listed above with the \"view online, download, and transmit\" objectives beginning in 2014 for Stage 1. We are making a technical correction to the regulati ons text to clarify that the existing Stage 1 objec tive at \u00a7495.6(f)(11) is being replaced. We clarify in Table 4 the f our existing Stage 1 object ives that are being replaced. We are also making a technical correcti on to the regulation text to remove the existing exclusion for the objective at \u00a7495.6(f)(12)(iii) beginning in 2014 because the objective that this exclusion applies to is being replaced. Removing CQM Reporting from Stage 1 Objectives -- We proposed a revised definition of a meaningful EHR user at \u00a7495.4 which would incorporate the requirement to 39 submit clinical quality measures, as discussed in section II.A.2 of this final rule. We also proposed to remove the objective to submit c linical quality measures from \u00a7495.6 beginning in 2013 for Stage 1 to conform with this change in the definition of a meaningful EHR user. Comment : While some commenters indicated that this change would be confusing, most commenters supported this change. Response : We appreciate the support of comm enters and believe that removing the objective will actually alleviate conf usion. Therefore, as discussed earlier in II.A.2. of this final rule, we are finalizing as proposed, the revised definition of a meaningful EHR user at \u00a7495.4 to include clinical quality measure submission, as we ll as the removal of this objective from \u00a7495.6 beginning in 2013. Public Health Objectives - For the Stage 1 public health objectives, beginning in 2013, we proposed to add \"except where prohibited\" to the regulation text in order to encourage all EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to submit electronic immunization data, even when not required by state/local law. Ther efore, if they are authorized to submit the data, they should do so even if it is not required by e ither law or practice. There are a few instances where some EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs are prohibited from submitting to a state/local immunization registry. For example, in sovereign tribal areas that do not permit transmission to an immunization registry or when the immunization registry only accepts data from certain age groups (for example, adults). Comment : Some commenters supported this change while others disagreed with it. A number of commenters interpreted the proposed a ddition of language as a change to either the measure of the objectives or the exclus ions that are currently in place. Response : As noted in the proposed rule, the a ddition of this language was intended to 40 ensure that providers who are not required by law or practice to submit data would do so and to make it clear that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that are prohibited from submitting data would not be required to submit such data. Immu nizations was used as a descriptive example in the proposed rule, but this change applies to all Stage 1 public h ealth objectives. The exclusions provided for these objectives in Stage 1 are not affected by the additi on of this language and remain in place for all providers. Therefore, we are finalizing the addition of this language as proposed. Menu Set Exclusions Policy - We pr oposed to change the policy on menu set exclusions for Stage 1 beginning in 2014. Please see section II.A .3.d. of this final rule for a discussion of the proposal and our final policy. Electronic Prescribing Comment: We received comments pointing out that we proposed a new exclusion for electronic prescribing objective for Stage 2 rega rding the availability of pharmacies that can accept electronic prescriptions. These commenters not ed that if this exclusion was not also made available for Stage 1 then it would create a st range scenario where an EP might have to electronically prescribe during thei r 2 years of Stage 1 and then meet an exclusion in Stage 2. Response: We agree that it makes no sense to a pply this exclusion to e-prescribing in Stage 2, but not in Stage 1. We consider it an oversight of our proposed rule that we did not include that exclusion in our pr oposed changes to the Stage 1 crit eria. We are finalizing an exclusion for the e-prescribing objective in St age 2 for any EP who does not have a pharmacy within their organization and ther e are no pharmacies that accept electronic prescriptions within 10 miles of the EP's practice location at the star t of his/her EHR reporting period. We are also finalizing the addition of this excl usion to Stage 1 starting in CY 2013. 41 TABLE 4: STAGE 1 CHANGES Stage 1 Objective Final Changes Effective Year (CY/FY) Use CPOE for medication orders directly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines Change: Addition of an alternative measure More than 30 percent of medication orders created by the EP or authorized pr oviders of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE 2013 - Onward (Optional) Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically (eRx) Change: Addition of an additional exclusion Any EP who: does not have a pharmacy within their organization and there are no pharmacies that accept electronic prescriptions within 10 miles of the EP's practice location at the start of his/her EHR reporting period. 2013 - Onward (Required) Record and chart changes in vital signs Change: Addition of alte rnative age limitations More than 50 percent of all unique patients seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have blood pressure (for patients age 3 and over only) and height and weight (for all ages) recorded as structured data 2013 Only (Optional) Record and chart changes in vital signs Change: Addition of alternative exclusions Any EP who (1 ) Sees no patients 3 year s or older is excluded from recording blood pressure; (2 ) Believes that all thre e vital signs of height, weight, and blood pressure have no relevance to their scope of practice is excluded from recording them; (3 ) Believes that height a nd weight are relevant to their scope of practice, bu t blood pressure is not, is excluded from recording blood pressure; or (4 ) Believes that blood pressu re is relevant to their scope of practice, but height and weight are not, is excluded from recordi ng height and weight. 2013 Only (Optional) 42 Stage 1 Objective Final Changes Effective Year (CY/FY) Record and chart changes in vital signs Change: Age limitations on height, weight and blood pressure More than50 percent of a ll unique patients seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have blood pressure (for patients age 3 and over only) and height and weight (for all ages) recorded as structured data. 2014 - Onward (Required) Record and chart changes in vital signs Change: Changing the age and splitting the EP exclusion Any EP who (1 ) Sees no patients 3 year s or older is excluded from recording blood pressure; (2 ) Believes that all thre e vital signs of height, weight, and blood pressure have no relevance to their scope of practice is excluded from recording them; (3 ) Believes that height a nd weight are relevant to their scope of practice, bu t blood pressure is not, is excluded from recording blood pressure; or (4 ) Believes that blood pressu re is relevant to their scope of practice, but height and weight are not, is excluded from recordi ng height and weight. 2014 - Onward (Required) Capability to exchange key clinical information (for example, problem list, medication list, medication allergies, and diagnostic test results), among providers of care and patient authorized entities electronically Change: Objective is no longer required. 2013 - Onward (Required) Report ambulatory (hospital) clinical quality measures to CMS or the states Change: Objective is incorporated directly into the definition of a meaningful EHR user and eliminated as an objective under \u00a7495.6 2013 - Onward (Required) 43 Stage 1 Objective Final Changes Effective Year (CY/FY) EP and Hospital Objectives: Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information (including diagnostics test results, problem list, medication lists, medication allergies, discharge summary, procedures) upon request.

State Flexibility for Stage 2 of Meaningful Use We proposed to offer states flexibility unde r the Medicaid incentiv e program with the public health measures in Stage 2, similar to that of Stage 1, subject to the same conditions and standards as the Stage 1 flexibility policy. This applies to the pub lic health measures as well as 44 the measure to generate lists of specific condi tions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research or outreac h. We clarify that our proposal in cluded the existing public health measures from Stage 1 as well as the new public health measures proposed for Stage 2. In addition, we stated that whet her a state moved an objective to the core or left it in the menu, states may also specify the means of tran smission of the data or otherwise change the public health measure, as long as it does not require EHR functionality above and beyond that which is included in the 2014 ONC EHR certification criteria. We solicited comments on extending state fl exibility as described for Stage 2 of meaningful use and whether this remains a useful tool for state Medicaid agencies. Comment : Commenters requested clarification of the requirement that states cannot require EHR functionality above and beyond th at which is include d in the 2014 ONC EHR certification criteria. These commenters point out that the Stage 2 public health measures require capabilities beyond that which is included in the 2014 ONC EHR cer tification criteria already. Response : We assume commenters are referring to transmission methods which are not included in 2014 Edition EHR certifi cation criteria adopted by ONC for public health objectives (immunizations, electronically re portable lab results, syndromic surveillance, cancer registries and specialized registries). This limitation applies only to those capabilities and standards included in 2014 ONC EHR certifica tion criteria for a given pub lic health objective. For example, a state could not require a different standard than the one included in 2014 ONC EHR certification criteria. In cases where the 2014 ONC EHR certification criteria are silent, such as the means of transmission for a given public he alth objective, the state may propose changes to public health measures. Comment : Several commenters supported extending state flexibility with meaningful use 45 for Stage 2, but requested that CM S provide a clearer de finition of state flexibility. Commenters suggested that it would be help ful to EPs and eligible hospita ls if states follow a common timeline for establishing state-specific requirements. Response : We appreciate these comments and would like to clarify that the state flexibility for Stage 2 remains defined the same way as it is defined in Stage 1 at \u00a7495.316 (d)(2) and \u00a7495.322 (f)(2) . Given that states are launching thei r programs at different times and are therefore at different stages in the program lifecycle and process, at this time we do not support the development of a common timeline for esta blishing state-specific requirements. The parameters remain the same as for Stage 1 and providers are subject to the requirements found in \u00a7495.332. CMS approval of states' requests will in clude a review of the outlined elements. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e finalizing these provisions as proposed. d. Stage 2 Criteria for Meaningful Use (Core Set and Menu Set) We proposed to continue the Stage 1 concept of a core set of objectives and a menu set of objectives for Stage 2. In the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44322), we indicate d that for Stage 2, we expected to include the Stage 1 menu set objectives in the core set. We proposed to follow that approach for our Stage 2 core set with two excep tions. We proposed to keep the objective of \"capability to submit electronic syndromic survei llance data to public health agencies\" in the menu set for EPs. Our experience with Stage 1 is that very few public health agencies have the ability to accept non-emergency or non urgent care ambulatory syndromic surveillance data electronically and those that do are less likely to support EPs than hospita ls; therefore we do not believe that current infrastructure supports moving this objective to the core set for EPs. We also proposed to keep the objective of \"record advance directives\" in the menu set for eligible 46 hospitals and CAHs. As we stated in our Stag e 1 final rule (75 FR 44345), we have continuing concerns that there are potential conflicts betw een storing advance direct ives and existing state laws. We proposed new objectives for Stage 2, some of which would be part of the Stage 2 core set and others would make up the Stage 2 menu set, as discu ssed below with each objective. We proposed to eliminate certain Stage 1 objective s for Stage 2, such as the objective for testing the capability to exchange key clinical informa tion. We proposed to combine some of the Stage 1 objectives for Stage 2. For example, the objectiv es of maintaining an up-to-date problem list, active medication list, and active medication alle rgy list would not be separate objectives for Stage 2. Instead, we proposed to combine th ese objectives with the objective of providing a summary of care record for each tran sition of care or referral by in cluding them as required fields in the summary of care. We proposed a total of 17 core objectives a nd 5 menu objectives for EPs. We proposed that an EP must meet the criteria or an exclusion for all of the core objectives and the criteria for 3 of the 5 menu objectives. This is a change fr om our current Stage 1 policy where an EP could reduce the number of menu set objectives that the EP would otherwise need to meet by the number of menu set objectives that the EP could exclude. We noted the feedback we received on Stage 1 from providers and health care associations leads us to believe that most EPs had difficulty understanding the con cept of deferral of a menu objectiv e in Stage 1. Therefore, we proposed this change for Stage 2, as well as for Stage 1 beginning in 2014, to make the selection of menu objectives easier fo r EPs. We also proposed this ch ange because we are concerned that under the current Stage 1 requirements some EPs could select and exclude menu objectives when there are other menu objectives they can legitimately meet, thereby making it easier for them to 47 demonstrate meaningful use than EPs who attempt to legitimately meet the full complement of menu objectives. Although we provided the ability to do this in the sele ction of Stage 1 menu objectives through 2013, we stated th at EPs participating in Stage 1 and Stage 2 starting in 2014 should focus solely on those objectiv es they can meet rather than those for which they have an exclusion. In addition, we noted the exclusions for the Stage 2 menu objectives that we believe would accommodate EPs who are unable to meet certai n objectives because of scope of practice. However, just as we signaled in our Stage 1 re gulation, we stated our in tent to propose in our next rulemaking that every objective in the menu set for Stage 2 (as described later in this section) be included in Stage 3 as part of the core set. We explained that in the case where an EP meets the criteria for the exclusions for 3 or more of the Stage 2 menu objectives, the EP w ould have more exclusions than the allowed deferrals. EPs in this situation would attest to an exclusion for 1 or mo re menu objectives in his or her attestation to meaningful use. In doing so, the EP would be attesting that he or she also meets the exclusion criteria for all of the menu ob jectives that he or she did not choose. We stated that the same policy would also apply for the Stage 1 menu objectives for EPs beginning in 2014. We proposed a total of 16 core objectives a nd 4 menu objectives for eligible hospitals and CAHs for Stage 2. We proposed that an eligib le hospital or CAH must meet the criteria or an exclusion for all of the core objectives and the criteria for 2 of the 4 menu objectives. We proposed that the policy for exclusions for EPs discussed in the preceding paragraph would also apply to eligible hospitals and CAHs for Stage 1 beginning in 2014 and for Stage 2. We received many comments on the appropriate ness of individual objectives placement in the core or menu set. We discuss these comments below for each individual objective. 48 Comment : Commenters expressed concern over the small number of objectives in the menu set. They were concerned that the small nu mber of objectives limited the usefulness of the menu set to providers. Response : Stage 2 does contain a mo re specialized and smaller menu set than Stage 1. We see this as a natural result of moving up the staged path towards improved outcomes and adding fewer new objectives. We also see specia lization as necessary for meaningful use to be applicable to all EPs. Due to comments receive d we are adding two objectives for hospitals and one for EPs which will be in the menu, as fu rther explained later in this section. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we finalize the concept of a core and menu set for Stage 2. We finalize a total of 17 core objectives a nd 6 menu objectives for EPs for Stage 2. We finalize that an EP must meet the criteria or an exclusion for all of th e core objectives and the criteria for 3 of the 6 menu objectives unless an ex clusion can be claimed for more than 3 of the menu objectives in which case the criteria for th e remaining non-excluded objectives must be met. We finalize a total of 16 core objectives and 6 menu objectives for eligible hospitals and CAHs for Stage 2. We finalize that an eligible hospital or CAH must m eet the criteria or an exclusion for all of the core objectives and the criteria for 3 of the 6 menu objectives. We also finalize our proposal to change the menu set exclusions policy for Stage 1. Beginning in 2014, qualifying for an exclusion fr om a menu set objective will no longer reduce the number of menu set objectives that an EP or hospital must otherwise satisfy to demonstrate meaningful use for Stage 1. There is an exception for EPs who meet the criteria to exclude five or more of the menu set objectives, in which case the EP must meet the criteria for all of the 49 remaining non-excluded menu set objectives. This exception would not be applicable to hospitals due to the number of hospital me nu set objectives that include exclusions. (1) Discussion of Whether Cert ain EPs, Eligible Hospitals or CAHs can meet all Stage 2 Meaningful Use Objectives Given Established Scopes of Practice We noted in the proposed rule that we do not believe that any of the proposed new objectives for Stage 2 make it impossible for any EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet meaningful use. Where scope of practice may prevent an EP, eligible hospital or CAH from meeting the measure associated with an objec tive, we discussed the barriers and included exclusions in our descriptions of the indivi dual objectives. We proposed to include new exclusion criteria when necessary for new objec tives, continue the Stage 1 exclusions for Stage 2, and continue the option for EPs and hosp itals to defer some of the objectives in the menu set unless they meet the exclusion criteria for more objectives than they can defer as explained previously. We recognized in the proposed rule that at the time of publication, our data (derived internally from attestations) only reflected the meaningful use attestations from Medicare providers. There have been no significant changes in the data derived from meaningful use attestations since the publica tion of the proposed rule. We did not receive any co mments on this provision. (2) EPs Practicing in Multiple Practices/Locations We proposed for Stage 2 to continue our policy that to be a meaningful EHR user, an EP must have 50 percent or more of his or her outpatient encounters during the EHR reporting period at a practice/location or practices/locatio ns equipped with CEHRT. An EP who does not conduct at least 50 percent of their patient encoun ters in any one practice /location would have to 50 meet the 50 percent threshold through a combin ation of practices/lo cations equipped with CEHRT. We gave the following in the proposed rule example: if the EP pr actices at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) and within his or her individual practice at 2 different locations, we would include in our review all 3 of these locations, and CEHR T would have to be available at one location or a combination of locations wher e the EP has 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters. If CEHRT is only availabl e at one location, then only encounters at this location would be included in meaningful use assu ming this one location represents 50 percent or more of the EP's patient encounter s. If CEHRT is available at mu ltiple locations that collectively represent 50 percent or more of the EP's patient encounters, then all encounters from those locations would be included in meaningful use. In the proposed rule we stated that we ha ve received many inquiries on this requirement since the publication of the Stag e 1 final rule. We define patie nt encounter as any encounter where a medical treatment is provided and/or ev aluation and management services are provided. This includes both individually bill ed events and events that are globally billed, but are separate encounters under our definition. We define a pr actice/location as equippe d with CEHRT if the record of the patient encounter that occurs at th at practice/location is created and maintained in CEHRT. This can be accomplished in three wa ys: CEHRT could be permanently installed at the practice/location, the EP could bring CE HRT to the practice/location on a portable computing device, or the EP could access CEHR T remotely using computing devices at the practice/location. Although it is currently allowed under Stage1 fo r an EP to create a record of the encounter without using CEHRT at the practice/location and then later input that information into CEHRT that exists at a different practic e/location, we do not believe this process takes advantage of the value CEHRT offers. We pr oposed not to allow this practice beginning in 51 2013. We have also received inquiries whether th e practice locations have to be in the same state, to which we clarify that they do not . Finally, we received inquiries regarding the interaction with hospital-based EP determinatio n. The determination of whether an EP is hospital-based or not occurs pr ior to the application of this policy, so only nonhospital-based eligible professionals are included. Furthermore, this policy, like all meaningful use policies for EPs, only applies to outpatient settings (all settings except the inpatient and emergency department of a hospital). Comment : Some commenters suggested that for EPs practicing in multiple locations that meaningful use attestations should be limited to just reporting on meaningful use for the most prevalent location due to the difficulty in aggregating data across locations. Response : We continue to believe that for the core measures, aggregating data is not overly burdensome. We allow the numerators and denominators calculated by CEHRT to be summed across an EP's various practice locations. Comment: We received request for clarification on what to do when an EP is practicing in multiple locations that select different menu objectives to pursue, and the EP does not control this selection. Response : An EP who does not have the same menu objectives implemented across each of their practice lo cations equipped with CEHRT would atte st to the three menu objectives that represent the greatest nu mber of their patient encounters. For example, if six menu objectives are implemented between two locations, an EP would attest to the three menu objectives implemented at the location where they have th e greatest number of en counters during the EHR reporting period. For measures that utilize a percentage threshold, they can limit the denominator to the location or locatio ns that pursued that menu objective. 52 After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the proposed provisions with the modificati ons previously discussed. (3) Discussion of the Reporting Requirements of the Measures Associated with the Stage 2 Meaningful Use Objectives In our experience with Stage 1, we f ound the distinction between limiting the denominators of certain measures to only thos e patients whose records are maintained using CEHRT, but including all patients in the denomin ators of other measures, to be complicated for providers to implement. We proposed to remove this distinction for Stage 2 and instead include all patients in the denominators of all of the measures associated with the meaningful use objectives for Stage 2. We believe that by the time an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH has reached Stage 2 of meaningful use all or nearly all of th eir patient population should be included in their CEHRT, making this distin ction no longer relevant. Comment : We received comments that maintain that this distinction is still necessary for Stage 2 because there are situations where signif icant patient records may still be maintained outside of CEHRT. Examples provided by commen ters include worker's compensation or other special contracts for certain pati ents, specialized departments or units in a hospital for which CEHRT is not tailored and patient reque sts to keep their records on paper. Response : We continue to believe that nearly all patient records will be stored in CEHRT by the time a provider reaches Stage 2. Howe ver, we acknowledge that if this assertion is correct then there is no pract ical consequence of maintaining th e distinction, whil e if it is not, removing the distinction could have adverse impacts on providers. After consideration of the co mments, we are not finalizing our proposed change. Instead, we maintain the distinction between measures that include only those patients whose records are 53 maintained using CEHRT and measures that in clude all patients. Providers may limit the denominator to those patients whose records ar e maintained using CEHRT for measures with a denominator other than unique patients seen by the EP during the EH R reporting period or unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department during the EHR reporting period. Comment: Some commenters suggested that the denominators should be limited to either just Medicare-covered patients for those participa ting in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program or just Medicaid-covered patients for those participating in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. Commenters presented two arguments in favor of th is suggestion. First, th at requiring a provider to include all patients was more burdensom e than including just Medicare-covered or Medicaid-covered patients and that this burden wa s not offset by the incentive payments that are based (for Medicare only) on charges submitted to Medicare. Second, that if identifiable patient data was included in Medicare or Medicaid mean ingful use reporting for patient not covered by Medicare or Medicaid this w ould raise serious privacy concer ns and possibly require patient consent. Other commenters were supportive of current denominators that does not account for payers. Response: We discussed the burden differences between all patients versus patients differentiated by payer in our Stage 1 final rule ( 75 FR44332). We continue to believe that it is highly unlikely that providers wi ll use different record keeping systems based on payer. Where there are differences in patient populations such as age we account for them directly in the measure not indirectly with payer as a gene ralized proxy. The burden of breaking out the patients by payer for purposes of meaningful us e measurement would have only increased from the publication of the Stage 1 final rule as measurement tools have been designed and 54 implemented to measure patients regardless of payer. If at a future date, the demonstration of meaningful use includes the submission of identifi able patient data we wi ll certainly address the privacy implications of that requirement. Ho wever, the Stage 1 objectives and measures and Stage 2 objectives and measures included in this final rule do not re quire the submission of identifiable patient information. We are not making any changes to th is policy in this final rule. We proposed new objectives that could in crease reporting burden. To minimize the burden, we proposed to create a uniform set of de nominators that would be used for all of the Stage 2 meaningful use objectives, as discussed later. Many of our meaningful use objec tives use percentage-based m easures if appropriate. To provide a check on the burden of reporting of me aningful use, we proposed for Stage 2 to use 1 of 4 denominators for each of the measures asso ciated with the meaningful use objectives. We focused on denominators because the action that moves something from the denominator to the numerator usually requires the use of CEHRT by th e provider. These actions are easily tracked by the technology. The four proposed denominators for EPs are-- Unique patients seen by the EP during th e EHR reporting period (stratified by age or previous office visit); Number of orders (medication, labs, radiology); Office visits, and Transitions of care/referrals. Comment : We received many comments supporti ng our efforts to minimize the variety of denominators. Some comment ers argued that any variation (s uch as by age or orders of different types) should be consid ered separate denominators. 55 Response : We appreciate the support for our proposal to minimize the variety of denominators. Our base of four denominators are only modified by information that must be entered into CEHRT in order to meet meaningf ul use; therefore, we believe that such modifications represent a small burden and are in keeping with our overall goal in minimizing the variety of denominators. In the proposed rule, we stated that the term \"unique patient\" means that if a patient is seen or admitted more than once during the EHR reporting period, the patient only counts once in the denominator. Patients seen or admitted only once during the EHR reporting period will count once in the denominator. A patient is seen by the EP when the EP has an actual physical encounter with the patient in which they render a ny service to the patient. A patient seen through telemedicine will also still count as a patient \"seen by the EP.\" In cases where the EP and the patient do not have an actual physical or teleme dicine encounter, but the EP renders a minimal consultative service for the patien t (like reading an EKG), the EP may choose whether to include the patient in the denominator as \"seen by the EP\" provided the choice is cons istent for the entire EHR reporting period and for all relevant meaningful use measures. For example, a cardiologist may choose to exclude patients for whom they pr ovide a one-time reading of an EKG sent to them from another provider, but include more involved consultative serv ices as long as the policy is consistent for the entire EHR reporting period and for all meaningful use measures that include patients \"seen by the EP.\" EPs who neve r have a physical or telemedicine interaction with patients must adopt a policy that classifies at least some of the services they render for patients as \"seen by the EP,\" and this policy mu st be consistent for the entire EHR reporting period and across meaningful use m easures that involve patients \"seen by the EP\" -- otherwise, these EPs will not be able to satisfy meaningful use, as they will have denominators of zero for 56 some measures. In cases where the patient is seen by a member of the EP's clinical staff the EP can include or not include those patients in their denominator at their discretion as long as the decision applies universally to all patients for the entire EHR reporting period and the EP is consistent across meaningful use m easures. In cases where a member of the EP's clinical staff is eligible for the Medicaid EHR incentive in thei r own right (for example, nurse practitioners (NPs) and certain physician assistants (PA)), patients seen by NPs or PAs under the EP's supervision can be counted by both the NP or PA and the supervising EP as long as the policy is consistent for the enti re EHR reporting period. Comment : While generally supporting the concep t of a unique patient as a good tool to address the fact that not all meaningful use objectives need be addressed at every patient encounter or rendering of medical service, some commenters expressed c oncern about the ability to identify unique patients across CEHRTs in situations where an EP practices at multiple locations or in situations where an EP might switch CEHR T during an EHR reporting period. Response : We agree that determining unique patie nts across CEHRTs is difficult. When aggregating performance on meaningful use meas ures across multiple practice locations using different CEHRTs we do not requir e that it be determined that a patient seen at one location was not also seen at another location. While this could result in the sa me patient appearing more than once in the denominator of unique patients seen, we believe that the burden of seeking out these patients is greater than any gain in measurement accuracy. Furthermore, it is not possible for a provider to increase only the numerator with this policy as any increase in the numerator would also increase the denominator. Accordingly, we are adopting a final policy that will give EPs who practice at multiple locations or switch CEHRT during the EHR reporting period some flexibility as to the method for counting unique pa tients in the denominators. We leave it up to 57 the EP to decide for the EHR reporting period whether to count a uni que patient across all locations equipped with different CEHRT (for ex ample, 1 patient seen at 3 locations with different CEHRT counts once) or at each locati on equipped with CEHRT (f or example, 1 patient seen at 3 locations with diffe rent CEHRT counts thrice). In cases where a provider switches CEHRT products at a single location during th e EHR reporting period, th ey also have the flexibility to count a patient as unique on each si de of the switch and not across it (for example, 1 patient seen before the switch and after the switch could be counted once or twice). EPs in these scenarios must choose one of these methods for counting unique patients and apply it consistently throughout the en tire EHR reporting period. With the flexibility for EPs practicing in multiple locations using different CEHRT or switching CEHRT during the EHR reporting period, we otherwise finalize our description of \"unique patient\" as proposed. We proposed that an office visit is defined as any billable visit that includes: (1) concurrent care or transfer of care visits; (2) consulta nt visits; or (3) prolonged physician service without direct, face-to-fa ce patient contact (for example, telehealth). A consultant visit occurs when a provider is asked to render an expert op inion/service for a specif ic condition or problem by a referring provider. The visit does not have to be individua lly billable in instances where multiple visits occur under one global fee. Comment : We received comments requesting that we establish a list of billing codes that constitute an office vis it for purposes of clarity. Response : We continue to believe that the use of a list of billing codes would inappropriately limit the discretion of EPs that we have built into this measure. We finalize as proposed our description of an office visit and em phasize that there is room for EP discretion in 58 this definition and that the most important consid eration in utilizing that discretion is that the policy apply for the entire EHR repor ting period and across all patients. We proposed to describe transitions of care as the movement of a patient from one setting of care (hospital, ambulatory primary care practi ce, ambulatory specialty care practice, long-term care, home health, rehabilitation fa cility) to another. Currentl y, the meaningful use measures that use transitions of care require there to be a receiving provider of care to accept the information. Therefore, a tran sition home without any expectat ion of follow-up care related to the care given in the prior set ting by another provider is not a transition of care for purpose of Stage 2 meaningful use measures as there is no provider recipient. A transition within one setting of care does not qualify as a transition of care. Referr als are cases where one provider refers a patient to another, but the referring provid er maintains their care of the patient as well. Please note that a \"referral\" as defined here and elsewhere in this final rule is only intended to apply to the EHR Incentive Programs and is not applicable to othe r Federal regulations. Comment : We have received many comments that determining when a transition of care occurs is very difficult under our current Stage 1 rule, particularly when the provider is on the receiving end of the tran sition of care. Commenters suggest th at the only reliable way to know if a patient saw another provider is to ask the patient at e ach encounter and even then this is not guaranteed. Several suggestions were presented to make the definition more precise on both the receiving and transitioning side . They were as follows:-- Discharges for eligible hospitals/CAHs and referrals to other providers who do not share the same CEHRT as the EP are very clearly identified and should be the focus of the numerator/denominator. A transition within one set ting of care does not qualify as a transition of care. Referral 59 is defined as care \"where one provider refers a patient to another, but the referring provider maintains their care of the patient as well.\" A patient is referred to a nother provider (for EPs) or a patient is discharged (for eligible hospitals). Sharing data with health plans. Response : In reviewing the comments, we agree th at a refinement of our transitions of care definition is needed. We also agree with the suggestions to point to specific events that identify a transition of care has occurred wit hout relying entirely on asking the patient. Therefore, we revise our description of tran sitions of care for the purpose of defining the denominator. For an EP who is on the receiving end of a transition of care or referral, (currently used for the medication reconci liation objective and m easure), the denominator includes first encounters with a new patient and encounters w ith existing patients where a summary of care record (of any type) is provided to the receiving provider. The summary of care record can be provided either by the patient or by the referri ng/transiting provider or institution. We believe that both of these situations would create information in the CE HRT that can be automatically recorded. For an EP who is initiating a patient transfer to another setting and/or referring a patient to another provider, (currently used for providing summary of care documents at transitions of care), the initiating/referring EP w ould count the transitions and/or referrals that were ordered by the EP in the measure denominat or. If another provide r also sees the same patient, only the EP who orders th e transition/referral would need to account for this transition for the purpose of this measure. EPs are not re sponsible for including patie nt-initiated transitions and referrals that were not ordered by the EP. For example, if the EP creates an order for admission to a nursing home, this transition of care would be counted in the EP's measure 60 denominator. If one of the EP's patients is adm itted to a nursing home by another provider, this transition would only have to be counted by the EP who creates the order and not necessarily by other EPs who care for the patient. We want to emphasize that these transitions of care/referral descriptions have been devel oped for purposes of reducing the provider measurement burden for the EHR Incentive Program and do not necessarily apply to other programs or regulations. We also clarify that these descri ptions are minimum re quirements. An EP can include in the denominator transitions of care and referrals that fit the broader de scriptions of these terms, but are not one of the specific ev ents described previously. The four proposed denominators for eligible hospitals and CAHs are-- Unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department during the EHR repor ting period (stratified by age); Number of orders (medication, labs, radiology); Inpatient bed days; and Transitions of care. We noted in the proposed rule that our explan ation of \"unique patien ts\" and \"transitions of care\" for EPs would also apply fo r eligible hospitals and CAHs. Comment : Commenters suggested a problem with unique patients could arise if a hospital switched CEHRT during the EHR reporting period. Response : Our final policy on EPs who switch CEHRT during the EHR reporting period counting unique patients in the de nominator would also apply for hos pitals in the same situation. Comment : We have received many comments that determining when a transition of care occurs is very difficult under our Stage 1 regulat ions, particularly when the provider is on the receiving end of the tran sition of care. Commenters suggest th at the only reliable way to know if 61 a patient saw another provider is to ask the patient at e ach encounter and even then this is not guaranteed. Several suggestions were presented to make the definition more precise on both the receiving and transitioning side, which we summ arized previously in the discussion of the proposed denominators for EPs. Response : For the same reasons as discussed for EPs, we agree that pointing to specific occurrences is needed to accurate ly measure this denominator. Fo r transitions of care when the hospital is on the receiving end, (currently used for the medication rec onciliation objective and measure), we include all admissions to the inpatie nt and emergency departments. For transitions of care when the hospital is transitioning the pa tient, (currently used for providing summary of care documents at transitions of care), we include all discharges from the inpatient department and after admissions to the emergency depart ment when follow-up care is ordered by an authorized provider of the hospital. As with EP s, these are the minimum events that must be included in the denominator for the transitions of care measure. Hospitals can include additional transitions of care that match the full description of transitions of care, but are not one of these specific events. We proposed that admissions to the eligible hospital or CAH can be calculated using one of two methods currently available under Stage 1 of meaningful use. The observation services method includes all patients admitted to the inpatie nt department (POS 21) either directly or through the emergency department and patients who initially present to the emergency department (POS 23) and receive observation serv ices. Details on observation services can be found in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 6, Section 20.6. Patients who receive observation services under both th e outpatient department (POS 22) and emergency department (POS 23) should be included in the denomin ator under this method. The all emergency 62 department method includes all patients admitted to the inpatient department (POS 21) either directly or through the emergency department and all patients receiv ing services in the emergency department (POS 23). Comment : Commenters expressed near universal support for the continuance of the two options in defining an admission to the emergency department. Response : We continue to believe that not a ll information require d by meaningful use may be relevant to all encounters in the emergency department and that this decision is best left to the hospital; therefore, we are finalizing this as proposed. We proposed that inpatient bed days are th e admission day and each of the following full 24-hour periods during which the patie nt is in the inpatient departme nt (POS 21) of the hospital. For example, a patient admitted to the inpatient department at noon on June 5th and discharged at 2 p.m. on June 7th will be admitted for 2-patient days: the admission day (June 5th) and the 24 hour period from 12:00 a.m. on June 6th to 11:59 p.m. on June 6th. We did not receive comments on this proposal . This denominator is not used by the proposed meaningful use objectives and measures nor the finalized objectives and measures. As discussed later in this section, we are including the menu objective for hospitals of \"Provide structured electronic lab results to ambulatory providers\" . The measure associated with the objective uses a denominator that was not in cluded in our proposal. The denominator is the number of electronic lab orders received by the hospital from ambulatory providers. For this objective, we use the same description of \"l aboratory services\" as for our Stage 2 CPOE objective: any service provided by a laboratory that could not be provided by a nonlaboratory. We also use the definition of \"laboratory\" at \u00a7493.2 as for the Stage 2 CPOE objective. Any order for a laboratory service will be considered a lab order. Fo r the order to be considered 63 received electronically, it must be received by the hospital utilizing an electronic transmission method and not through methods such as physical electronic media, electronic fax, paper document or telephone call. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing the following denominators for EPs: Unique patients seen by the EP during th e EHR reporting period (stratified by age or previous office visit); Number of orders (medication, labs, radiology); Office visits; and Transitions of care/refe rrals including at a minimum one of the following: ++ When the EP is the recipient of the transi tion or referral, firs t encounters with a new patient and encounters with exis ting patients where a summary of care record (of any type) is provided to the receiving EP; ++ When the EP is the initiator of the tran sition or referral, tran sitions and referrals ordered by the EP. We are finalizing the following denominat ors for eligible hospitals and CAHs: Unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department during the EHR repor ting period (stratified by age); Number of orders (medication, labs, radiology); Transitions of care including at a minimum one of the following: ++ When the hospital is the recipient of the transition or referral, all admissions to the inpatient and emergency departments, ++ When the hospital is the initiator of the tr ansition or referral, all discharges from the 64 inpatient department and after admissions to th e emergency department when follow-up care is ordered by authorized provi ders of the hospital; and Electronic lab orders received by th e hospital from ambulatory providers. (4) Discussion of the Relationship of Meaningful Use to CEHRT We proposed to continue our policy of linking each meaningful use objective to certification criteria for CEHRT. As with Stage 1, EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs must use the capabilities and standards that are certified to meet the objectives and associated measures for Stage 2 of meaningful use. In meeting any objecti ve of meaningful use, an EP, eligible hospital or CAH must use the capab ilities and standard s that are included in cer tification. We noted that in some instances, meaningful use objectives an d measures require use that is not directly enabled by certified capabilities and/ or standards. In these cases, the EP, eligible hospital and CAH is responsible for meeting the objectives and measures of meaningful use, but the way they do so is not constrained by the capabilities and standards of CEHR T. In the proposed rule we gave the following example: in e-Rx and pub lic health reporting, CEHR T applies standards to the message being sent and enables certain cap abilities for transmission in 2014; however, to actually engage in e-Rx or public health repor ting many steps must be taken outside of these standards and capabilitie s such as contacting both parties and troubleshooting issues that may arise through the normal course of business. Comment : We received many comments that expressed confusion of when the capabilities and standards included in certifi cation must be used and when they do not. Response : Nearly all of these comments were obj ective-specific, so we address them at the referenced objective. With each measur e we include a universal statement on the applicability of the specific standards and capabilities incl uded in the 2014 edition of 65 certification criteria for EHR t echnologies and, if applicable, specific allowances for that measure. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e finalizing these provisions as proposed. (5) Discussion of the Relationship between a Stage 2 Meaningful Use Objective and its Associated Measure We proposed to continue our Stage 1 policy that regardless of any actual or perceived gaps between the measure of an objective and full compliance with the objective (such as a measure threshold of less than 100 percent or a measure designed to account for circumstances where 100 percent compliance in not the intention of the objective) , meeting the criteria of the measure means that the provider has met the objective for Stage 2. We did not receive any comm ents and we are finalizing these provisions as proposed. (6) Objectives and Their Associated Measures (a) Objectives and Measures Carried Over (Modi fied or Unmodified) from Stage 1 Core Set to Stage 2 Core Set Proposed Objective: Use computerized provider or der entry (CPOE) for medication, laboratory and radiology orders di rectly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, lo cal and professional guide lines to create the first record of the order. In the proposed rule, we outlined the follo wing benefits of CPOE. CPOE improves quality and safety by allowing clinical decision support at the point of the order and therefore influences the initial order decision. CPOE improves safety and efficiency by automating aspects of the ordering process to reduce the pos sibility of communicatio n and other errors. 66 Consistent with the recommendations of the HIT Policy Committee, we proposed to expand the orders included in the objective to medication (which was included in Stage 1), laboratory, and radiology. We believe that the e xpansion to laboratory and radi ology furthers the goals of the CPOE objective, that such orders are commonly in cluded in CPOE roll outs and that inclusion of the entry of these orders using CPOE is a logica l step in the progression of meaningful use. We note that this does not require the el ectronic transmission of the order. We proposed to continue to define CPOE as the provider's use of computer assistance to directly enter medical orders (f or example, medications, consu ltations with other providers, laboratory services, imaging studi es, and other auxiliary services ) from a computer or mobile device. The order is then documented or captured in a digital, structured, and computable format for use in improving safety and efficiency of the ordering process. We fu rther proposed that the CPOE function of CEHRT must be used by the ordering provider or licensed healthcare professionals under his or her direct ion to create the first record of that order, or it would not count as CPOE. As this proposed objective limits the use of CPOE to the creation of the first record of the order (a more restrictive standard than in Stage 1), we invited public comment on whether the stipulation that th e CPOE function be used only by licensed healthcare professionals remains necessary or if CPOE can be expanded to include non-licensed healthcare professionals such as scribes. Comment : Commenters focused primarily on CPOE's value as the trigger for clinical decision support interventions. It was suggested the term be revi sed from computerized provider order entry to computerized or der evaluation. This focus le d to the suggestion by several commenters that as long as the ordering providers \"signs\" or ot herwise authorizes the order before it is carried out this s hould count for CPOE. These comment ers maintain that meaningful 67 use should not dictate any of the pr ocesses that lead up to this authorization including who enters the order into CEHRT nor what types of record of the order may exist prior to entry into CEHRT. Response : We agree that CPOE as the trigger for CDS interventions is the primary value creating function of CPOE. However, we disagree th at it is the only one. We believe automating aspects of and/or eliminating step s in the ordering process prior to final authorization of the order does reduce communication and othe r errors. Furthermore, it is our understanding from both commenters and our own experiences with CEHRT th at many EHRs use the entry of the order as the trigger for CDS interventions and either displa y them again at authorization or do not display them at all at authorization. For these reasons, we continue to focus the definition and measurement of CPOE on when and by whom the order is entered into CEHRT and not on when it is authorized by the orde ring provider in CEHRT. Comment : Commenters stated that the authentica tion of verbal orders is already covered by the conditions of participation for hospitals at 42 CFR482.24(c)(1)(iii) wh ich states that \"[a]ll verbal orders must be authenti cated based upon Federal and state la w. If there is no state law that designates a specific timeframe for the authentic ation of verbal orders, verbal orders must be authenticated within 48 hours. \" Meaningful use should adopt this same standard. Response : We are not adopting this standard for two reasons. First, as this is in an incentive program, we do not believe it is logical to base a requirement for meaningful use solely on a condition of participation. Hospitals al ready must comply w ith the conditions of participation, so we believe as an incentiv e program meaningful us e should be incentivizing behavior beyond the conditions of participation. Second, as discussed later, we are not limiting the communication of orders prior to CPOE to ve rbal orders so there is not a direct corollary 68 between this condition of partic ipation and our description of CPOE. Section 482.23(c)(2) also speaks to verbal orders. First, it states, \"If verbal orders are used, they are to be used infrequently. Second, it states, \"When verbal or ders are used, they must only be accepted by persons who are authorized to do so by hospital policy and procedures consistent with Federal and state law.\" We discuss who may enter the or der later in comment and response, but reiterate our position that meaningful us e should incentivize behavior that benefits patients beyond that required by the conditions of participation. Comment : Commenters objected to our proposal to change our policy regarding CPOE from \"the CPOE function should be used the firs t time the order becomes part of the patient's medical record and before any action can be take n on the order\" to \"the order created using the EHR must be the first record of that order or it would not count as CPOE\". The commenters stressed that if they used a process that created a record of the order th at was not part of the patient's medical record, then the proposed polic y requiring this record not be retained is not advisable. The commenter s asserted that even if it was not pa rt of the patient's medical record the initial record of the order could be used for quality control purposes. Response: Our proposed policy change was intende d as an evolution from the Stage 1 requirements for CPOE. However, after revi ewing the comments received, we agree that requiring an electronic or written order that is not cr eated using the CPOE function of CEHRT to not be retained in order for it to count as CPOE could have unforeseen and possibly detrimental consequences for quality control. We continue to believe that our orig inal proposal would have increased CPOE's ability to improve safety and efficiency and encourage all providers to streamline the ordering process to minimize the nu mber of steps involved. However, we do not have sufficient information to determine whether the gains of the proposal are greater than or 69 less than the potential cost of not retaining written or electronic orders issued before the use of the CPOE function. Therefore, we are not fina lizing the proposed revise d description of when the CPOE function must be utilized during the ordering process and inst ead finalize our existing Stage 1 description that the CPOE function should be used the fi rst time the order becomes part of the patient's medical record and before any action can be taken on the order. Based on the questions we have received on CPOE to date, th e limiting criterion is the first time the order becomes part of the patient's medical record rath er than the limitation of before any action can be taken on the order. The provider must make the de termination as to what constitutes the patient's medical record and what does not based on thei r existing policies and applicable state and Federal law. Our only requirements in this regard are that the determin ation be made by the provider prior to the start of the EHR re porting period and be uniformly applied. Comment: We have received many comments on who can enter the order into CEHRT for it to count as CPOE. Four possibilities rece ived comment support. First, only the ordering provider be able to enter the order into CEHRT. Second, any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professi onal guidelines can enter the order into CEHRT. This is the current policy which was proposed to continue. Third, an expansion to any licensed, certifi ed or appropriately credentiale d healthcare professional (some commenters replaced medical assistant with heal thcare professional) who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professi onal guidelines. Fourth, an expansion to allow anyone, including those commonly referre d to as scribes, enter the or ders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines. We also note that there was some confusion among commenters as to our current limitation and prop osal of any licensed healthcare professional using CPOE to create the first en try of the order into the patient's medical record as we received 70 many comments suggesting that nurses should be able to enter the orders. We clarify that nurses who are licensed and can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines may enter the order into CEHRT and have it count as CPOE. Response : As we did not revise our descripti on of when in the ordering process the CPOE function must be used, we are inclined to not revise our descript ion of who may enter it into CEHRT. However, we are particularly conc erned with CPOE usage by EPs in this regard. Many EPs practice without the assistance of othe r licensed healthcare professionals. These EPs in their comments urged the expansion indicate d in the third possibili ty of credentialed healthcare professionals/medical assistants. We believe that this expansion is warranted and protects the concept that the CDS interventions will be presented to someone with medical knowledge as opposed to a layperson. The concept of credentialed healthcare professionals is over broad and could include an untold number of pe ople with varying qualif ications. Therefore, we finalize the more limited description of including credentialed medical assistants. The credentialing would have to be obtained from an organization other than the employing organization. Our responses to earlier comments factored into this deci sion as well. Based on the public comments received, questions submitte d by the public on Stage 1 and demonstrations of CEHRT we have participated i n, it is apparent that the prevalent time when CDS interventions are presented is when the order is entered into CEHRT, and that not all EHRs also present CDS when the order is authorized (assuming such a multiple step ordering process is in place). This means that the person entering the order could be required to enter the order correctly, evaluate CDS either using their own judgme nt or through accurate relay of the information to the ordering provider, and then either make a change to the order based on the CDS intervention or bypass the intervention. We do not believe that a laypers on is qualified to do this, and as there is no 71 licensing or credentialing of scribes, there is no guarantee of their qualifications. Comment : We received comments on a particular category of orders referred to as \"protocol\" or \"standing\" orders. The defining characteristic of thes e orders is that they are not created due to a specific clinical determination by the ordering provider for a given patient, but rather are pre-determined for patients with a give n set of characteristics (for example, administer medication X and order lab Y for all patients under going a certain procedure or refills for given medication). Commenters maintain that these orde rs require special treatment in regards to when they are entered into CEHRT and who enters th em. Commenters indicate that administrative staff should be allowed to enter them, but not override any CDS in terventions that may appear. Response: We agree that this cate gory of orders warrant diffe rent considerations than orders that are due to a specifi c clinical determination by the ordering provider for a specific patient. We therefore allow provide rs to exclude orders that are predetermined for a given set of patient characteristics or for a given procedure from the calculation of CPOE numerators and denominators. Note this does not require providers to exclude this category of orders from their numerator and denominator. We foresee two circ umstances where a provider would not want to exclude this category of orders. Th e first is that they disagree th at these type of orders warrant different considerations and th erefore enter them according to our description of CPOE. The second is providers who are unable to separate them from other orders in their calculation of the denominator and numerator. Comment : Commenters mostly support the expa nsion to the laboratory and radiology orders. Three concerns were raised. First, co mmenters believed that as laboratory and radiology orders were new additions they should have a lower threshold than medication orders. Second, commenters desired a more descriptive defi nition on what constitutes a laboratory and 72 particularly a radiology order. Third, commenters suggested that laboratory and radiology orders should be delayed for EPs until more laboratory a nd radiology providers could receive the order electronically. Response: We discuss the measure separately later in this section and address the comments on the threshold there. We describe laboratory services as any service provided by a laboratory that could not be provided by a non-laboratory. Laborat ory is defined at 42 CFR examination of from the human body for the purpo se of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impair ment of, or the assessment of the health of, human beings. These examinations also include pr ocedures to determine, measure, or otherwise describe the presence or absen ce of various substances or organisms in the body. Facilities only collecting or preparing specimens (or both) or only serving as a mailing service and not performing testing are not consid ered laboratories.\" We descri be radiologic services as any imaging service that uses electr onic product radiation. Electronic product radiation is defined at 21 CFR 1000.3 as: \"any ionizing or radiation, or [a]ny sonic, infrasonic, or ultrasonic wa ve that is emitted from an elect ronic product as the result of the operation of an electronic circuit in such product.\" If the provider desires to include other types of imaging services that do not rely on electroni c product radiation they may do so as long as the policy is consistent across all patients and for the entire EHR reporting pe riod. Finally, as we discuss in the next comment and response, el ectronic transmission of the order is not a requirement for CPOE. Comment : Some commenters stat ed that while CPOE is a commonly understood 73 function in the hospital setting, in the ambulat ory setting its use is more ambiguous. For medication orders, the difference between CPOE for the medication and e-prescribing the medication is more subtle. The expansion to labo ratory and radiology further complicates this in the ambulatory setting as most laboratory and ra diology orders are sent to a third party which may or may not be able to rece ive such orders electronically. Response : While we agree that the concept of CPOE is a more definitive action in the ordering process in the hospital setting, we believe that it is still integral to the ambulatory setting and serves the same purposes in both setti ngs as a trigger for CDS interventions and as a way to increase the efficiency and safety of the ordering process. CPOE is the entry of the order into the patient's EHR that uses a specific function of CEHRT. It is not how that order is filled or otherwise carried out. For medications , on the ambulatory side CPOE feeds into e-prescribing, and on the hospital side electronic medication admi nistration record may be used, but neither of these are requirements for CPOE. For example, a medication could be entered into CEHRT using CPOE and then be electronically transmitted to a pharmacy. This would be both CPOE and e-prescribing. However, a medicati on could be entered into CEHRT using CPOE and then a printed copy of the pres cription could be generated by CE HRT and given to the patient. This would still be CPOE, but not e-prescribing. Similarly, whether the or dering of laboratory or radiology services using CPOE in fa ct results in the order being tr ansmitted electron ically to the laboratory or radiology provi der does not dictate whether CPOE was met. CPOE is a step in a process that takes place in both hospital and ambulato ry settings, and we continue to believe it is relevant to both settings. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are modifying this objective for EPs as \u00a7495.6(j)(1)(i) and for elig ible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(1)(i) to use the same 74 language as Stage 1 (with the addition of laborator y and radiology orders), as we did not finalize our proposed changes to when the order must be entered: \"Use computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medication, la boratory, and radiology orders di rectly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can en ter orders into the medical r ecord per state, local, and professional guidelines.\" Proposed Measure: More than 60 percent of me dication, laboratory, and radiology orders created by the EP or authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE. In Stage 1 of meaningful use, we adopted a m easure of more than 30 percent of all unique patients with at least one medication in their me dication list seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emer gency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have at least one medication order entered using CPOE. In the Stage 1 final rule, we adopted a threshold of 60 pe rcent for this measure for Stage 2. In our proposed rule, we discussed how our experience with Stage 1 has shown that the denominator of all orders created by the EP or in the hospital would not be unduly burdensome for providers and creates a better measuremen t for CPOE usage, particularly for EPs who infrequently order medications. We explained that the denominator recommended by the HITPC of \"patients with at least one t ype of order\" is a proxy measure fo r the number of orders issued. We asked for comments on whether the barriers to collecting information for our proposed denominator would be greater in a hospital or ambulatory setting. We also requested that commenters suggest different denominators or measures a nd encouraged any commenter proposing an alternative denominator to discuss wh ether the proposed thres hold or an alternative 75 threshold should be used for this measure and to include any exclusions they believe are necessary based on their a lternative denominator. We also stated in our proposed rule that we believed providers do not roll out CPOE for only one order type, but rather for a package of order types. The HITPC had recommended a percentage threshold for laborat ory orders, but a yes/no attesta tion of one order for radiology (not for both laboratory and radiology , as we mistakenly stated in the proposed rule). We also expressed concerns in the proposed rule about th e possibility that an EP , eligible hospital or CAH could create a test environmen t to issue the one order and not roll out the capability widely or at all. For these reasons, we proposed a pe rcentage threshold for a ll three types of orders: medication, laboratory, and radiology. Comment : Commenters both supported and opposed the new denominator for CPOE. Those supporting the proposed denominator did so for its simplicity and greater accuracy for measuring actual CPOE usage. Commenters that opposed the proposed denominator did so for one of two reasons. Either they were concerned with the burden associated with counting paper or other orders that are never entered into CE HRT or they were conc erned that the proposed denominator requires much higher performance of CPOE usage. For example, in the hospital setting an inpatient might have 20 orders duri ng a stay. Under the proposed denominator, 13 of those orders would have to be entered using CPOE, while under the cu rrent denominator only one order would have to be entered usi ng CPOE. A few commenters opposed the new denominator for both reasons. Response : In regards to the perceived higher performance of CPOE usage required by switching from the Stage 1 denomin ator to the Stage 2 proposed denominator, the sole purpose of the proxy measure for CPOE used in Stage 1 was to alleviate the measurement burden, not 76 create a lower level of CPOE usage than implie d by the percentage threshold. Therefore, as a more accurate measure is possible, it should reflec t the percentage of CPOE use indicated by the established thresholds. In regards to the burden of the measure, we had stated in our proposed rule that the reason we believed we could move to the proposed denominator was feedback from many providers indicating that they could in fact measure the propos ed denominator. In addition due to problems associated with the proxy for EPs who have comprehensive medication lists for their patients, but were not the ordering provide r for many of those medications some EPs were having to use an alternative m easure issued through guidance (https://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&faqId=3257) that allowed them to only include patients with medications the EP had ordered. We assume in determining the measures of meaningful use that the patient's medical record conforms to existing Federal and state laws, which we believe would generally require that all orders issued by a provider for a patient become part of the patient's medical record (f or example, 42 CFR 482.24(c )(2)(vi)). Therefore, the concept that some orders do not become pa rt of the CEHRT means that the provider is maintaining patient medical records both electr onically in CEHRT and outside of CEHRT using either paper charts or another el ectronic system. When a provider starts their first Stage 2 EHR reporting period, they will have been using CEHRT for at least 15 m onths. In our proposed rule, we have stated our belief that most providers would have fully transi tioned patients' medical records to CEHRT by the time they start Stage 2. However, as discusse d previously, we are leaving open the option for limiting certain meas ures to only those records maintained in CEHRT. As this is one of those measures, there is no reason to change the measure to accommodate patient records not maintained in CEHRT as provider can choose to not include records not maintained in CEHRT in the denomin ator. Thus, we finalize the denominator as 77 proposed. Comment : Commenters requested clarifica tion on whether the measure puts all medication, laboratory and radiol ogy orders in the same denom inator and therefore it was potentially possible to meet the 60 percent threshold w ithout CPOE being used 60 percent of the time for one or more order type, up to and incl uding the possibility that CPOE may never be used for one or more order type. Many commenters suggested that if all orders were in the same denominator this was not a good measure of the expansion of CPOE to laboratory and radiology and that the orders should be broken out separately. Only a fe w commenters suggested that the denominator should be the aggregate of all three types of orders. Response : We agree with the commenters that an aggregate denominator does not best reflect our expansion to laborator y and radiology and therefore crea te a separate denominator for each order type. This is consistent with the sugg estions of the majority of commenters and most accurately reflects the use of CP OE. While CPOE does not require the electronic transmission of the order, many CEHRT will be linked to the technology systems that manage medication, as well as those for laboratories and radiology departments. These systems may be different thereby presenting unique challenges for each orde r type that could result in differing roll out times and utilization rates. In addition, a pr ovider with a high number of one order type compared to others may even be able to reach a combined threshold without implementing CPOE for one or more of the order types. This would negate the benef its of expanding CPOE to these order types. We have excl usionary criteria for those provider s who so infrequently issue an order type that it is no t practical to implement CPOE for that order type. Comment : We received several suggestions on the percentage threshold for medication orders to reduce it below 60 percent. The sugge stions ranged from 50 percent to 30 percent. 78 Two reasons were given. First, that 60 per cent was simply too high. Second, that the proposed denominator made 30 percent a much higher bar th an it was when the proxy was in place and the threshold should not be raised until we have data based on the proposed denominator. Response : As we stated previously, the purpos e of the proxy denominator was not to create a lower bar than CPOE usage at 30 perc ent, but to address measurement burden. While we agree that the information ge nerated using the proxy denominator for CPOE is different from the finalized denominator, this is only true in a limited set of circ umstances, especially for EPs. For it to be different at all, a provider must ha ve ordered more than one medication for a patient during the EHR reporting period. Furthermore, this is most likely limited to providers who see a patient on more than one occasion. We believe it would be highly unlikely that a provider would use CPOE to order one medication and then not us e it to order another during the same encounter or admission. For these reasons, we believe that while not a perfect co rrelation the information gained through Stage 1 attestations. The Stage 1 attestations provide a reasonable basis on which to set the Stage 2 thresholds. We believe it is reasonable to expect the actual use of CPOE to increase from 30 percent in Stage 1 to 60 percen t in Stage 2 and consist with the expectations that were finalized in the Stage 1 regulations. Therefore, for medication orders, we finalize the threshold at 60 percent. Comment : Some commenters maintain that th e addition of labor atory and radiology orders to CPOE is a new function and should not be introduced at the same threshold. Response : Based on the same logic supporting th e 60 percent threshold for medication orders (that is, 30 percent is reasonable when CP OE is first introduced for an order type, and 60 percent in the next stage following CPOE in troduction), we agree with the commenters that the thresholds should be different. We finalize a threshold of 30 percent for each laboratory and 79 radiology orders. After consideration of the public comments received, we are splitting the proposed measure into three measures and changing the th reshold for radiology and laboratory orders at \u00a7495.6(j)(1)(ii) for EPs and \u00a7495.6(l)(1)(ii) for eligible hospitals and CAHs. More than 60 percen t of medication orders created by the EP or authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE. More than 30 percen t of laboratory orders created by th e EP or authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE. More than 30 percen t of radiology orders created by th e EP or authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(1). As discussed in the comment and response section, an EP, eligible hospital or CAH can limit the denominators to only include medication, laboratory and radiology orders for patients whose records are maintained using CEHRT. To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of medication orders created by the EP or authorized providers in the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. 80 Numerator : The number of orders in the denominator recorded using CPOE. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 60 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who writes fewer than 100 medication orders during the EHR reporting period. Denominator : Number of radiology orders created by the EP or authorized providers in the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of orders in the denominator recorded using CPOE. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 30 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who writes fewer than 100 radiology orders during the EHR reporting period. Denominator : Number of laboratory orders created by the EP or authorized providers in the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of orders in the denominator recorded using CPOE. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 30 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who writes fewer than 100 laboratory orders during the EHR reporting period. An EP through a combination of meeting the thre sholds and/or exclusi ons must satisfy all three measures for this objective. 81 A hospital must meet the thresholds for all three measures. Proposed EP Objective : Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically (eRx). In the proposed rule, we noted that the use of electronic pres cribing has several advantages over having the patien t carry the prescription to the pharmacy or directly faxing a handwritten or typewritte n prescription to the pharmacy. When the EP generates the prescription electronically, CEHRT can recognize the inform ation and can provide decision support to promote safety and quality in the form of advers e interactions and other treatment possibilities. The CEHRT can also provide decision support that promotes the efficiency of the health care system by alerting the EP to generic alternatives or to alternatives favored by the patient's insurance plan that are equally effective. Transmitting the prescription electronically promotes efficiency and safety through reduced communicati on errors. It also al lows the pharmacy or a third party to automatically compare the medicati on order to others they have received for the patient. This comparison allows for many of th e same decision support functions enabled at the generation of the prescription, but bases them on potentially greater information. We proposed to continue to define prescripti on as the authorization by an EP to dispense a drug that will not be dispensed without such authorization. This in cludes authorization for refills of previously au thorized drugs. We proposed to defi ne a permissible pr escription as all drugs meeting the definition of pres cription not listed as a controll ed substance in Schedules II - V http://www.deadiversion.us doj.gov/schedules/index.html . Although the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) interim final rule on elec tronic prescriptions for controlled substances (75 FR 16236) removed the Federal prohibition to electronic prescr ibing of controlled substances, some challenges remain including more restrictive state law and widespread 82 availability of products both fo r providers and pharmacies that include the functionalities required by the DEA's regulations. We asked for public comments as to whether over the counter (OTC) medicines w ill be routinely electronically prescr ibed and proposed to continue to exclude them from the definition of a prescription. In our proposed rule we discu ssed several different workflow scenarios are possible when an EP prescribes a drug for a patient. First, th e EP could prescribe the drug and provide it to the patient at the same time, and sometimes the EP might also provide a prescription for doses beyond those provided concurrentl y. Second, the EP could prescr ibe the drug, transmit it to a pharmacy within the same organization, and th e patient would obtain the drug from that pharmacy. Third, the EP could prescribe the dru g, transmit it to a pharmacy independent of the EP's organization, and the patient would obtain the drug from that pharmacy. Although each of these scenarios would result in the generati on of a prescription, the transmission of the prescription would vary. In the first situation, there is no transm ission. In the second situation, the transmission may be the viewing of the ge neration of the prescription by another person using the same CEHRT as the EP , or it could be the transmission of the prescription from the Certified EHR Technology used by the EP to anot her system used by the same organization in the pharmacy. In the third situation, the EP's Certified EHR Technology transmits the prescription outside of their orga nization either through a third part y or directly to the external pharmacy. These differences in transmissions creat e differences in the need for standards. We proposed that only the third situ ation would require standards to ensure that the transmission meets the goals of electronic pres cribing. In the first two scenar ios one organization has control over the whole process. In the third scenario, the process is di vided between organizations. In that situation, standards can ensu re that despite the lack of c ontrol the whole process functions 83 reliably. To have successfully e-prescribed, we proposed that the EP needs to use CEHRT as the sole means of creating the prescription, and when transmitting to an external pharmacy that is independent of the EP's organization such tr ansmission must use standards adopted for EHR technology certification. We did not receive any public comments on this objective, therefore, we are finalizing this objective at \u00a7495.6(j )(2)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measure: More than 65 percent of all pe rmissible prescriptions written by the EP are compared to at least one drug form ulary and transmitted elec tronically using CEHRT. We proposed a new exclusion for Stage 2 that would allow EPs to exclude this objective if no pharmacies within 25 miles of an EP's pract ice location at the start of his/her EHR reporting period accept electronic prescriptions. This is 25 miles in any straight line from the practice location independent of the travel route from the practice locati on to the pharmacy. We stated that EP's practicing at multiple locations would be eligible for the exclusion if any of their practice locations that ar e equipped with CEHRT meet this criter ia. An EP would not be eligible for this exclusion if he or she is part of an organization that owns or operates its own pharmacy within the 25-mile radius regardless of whethe r that pharmacy can accept electronic prescriptions from EPs outside of the organization. We also proposed an exclusion for EPs who write fewer than 100 prescriptions during the EHR reporting period. Comment : Most commenters agreed with the excl usion of controlled substances in the denominator. They were concerned about industr y readiness as well as potentially conflicting state regulations. Other comment ers expressed concerns that sp ecialists (that is, surgeons, psychiatrists) who write prescrip tions that are not permissible (t hat is, controlled substances) would not be able to meet the measure. 84 Response : We agree with the commenters and will continue to exclude controlled substances from the denominator. However, we are also adding an alternative denominator to provide additional flexibility for EPs who are able to electronically prescribe controlled substances and want to count thes e prescriptions in the measure. Comment : Most commenters did not support the inclusion of OTC medicines in this objective, as OTC medicines are not usually intended for the pharmacy to fill. Those commenters who did support it noted that OTC me dicines are prescribed often times because it allows patients to use thei r health care spending account s to pay for the cost. Response : After consideration of public comments, we agree with the majority of commenters in that OTC medicine s should not be included as a pa rt of this objective. While some OTC medicines are ordered by the EP, the low prevalence of such occurrences means the costs of including them in both measurement and actual e-prescribing outwe ighs any benefit of inclusion. Comment : Most commenters thought the proposed threshold was too high or just right. Those who thought it was too high expressed co ncerns about the abilities of mail-order pharmacies to accept electronic subscriptions . Some commenters suggested lowering the threshold to 50 percent. Other commenters expressed concerns that patients may prefer a paper prescription and suggested exclud ing those patients from the denominator. The commenters who thought the proposed threshold was \"just right \" noted that most EPs who successfully demonstrated meaningful use for Stage 1 far ex ceeded the Stage 1 threshold of 40 percent. Response : Preliminary analysis of Stage 1 mean ingful use attestation data shows that those EPs who successfully attested for this m easure exceeded the 40 percent threshold - many reporting thresholds of 80-100 percent. However, the Surescripts Q4 2011 Report suggests that 85 close to 40 percent of physicians who began e-pr escribing in 2008 meet the 65 percent threshold. This report only represents the earliest adopters. Based on public comments, we believe the 65 percent threshold we proposed may be unatt ainable for many EPs and question whether any real difference in provider beha vior is achieved with a 65 percen t threshold vers us a 50 percent threshold. This lower threshol d also accounts for patients who ma y prefer a paper prescription, rather than having their prescription sent to a pharmacy electronically. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing the threshold for this measure at 50 percent. Comment : Most commenters supported comparing prescriptions written by the EP to a drug formulary, but not without concern. Many noted that drug formularies are not always readily available, are linked to specific payers , or may not otherwise be readily available. Response : After review of the public comments, we realize this measure needs to be further clarified. We recognize that not every patie nt will have a formulary that is relevant for him or her. Therefore, we require not th at the CEHRT check each prescription against a formulary relevant for a given patient, but rath er that the CEHRT check each prescription for the existence of a relevant formulary. If a relevant formulary is available, then the information can be provided. We believe that th is initial check is essentially an on or off function for the CEHRT and should not add to the measurem ent burden. Therefore, with this clarification of the check we are referring to, we are finalizing the drug formular y check as a component of this measure. We look forward to the day when a relevant formul ary is available for every patient. We also modified the measure to use the word \"query\" in stead of \"compare\" because it better explains the process in which the EP uses the CEHRT to c onsult the information provided in the formulary. Comment : Many commenters expressed concerns about patients who request paper copies of their prescriptions and how they would be accounted for in this measure. Commenters 86 also expressed concerns about pa tients who prefer to use mail -order pharmacies that do not accept eRx. Response : We have accounted for patient prefer ences by lowering the threshold for this measure from 65 percent to 50 percent. Comment : Many commenters expressed concerns that the word \"permissible\" was omitted from the proposed exclusion for EPs who write fewer than 100 prescriptions during the EHR reporting period. Response : We agree with commenters in that we inadvertently omitted the word \"permissible\" from this exclusion. After cons ideration of public comm ents, we are finalizing this exclusion as \"EPs who wr ite fewer than 100 permissible prescriptions during the EHR reporting period.\" Comment : Many commenters supported this excl usion but expressed concerns about how it was proposed and would be implemented. Some commenters sugge sted reducing the radius to 10 miles or less in urban areas a nd leaving it at 25 miles in rural areas. Other commenters suggested revising this exclusion for EPs where less than 20 percent of pharmacies e-prescribe within a 25-mile radi us of their office. Other comme nters expressed concerns that there may only be a limited number of pharmacies in their geographic area that can accept prescriptions electronic ally. Yet others suggested includ ing a grace period for EPs in areas where no pharmacies e-prescribe at the beginning of their EHR reporting period, but later begin accepting eRx. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns about this exclusion. We agree with commenters in that a 25-mile radius may be too la rge. We believe the 10-mile radius is more reasonable as it takes the country's geographic diversity (urban, suburban, rural areas) into 87 account. We are therefore finalizi ng that if no pharmacies within a 10-mile radius of an EP's practice location at the start of the EHR reportin g period accept electroni c prescriptions, the EP would qualify for this exclusion, un less the EP is part of an orga nization that owns or operates a pharmacy within the 10-mile radius. As for patie nt preference, we agree with commenters that not all patients will want to go to a particul ar pharmacy just because they accept electronic prescriptions. However, we believe we accounted for patient preference by lowering the threshold for the measure to 50 percent. After consideration of public comments, we are revising the measure at \u00a7495.6(j)(2)(ii) to read: \"More than 50 percent of all permissible prescriptions, or all prescriptions, written by the EP are queried for a drug formulary and transmitted electronically using CEHRT.\" We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(3) and 45 CFR 170.314(a)(10). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of prescriptions written for drugs requiring a prescription in order to be dispensed other than controlled substances during the EHR reporting period; or Number of prescriptions written for drugs requiring a prescription in order to be dispensed during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of prescrip tions in the denominator generated, queried for a drug formulary and transmitted el ectronically using CEHRT. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusions : Any EP who: (1) writes fewer than 100 permissible prescriptions during the 88 EHR reporting period; or (2) does not have a pharmacy within thei r organization and there are no pharmacies that accept electronic prescriptions w ithin 10 miles of the EP's practice location at the start of his/her EHR reporting period. Consolidated Objective : Maintain an up-to-date probl em list of current and active diagnoses. Consolidated Objective : Maintain active medication list. Consolidated Objective : Maintain active medication allergy list. For Stage 2, we proposed to consolidate the objectives for maintaining an up-to-date problem list, active medication list, and active me dication allergy list with the Stage 2 objective for providing a summary of care for each transiti on of care or referral. We stated that we continue to believe that an up- to-date problem list, active medi cation list, and active medication allergy list are important elements to be ma intained in CEHRT. However, the continued demonstration of their meaningful use in Stage 2 would be requi red by other objectives focused on the transitioning of care of patients removing the necessity of measuring them separately. Providing this information is crit ical to continuity of care, so we proposed to add these as required fields in the summary of care for the following Stage 2 objective: \"The EP, eligible hospital or CAH who transitions th eir patient to another setting of care or provider of care or refers their patient to another provider of car e should provide summary care record for each transition of care or referral.\" We stated th at EPs and hospitals would have to ensure the accuracy of these fields when providing the summa ry of care, which we believe would ensure a high level of compliance in maintaining an up-to-date problem list, active medication list, and active medication allergy list for patients. The required standards for these fields are discussed in the ONC standards and certification final ru le published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 89 Register . Comment : Overall, we received very few comm ents on our proposal to consolidate the up-to-date problem list, active medication list, and active medication allergy list objectives. Some commenters opposed our proposa l as they believe it would detract from the importance of these items. However, the vast majority of t hose who commented on this proposal supported the consolidation of these objectives. Response : After consideration of public comments , we are finalizing the consolidation of these objectives as proposed for the reasons disc ussed in the proposed ru le. The objectives of maintaining an up-to-date problem list, active medication list, a nd active medication allergy list will be consolidated with the Stage 2 objective for providing a summary of care for each transition of care or referral. Proposed EP Objective: Record the following demographics: preferred language, gender, race and ethnicity, and date of birth. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective. Record the following demographics: preferred language, gender, race and ethnicity, date of birth, and date and preliminary cause of death in the event of mortality in the eligible hospital or CAH. We proposed to continue the policy that EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs collect baseline demographic data for all unique patients in the EHR using OMB standards for race and ethnicity. The proposed rule outlines some of the numerous benefits from recording basic patient demographic information in the EHR, including improved patient-centered care and management of the health of populations. In response to multiple comments from the Stage 1 final rule regarding the preliminary cause of death data element required fo r eligible hospitals and CAHs, we clarified the following; this element is the pr eliminary cause of death recorded by the hospital 90 and is not required to be ame nded when additional information becomes available, there is no specified timeframe for recording this elemen t, and we invited additional public comment regarding these clarific ations in the proposed rule. We also asked for public comment on the burden and ability to include addi tional measures of disability st atus, gender identity and/or sexual orientation. Comment : We received many comments sugges ting CMS differentiate between the terms sex and gender. One commenter provided th e definition that the term sex is used in recording vital health statistics that describe th e physiological characteri stics at time of birth. The term gender incorporates behaviors, roles, and expectations correspon ding to an individual's sex and is generally self reported. Response : We appreciate this clarification and will incorporate the change in terminology for the final rule using the term sex instead of gender in EP , eligible hospital and CAH objectives for recording demographics. Th is change in terminol ogy aligns with vital statistic reporting and the HHS final dem ographic data collection standards published October 31, 2011. Comment : Several commenters indicated that the collection of race and ethnicity demographic information can be sensitive and patients may be unwilling or uncomfortable reporting this information to the individual co llecting demographic data. Other comments supported CMS clarification in the Stage 1 final rule that provider s can be allowed to account for patients who decline to provide elements of demographic information. Additional comments suggested that a single system parameter be de veloped to identify stat es that prohibit data reporting should be available to the EHR. Response : If a patient declines to provide informa tion of ethnicity or race or if capturing 91 a patient's ethnicity or race is proh ibited by state law, this should be duly noted as structured data in the EHR and this would still count as an entr y for the purpose of meeting this measure. A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research an d Quality (AHRQ) states that current state prohibitions on the collection of ethni city and race apply to health plans collection of data at the time of enrollment. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits health care organizations to collect race, ethnicity, and preferred language patient data for the purpose of quality improvement. Comment : Several commenters suggested that CM S use the same definition for race and ethnicity as the Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention (CDC) and the United States Census Bureau. Other commenters were concerned abou t the need to collect data granular enough to identify differences between subpopulations and aligned across government programs. Response : We recognize that the CDC has deve loped codes that allow for the mapping of more detailed race and ethnic ity categories such as those maintained by the U.S. Bureau of the Census to the less detailed OMB standard. We appreciate that providers may need to collect more granular demographic data to manage thei r patient populations. For purposes of achieving Stage 2 of meaningful use, we will continue to rely on the OMB standard as a minimum standard for the collection of race and ethnicity data. EP s, eligible hospitals, and CAHs who wish to collect more granular level data on patient race and ethnicity may do so as long as they can map the data to 1 of the 5 races included in the ex isting OMB standards. The standards associated with the meaningful use objectives and measures are discussed fu rther in the ONC standards and certification criteria final rule a nd we refer readers to that regu lation published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Comment : Many commenters agreed with the need to incorporate disability status in 92 EHR technology. However, it was also clear that several of these commen ters varied in their definition of disability with in terpretations that ranged from phys ical, mental, occupational, and economic disability status. Commenters also di ffered regarding the most appropriate location for the capture and storage of disability status data elements within the EHR. Suggestions for where to incorporate disability status data varied (for example; fr om the demographic objective, to physician notes, and/or the problem list component of the summary of care document). Another commenter suggested that the de mographic objective should be lim ited to collecting data with static values and the active pr oblem list, electronic notes and/ or care summary documents that are continually updated would be more appropriate for recording changes in patient disability status. Response : We wish to clarify that the term disab ility status used in the proposed rule was meant to be all-encompassing by incorporating both the concepts of physical and cognitive disabilities as well as the concep t of functional status limitations that impact an individual's capability to perform activities in different e nvironments. This latter concept incorporates metrics useful for planning and coordination acro ss care settings. Comment ers varied in their responses regarding the level of consensus on measurement standa rds for each of these health status measures. Since publishing the proposed rule we have learned that significant progress has been made regarding the captu re of functional status into th e consolidated clinical document architecture (C-CDA) standard for summary of care records. The C-CDA Implementation Guide provides the following examples that may be inco rporated under functiona l status; assessments of a patient's language, vision, hearing, activities of daily living, behavior, general function, mobility, self-care status, physical state and cognitive function. 1 The C-CDA standards support 1Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2.0 (US REALM) July 2012, \u00a9 2012 Health Level Seven, Inc. Ann Arbor, MI 93 the exchange of clinical documen ts between those involved in the care of a patient and allow for the re-use of clinical data for clinical care giving, public he alth reporting, quality monitoring, patient safety and clinical trials. This inclusi on is addressed more fully under the discussion of the transition of care objective in this final rule. We strongly support the adoption, implementatio n and meaningful use of CEHRT for all individuals and the reduction of ba rriers for persons with disabilities . In finalizing this rule, we also considered the operational challenges that could result from the lack of consensus noted by many commenters to incorporate a physical disability standard measure in the demographic section of CEHRT at this time. As a result, we will not require the collection of disability status data under the demographic objective for Stage 2 of meaningful use. However, we suggest that providers examine the questions developed by the HHS as required by section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act. The questions resulted fr om an interagency proces s and are closely aligned to the Census Bureau's American Community Su rvey and the Internati onal Classification of Disability. These questions ma y be found on the HHS website at http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/te mplates/content.aspx?ID=9232#1 . The answers to these questions could be incorporated as functional status or othe r data elements in the C-CDA summary of care document mentioned above and disc ussed more fully in the transition of care objective later in this rule. We will continue to work with ONC, other fe deral agencies and seek the advice of the HIT Policy Committee to explore fu rther how disability status c ould be included in meaningful use Stage 3. Comments : Many commenters supported the prop osed inclusion of recording gender identity and/or sexual orientation as part of the demographic objective. Other commenters 94 suggested that the collection of this information is extremely sensitive and could be considered offensive for some patients especially when collected by administrative staff. Still other commenters did not see the clinical significance of collecting and recording this information in the demographic section of the EHR. Others comm enters were against recording gender identity and/or sexual orientation because they did not consider this w ould provide additional clinical benefit. Still others suggested that the repor ting of gender identity or sexual orientation be optional and up to individual clinician judgment whet her or not it is appropriate to collect this information. Similar to the comments for the proposed incl usion of disability st atus, commenters noted both the data collection challenges and data re porting burden. Many commenters were opposed to the mandatory collection of all three additiona l measures for Stage 2 of meaningful use and suggested that reporti ng could be optional. Response : Considering the lack of consensus fo r the definition of the concept of gender identity and/or sexual orientation as well as fo r a standard measure of the concept and where it would be most appropriate to store the data wi thin the EHR, we will await further development of a consensus for the goal and standard of measurement for gender identity and/or sexual orientation. Additionally, we note that many comm enters raised concerns as to whether such data collection is necessary for all EPs, eligib le hospital, and CAH regardless of specialty. Comments : Several additional measures were suggested under the demographic objective including; measuring the level of access to and use of the internet, measuring computer literacy, and measuring standardized occ upation using established industry codes. Response : We appreciate the numerous commen ts suggesting additional demographic information that will allow providers to improve th e quality of individual patient centered care as 95 well as population health. We may consider these suggestions further in the development of Stage 3 of meaningful use. Comment : A minority of commenters recommende d removing the preliminary cause of death element altogether from the eligible hos pital/CAH objective. Othe rs suggested that the eligible hospital /CAH measure for preliminary cau se of death be modified to simply capture whether or not the patient had a cause of death re corded, regardless of when that information was entered into the EHR, because the preliminary cause of death may ofte n be inaccurate since by law the coroner or medical examiner makes th e final determination for the patient's death certificate. Response : We appreciate the suggestion for meas ure simplification. However, for this measure we want to respect the existing hospital workflow where a clinician evaluates the patient to pronounce the death. This preliminary cause of death is documented by the clinician in the patient's chart. We recognize that these work flows may change as EH R technology develops and becomes more widely adopted and the exchange of health information is able to link to vital statistic reporting. However, for the time bei ng the measure of preliminary cause of death under the demographic objective will remain unchanged. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e modifying the meaningful use objective at \u00a7495.6(j) (3) (i) of our regulations as follows: EP s \"Record all of the following demographics: preferred language, sex, r ace, ethnicity, and date of birth.\" After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e modifying the meaningful use objective at \u00a7495.6(l)(2)(i) of our regulations as follows: E ligible hospitals and CAHs \"Record all of the following demo graphics: Preferred language, sex, race, ethnicity, date of birth, date and preliminary cause of death in the event of mortality in the eligible hospital or 96 CAH.\" Proposed Measure: More than 80 percent of all un ique patients seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have demogr aphics recorded as structured data. Comment : Most commenters were supportive of the increased threshold for this measure. Response : Our analysis of the meaningful use data for Stage 1 found that over 90 percent of EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs were able to successfully report the demographic measure. Therefore, based on comments and actual perf ormance data we do not foresee a burden in increasing the measure threshold from more than 50 percent in Stage 1 to greater than 80 percent in Stage 2. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(3)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6( l)(2)(ii) as proposed. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(3). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator: Number of unique patients seen by the EP or admitted to an eligible hospital or CAH inpatient or emergency depart ment (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator: The number of patients in the denomi nator who have all the elements of demographics (or a specific notati on if the patient declined to provi de one or more elements or if recording an element is contrary to state law) recorded as structured data. 97 Threshold: The resulting percentage must be more than 80 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. If a patient declines to provi de one or more demographic el ements this can be noted in the CEHRT and the EP or hospital may still count th e patient in the numerator for this measure. The required elements and standards for record ing demographics and no ting omissions because of state law restrictions or patients declining to provide information will be discussed in the ONC standards and certification rule, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Proposed Objective : Record and chart changes in the following vital signs: height/length and weight (no age limit); blood pre ssure (ages 3 and over); calculate and display body mass index (BMI); and plot and display growth charts for patients 0-20 years, including BMI. We proposed to continue our policy objective from Stage 1 to collect and record basic vital sign data for patients across health care se ttings. In the proposed rule, we outlined the benefits of documenting basic vita l signs including that the data provides important clinical information on both the patient's current conditio n as well as the ability to track changes in patient status over time. For Stage 2, we propos ed to remove the age restrictions on recording height/length and weight, and also proposed to remove the age restrictions on calculating and displaying BMI and growth charts. In addi tion, we proposed to modify the Stage 1 blood pressure guideline to align with the Am erican Academy of Pediatrics guideline recommendations to measure blood pressure for ch ildren 3 years of age and older. We also proposed to continue our exclus ions policy from Stage 1 (with modifications, as discussed below) for EPs who believe that recording and ch arting vital signs is outsi de the scope of their practice. 98 Comment : Several commenters questioned why all providers need to collect vital sign data when this information should be available from a robust health information exchange across providers. Response : We will continue the Stage 1 mean ingful use policy that any method of obtaining height, weight and blood pressure is acceptable fo r the purpose of this objective as long as the information is recorded as structured data in the CEHRT. As stated in the proposed rule, the vital sign information can be entered into the patient's medical r ecord in a number of ways including: direct entry by the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH; entry by a designated individual from the EP, eligible hospital, or CA H's staff; data transfer from another provider electronically, through an HIE or through other met hods; or data entered di rectly by the patient through a portal or other means. Some of these methods are more accurate than others, and it is up to the EP or eligible hospital to determine the level of accuracy needed to care for their patient and how best to obtain this information. We also look forward to the time when a more robust health information exchange network will allow providers to share relevant data across settings and/or alert providers when additional data should be obtained. Comment : We received comments requesting that CMS include a statement clarifying which specialties would be included or excluded from this objective. Response : We appreciate commenter's efforts to cl arify this objective. However, we will continue our more general policy from Stage 1 (with modifications, as explained later) of allowing EPs to exclude this objective if they believe recording and ch arting changes in vital signs is not relevant to their sc ope of practice. We cannot defi ne the scope of practice and/or interventions necessary for each individual patient and will continue to rely on provider determinations based on individual patient circ umstances. Consider a hypothetical example of 99 an elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions that includes de pression. When the patient is seen by his behavioral healthcare provider to manage his depressi on, it is up to that provider to determine whether it would be medically necessary to record and chart the patient's weight in order to manage the patient's care. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(4)(i) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(3)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure: More than 80 percent of all un ique patients seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have blood pressu re (for patients age 3 and over only) and height/length and weight (for all ag es) recorded as structured data. We proposed to split the exclusions from Stag e 1 such that an EP could choose to record height/length and weight only and exclude blood pressure, or record bl ood pressure only and exclude height/length and weight. We encourag ed comments on this split and whether it should go both ways. We proposed to increase the thresh old from more than 50 percent to more than 80 percent for this measure. Comment : Several commenters agreed with th e policy that height /length, weight, and blood pressure do not each need to be updated by a provider neither at ev ery patient encounter nor even once per patient seen during the EHR reporting period. Response : We will maintain our policy from Stage 1 that it is up to the EP or hospital to determine whether height/length, weight, and blo od pressure each need to be updated, the level of accuracy needed to care for their patient, and ho w best to obtain the vital sign information that will allow for the right care for each patient. Comment : Another commenter suggest ed that CMS clarify that the growth charts and 100 BMI are not part of the actual measure for this objective. Response : We clarify that to satisfy the measur e of this objective, the CEHRT must have the capability to calculate BMI and produce growth charts for patients as appropriate. Since BMI and growth charts are only produced when height/length and weight vital sign data are captured in the CEHRT, the measure is limited to these data elements. Overall commenters supported the added flexibil ity of our proposal to split the exclusion and allow EPs to record blood pressure only or he ight/length and weight on ly. Our analysis of the meaningful use data for Stage 1 found that ov er 90 percent of EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs were able to successfully report the vital signs measure. We did not propose additional measure elements that could increase the reporting burden at this time. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this measure as proposed for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (j)(4)(ii) and for e ligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(3)(ii). We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(4). The ability to calculate the measure is included in CEHRT. To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following: Denominator : Number of unique patients seen by the EP or admitted to an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency depa rtment (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period Numerator : Number of patients in the denominat or who have at least one entry of their height/length and weight (all ages) and/or blood pressure (ages 3 and over) recorded as structured data. 101 Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 80 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusions : Any EP who sees no patients 3 years or older is excluded from recording blood pressure. Any EP who belie ves that all 3 vital signs of height/leng th, weight, and blood pressure have no relevance to th eir scope of practice is excluded from recording them. Any EP who believes that height/length and weight are relevant to th eir scope of practice, but blood pressure is not, is excluded from recordi ng blood pressure. Any EP who believes that blood pressure is relevant to their sc ope of practice, but he ight/length and weight are not, is excluded from recording height/length and weight. Proposed Objective : Record smoking status for pa tients 13 years old or older. We stated in the proposed rule that accu rate information on smoking status provides context to a high number and wide variety of clin ical decisions, such as immediate needs for smoking cessation or long-term outcomes for chroni c obstructive pulmonary disease. Cigarette smoking is a key component to the current Million Hearts Initiative (http://millionhearts.hhs.gov). We did not propose rules on who may record smoking status or how often the record should be updated. In addi tion, we proposed to continue the age limitation at 13 years old. We also requested comments specifically on the possible inclusion of other forms of tobacco use and second hand smoke. Comment : We have received comments that assert that the objective is not relevant to a significant number of EPs due to th eir scope of practice and that it is redundant to the clinical quality measure \"National Quality Forum (NQF) 28: Preventive Care and Screening: Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation In tervention\". Some of the comments suggest that it should be eliminated and those EPs for whom it is relevant select the CQM. 102 Response : We disagree that the proposed objec tive and the clini cal quality measure identified by commenters serve the same purpos e and therefore only one should be included. The objective seeks to ensure that information on smoking status is included in the patient's record. Furthermore, that the information is stored in a structured format so that it can automatically be identified by CEHRT as smoking status for possible re porting or exchanging. We also note that the clinical quality measure only focuses on patients 18 years or older, while the objective focuses on patients 13 years or older. In addition, many quality measures related to smoking are coupled with follow-up actions by the provider such as counseling. We consider those follow-up actions to be beyond the scope of wh at we hope to achieve for this objective and would move the objective beyond the scope of pract ice for many providers. We disagree that the objective is not relevant to EPs s eeing patient 13 years ol d or older. We note that this is intended to inform the provider. The frequency of wh en the information is updated, detail beyond the standard included in certification of EHR tec hnology and many other factor s discussed later are all left up to the provider to d ecide and fit to their scope of pr actice and their patient population. Comment : We received conflicting suggestions in comments regarding the age limitation. These comments can be divided into t hose suggesting a lower ag e (as low as 8 to 12), those supporting 13 years old and those who beli eve it should be raised to 18 to match the clinical quality measures associated with smoking. Response : It is apparent from the comments th at the appropriate age for smoking status is an elusive target highly dependent on the situation. For example, it was suggested in comments that the age be lowered for patients m eeting certain characteristics such as parents who smoke or other risk factors, while remaining at 13 for other patients. In our review of the public comments, we do not believe a consensus has been reached on a different age limitation 103 than our Stage 1 age limitation of 13 years ol d and therefore finalize the age limitation as proposed. As with other meaningful use objectiv es and measures, this represents a minimum requirement. We encourage each and every provider to evaluate whether their scope of practice and/or patient population calls fo r collecting smoking status on pa tients younger than 13 or more detailed information than required by this objective. Comment : There continues to be strong support for expanding smoking to other forms of tobacco use. Commenters note that other types of tobacco us e are supported by the clinical quality measure \"NQF 28: Preventive Care a nd Screening: Tobacco Use: Screening and Cessation Intervention\". Response : We refer readers to ONC's standards and certification criteria final rule that is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register for discussions on the adoption of a standard that would support ot her types of tobacco use. As ONC did not adopt a standard supporting other forms of tobacco use, we do not expand the objective. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed strong support for the inclusion of second-hand smoke either as part of this objec tive or as a separate objective. Response : We agree with the importance of co llecting second-hand smoke information for many EPs and hospitals. However, as with othe r forms of tobacco use, there is not a standard on which to base the requirement of collection of this information as structured data. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this objective as proposed for EPs as \u00a7495.6(j)(5)(i) and for elig ible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(4)(i). Proposed Measure: More than 80 percent of all un ique patients 13 years old or older seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency departments (POS 21 or 23) duri ng the EHR reporting period have smoking status recorded as 104 structured data. In our proposed rule, based on Stage 1 data showing performance on this measure far exceeded the measure threshold of more than 50 pe rcent, we proposed a threshold of more than 80 percent for this measure for St age 2 of meaningful use. Comment : We received comments asking for clarific ation on what must be recorded in the EHR and how often for the numerator to be met. Response : Information on smoking status must be present as structured data using the standard specified at 45 CFR 170.31 4(a)(11). There is no requireme nt that the smoking status be entered into the record by a specific person or category of persons, there is no requirement that smoking status be entered into the CEHRT alrea dy in the terminology of the standard and there is no requirement on how frequently this inform ation be updated. A patient indicating how many packs he smokes a day on a new patient questionnai re which is then ente red by an administrative person and mapped in the CEHRT to one of the re sponses in the standard is valid for this measure. A physician could also ask a patient detailed questions to determine if the patient is a current smoker, input the information into the CE HRT, and select one of the responses of the standard. ONC has provided a mapping of SNOMED CT\u00ae ID to the descriptions at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(11). Comment : We received a few comments on the threshold. Most were supportive, while others believe it should remain at 50 percent. Response : Due to our analysis of performance on this measure from Stage 1 and the support received from commenters, we are finalizing the threshold as proposed. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this measure as proposed for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(5)(ii) and fo r eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(4)(ii). 105 We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(11). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients age 13 or older seen by the EP or admitted to an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency departments (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of patients in the deno minator with smoking status recorded as structured data. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 80 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP, eligible hospital, or CAH th at neither sees nor admits any patients 13 years old or older. CQM Reporting as a Stage 2 Objective - We proposed to add CQM reporting to the definition of \"meaningful EHR user\" under \u00a7495.4 in stead of including it as a separate objective under \u00a7495.6. Accordingly, we did not propose a CQM reporting objective for EPs and hospitals as part of the Stage 2 criteria under \u00a7495.6. Comment : While some commenters indicated that this change would be confusing, most commenters supported this change. Response : We appreciate the support of co mmenters and believe including CQM reporting in the definition of \"meaningful EHR user\" under \u00a7495.4 will actually alleviate confusion. Therefore, we are not finalizing an objective related to the reporting of CQMs in the Stage 2 criteria for meaningful use under \u00a7495.6. Although CQM reporting is not listed as a 106 separate objective and measure under \u00a7495.6, it remains a condition for demonstrating meaningful use.. Consolidated Objective : Implement drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks. For Stage 2, we proposed to make the objective for \"Implement drug-drug and drug-allergy checks\" one of the measures of the core objective for \"Use clinical decision support to improve performance on high-prio rity health conditions.\" We not ed our belief that automated drug-drug and drug-allergy checks provide important information to advise the provider's decisions in prescribing drugs to a patient. Beca use this functionality provides important clinical decision support that focuses on patient health and safety, we proposed to include this functionality as part of the objective for using clin ical decision support. We discuss comments regarding this consolid ation in the discussion of the clinical decision support objective. Proposed Objective : Use clinical decision supp ort to improve performance on high-priority hea lth conditions. We proposed to modify the clinical decisi on support (CDS) objective for Stage 2 such that CDS would be used to improve performance on high-priority health condi tions. We stated it would be left to the provider's clinical di scretion to select the most appropriate CDS interventions for their patient population. We also proposed that the CDS interventions selected must be related to five or more of the clin ical quality measures (C QMs) on which providers would be expected to report. The goal of the proposed CDS objective is for providers to implement improvements in clinic al performance for high-priority health conditions that will result in improved patient outcomes. Comment : A few commenters voiced concern rega rding the maturity of the development 107 of clinical decision support systems. Othe rs voiced a misconception that not all CEHRT includes pre-built CDS interventions where both capabilities and conten t are vendor supplied. The commenter went on to clarify that the CDS in terventions must be spec ific to each provider's requirements. Still others commented on the CM S change in terminology from CDS \"rules\" to CDS \"interventions\" increases the range of available interventions. Response : We recognize commenters' concerns re garding the maturity of CDS systems. Closely linked to the development of EHRs, ther e are multiple factors impacting the evolution of CDS systems including; the incr easing availability and sophistic ation of information technology in clinical settings, the increas ing pace of publication of new evidence-based guidelines for clinical practice and the continual evaluation and improvements of CDS.2 We clarify that all CEHRT includes CDS interventions. The compan ion ONC standards and certification criteria final rule published elsewh ere in this issue of the Federal Register includes further information regarding the criteria necessary to implement CDS in CEHRT for Stage 2 of meaningful use . With each incremental phase of meaningful us e, CDS systems progres s in their level of sophistication and ability to support patient care. For Stage 2 of meaningful use, it is our expectation that at a minimum, providers will select clinical decision support interventions to drive improvements in the delivery of care for the high-priority health cond itions relevant to their patient population. Continuous quality improvement requires an iterative process in the implementation and evaluation of selected CD S interventions that will allow for ongoing learning and development. In this final rule, we will consider a broad range of CDS interventions that improve both cl inical performance and the effici ent use of healthcare resources 2Study Protocol for the Effects of computerized clinical decision support systems on practitioner performance and patient outcome: Methods of a decision- maker-researcher partnership systematic review. R Brian Haynes*, Nancy L Wilczynski and the Computerized Clinical Decision Support System (CCDSS) Systematic Review Team. IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE 2010, 5:12 108 in measuring providers' ability to demonstrat e the meaningful use of CEHRT for Stage 2. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this objective as proposed for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(6)(i) and for elig ible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(5)(i). Proposed Measure: We proposed two measures for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs for this objective. Both of the measures must be met in order for the provider to satisfy this objective: 1. Implement five clinical decision support inte rventions related to fi ve or more clinical quality measures at a relevant point in patient care for the entire EHR reporting period; and 2. The EP, eligible hospital, or CAH has en abled and implemented the functionality for drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction ch ecks for the entire EHR reporting period. We proposed to make the Stage 1 objectiv e for \"implement drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks\" one of the measures of the CDS objective for Stage 2. Based on the HIT Policy Committee's recommendation, we proposed th at each CDS intervention must enable providers to review all of the following attr ibutes for the interven tion: developer of the intervention, bibliographic citation, funding s ource of the intervention, and the release or revision date of each intervention. The ONC st andards and certification criteria final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register provides additional information regarding the incorporati on of the CDS in CEHRT . We proposed that pr oviders must implement the CDS intervention at a relevant point in pa tient care when the intervention can influence clinical decision making before an action is take n on behalf of the patient. We proposed that providers must implement five CDS interventions that they believe will result in improvement in performance for five or more of the clinical qu ality measures on which they report. If none of the clinical quality measures is applicable to an EP's scope of practice, the EP should implement 109 a CDS intervention that he or she believes will be effective in improving the quality, safety, or efficiency of patient care. Comment : Many commenters noted that at le ast one of the CDS interventions implemented should be tied to efficiency goals (for example, reducing the overuse of high-cost procedures). Response : While we believe that it is entirely possible for a CDS intervention to improve both the quality of care and improve healthcare efficiency, we agree with the suggestion that at least one intervention could be tied directly to improving the efficient use of healthcare resources. In considering whether a CDS interv ention increases healthcare efficiency, providers can consider improvements in any healthcare pr ocess. Some examples, of CDS interventions that may lead to improvements in healthcare e fficiency include, alerts when duplicate tests, procedures or treatments are ordered for the sa me patient, using clinical guidelines for direct patient care processes, documentation templates to reduce variability in recording and alerting when outside of specified parameters, and usi ng evidence based pre-spec ified order sets for blood products. Therefore, we are modifying th e proposed CDS measure such that four of the CDS interventions are related to four or more CQMs, and the fifth CD S intervention should be related to improving healthcare effi ciency. We clarify that any of the five CDS interventions may be related to both CQMs and improving healthcare efficiency. Comment : Various comments were received in response to the proposed number of CDS interventions that are related to five or mo re CQMs. One commenter noted the potential for improved provider reporting and user efficiencies due to the inherent measure associations. Several commenters welcomed this improved alignment of CQM meas ures and reporting between the EHR Incentive Program and othe r CMS quality programs. Other commenters 110 expressed the difficult burden for specialists an d others who may not be able to identify sufficient CQMs related to their patient populat ion. Still other comments suggested that providers could easily implement double th e number of proposed CDS interventions. Response : Overall comments were supportiv e of the proposed number of CDS interventions and of aligning th ese interventions with CQM reporting. If none of the clinical quality measures are applicable to an EP's scope of practice, the EP s hould implement a clinical decision support intervention that he or she believes will be effective in improving the quality, safety or efficiency of patient care. We believe that the propos ed clinical quality measures for eligible hospitals and CAHs w ould provide ample opportunity for implementing clinical decision support interventions related to high-pr iority health conditions. Comment : Commenters also supported continuing the requirement for provide rs to enable and implement drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks fo r the entire reporting period under the new CDS measure. An AHA Survey indicated that 73 percent of hospita ls could perform the drug/drug and drug/allergy check, as well as at least one a dditional clinical de cision support function in the Fall of 2011. Response : We appreciate the commenters' overall support for consolidating this Stage 1 objective into one of the require d clinical decision support meas ures. We also agree that drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks are important CDS t ools contributing to improvements in patient safety and the overall quality of patient care. Comment : Additional comments addressed con cerns regarding the point at which professionals will be able to exercise clinical judgment about the CDS intervention before action is taken on behalf of the patient. The specific concern is that some interventions are only triggered when an action is about to be taken, and proposed that CMS re vise this criterion to \"before or at the time an action is taken.\" 111 Response : We agree with the commenter that provi ders should be allowed the flexibility to determine the most appropriate CDS interven tion and timing of the CDS. The CDS measure for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs allows th is flexibility by allowing the implementation at a \"relevant point in patient care.\" We clarify th at the CDS implementation criterion which allow for CDS implementation at a relevant point in pa tient care includes interv entions that may occur before or at the time an action is taken in the care delivery process. Comment : Several commenters expressed concern with \"alert fatigue\" associated with increased use of clinical decisi on support interventions. These commenters cited studies that suggest that multiple alerts may be disabled or ig nored resulting in adverse effects in the quality of care and patient safety. Response : We recognize that \"alert fatigue\" is a potential oc currence with the increased use of some types of clinical decision support interven tions. However, meaningful use seeks to leverage the capabilities of CEHR T to improve patient care. The selection of CDS interventions should weigh both the potential for unintended cons equences including alert fatigue against the benefits of each CDS intervention, and the approp riate selection of an intervention type that interferes minimally with the pr ovider's clinical workflow and cognitive burden. We believe such determinations are best left to providers. CDS is included as a meaningful use objective because we believe that the overall benefit of CDS is to improve patient safety and the quality of care. Therefore, we will continue to require the implementation of clinical decision support interventions in order to achieve meaningful use. Finally, as defined in the ONC standards and certification criteria final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , CDS is \"not simply an alert, notification, or explicit care suggestion.\" While some alerts may be helpful and necessary, we encourage EPs and hospitals to consider the selection of CDS interventions 112 that are not alerts in order to reduce the burden of alert fatigue. Examples of non-alert CDS may include patient or disease specific order sets , referential decision support (presentation or availability of clinical refere nce information such as diagnostic guidance, dosing guidelines, or lab value interpretation assistance, or patient or disease specific documentation forms/templates that remind the provider to capture essential hist orical or physical exam findings for a patient with a certain condition). A common exam ple of a CDS form/template would be a documentation form that is presented for patients w ith diabetes that includes a required section for the diabetic foot exam, where the same form would be presented for pa tients without diabetes and with the diabetic foot exam section removed. Comment: Several commenters requested the fl exibility to be able to change CDS interventions at any po int during the reporting pe riod so that in effect they would not be implementing the CDS intervention during the entire reporting period. Commenters cited provider uncertainty at the beginning of a reporti ng period of which CQMs they will ultimately report during the attestation process (for exampl e, due to low counts for the measures). Many commenters requested the additional flexibility fo r providers to be permitted to implement CDS interventions relevant to any of the finalized panel of clinical quality measures specific to the provider type, even if the provi der ultimately chooses different clinical quality measures to report. Commenters requested the opportunity to change CDS interventions during the reporting period and not be penalized for the CDS measure that requires the intervention during the entire reporting period. Commenters al so wanted clarification whet her they have to align CDS interventions with the same CQM measur es reported for meaningful use. Response : We expect providers to align CDS interventions with CQMs to the extent possible, although we recognize th at providers may not know at the beginning of a reporting 113 period which CQMs they will end up selecting to report. Based on the comments, we clarify that EPs and hospitals may implement CDS interventions that are related (as defined in the proposed rule) to any of the clinical qua lity measures for EPs and hosp itals, respectively, and that are finalized for the EHR Incentive Program for the re levant year of reporting. In other words, providers are not required to implement CDS inte rventions that are related to the specific CQMs that they choose to report for th at year. Providers who are not able to identify CQMs that apply to their scope of practice or patient populati on may implement CDS interventions that they believe are related to high-priority health condit ions relevant to their patient population and will be effective in improving the quality, safety or efficiency of patient care. We will require providers to implement a minimum of five CD S interventions for the entire EHR reporting period. The provider may switch between CDS in terventions or modify them during the EHR reporting period as long as a mi nimum of five are implemente d for the entire EHR reporting period. We expect that providers may choose to implement a greater num ber of interventions from which they can select five interventions that have been enabled for the entire EHR reporting period when they atte st to meaningful use. Comment : Several providers recommend to be allowed to use their clinical judgment regarding which clinical decisi on support interventions would best benefit patients within the scope of their practice. Response : We thank providers for this comment a nd want to clarify that in Stage 1; CMS allowed providers significant leeway in determ ining the clinical suppor t interventions most relevant to their scope of practice. In Stage 2, we will continue to provide the flexibility for providers to identify high-priority health conditions th at are most appropriat e for CDS. As we stated in the proposed rule, for Stage 2 we w ill not require the provider to demonstrate actual 114 improvements in performance on clinical quality measures for this objective. Because CQMs focus on high-priority health condit ions by definition, to the extent possible, four of the five CDS interventions that are implemented must be rela ted to CQMs. Providers are also reminded that the CDS interventions selected for Stage 2 repres ent only a floor. We expect that providers will implement many CDS interventions, and providers are free to choose interventions in any domain that is a priority to th e EP, eligible hospital or CAH. Comment : Several commenters voiced concer n that CDS interventions must be predetermined at the beginning of an EHR reporti ng period but providers do not have to choose CQMs until the end of the attesta tion reporting period. There is c oncern that providers will be unable to change the CDS interven tions if they decide to change the related CQMs in a reporting period. Response : We proposed alignment with CQMs to facilitate provider reporting and measurement, but as we clarifie d earlier, providers ar e allowed the flexibility to implement CDS interventions that are related to any of the CQMs that are finalized for the EHR Incentive Program. They are not limited to the CQMs they c hoose to report. Providers who are not able to identify CQMs that apply to their scope of practice or patient population may implement CDS interventions that they believe are related to hi gh-priority health conditions relevant to their patient population and will be effective in improving the quality, safety or efficiency of patient care. These high priority conditions must be determined prio r to the start of the EHR reporting period in order to implement the appropriate CDS to allow for improved performance. We require a minimum number of CDS interventi ons, and providers must determine whether a greater number of CDS interv entions are appropriate fo r their patient populations. Comment : Commenters supported the inclusion of drug-drug and drug-allergy checks 115 noting that they are critical to ensuring the safety of the medications prescribed for patients, and agree with the inclusion of this measure. Othe r commenters noted the lack of an for EPs who do not prescribe medications and t hus would not be able to me et this core set objective. Response : We received similar feedback after p ublication of the Stage 1 final rule and after careful consideration of the comments, we will allow an exclusion to this measure for EPs that write fewer than 100 me dication orders during the EHR reporting period. We did not include this exclusion as a change to Stage 1 as this is primarily an implementation of a function of CEHRT and there is no requirement to update CEHRT in 2013. This exclusion aligns with the exclusion under the objective CPOE for medicat ion orders discussed ear lier in this rule. Comment : There were several comments regard ing the implementation of CDS and the attributes required for each intervention. Comm enters did not believe that the information requested in order to support the inclusion of CDS attributes would be available to many providers, particularly for provide rs in a group practice. Commenter s also requested clarification whether these attributes would be required for drug-drug and drug- allergy interactions. Other commenters requested additional clarification re garding the extent that CDS attributes are required when the interventions re sult from self-generated eviden ce. Other comments addressed provider concerns regarding th e need to purchase additional expensive vendor products and upgrades to incorporate these requirements. Response : We appreciate the many comments fo r the proposed CDS attributes. We clarify that the need for inclus ion of attributes for each CDS in tervention also applies to drug- drug and drug-allergy interventions as well as interventions based on self-generated evidence. The companion ONC standards and certification cr iteria final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register further describes CEHRT requireme nts for these CDS attributes in 116 order to ensure that all users of CEHRT w ill have access to this new functionality. After consideration of the public comments and for the reasons discussed earlier, we are modifying the measures for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(6)( ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(5)(ii) as follows: Implement five clinical decision support inte rventions related to f our or more clinical quality measures at a relevant point in patient care for the en tire EHR reporting period. Absent four clinical quality measures re lated to an EP, eligible hospita l or CAH's scope of practice or patient population, the clinical decision support inte rventions must be rela ted to high-priority health conditions . It is suggest ed that one of the five clinical decision support interventions be related to improving healthcare efficiency. The EP, eligible hospital, or CAH has en abled and implemented the functionality for drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction ch ecks for the entire EHR reporting period. Exclusion: For the second measure, any EP who writes fewer than 100 medication orders during the EHR reporting period. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(8) and (a)(2). Replaced Objective: Provide patients with an el ectronic copy of their health information. Replaced Objective: Provide patients with an el ectronic copy of their discharge instructions. For Stage 2, we did not propose the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives for EPs and hospitals to provide patients w ith an electronic copy of their health information and discharge 117 instructions upon request. As we stated in the proposed rule, the HIT Policy Committee recommended that these objectives be combined with the objectives fo r view online, download, and transmit. We agreed with the HIT Policy Committee and proposed to replace the Stage 1 objectives above with objectives and measures for Stage 2 that w ould enable patients to view online and download their health information and hospital admission information. We stated that continued online access to such information is more useful and provide s greater accessibility over time and in different health care environm ents than a single elect ronic transmission or a one-time provision of an electronic copy, especially when that acce ss is coupled with the ability to download a comprehensive point in time record. We received no comments that supported the re tention of these objec tives for Stage 2. Therefore, we are finalizing the replacement of th ese objectives for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs as proposed. Please refer to the discussi ons later in this rule regarding view online, download, and transmit objectives for both EPs a nd eligible hospitals and CAHs for more information about the Stage 2 objectives that replace these Stage 1 objectives. Proposed EP Objective: Provide clinical summaries for patients for each office visit. In the proposed rule, we outlined the followi ng benefits of providing clinical summaries for patients for each office visit: A summary of an office visit provide s patients and their families with a record of the visit. This record can prove to be a vital reference for the patient and their caregivers about their he alth and actions they should be taking to improve their health. Without this reference, the patient must either recall each detail of the vi sit, potentially missing vital information, or contact the provider after the visit. Ce rtified EHR technology enables the provider to create a summary easily and in many cas es instantly. This capa bility removes nearly all of the barriers that exis t when using paper records. 118 As noted in the proposed rule, clinical su mmaries for each office visit are important because without this reference the patient must e ither recall each detail of the visit, potentially missing vital information, or contact the provider af ter the visit. We also noted that this is a meaningful use requirement, whic h does not override an individua l's broader right under HIPAA to access his or her health information. Providers must continue to comply with all applicable requirements under the HIPAA Privacy Ru le, including the access provisions of 45 CFR 164.524. However, none of the HIPAA access requirements preclude an EP from releasing electronic copies of c linical summaries to their patients as required by this meaningful use provision. For Stage 2, we proposed this as a core objective for EPs. Comment : Some commenters believed that this objective should be eliminated because the same information would be made available through the objective to \"Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transmit their health information.\" Other commenters suggested combining these objectives with a co ncomitant rise in the measure threshold. Response : While it is true that there may be overlap between the information in the clinical summary and the information made availa ble through the objective to \"Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transm it their health information,\" we believe the clinical summary after an office visit serves a different purpose than online access to health information. A summary of an office visit provides patients and their families with a record of the visit and specific lab tests or specific follow-up actions and treatment related to the visit. While this information is certainly part of th e patient's overall electr onic health record, the clinical summary serves to highli ght information that is relevant to the patient's care at that particular moment. Therefore, we declin e to eliminate or combine the objective. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use 119 objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(11)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measure: Clinical summaries provided to patients within 24 hours for more than 50 percent of office visits. In the proposed rule, we proposed to mainta in several policies re garding this objective from Stage 1. As we stated, for purposes of m eaningful use, an EP could withhold information from the clinical summary if they believe substa ntial harm may arise from its disclosure through an after-visit clinical summary. An EP coul d also choose whether to offer the summary electronically or on paper by defa ult, but at the patient's reque st must make the other form available. The EP could select any modality (f or example, online, CD, USB) as their electronic option and would not have to accommodate requests for different modalities. We also stated in the proposed rule that we do not believe it would be appropriate for an EP to charge the patient a fee for providing the summary. Finally, we stated that when a single consolidated summary is provided for an office visit that lasts for several consecutive days , or for an office visit where a patient is seen by multiple EPs, that office vis it must be counted only once in both the numerator and denominator of the measure. We are finaliz ing all of these policies for Stage 2 as proposed. Comment : Many commenters suggested that th e measure should be changed from \"24 hours\" to \"1 business day.\" Other commenters believed that this timeframe was too short, especially for specialty provide rs who might not come into the office every day, and suggested either changing the timeframe to 48 hours or re verting to the 72-hour measure of Stage 1. Another commenter noted that delays past 24 hours can sometimes occur outside of the provider's control\u2014for example, in the case of new patients where the provider might not have access to adequate previous records. Response : We believe that Certified EHR tec hnology enables the provider to create a 120 summary with the required information easily and in most cases instantly. The feedback we have received on this objective in Stage 1 through discussions with provide rs indicates that most providers make this clinical summary available as patients leave the office visit, and we expect this workflow to continue for most providers . Therefore a longer timeframe of 48 or 72 hours should not be necessary for providing clinical summaries. We also note that the clinical summary contains information rele vant to the patient's office vi sit and therefor e the EP should not need to include information from previous records for most patients. However, we believe the threshold of more than 50 pe rcent of office visits allows EPs to meet the measure of this objective despite these challenges for a small num ber of patients. We also agree that the measure should be changed from \"24 hours\" to \"1 business day\" since all providers may not have staff available to issue clinical summaries prior to the close of a work week or the beginning of a Federal holiday. Therefore, we are finalizing the change from \"24 hours\" to \"1 business day.\" Comment : A number of commenters raised ques tions regarding the provision of the clinical summary. They asked whether the summary should be given automatically to each patient or whether offering the summary at the e nd of an office visit was sufficient to meet the measure. Commenters also asked whether patien ts who refused a copy of the clinical summary should be counted in the numerator of the measure. Response : It is the intention of this objective that clinical summaries be automatically given to patients within 1 busin ess day of an office visit. However, we do recognize that some patients may decline a physical c opy of their clinical summary. In the event that a clinical summary is offered to and subsequently declined by the patient, that patient may still be included in the numerator of the measure. We note that the clinical summary mu st be offered to the patient; a passive indication of th e clinical summary's availability (for example, a sign at the 121 reception desk, a note in form, etc.) would not se rve as offering the clinical summary and those patients could not be counted in the numerator of the measure. However, the clinical summary does not necessarily need to be printed before being offered to the patient. Comment : Commenters asked whether making clin ical summaries available on a patient portal or as part of the objectiv e to \"Provide patients the abil ity to view online, download, and transmit their health information\" would meet th e measure of this objective. Some commenters suggested that patients should be permitted to de mand an electronic copy of clinical summaries where an EP has chosen to provide them in hard copy form. Response : We are continuing our policy from Stag e 1 that the clinical summary can be provided through a patient portal or through other electronic means to satisfy this measure. A clinical summary provided thr ough the same means that the provider makes other patient information available to meet the objective to \"P rovide patients the ab ility to view online, download, and transmit their health information\" w ould also meet the measure of this objective. As stated previously, an EP can choose whether to offer the summary electronically or on paper by default, but at the patient's request must make the other form available. The EP could select any modality (for example, online, CD, USB) as their electronic option and would not have to accommodate requests for different electronic modalities. Comment : Some commenters suggested that this measure shoul d be based on the number of unique patients seen by the EP instead of office vis its. Other commenters suggested that the threshold for the measure should be reduced. Response : We do not agree that the measure sh ould be based on unique patients. The purpose of the clinical summary is to provide patie nts and their authorized representatives with a record of an office visit and specific lab tests or specific follow-up actions and treatment related 122 to that visit. Nor do we agree that the percentage threshold of this measure should be reduced. We note that the threshold for this measure in Stage 1 was also 50 percent; any reduction would constitute a step backward for the meaningful use of this capability. Comment : Some commenters suggested that EPs should be permitted to charge a fee for provision of a clinical summary. Response : Because the clinical summary is mean t to summarize the office visit and any lab tests, follow-up actions, or tr eatments related to that visit, we do not believe it is appropriate for an EP to charge patients additional fees for its provision. Also, because this is a meaningful use requirement for the incentivized provider and not a response to a patient request, we do not believe it is appropriate for an in centivized provider to charge the pa tient. This is consistent with our position for this objectiv e in Stage 1 (75 FR 44358). Comment : Commenters suggested that clinical summaries provided to patient-authorized representatives should also be counted for this measure. Response : We agree that the provision of a clinical summary to a patient-authorized representative should also be counted, and we have amended the measure accordingly. Comment : Many commenters believed that the list of required elements to be included in the clinical summary was excessive and not useful to the patient. Commenters suggested that the list be shortened or left to the provider's discretion. Additionally, many commenters asked for clarification on whether certain fi elds could be left blank and s till permit the EP to meet the measure of this objective. Fina lly, a number of commenters sugge sted that this objective should focus on whether the summary is provided and not on required information since CEHRT cannot distinguish between information not provided in a clinical summary because it is not relevant or because a provider has exercise d discretion to withhold it. 123 Response : This measure is focused on the prov ision of the clinical summary. The clinical summary represents a patient's current ca re and health as a snapshot in time. When provided, we believe it can significantly improve a patient's overall awar eness of the care they are receiving as well as any conditions they may need to manage between office visits. The required information listed at the end of this se ction are provided as a way to standardize and prioritize for the purposes of EHR technology cer tification the minimum amount of information that must be available to EPs to select. Further, we believe that the info rmation in this minimum list is the most applicable and be neficial to improving patient care. This is a list of information, not a particular structure or format for the summary handed to the patient. We have no requirements on the design of the summary just the information that must be present if it is in the CEHRT. The design of the summary should refl ect the context of the visit. For example, the information of future appoint ments, referrals to other providers, future scheduled tests, and clin ical instructions could all appear in a section of the summary called \"Next steps\". If all of these information areas were empty th en \"next steps\" could just be none and all the feeding information elements would be covered. Alternatively, if the summary is provided on letterhead that incl udes the office location and the pr ovider's name that information does not have to be repeated in the text of th e summary. We cannot empha size enough that this is required information for the summary not a pa rticular required structure for the summary. We do not believe that the list of required info rmation imposes an undue burden on providers because CEHRT will be able to automatically genera te the clinical summary with at least all of the required information. In ONC's rule it has included in the certi fication criterion that correlates to this objective the capability for e nd-users to customize (f or example, edit) the clinical summary to make it more relevant to the patient encounter. 124 In circumstances where there is no informati on available to populate one or more of the fields previously listed, either because the EP can be excluded from recording such information (for example, vital signs) or because there is no information to record (for example, no medication allergies or laboratory te sts), an indication that the info rmation is not available in the clinical summary would meet the measure of this objective. The feedback we have received on this objective in Stage 1 through discussions with providers indicates that the absence of information in the clinical su mmary sometimes offers an oppor tunity for rec onciliation of misinformation; for example, if \"no medication alle rgies\" is listed but the patient has one, he or she may communicate that to the pr ovider, thus improving the quality of the data in the EHR. We do note that the measure of this objective already focuses on provision of the clinical summary and is not specific to the information wh ich is provided within the clinical summary; the list of required elements is meant to standa rdize the information given to patients, not to create an additional measure for the objective. We also refer providers to our discussion of wh at constitutes an office visit. Many of the concerns we have heard regarding this summary are the result of misunde rstandings about what constitutes an office visit. For example, in so me cases removing sutures or giving allergy shots do not represent an office visit if that is the only service provided. Comment : Commenters asked for clarification on \"current problem list and any updates,\" \"current medication list and any updates,\" and \"current medication allergy list and any updates,\" since updates would be included in any current probl em list. They suggested simplifying these requirements to \"current problem list;\" \"current medication list;\" and \"current medication allergy list\". Response : We agree that including the language \"and any updates\" is redundant since a 125 current problem, medication, or medication allergy list would al ready include updated information. We are amending this language in th e list of required elements below. However, the clinical summary should incl ude both a current problem list and any diagnosis specifically related to the office visit as sepa rate fields. The diagnosis rela ted to the office visit should be expressed in the \"Reason for the patient's vis it\" field, though it may al so be included in the current problem list. We note that this is cons istent documentation availa ble in the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), which defi nes the \"Reason for the patient's visit\" field as the provider's description of the reason for visit and the \"Chief complaint field\" as the patient's own description. Comment : Commenters asked for clarification on \"vital signs and any updates\" and suggested simplifying this requiremen t to \"Vitals taken during visit\". Response : While we agree that vital signs taken during the visit would be most useful in the clinical summary, we also recognize that al l vital signs may not be updated at each office visit. Therefore, we are amending this languag e to \"Vital signs taken dur ing the visit (or other recent vital signs)\" in the list of required elements below. Comment : Commenters asked us to clarify if th e requirement relating to the inclusion of laboratory test results applies only to test results av ailable at the time of the office visit or to test results that become available after the clinical summary is issued. Response : By laboratory test results, we mean for the clinical summary to include results that are available at the time the clinical summary is issued to the patient. As we stated in the proposed rule, clinical summaries can quickly become out of date due to information not available to the EP at the end of the visit. Th e most common example of this is laboratory test results. We believe that EPs should make this information known to the patient when the results 126 are available, but do not require that a new clinical summary must be issued when information needs to be updated. Comment : Commenters asked us to clarify if th e list of diagnostic tests pending indicates diagnostic tests that have been scheduled or diagnostic tests for whic h results are not yet available. Response : Diagnostic tests pending refers to di agnostic tests that have been performed but for which results are not yet available. Laboratory or diagnostic tests that have been scheduled but not yet performed should be record ed under \"Future scheduled tests\" in the list of required elements later in this section. Comment : Some commenters asked us to define clinical instru ctions. Other commenters asked if the instructions include d as part of the care plan we re redundant with the \"clinical instructions\" element in the list of required information. Response : By clinical instructions we mean car e instructions for the patient that are specific to the office visit. Alt hough we recognize that these clini cal instructions at times may be identical to the instructions included as part of the care plan, we also be lieve that care plans may include additional instructions that are meant to address long-term or chronic care issues, whereas clinical instructions sp ecific to the office visit may be related to acute patient care issues. Therefore, we maintain these as separate items in the list of required elements later. Comment : A commenter noted that future appoint ments and future scheduled tests might be stored in a scheduling syst em that is separate from CE HRT and suggested that if the information is not available in CE HRT that the EP be excluded from having to provide it as part of the clinical summary. Response : As noted previously, in circumstance s where there is no information available 127 to populate one or more of the fi elds previously listed, either because the EP can be excluded from recording such information (for example, v ital signs) or because there is no information to record (for example, no medication allergies or laboratory tests), an indication that the information is not available in the clinical summ ary would meet the measur e of this objective. This would also be true if the info rmation is not accessible through CEHRT. Comment : Commenters asked for clarification regarding demographics \"maintained by EP.\" Specifically, they asked whether the EP was required to enter demographics or whether these could be maintained by a member of his or her staff. Response : By demographics we mean the demogr aphics maintained within CEHRT. We do not intend to specify that only the EP can en ter such information into the EHR; demographic information can be entered into CEHRT by any person or through any elec tronic interface with another system. Therefore, we are amendi ng the language to \"Demographic information maintained within CEHRT\" in our list of required elements later in this section. Comment : In regard to the inclusion of \"car e plan field\" in th e list of required information, some commenters believed that the wording was overly prescriptive since CEHRT could utilize multiple fields to structure care plans. Other commenters requested a more detailed definition of care plan. Response : We agree that the language proposed c ould be viewed as prescriptive, and we do not intend to limit the inclusion of the care plan to a single field. Therefore, we are amending the language to \"Care plan fiel d(s), including goals and instruc tions\" in our list of required elements below. However, we decline to prov ide an alternate definition that would limit the information in the care plan. We believe that the definition we proposed in the proposed rule is sufficient to allow for the inclusion of a variet y of care plans in the clinical summary. For 128 purposes of the clinical summary, we define a car e plan as the structur e used to define the management actions for the various conditions, probl ems, or issues. A care plan must include at a minimum the following components: problem (t he focus of the care plan), goal (the target outcome) and any instructions that the provider has given to the patient. A goal is a defined target or measure to be achieved in the pr ocess of patient care (an expected outcome). Comment : Some commenters asked for clarific ation about what is meant by patient decision aids. Response : By patient decision aids we mean a ny educational resource or tool that the provider believes can inform pa tient decisions about their own care. An example is an educational handout on the pros and cons of having surgery for a particular condition. Comment : Some commenters noted that because EHRs capture medical data, they will produce clinical summaries with medical te rminology, whereas patients should receive summaries with nonmedical terminology and desc riptions of both medi cations and lab test results that are easy to read and contain actionable items. Response : While we agree that clinical summaries with nonmedical terminology and extended descriptions would be most beneficial to pa tients, we also believe that the utility of this objective must be balanced against the potential burden it places on EPs. Since clinical summaries can be automatically generated fr om existing data in CEHRT, this removes significant workflow barriers to providing a summary for patients. We believe that requiring providers or their staff to render all information in the clinical summary into nonmedical terms at this time would impose a significant burden on pr oviders and reduce the number of clinical summaries that providers make available to pati ents, thereby reducing the effectiveness of this objective. However, we note that most of the information that is required as part of the clinical 129 summary should be easily understandable by most pa tients. Also, there is nothing to prevent an EP from providing additional inform ation if he or she believes it would be more effective for the overall quality of patient care. We further note that we anticipate that the capabilities of CEHRT may soon allow for the provision of non-medical terminology and extended descriptions and we are considering adding this requirement in future stages of meaningful use. Comment : One commenter noted that the clinical summary c ontains a vast amount of protected health information (PHI) which could be compromised if patients discard the clinical summary insecurely. The commenter suggested requiring the clinical summary only for those patients who affirm they want it to eliminate any provider responsibility for security of the information. Response : We do not believe that making protected health information available to patients in any way compromises ei ther patients or provi ders. On the contrary, we believe that offering this information is critical to improvi ng the overall quality of patient care by offering specific follow-up instructions, test results, and care plan informati on to patients so that they can actively participate in their own care. We believe that providers can take steps to inform patients about the need to securely dispose of PHI, a nd we further note that making clinical summaries available electronically through an online portal or other means can be used to keep such PHI secure. Therefore, we decline to ch ange the measure for this objective. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use measure for EPs as \"Clinical summaries prov ided to patients or patient-authorized representatives within 1 busin ess day for more than 50 percent of office visits\" at \u00a7495.6(j)(11)(ii). We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the 130 capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(e)(2). We clarify that the following information (or an indication that there is no information available) is required to be part of the clinical summary for Stage 2: Patient name. Provider's name and office contact information. Date and location of the visit. Reason for the office visit. Current problem list. Current medication list. Current medication allergy list. Procedures perfor med during the visit. Immunizations or medications administered during the visit. Vital signs taken during the vis it (or other recent vital signs). Laboratory test results. List of diagnostic tests pending. Clinical instructions. Future appointments. Referrals to other providers. Future scheduled tests. Demographic information maintained with in CEHRT (sex, race, ethnicity, date of birth, preferred language). Smoking status Care plan field(s), incl uding goals and instructions. 131 Recommended patient decision aids (if applicable to the visit). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of office visits conduct ed by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : Number of office visits in the denominator where the patient or a patient-authorized representative is provided a clin ical summary of their visit within 1 business day. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who has no office visi ts during the EHR reporting period. Removed Objective: Capability to exchange key clinical information. In Stage 2, we proposed to move to actual us e cases of electronic exchange of health information through the following objective: \"The EP, eligible hospital or CAH who transitions their patient to another setting of care or provider of care or re fers their patient to another provider of care should provide su mmary care record for each transiti on of care or referral.\" We also proposed to remove this objective for St age 1 as well, but requested comments on other options. Please refer to the section titled \"Change s to Stage 1\" at II.A.3.b. of this final rule for details of the options considered. We are finalizing the removal of this objective as proposed in favor of the more robust, actual use case of electronic exchange through a summary of care record following each transition of care or referral. We believe that this actual use case is not only easier for providers to unders tand but it is also more bene ficial because it contributes directly to the care of the pa tient through enhanced coordinati on between providers. A prudent 132 provider will be preparing and testing to conduct actual exchange prior to the start of Stage 2 during their Stage 1 EHR reporting periods. Proposed Objective : Protect electronic health information created or maintained by the CEHRT through the implementation of appropriate techni cal capabilities. In the proposed rule, we outlined the following benefits of protecting health information: Protecting electronic health information is essent ial to all other aspects of meaningful use. Unintended and/or unlawful disclosures of personal health information could diminish consumers' confidence in EHRs and electronic h ealth information exchange. Ensuring that health information is adequately protected and s ecured will assist in addr essing the unique risks and challenges that may be presen ted by electronic health records. Comment : A number of commenters supported the continued inclusion of this objective, yet several commenters requested the elimina tion of this objective as redundant to HIPAA regulations. Response : We believe that it is crucial that EP s, eligible hospitals, and CAHs evaluate the privacy and security implications of CE HRT as part of the EHR Incentive Programs, particularly as they pertain to 45 CFR 164.308( a)(1) and the protection and safeguarding of personal health information in general. Theref ore, we retain this objective and measure for meaningful use in the final rule. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(16)(i ) and eligible hospitals a nd CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(15)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure: Conduct or review a security risk analysis in accordance with the requirements under 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1), including a ddressing the encryption/security of data 133 at rest in accordance with requirement s under 45 CFR 164.312 (a)(2)(iv) and 45 CFR 164.306(d)(3), and implement security updates as necessary and correct identified security deficiencies as part of the provi der's risk management process. In the proposed rule, we explaine d that this measure is the same as in Stage 1 except that we specifically address the encryption/security of data is that is stored in CEHRT (data at rest). Due to the number of breaches reported to HHS involving lost or stolen devices, the HIT Policy Committee recommended specifically highlighting the importance of an entity's reviewing its encryption practices as part of its risk analysis. We agree that th is is an area of security that appears to need specific focus. Recent HHS analysis of reported breaches indicates that almost 40 percent of large breaches involve lost or st olen devices. Had these devices been encrypted, their data would have been secured. It is for these reasons that we specifically call out this element of the requirements under 45 CFR 164.308(a )(1) for the meaningful use measure. We did not propose to change the HIPAA Security Ru le requirements, or require any more than is required under HIPAA. We only emphasize the impor tance of an EP or hospital including in its security risk analysis an assessment of the reasonable and appropriateness of encrypting electronic protected health information as a mean s of securing it, and wh ere it is not reasonable and appropriate, the adoption of an equivalent alternative measure. We proposed this measure because the implementation of CEHRT has privacy and security implications under 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1). A review must be conducted for each EHR reporting period and any security updates and defici encies that are identif ied should be included in the provider's risk management process and im plemented or corrected as dictated by that process. In the proposed rule, we emphasized that our discussion of this measure and 134 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1) is only releva nt for purposes of the meani ngful use requirements and is not intended to supersede what is separately required under HIPAA and other rulemaking. Compliance with the HIPAA requirements is out side of the scope of this rulemaking. Compliance with 42 CFR Part 2 and state mental h ealth privacy and confidentiality laws is also outside the scope of this rulemaking. EPs, elig ible hospitals or CAH affected by 42 CFR Part 2 should consult with the Substance Abuse a nd Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) or state authorities. Comment : Some commenters asked if the Stag e 2 requirements for this objective contradict earlier Stage 1 requi rements and HIPAA regulations. Specifically, the addition of addressing encryption/security of data at rest to the measure was raised as a concern. Response : We do not believe that the Stage 2 meas ure of this objective contradicts either the Stage 1 measure or current HIPAA regulations. As noted in the propo sed rule, this measure is the same as in Stage 1 except that we specifica lly highlight the encryption/ security of data that is stored in CEHRT (data at rest). Recent HHS analysis of reported breaches indicates that almost 40 percent of large breaches (breaches aff ecting 500 or more individuals) involve lost or stolen devices. Had these device s been encrypted, their data would have been secured. It is for these reasons that we specifica lly call out this requirement under 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1). We did not propose to change the HIPAA Security Rule requirements, or require any more under this measure than is required under HIPAA. We onl y emphasize the importance of an EP or hospital including in its security risk analysis an a ssessment of the reasonable and appropriateness of encrypting electronic protected health information as a means of securing it, and where it is not reasonable and appropriate, the adoption of an equivalent alternative measure. Comment : Several commenters asked for clarification of what constitutes an acceptable 135 security risk analysis. Commenters also asked if the security risk an alysis required in the measure should apply to health data stored in data cente rs with physical security. Response : We did not propose to change the HI PAA Security Rule requirements or impose additional requirements under this measure than those required unde r HIPAA. A review must be conducted for each EHR reporting period and any security updates and deficiencies that are identified should be included in the provider's risk management process and implemented or corrected as dictated by that process. We refer provide rs to the requirements under 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1), including addre ssing the encryption/security of data at rest in accordance with requirements under 45 CFR 164.312 (a)(2)( iv) and 45 CFR 164.306(d)(3), of the HIPAA Security Rule for compliance. The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued guidance on conducting a security risk assessment pur suant to the HIPAA Security Rule (http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/h ipaa/administrative/security rule/rafinalguidancepdf.pdf ). The scope of the security risk anal ysis for purposes of this meani ngful use measure applies only to data created or maintained by CEHRT. This meas ure does not apply to data centers that are not part of CEHRT. However, we note that such data centers may be s ubject to the security requirements under 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1) and refer pr oviders to the HIPAA Security Rule for compliance information. Comment : One commenter asked if the measure of the objective required hospitals to report on data encryption methods. Response : No, eligible hospitals and CAHs are not required to report to CMS or the states on specific data encryption methods use d. However, they are required to address the encryption/security of data at rest in accordance with requirements under 45 CFR 164.312(a)(2)(iv) and 45 CFR 164.306(d)(3). 136 Compliance with 42 CFR Part 2 and state mental health privacy and confidentiality laws is also outside the scope of this rulemaking. EPs, eligible hospitals or CAH affected by 42 CFR Part 2 should consult with the Subs tance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) or state authorities. We are making a change in this final rule to the language of \"data at rest\" to specify our intention of data that is stored in CEHRT. After consideration of th e public comments, we are finalizing the meaningful use m easure as \"Conduct or review a security risk analysis in accordance with the requirements under 45 CF R 164.308(a)(1), including addressing the encryption/security of data stored in CEHRT in accordance with requirements under 45 CFR 164.312 (a)(2)(iv) and 45 CFR 164.306(d)(3), and implement security updates as necessary and correct identified security deficienci es as part of the provider's risk management process\" for EPs \"at \u00a7495.6(j)(16)(ii) and elig ible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(15)(ii). We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(d)(1) through 170.314(d)(8). (b) Objectives and Measures Carried Over (Modi fied or Unmodified) from Stage 1 Menu Set to Stage 2 Core Set We signaled our intent in the Stage 1 final rule to move the objectives from the Stage 1 menu set to the Stage 2 core set. The HIT Po licy Committee also recommended that we move all of these objectives to the core set for Stage 2. We propos ed to include in the Stage 2 core set all of the objectives and associated measures from the Stage 1 menu set, except for the objective \"capability to submit electronic syndromic surveilla nce data to public hea lth agencies\" for EPs, which will remain in the menu set for Stage 2. As discussed later, we also proposed to modify 137 and combine some of these objectives and associated measures for Stage 2-- Consolidated Objective: Implement drug formulary checks. For Stage 2, we proposed to include this objective within the core objective for EPs \"Generate and transmit permissibl e prescriptions electronically (eRx)\" and the menu objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs of \"Generate and transmit permissible discharge prescriptions electronically (eRx).\" We believe that drug formul ary checks are most useful when performed in combination with e-prescribing, wh ere such checks can allow the EP or hospital to increase the efficiency of care and benefit the patient financ ially. We address the comments related to these proposals and state our final pol icy in the discussions of the eRx objectives for EPs and hospitals. Proposed Objective : Incorporate clinical lab test resu lts into CEHRT as structured data. We propose to continue the policy from Stage 1 to incorporate clinical lab test results into CEHRT as structured data. We believe this m easure contributes to th e exchange of health information between providers of care, facilitate s the sharing of information with patients and their designated representatives, and may reduce order entry errors which will contribute to patient care improvements. We did not receive any comments for this obj ective. We are finalizing the meaningful use objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(7 )(i) and eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(6)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure : More than 55 percent of all clinical lab tests results ordered by the EP or by authorized providers of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emergency depart ment (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period whose results are either in a positive/negative or numerical format are incorporated in CEHRT as 138 structured data. We proposed to increase the measure threshold from more than 40 percent for Stage 1 to more than 55 percent for Stage 2. We also solic ited public comment regard ing the feasibility of continuing to account for individual lab tests separately from group and panel tests. In addition, we solicited comment on whether standards and ot her capabilities would al low for the expansion of this measure to include all quantitative lab results. Comment : Many of the commenters voiced their c oncern that not all EHRs are capable of splitting out individual test results from panel te sts and that it would not be feasible to require this for Stage 2 of meaningful use. Other co mmenters suggested modifying the current measure to use the number of laboratory test results in the EHR as the numerator and the total laboratory test results from the Lab Information System as the denominator. Others questioned the validity of the current measure that counts orders in the denominator and results in the numerator. Another comment is that not all providers have access to a lab interface system and not all lab interfaces are compatible Response : We appreciate the many comments and suggestions submitted regarding this measure which were carefully considered as we developed the final regulation. Some commenters questioned the measure validity sugges ting that the measure is imperfect since the numerator and denominator are incongruent. Ho wever, in considering the broader policy goal underlying this measure (to incorporate lab resu lts into CEHRT in a standard format) the measure needs to be broad enough to allow provider s to incorporate laborato ry orders and results from multiple service providers. By incorporating all lab orders (whether panel or individual) in the denominator, and all lab test results in the numerator, providers will be able to capture structured lab data from a broad range of pr ovider laboratory information systems into the 139 CEHRT. We understand that the most likely scenar io is that the denominator of total lab orders (if panel orders are counted as one) will be less than the numerator of laboratory results because results are provided for each individual test rather than by panel. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the measure would impact a provider's abil ity to meet the increased threshold in this scenario. Providers will need to continue to report individual lab test results recorded as structured data in the numerator, and in the denominator report all individual lab-te sts ordered whether or not they are ordered individually or as part of a panel or group la b order. For example, one panel order of ten individual lab tests could be counted as 1 or 10 lab tests ordered in the denominator depending on the system that is used to incorpor ate this data into the CEHRT. We will monitor provider experience with this m easure as technological capacity for the reporting and exchange of lab data continues to evolve. Comment : Other commenters mentioned uncertain ty regarding the proper vocabulary to use for the incorporation of lab test results in a structured format. Several commenters went on to mention that there is not one current vocabulary that encompasses all types of tests. Another comment proposed that CMS work to amend the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) to require hospital labs to report result s in standard vocabulary such as the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes System (LOINC) by the time St age 2 is implemented in 2014. Response : We refer readers to the ONC standard s and certification criteria final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register for vocabulary specifications. Comment : Many commenters were confused by th e clarification CM S provided in the proposed rule for expanding the measure to all qu antitative results (all results that can be 140 compared on as a ratio or on a difference scale). Comments were mixed on whether this measure should include all types of lab tests that produce quantitative results. One commenter suggested CMS should allow ordinal responses for the meas ure since that is what LOINC uses as the response rather than counting test results with either a positive, negative or numeric response since operationally, counting tests based on whet her or not they have two allowed answer choices is difficult, where counti ng tests based on whether the LO INC code for them had a Scale of QN or Ord would be quite simple. Another commenter suggested most people would assume that \"numeric/quantitative test s\" would include decimals and w hole numbers as well as results reported in a range (for example, >7.4 or <150) and ratios such as also tite r levels (for example, 1:128). Response : We appreciate the number of comme nts regarding an expansion of the existing measure as well as further clarif ication. Based on both CMS and companion ONC comments received, we clarify that the measure in corporate all numeric/quantitative tests that report whole or decimal numbers. The structured data for the numeric/quantitative test results may include positive or negative affirmations and/or numerical format that would include a reference range of numeri c results and/or ratios. Comment : Most commenters agreed that the incr ease measure threshold is appropriate. One commenter referenced a recent AHA survey that found \"60 percen t of hospitals could perform this function in Fall 2011 at the raised threshold\". Response : Our analysis of the Stage 1 attestatio n data shows that 91.5 percent of EPs and 95 percent of eligible hospitals and CAHs were able to successf ully demonstrate meaningful use for this measure. Therefore, combined with the AHA survey data results, we will adopt the proposed threshold of 55 percent or more for this measure. 141 After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we modify the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(7)(ii) and eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(6)(ii) to: More than 55 percent of all clinical lab test s results ordered by the EP or by authorized providers of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR re porting period whose results are either in a positive/negative affirmation or numerical format ar e incorporated in CEHRT as structured data. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(5). Denominator : Number of lab tests ordered du ring the EHR reporti ng period by the EP or by authorized providers of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) whose results are expressed in a positive or negative affirmation or as a number. Numerator : Number of lab test results which ar e expressed in a positive or negative affirmation or as a numeric result which are incorporated in CEHRT as structured data. Threshold: The resulting percentage must be more than 55 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who orders no lab test s where results are either in a positive/negative affirmation or numeric format during the EHR reporting period. There is no exclusion available for eligib le hospitals and CAHs because we do not believe any hospital will ever be in a situation where its authori zed providers have not ordered any lab tests for admitted patients during an EHR reporting period. Proposed Objective : Generate lists of patients by sp ecific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of dispar ities, research, or outreach. 142 In the proposed rule, we outlined the following benefits of generating lists of patients by specific conditions: Generating pa tient lists is the first step in proactive management of populations with chronic conditions and is critical to providing acc ountable care. The ability to look at a provider's entire population or a subset of that population brings insight that is simply not available when looking at patients individuall y. Small variations th at are unnoticeable or seem insignificant on an individual basis can be magnified when multiplied across a population. A number of studies have show n that significant improvements result merely due to provider awareness of population level information. We belie ve that many EPs and eligible hospitals will use these reports in combination with one of the selected quality measures and decision support interventions to improve quality for a high priority issue (for ex ample, identify patients who are in the denominator for a measure, but not the nume rator, and in need of an intervention). The capabilities and variables used to generate the lists are defi ned in the ONC standards and certification final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register ; not all capabilities and variables must be used for every list. We have combined the comments and responses for this objective with the measure below. After consideration of the public co mments, we are finalizing the meaningful use objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(8)(i) and eligible hosp itals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(7)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure : Generate at least one report li sting patients of the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH with a specific condition. We proposed to continue our Stage 1 polic ies for this measure. The objective and measure do not dictate the specific report(s) that must be generate d, as the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH is best positioned to determine which reports are most useful to their care efforts. The 143 report used to meet the measure can cover every patie nt or a subset of patients. We believe there is no EP, eligible hospital, or CAH that could no t benefit their patient pop ulation or a subset of their patient population by using such a report to identify opport unities for quality improvement, reductions in disparities of patient care, or for pur poses of research or patient outreach; therefore, we did not propose an exclusion for this measure. The report can be generated by anyone who is on the EP's or hospital's staff during the EHR reporting period. We al so solicited comment on whether a measure that either increases the num ber and/or frequency of the patient lists will further the intent of this objective. Comment : Most commenters voiced support for the objective and measure and wish it to remain unchanged in the final rule, although some commenters stated that the measure should only require demonstration that a list can be created and not requi re a certain number of patient lists until the needs to create certain pa tient lists are better ascertained. Response : We appreciate the support for this objective, and we note that the measure of the objective remains unchanged from Stage 1. Dem onstration only of the capability to generate lists of patients by specific conditions would represent a step backward from the Stage 1 measure, therefore we do not agree that this w ould be an appropriate m easure for Stage 2. We also believe there is ample evid ence to support the use of patient lists in a variety of quality improvement efforts. Comment : Some commenters suggested that the measure requirements should be increased, either to require more than one repor t be generated during th e EHR reporting period or to require that the report generate d is linked to one of the EP's or eligible hospital's clinical decision support interventions. Another commente r suggested that the measure should indicate how the list should be used. 144 Response : We believe that moving the objective fr om the menu set to the core represents an adequate increase for Stage 2. We also contin ue to believe that an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH is best positioned to determine which reports are most useful to their care efforts. Therefore, we do not propose to di rect certain reports be create d or link reports to clinical decision support interventions at this time. Comment : Some commenters suggest ed that lists should be generated according to specific clinical conditions or in clude specific elements, such as demographics, to aid analysis. One commenter wanted to know whether EPs retain fl exibility in deciding the lists they generate, particularly in coordinating public health activities with state and local public health departments and Medicaid agencies. Another commenter suggested that the m easure of the objective specify the continuous use of the report throughout the EHR reporting period. Response : As noted previously, we are continuing our policy fr om Stage 1 that an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH is best positioned to determine which reports are most useful to their care efforts. Therefore, we do not propose to direct certain repor ts be created, nor do we require that specific conditions or elemen ts be required for the reports. Also, we do not set requirements for the frequency of use of the report. Comment : A commenter asked us to clarify whether the EP must generate the patient list or if the patient list could be generated by a me mber of the EP's staff in order to meet the measure. Response : For this and most meaningful use objectives, we do not specify how information must be entered into CEHRT or who must complete the required action to meet the measure. Therefore an EP or a member of the EP 's staff could generate the list and meet this measure. The exception to this rule is fo r computerized provider order entry (CPOE) of 145 medication, laboratory, and radiology orders, wh ich must be entered by a licensed healthcare professional per state, local, and professional guidelines. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(8)(ii ) and eligible hosp itals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(7)(ii) as proposed. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(14). Proposed EP Objective: Use clinically relevant information to identify patients who should receive reminders for preventive/follow-up care. In the proposed rule, we described the fo llowing benefits of this objective. By proactively reminding patients of preventive and follow-up care needs, EPs can increase compliance. These reminders are especially bene ficial when long time lapses may occur as with some preventive care measures and when symptoms subside, but additional follow-up care is still required. We also proposed to revise this objective for Stage 2 to \"Use clinically relevant information to identify patients who should rece ive reminders for preventive/follow-up care\" based on the HITPC recommendation. An EP should use clinically relevant information stored within the CEHRT to identify patients who should receive reminders. We believe that the EP is best positioned to decide which information is clinically relevant for this purpose. Comment : A commenter stated that the language in the proposed objecti ve is in conflict with the proposed measure. The proposed objective is to \"Use clinically relevant information to identify patients who should receive reminders for preventive /follow-up ,\" with no indication that the reminder be sent. However, the proposed measure refers to \"patient who had an office 146 visit and were sent a reminde r, per patient preference.\" Response : We agree with the commenter that the objective as proposed only speaks to the identification of the need for the reminder and that the proposed measure requires that the reminder be sent. The value of this objective is created when the reminder is sent to the patient and therefore, we revise the objective accordingly. Comment : Commenters requested request clarif ication of the operative definition of \"reminder.\" Remembering to keep the appointment is an important first step to follow-up and preventive care and ther efore should be counted. Response : We believe that reminders should be li mited to new actions that need to be taken not of actions that are already taken. For example, a reminder to schedule your next mammogram is a reminder to take action, whil e a reminder that your next mammogram is scheduled for next week is a remi nder of action already taken. If we were to allow for reminders of existing scheduled appointments then every pr ovider could meet this objective and measure without any patient ever lear ning new information. So we clarify that reminders for preventive/follow-up care should be for care that the patient is not already scheduled to receive. Reminders are not necessarily just to follow up with the reminding EP. Reminders for referrals or to engage in certain activities are also included in this ob jective and measure. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e modifying the objective at \u00a7495.6 (j)(9)(i) to \"Use c linically relevant info rmation pati ents who should receive reminders for preventive/follow-up care and se nd these patients the reminders, per patient preference.\" Proposed EP Measure: More than 10 percent of all unique patients who have had an office visit with the EP within the 24 months prior to the be ginning of the EHR reporting period 147 were sent a reminder, per patient preference. In Stage 1, the measure of this objective wa s limited to more than 20 percent of all patients 65 years old or older or 5 years old or younger. Rather than raise the threshold for this measure, the HIT Policy Committee recommende d lowering the threshold but extending the measure to all active patients. We proposed to ap ply the measure of this objective to all unique patients who have had an office visit with the EP within the 24 months pr ior to the beginning of the EHR reporting period. We believe this no t only identifies the popul ation most likely to consist of active patients, but also allows the EP flexibility to identify patients within that population who can benefit most from reminders. We solicited comments on the appropriateness of this timeframe. We also recognize that some EPs may not conduct face-to-face encounters with patients but still provide treatment to patients. These EPs could be unintentionally prevented from meeting this core objective under the measure requirements, so we proposed an exclusion for EPs who have no office visits in order to accommodate such EPs. Patient preference refers to the met hod of providing the reminder. Comment : Commenters expressed concern that even with the proposed revisions many patients in the denominator might not requir e a reminder. One example given was some colonoscopies are done on a schedule of once ever y ten years. Another example provided was specialists who see some patients only for one-time consults. Suggestions by commenters to deal with patients in the denominator who do not require reminders invo lve either much more precise measurement such as tracking and following up when CEHRT identifies the need for a patient reminder, to specific exclusions of certa in visit types in the measure or to move the requirement to the menu set. Others suggest ed that providers who do not typically send reminders be sent granted exclusions. 148 Response : We agree that not every active pati ent will require a reminder during the EHR reporting period, which is why the threshold is far below 100 percen t. We believe that a low threshold of 10 percent is the best way to account for the contextually specific reasons a patient might not be sent a reminder. We proposed an exclusion for EPs who would typically not send reminders, specifically those withou t office-based visits. This may not include all providers who do not typically send reminders, but as an exclusion must contain definitive criteria we believe it is a good exclusion. We did not receive in comment s precise criteria for an alternative exclusion. Comment : We received many comments as to what constitutes an active patient in a practice. Many voiced the opini on that given the 24 month l ook back period in a typical practice, many patients would have moved to a nother practice. One suggestion given for an alternate way to count patients was to change the de finition of \"active patients\" to be either three or more visits in 24 months or two or mo re visits in 12 months. Other commenters recommended that the time limitation be removed. Response : We proposed active patients as a met hod to limit the denominator to patients more likely to require a reminder. The goal is to limit the denominator as much as possible without excluding patients who should receive a reminder. After reviewing the comments, we change the look back to patients wi th at least two office visits in the last 24 months. We believe this better establishes a relati onship between the provider and th e EP. This would account for those specialists that do not have continuing relationships with their patients, but rather hand their care back to th e referring provider. Comment : Several commenters raised concerns with the requirement that it be per patient preference. They asked for clarification on the definition of \"per patient preference\". Specifically commenters asked if patient prefer ence referred to whether the patient wanted 149 reminders or what method of communication th ey wanted to receive the reminders. Second, clarification is requested on how providers should document thes e preferences. Third, there is concern that an insufficient number of patients will have their preferences recorded at the start of the EHR reporting period and if so, any met hod of communication should suffice for those patients. Response : We clarify that patient preferen ce is the method of communication that patients prefer to receive their reminders such as (but not limited to) by mail, by phone or by secure messaging. Given the look back period associ ated with this measure, we agree that it is not feasible to have all patient preferences r ecorded prior to the st art of the EHR reporting period. Therefore, we clarify that reminders mu st be sent using the preferred communication medium only when it is known by the provider. Th is is limited to the type of communication (phone, mail, secure messaging, etc.) and does not ex tend to other constraints like time of day. Patients may decline to provide their prefer red communication medium in which case the provider may select the communication medium. A patient may also decline to receive reminders. We believe that this will be rare enough that comb ined with the 10 percent through, patients declining to receive reminders will not affect the ability of an EP to meet this measure. It is our expectation that providers will begin to co llect this information and that in the future as the look back period catches up to the publication of this final rule it will become possible to require that all reminders be se nt per patient preference. We do not specify how things are documented beyond the capabilities and standards included in CEHRT. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e modifying the measure at \u00a7495.6 (j)(9)(ii) to \"More than 10 percent of all un ique patients who have had 2 or more office visits with the EP within the 24 months before the beginning of the EHR reporting period were 150 sent a reminder, per patient preference when available.\" We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(14). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients who have had two or more office visits with the EP in the 24 months prior to th e beginning of the EHR reporting period. Numerator : Number of patients in the denomin ator who were sent a reminder per patient preference when availabl e during the EHR reporting period. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 10 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusion: Any EP who has had no office visi ts in the 24 months before the EHR reporting period. Proposed EP Objective: Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transmit their health information within 4 business days of the information being available to the EP. In the proposed rule, we stated that the goal of this objective was to allow patients easy access to their health information as soon as possi ble so that they can make informed decisions regarding their care or share their most recent clinical information wi th other health care providers and personal caregivers as they see fit. In addition, we noted that this objective aligns with the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs),3 in affording baseline privacy protections 3 In 1973, the Department of Health, Educat ion, and Welfare (HEW) released its report, Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens , which outlined a Code of Fair Information Prac tices that will create \"safeguard requirements\" for certain \"automated personal data systems\" maintained by the Federal Government. This Code of Fair Information Practices is now commonly referred to as fair information practice principles (FIPPs) and established 151 to individuals.4 In particular, the principles includ e Individual Access (patients should be provided with a simple and timely means to a ccess and obtain their individually identifiable information in a readable form and format). We indicated that this objective replaces the Stage 1 core objective for EPs of \"Provide patients with an electronic copy of th eir health information (including diagnostic test results, problem list, medication lists, me dication allergies) upon request\" and the Stage 1 menu objective for EPs of \"Provide patients wi th timely electronic access to their health information (including la b results, problem list, medication lists, and allergies) within 4 business days of the information being availa ble to the EP.\" The HIT Policy Committee recommended making this a core objectiv e for Stage 2 for EPs, and we agreed with their recommendation consistent with our policy of moving Stage 1 menu objectives to the core set for Stage 2. Consistent with the Stage 1 require ments, we noted that th e patient must be able to access this information on demand, such as through a patient portal or personal health record (PHR). However, we noted that providers should be aware that while meaningful use is limited to the capabilities of CEHRT to provide online access there may be patients who cannot access their EHRs electronically because of their disabil ity. Additionally, other health information may not be accessible. Finally, we noted that provi ders who are covered by civil rights laws must provide individuals with disabili ties equal access to information and appropriate auxiliary aids and services as provided in the ap plicable statutes and regulations. Comment : Some commenters suggested that this object ive should be part of the menu set the framework on which much privacy policy will be built. There are many versions of the FIPPs; the principles described here are discussed in more detail in The Nationwide Privacy and Secu rity Framework for Electronic Exchange of Individually Identifiable Health Information , December 15, 2008. http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/community/h ealthit_hhs_gov__privacy___security_framework/1173. 4 The FIPPs, developed in the United Stat es nearly 40 years ago, are well-esta blished and have been incorporated into both the privacy laws of many states with regard to government-held records4 and numerous international frameworks, including the development of the OECD's privacy guidelines, the European Union Data Protection Directive, and the Asia-Pacific Ec onomic Cooperation (APEC) Privacy Framework.http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/com munity/healthit_hhs_gov__privacy___security_framework/1 173. 152 instead of a core objective for Stage 2. This w ould permit EPs who do not believe they can meet the measure at this time to select different objectives. Response : We do not agree that this objective s hould be part of the menu set. We proposed this objective as part of the core for EP s because it is intended to replace the previous Stage 1 core objective of \"Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request\" and the Stage 1 menu obj ective of \"Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information.\" Although CEHRT w ill provide added capabilities for this objective, we do not believe the objective itself is sufficien tly different from previ ous objectives to justify placing it in the menu set. Also, we believe th at patient access to their electronic health information is a high priority for the EHR Incen tive Programs and this objective best provides that access in a timely manner. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed the opinion that this objective should not be included as part of meaningf ul use and was more appropria tely regulated under HIPAA and through the Office for Civil Rights. Response : We do not agree that this objective should not be incl uded in meaningful use. Although we recognize that many issues concerning th e privacy and security of electronic health information are subject to HIPAA requirements, we believe that establishing an objective to provide online access to health information is within the regulatory purview of the EHR Incentive Programs and consistent with the statutory requirements of meaningful use. Comment : Some commenters suggested that this object ive should be combined with the objective to \"Provide clinical su mmaries for patients after each o ffice visit\" since much of the information provided in these objectives is identical. Response : While it is true that there may be ove rlap between the information provided in 153 the clinical summary and the information made av ailable through this obj ective, we believe the clinical summary after an office visit serves a different purpose than online access to health information. A summary of an office visit provides patients and their fam ilies with a record of the visit and specific lab tests or specific follow-up actions and treatment related to the visit. While this information is certainly part of th e patient's overall electr onic health record, the clinical summary serves to highli ght information that is relevant to the patient's care at that particular moment. Therefore, we decline to combine the two objectives. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(10)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measures: We proposed two measures for this objective, both of which must be satisfied in order to meet the objective: More than 50 percent of all unique patie nts seen by the EP dur ing the EHR reporting period are provided timely (within 4 business days after the information is available to the EP) online access to their health in formation subject to the EP's discretion to withhold certain information. More than 10 percent of all unique patie nts seen by the EP dur ing the EHR reporting period (or their authorized repr esentatives) view, downl oad or transmit to a third party their health information. Exclusions: Any EP who neither orders nor creates any of the information listed for inclusion as part of this meas ure may exclude both measures. Any EP that conducts 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters in a c ounty that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 4Mbps broadband availability according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EHR reporting period may exclude only the second 154 measure. As we stated in the proposed rule, tran smission can be any means of electronic transmission according to any transport standard(s ) (SMTP, FTP, REST, SOAP, etc.). However, the relocation of physical elec tronic media (for example, USB, CD) does not qualify as transmission although the movement of the info rmation from online to the physical electronic media will be a download. Comment : Some commenters suggest ed that the timeframe fo r the first measure should be expanded to 7 days, since the data required to be provided in order to meet the measure of this objective would sometimes be incomplete only 4 days after the patient's visit. Other commenters suggested the timeline for the firs t measure should be shortened to 2 business days or 24 hours. Response : We do not agree that the timeframe fo r the measure should be lengthened. In the Stage 1 menu objective of \"Provide patients with timely electronic ac cess to their health information,\" we established the measure for prov iding access within 4 business days. Also, we believe that most of the informa tion required by this measure, except for lab tests, will be readily available within the specified time period. Howeve r, we also believe th at 24 hours or 2 business days would not provide adequate time to make all information av ailable online. Therefore, we maintain the requirement of making inform ation available within 4 business days. Comment : Some commenters asked for clarifica tion on whether online access had to be made available using CEHRT or if the informa tion could be made available through other means (patient portal, PHR, etc.). Response : Both of the measures for this objective must be met using CEHRT. Therefore, for the purposes of meeting this objective, the cap abilities provided by a patient portal, PHR, or any other means of online access and that would permit a patient or authorized 155 representative to view, download, or transmit their personal health information would have to be certified in accordance with th e certification requirements adopted by ONC. We refer readers to ONC's standards and certification cr iteria final rule that is publis hed elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Comment : A commenter asked how long data shoul d be made available online before it can be removed. In a related topic, anothe r commenter asked which provider would be responsible for excluding data from shari ng when multiple providers share CEHRT. Response : It is the goal of this objective to make available to the pa tient both current and historical health information. Therefore, we w ould anticipate that the data should be available online on an ongoing basis. However, an EP ma y withhold or remove information from online access if they believe substantial harm may arise from its disclosure online. In regard to withholding data and which provi der should be responsible for making the determination when multiple providers share CEHRT, we would exp ect that providers sharing the CEHRT would make a joint determination regarding the informati on to be withheld. Therefore, we leave this decision to the providers' discretion. Comment : Some commenters asked for clarif ication on how access by the patient is defined. Response : We define access as having been given when the patient possesses all of the necessary information needed to view, downloa d, or transmit their information. This could include providing patients with instructions on how to access their health information, the website address they must visit for online access, a unique and registered username or password, instructions on how to cr eate a login, or any other instructions, tools, or materials that patients need in order to view, download, or transmit their information. 156 Comment : Some commenters suggested that patients under the age of 18 should not have the same access to the same information to wh ich adult patients have access and requested a separate list of required elements for patients under the age of 18. Response : An EP may decide that online access is not the appropriate forum for certain health information for patients under the age of 18. Within the confines of the laws governing guardian access to medical records for patients under th e age of 18, we would defer to the EP's judgment regarding which information should be wit hheld for such patients. In lieu of providing online access to patients under th e age of 18, EPs could provide online access to guardians for patients under the age of 18, in accordance with state and local laws, in order to meet the measure of this objective. Providing online access to guardians in accordance to state and local laws would be treated the same as access for patient s, and guardians could then be counted in the numerator of the measure. We recognize that st ate and local laws may restrict the information that can be made available to guardians, and in these cases such information can be withheld and the patient could still be counted in the numerator of the measure. No requirement of meaningful use supersedes any federal, state or local la w regarding the privacy of a person's health information. Comment : Some commenters suggested that specialists should transmit information to the patient's primary care provider rather than pr oviding online access to information in order to reduce the number of portal s a patient must visit, wh ich could cause confusion. Response : We believe that much of this information will be transmitted between providers as part of the summary of care record following a transiti on of care. However, we also believe there is value to the patient in having onl ine access to this information for all providers they visit, including specialists. Therefore, we maintain this measure for all EPs. 157 Comment : Many commenters voiced objections to the second measure of this objective and the concept of providers being held acc ountable for patient actions. The commenters believed that while providers could be held ac countable for making information available online to patients, providers could not control whethe r patients actually acce ssed their information. Many commenters also noted that the potential barriers of limited internet access, computer access, and patient engagement with health IT for certain populations (for example, rural, elderly, lower income, visually impaired, non-En glish-speaking, etc.) might make the measure impossible to meet for some providers. There we re also a number of comments stating that metrics used to track views or downloads can be misleading and are not necessarily the most accurate measure of patient usage. Commenters suggested a number of possible solutions to allow providers to overcome these barriers, including eliminating th e percentage threshold of the measure or requiring providers to offer and track patient access but not requiring them to meet a percentage measure in order to demonstrate meaningful use. However, some commenters believed that the measure was a reasonable and n ecessary step to ensure that providers had accountability for engagement of their patients in use of electronic he alth information and integration of it into clinical practice. In addition, commenters pointed to the unique role that providers can play in encouraging and facilitating their patients' and their families' use of online tools. Response : While we recognize that EPs cannot directly cont rol whether patients access their health information online, we continue to believe that EPs are in a unique position to strongly influence the technologies patients use to improve thei r own care, including viewing, downloading, and transmitting their health informati on online. We believe that EPs' ability to influence patients coupled with the low threshol d of more than 10 per cent of patients having 158 viewed online, downloaded, or transmitted to a thir d party the patient's health information make this measure achievable for all EPs. We recognize that certain patient populations face greater challenges in online access to health information. We address the potential ba rrier of limited internet access in the comment regarding a broadband exclusion below. We addr ess the potential barrier to individuals with disabilities through ONC's rules requiring that EH Rs meet web content accessibility standards. While we agree that excluding certain patient popul ations from this requ irement would make the measure easier for EPs to achieve, we do not kno w of any reliable method to quantify these populations for each EP in such a way that we co uld standardize exclusions for each population. We also decline to eliminate th e percentage threshold of this measure because we do not believe that a simple yes/no attestation for this objectiv e is adequate to encourage a minimum level of patient usage. However, in considering the pot ential barriers faced by th ese patient populations, we agree that it would be appropriate to lower the proposed threshold of this measure to more than 5 percent of unique patients who view onlin e, download, or transmit to a third party the patient's health information. In addition, we ar e concerned that blanket exclusions for certain disadvantaged populations could serv e to extend existing disparities in electronic access to health information and violate civil rights laws. A ll entities receiv ing funds under this program are subject to civil rights laws. For more informa tion about these laws and their requirements (see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/index.html ). We believe that this lower threshold, combined with the broadband exclusion detailed in the resp onse that follow, will allow all EPs to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : Some commenters suggested an alte rnate definition of the second measure based on the number of patients seen within the la st 2 years that access their health information 159 online. Response : We believe that the current numerat or and denominator for this measure encourage the active online access by patients of their health information. We further believe that broadening the time period of this measure to patients seen within th e last 2 years does not encourage both EPs and current patients to use online access to health in formation in the active management of their care, which is one of the goals of the EH R Incentive Programs. Therefore, we decline to adopt this s uggested alternate definition. Comment : Some commenters asked for clar ification on how view is defined. Response : We define view as the patient (or authorized representa tive) accessing their health information online. Comment : Some commenters noted that the potential financia l burden of implementing an online patient portal to provide patients online access to health information. These commenters noted the added time burden for staff in handling the additional patient use of online resources, which may increase costs through the hiri ng of additional staff, as well as the need to modify their existing workflow to accommodate additional online messages from patients. Some commenters also believed that th ere would be an additional cost for sharing content before standards exist for content types and formats. Response : We do not believe that implementing online access for patients imposes a significant burden on providers. While we note that in some scenarios it may be possible for an EP to receive reimbursement from privat e insurance payers for online messaging, we acknowledge that EPs are genera lly not reimbursed for time spent responding to electronic messaging. However, it is also true that EPs ar e generally not reimbursed for other widely used methods of communication with pati ents (for example, telephone). As we noted in the proposed 160 rule, many providers have seen a reduction in time responding to inquires and less time spent on the phone through the use of health IT, including online messages from patients. We expect the same will be true for online access to health information by reducing continuous requests for health records, test results, a nd other pertinent patient informati on. Finally, we believe that the standards established for this objective by ONC w ill serve as a content standard that will allow this information to be more easily transmitted and uploaded to another certified EHR, thereby reducing additional costs. Comment : Some commenters noted th at patient engagement coul d occur effectively with or without online access, and patients should be encouraged to use any method (for example, telephone, internet, traditional mail) that suits them. These commenters noted that engagement offline reduces both the need and value for engagement online. Response : We agree that patient engagement can occur effectively th rough a variety of media, and we also believe that electronic access to health information can be an important component of patient engagement. We do not belie ve that offline engagement reduces the need for online access, as patients may opt to access info rmation in a variety of ways. Because of the variety of ways that patients/families may access information, we keep the threshold for this measure low. We also note that online access to health information can enhance offline engagement\u2014for example, patients could download information from an office visit with their primary care provider to bring w ith them for a consult with a specialist\u2014which is one of the primary goals of the EHR Incentive Programs. Comment : Some commenters expresse d concern that vendors woul d not be able to make these capabilities available as part of CE HRT in time for the beginning of Stage 2. Response : Many CEHRT vendors already make patien t portals available that would meet 161 the certification cr iteria and standards required for this measure. In fact, many vendors have already incorporated these capabili ties into their CEHRT products in order to meet the measure of the Stage 1 objective to \"Provide patients with timely electronic acc ess to their health information.\" Although the Stage 2 measure requi res some additional capabilities, we believe vendors will be able to make these capabilities available in time for the beginning of Stage 2. Comment : Some commenters request ed clarification on the ex clusion regarding an EP \"who neither orders nor creates any of the informa tion listed for inclusion as part of this measure may exclude both measures.\" Because the list of required elements for this measure includes the patient's name, provider's name, and office contac t information, these commenters suggested that no EP could qualify for this exclusion. Response : We amend the wording of the excl usion to accommodate providers who do not order or create any of the information lis ted, except for patient name, provider name, and office contact information. Comment : Some commenters suggested that ba sing an exclusion on the broadband data available from the FCC website (www.broadband.gov ) was suspect since the data originates from vendors. Response : The broadband data made available from the FCC was collected from over 3,400 broadband providers nationwide. This data was then subject to ma ny different types of analysis and verification methods, from drive testing wireless broadband service across their highways to meeting with community leaders to receive feedback. Representatives met with broadband providers, large and small, to confirm data, or suggest changes to service areas, and also went into the field looking for infrastructure to validate service offerings in areas where more information was needed. Therefore, we beli eve the data is appropriate for the exclusion to 162 this measure. We note that si nce publication of our proposed rule the website has changed to www.broadbandmap.gov and the speed used has changed from 4Mbps to 3Mbps. We are updating our exclusion to reflect these changes. Comment : Some commenters believ e that broadband exclusions should be based on the patients' locations instead of the providers, si nce county-level data may not be granular enough to capture all areas of low broadband av ailability within a particular region. Response : Although we agree that a broadband exclusion based primarily on the individual locations of each patient seen would be more accurate, we do not believe that there is any method of making this determination for ev ery patient without placing an undue burden on the provider. We continue to believe that lim ited broadband availability in the EP's immediate practice area, coupled with the low threshold of this measure, adequa tely serves as an acceptable proxy for determining areas where online access can present a challenge for patients. Therefore, we retain the broadband exclusion as proposed. Comment : Some commenters requested a clarification of the required element of \"Any additional known care team members beyond the re ferring or transitioni ng provider and the receiving provider.\" Response : With this element we mean for provi ders to indicate the names and contact information for any other health care professionals known to the EP. This could include referring providers, receiving pr oviders, or any other provider insi de or outside the EP's practice that provides care to the patient. We are ame nding the language for this required element to \"Any known care team members.\" Comment : Some commenters suggest ed that growth charts should not be included for either download or transmission, since these charts are simply visualizations of the height and 163 weight data elements. Response : We believe that growth charts can be a useful tool fo r both patients and providers, especially in instances where a patient may elect to download or transmit their health information to another provider. Therefore, we re quire them to be included to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : One commenter suggested that images should not be include d in the list of required elements to be provided to patients on line. They cited specific difficulties in image viewing online, as well as concerns over file size. Response : We note the commenter's concerns and further note that images are not among the required elements to meet the measure of this objective. After consideration of the pub lic comments, we finalize the first meaningful use measure for EPs as proposed at \u00a7495.6(j)(10)(ii)(A). We finalize the second meaningful use measure for EPs as \"More than 5 percent of all unique pa tients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period (or their authorized repr esentatives) view, downl oad or transmit to a third party their health information\" at \u00a7495.6(j) (10)(ii)(B). We finalize the fo llowing exclusions for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(10)(iii): \"Any EP who neither orders nor creates an y of the information listed for inclusion as part of both measures, except for \"P atient name\" and \"Provider's name and office contact both measures ;\" \"Any EP that conduc ts 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters in a county that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 3Mbps broadband availability according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EHR reporting peri od may exclude only the second measure\". We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(e)(1). 164 To calculate the percentage of the first m easure for providing patient with timely online access to health information, CMS and ONC have wo rked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of patients in the de nominator who have timely (within 4 business days after the information is availa ble to the EP) online access to their health information. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. For the second measure for reporting on the number of unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period (o r their authorized representa tives) who view, download or transmit health information, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of unique patients (or thei r authorized representatives) in the denominator who have viewed online, downloaded, or transmitted to a third party the patient's health information. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 5 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusions : Any EP who neither orders nor creat es any of the information listed for inclusion as part of both measures, except for \"P atient name\" and \"Provider's name and office 165 contact information,\" may exclude both measures. Any EP that conducts 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters in a county that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 3Mbps broadband availability according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EHR reporting pe riod may exclude only the second measure. In order to meet this objective, the followi ng information must be made available to patients electronically within 4 bus iness days of the information be ing made available to the EP: Patient name. Provider's name and office contact information. Current and past problem list. Procedures. Laboratory test results. Current medication list and medication history. Current medication allergy list and medication allergy history. Vital signs (height, weight, bl ood pressure, BMI, growth charts). Smoking status. Demographic information (preferred langu age, sex, race, ethnic ity, date of birth). Care plan field(s), includi ng goals and instructions, and Any known care team member s including the primary care provider (PCP) of record. As we stated in the proposed rule, this is not intended to limit the information made available by the EP. An EP can make available additional information and still align with the objective. In circumstances where there is no in formation available to populate one or more of the fields previously listed, e ither because the EP can be excluded from recording such information (for example, vital signs) or because there is no information to record (for example, 166 no medication allergies or laborator y tests), the EP may have an i ndication that the information is not available and still meet the obj ective and its associated measure. Please note that while some of the information made available through this measure is similar to the information made available in the summary of care document that mu st be provided following transitions of care or referrals, the list of information above is spec ific to the view online, download, and transmit objective. Patients and providers have different information needs and contexts, so CMS has established separate required fields for each of these objectives. Proposed Objective: Use clinically relevant information from Certified EHR Technology to identify patient-speci fic education resources and pr ovide those resources to the patient. In the proposed rule, we explai ned that providing clinically relevant education resources to patients is a priority for the meaningful use of CEHRT. Based on our experience with this objective in Stage 1, we are clarifying that while CEHRT must be used to identify patient-specific education resources, these resources or materials do not have to be stored within or generated by the CEHRT. We are aware that there are many electronic resources available for patient education materials, such as through th e National Library of Me dicine, that can be queried via CEHRT (that is, specific patient char acteristics are linked to specific consumer health content). The EP or hospital should utilize CE HRT in a manner where the technology suggests patient-specific educational resour ces based on the information stor ed in the CEHRT. Certified EHR technology is certified to use the patient's problem list, medica tion list, or laboratory test results to identify the patient-specific educationa l resources. The EP or hospital may use these elements or additional elements within CEHRT to identify educational resources specific to patients' needs. The EP or hospital can then prov ide these educational resources to patients in a 167 useful format for the patient (such as, electr onic copy, printed copy, elec tronic link to source materials, through a patient portal or PHR). In the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44359), we included the phrase \"if appropriate\" in the objective so that the EP or the authorized provider in the hosp ital could determine whether the education resource was useful and relevant to a specific patient. Consistent with the recommendations of the HIT Policy Committee, we proposed to remove the phrase \"if appropriate\" from the objective for Stage 2 because we do not believe that any EP or hospital will have difficulty identifying appropriate patient-specific education resources for the low percentage of patients required by the measure of this objective. We also recognized that provi ding education materials at li teracy levels and cultural competency levels appropriate to patients is an important part of pr oviding patient-specific education. However, we continue to believe that there is not currently wide spread availability of such materials and that such materials could be di fficult for EPs and hospitals to identify for their patients. Comment : Many commenters sought cl arification on the meaning of the term \"identified by CEHRT.\" They questioned how the CEHRT would identify resources and whether the education resources had to be stored in the CEHRT or if it could contain li nks to the materials. Response : We clarified in the proposed rule (77 FR 13720) that while CEHRT must be used to identify patient-specific education resour ces, these resources or materials do not have to be stored within or generated by the Certif ied EHR Technology. We refer readers to ONC's standards and certification criteria final rule th at is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register which describes the capabilities and st andards that CEHRT must include. For patient-specific education materials, this incl udes a general functional capability to identify 168 educational materials as well as a capability to do so using th e HL7 Context-aware Information Retrieval \"Infobutton\" standard. This measure requi res that an EP or hosp ital use the capabilities CEHRT includes to identify patient education materials. To clarify, although CEHRT will include the ability to identify education materials using the HL7 Infobutton standard, such capability alone does not need to be used in orde r to be counted in the numerator (that is, the general capability to identify education materials also c ounts towards the numerator). After reviewing the public comments, we fi nalize the objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(12)(i) and for eligible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(9)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measure: Patient-specific education resour ces identified by Certified EHR Technology are provided to patients for more than 10 percent of all office visits by the EP. In the proposed rule, we noted that the St age 1 measure for this objective for EPs was \"More than 10 percent of all unique patients seen by the EP are provided patient-specific education resources.\" Because we proposed this as a core objective for Stage 2, we proposed to modify the measure for EPs to \"Patient-speci fic education resources identified by CEHRT are provided to patients for more than 10 percent of all office visits by the EP.\" We recognized that some EPs may not conduct face-to-face encounters with patients but still provide treatment to patients. These EPs could be prevented from meeting this core objective under the previous measure requirements, so we proposed to alter the measure to account for office visits rather than unique patients seen by the EP. We also proposed an exclusion for EPs who have no office visits in order to accommodate such EPs. The resources will have to be those identified by CEHRT. If resources are not identified by CEHRT and provided to the pati ent then it will not count in the numerator. We do not intend through this requirement to limit the education resources provided to patient to only those 169 identified by CEHRT. We proposed the threshold at only 10 per cent for this reason. We believe that the 10 percent threshold both ensures that providers ar e using CEHRT to identify patient-specific education resour ces and is low enough to not infr inge on the provider's freedom to choose education resources a nd to which patients these res ources will be provided. The education resources will need to be provided prior to the calculati on and subsequent attestation to meaningful use. Comment : Many commenters expressed concerns about the availability of resources that would be available at the appropr iate literacy level for their patient populations. Some stated that there is a dearth of low-literacy materials ava ilable as most education sites are geared toward college-educated patients; others stated that most materials are designed to be appropriate for a broad spectrum of literacy levels. Some comme nters expressed concerns about the lack of resources available for non-English speaking patien ts. Yet other commenters were unclear as to what appropriate sources of pa tient-specific education would be . Some commenters expressed concerns that another alert within th e system may create physician fatigue. Response : We understand the commenters concer ns that the edu cational materials identified by the CEHRT may not be appropriate for certain patients. To accommodate these concerns, we are maintaining the threshold for this measure at 10 percent. As we stated in our proposed rule and in the Stage 1 Final Rule, we account for these concer ns by maintaining a low threshold for this objective. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed concerns that the CEHRT, not the provider, would \"choose\" which educational resources would be provided to the patient. Response : We cannot define the scope of pr actice and/or appropriate educational resources to be shared with each individual pa tient and will continue to rely on provider 170 determinations based on indivi dual patient circumstances. Comment : Many commenters were concerned that the denominator for the EP measure included the number of office visits by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Commenters agreed with the rationale that EPs might not have the opportunity to provide educational materials to a patient if the pa tient has not had an office visit with the EP, however, commenters also stated that if an EP has a series of office visits with a pati ent, it might not be appropriate to provide education at each visit (f or example, a patient with hear t disease or high blood pressure that would see the EP multiple times during the EHR reporting period). To avoid the potential for presenting redundant information to patients, commenters suggested that the denominator be based on unique patients with office visits. This is consistent with the denominator for eligible hospitals, as that denominator is based on uni que patients admitted. Additionally, commenters noted that counting unique patients is more appr opriate to account for patient-specific education resources that are not provided in the context of an office visit, such as reference materials available from a portal or PHR about a pati ent's medications, conditions, or lab results. Response : We agree with commenters in that c ounting unique patients with office visits during the EHR reporting period for EPs, rather than office visits, is a more appropriate denominator for this measure. A patient with a chr onic disease, such as diabetes or heart disease, may have multiple office visits with an EP during the EHR reporting period. While providing educational resources for these patients is impor tant, presenting the same materials each office visit may prove to be redundant. We encourage EPs to refer educational resources to their patients with multiple visits during the EHR reporting period at their discretion. Additionally, we do maintain that EPs with no office visits during the EHR reporting period can be excluded from this measure. Theref ore, we are finalizing the denominator for this 171 measure as the \"Number of unique patients with office visits seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period.\" Comment : Most commenters agreed that 10 per cent was a reasonable threshold for this measure as it was proposed. Response : We agree with commenters and are fi nalizing 10 percent as the threshold for this measure. It will remain unchanged from Stage 1. After reviewing the public comments, we are finalizing the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(12)(ii) as \"Patient-spe cific education resources iden tified by CEHRT are provided to patients for more than 10 percent of all unique patients with office visits seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period.\" We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(15). To calculate the percentage for EPs, CMS a nd ONC have worked toge ther to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients with o ffice visits seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : Number of patients in the denom inator who were provided patient- specific education resources identifi ed by the Certified EHR Technology. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 10 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who has no office visi ts during the EHR reporting period. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure: More than 10 percent of all unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency departments (POS 21 or 23) 172 are provided patient-specific education re sources identified by Certified EHR Technology. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing the measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(9)(ii) as proposed. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an eligible hospital or CAH must use the capabilities and sta ndards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(15). To calculate the percentage for hospitals, CM S and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency depa rtments (POS 21 or 23) duri ng the EHR reporting period. Numerator : Number of patients in the denomin ator who are subsequently provided patient-specific education re sources identified by CEHRT. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be mo re than 10 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Proposed Objective: The EP, eligible hospital or CAH who receives a patient from another setting of care or provide r of care or believes an encount er is relevant should perform medication reconciliation. In the proposed rule we outlined the followi ng benefits of this objective. Medication reconciliation allows providers to confirm that the information they have on the patient's medication is accurate. This not only assists the provider in their direct patient care, it also improves the accuracy of information they pr ovide to others through health information exchange. In the proposed rule, we noted that that when conducting medi cation reconciliation during a transition of care, the EP, eligible hospi tal or CAH that receives the patient into their 173 care should conduct the medicati on reconciliation. We reiterated that th e measure of this objective does not dictate what information must be included in medi cation reconciliation. Information included in the process of medicatio n reconciliation is appropriately determined by the provider and patient. In the proposed rule we defined medication reconciliation as the process of identifying the most accura te list of all medications that the patient is taking, including name, dosage, frequency, and route, by compari ng the medical record to an external list of medications obtained from a patient , hospital or other provider. We proposed that the electronic exchange of information is not a requ irement for medication reconciliation. Comment : Commenters requested that the defini tion of medication reconciliation should specifically mention over-the-counte r medications, vitamins, herbal or other alternative care medications in the definition. Response : We believe our term medications is expansive and not limiting. We in no way limit what any provider chooses to include or not include in their conduct of a medication reconciliation. As we are focused on the use of CEHRT to assist in medication reconciliation it is not our intent to develop a definitive definition of what medication reconciliation is. Comment : Commenters stated that the objectiv e is so reliant on health information exchange that it should not be moved to core until health informa tion exchange capability increases. Response : Robust health information exchange is certainly of great assistance to medication reconciliation. Howeve r, it is not required for medi cation reconciliation. Nor is electronic health information exchange the only way EHRs can assist with medication reconciliation. So while we belie ve that medication reconciliati on will become easier as health information exchange capability increases, it is not a prerequisite to performing medication 174 reconciliation. After consideration of the co mments received, we are fi nalizing this objective as proposed for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (j)(13)(i) and for elig ible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(10)(i). Proposed Measure: The EP, eligible hospital or CAH performs medication reconciliation for more than 65 percent of transiti ons of care in which the patient is transitioned into the care of the EP or admitted to the elig ible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23). In the proposed rule, we stated that al though the HITPC recommended maintaining this threshold at 50 percent we believed that due to this measure's role in information exchange that we seek to promote through meaningful use a higher measure was appropriate. Based on the performance of providers in Stage 1, we propos ed to raise the meas ure to 65 percent. Comment : If as stated in the proposed rule \"the majority chose to defer this measure in Stage 1,\" commenters asserted that this is insuffi cient information to justify raising the threshold to 65 percent and move the objectiv e to core. Other commenters assert that any measure that moves from menu to core should maintain its St age 1 threshold regardle ss of the particular measure's rate of deferral. Response : After considering the arguments for lowering the threshold to 50 percent and the lack of robust data in support of the pr oposed threshold, we do lower the threshold to 50 percent. For this measure in particular, we ag ree that since most providers chose to defer this measure in Stage 1 the information available on performance from Stage 1 meaningful EHR users is not as robust as for ot her objectives and measures. We do not agree with the comment that all objectives that move fr om menu to core should maintain the same threshold. We believe such a blanket policy would be arbitrary and not properly account for the information available 175 for each objective and measure. For example, if most Stage 1 meaningful EHR users had reported on this measure, there would be a robus t data set of performance on which to judge a threshold. A blanket policy w ould ignore such information. Comment : The denominator of transitions of care during the EHR reporting period for which the provider is the receivi ng part of the transition is impr ecise and therefore difficult to determine, especially when neither the transiti oning provider or patient no tifies the provider of the transition. Response : We addressed this comment earlier in this section in our discussion of meaningful use denominators and provided a minimu m set of specific actions that would indicate a transition of care has occurred. Comment : While the objective speaks to releva nt encounters, these are not included in the measure. This makes measurement difficu lt for those providers that conduct medication reconciliation at more than just transitions of care. If providers were allowed to include these encounters in the measure, measurement would bo th be easier and more representative of the actual use of CEHRT by the provider. Response : We continue to believe that what is a relevant encounter is to variable to be included in the measure for all providers. Howe ver, a provider who institutes a policy for medication reconciliation at en counters encompassing more than just the minimum actions defined by the transitions of care denominator ca n include those encounters in their denominator and if medication reconciliation is conducted at the encounter in the numerator as well. After consideration of the comments, we are modifying the threshold of the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (j)(13)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(10)(ii). The EP, eligible hospital or CAH performs medication reconciliation for more than 50 percent of 176 transitions of care in which the patient is transitioned into the care of the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23). We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(4). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of transitions of car e during the EHR reporting period for which the EP or eligible hospital's or CAH's i npatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) was the receiving party of the transition. Numerator : The number of transitions of care in the denominator where medication reconciliation was performed. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who was not the recipient of any transitions of care during the EHR reporting period. Proposed Objective: The EP, eligible hospital or C AH who transitions their patient to another setting of care or provide r of care or refers their pati ent to another provider of care provides a summary care record for each transition of care or referral. In the proposed rule, we outlined the following benefits of this objective. By assuring lines of communication between providers caring for the same patient, all of the providers of care can operate with better information and more effectively coordinate the care they provide. Electronic health record s, especially when linked direc tly or through health information exchanges, reduce the burden of such communicati on. The purpose of this objective is to ensure 177 a summary of care record is provided to the receiv ing provider when a patient is transitioning to a new provider or has been referred to anothe r provider while remaining under the care of the referring provider. In the proposed rule, we proposed to eliminat e the Stage 1 objective for the exchange of key clinical information for Stage 2 and instead in clude such information as part of the summary of care when it is a part of the patient's electr onic record. We also pr oposed to inco rporate two separate Stage 2 recommendations from the HI T Policy Committee as required fields in the summary of care record-- Record care plan fields, including goals and instructions , for at least 10 percent of transitions of care; and Record team member, including primary car e practitioner, for at least 10 percent of patients. ONC also proposed in their standards and certification criteria rule (77 FR 13848 to include these as standard fiel ds required to populate the summ ary of care document so CEHRT will be able to include this information. We provi ded a description of a \"care plan\" as well as the minimum components it must include for purposes of meaningful use, although we recognized that the actual content would be dependent on the clinical context. We asked for comments on both our description of a care plan and whethe r a description is n ecessary for purpose of meaningful use. We proposed certain elements that are listed in the proposed rule (77 FR 13722) to be included in the summary care document. In circumstances where there is no information available on an element, either because the EP, eligible hospital or CAH can be excluded from recording such information or because there is no information to record, the EP, eligible hospital 178 or CAH may leave the field(s) blank and still m eet the objective and its associated measure. In addition, we proposed that all summary of care documents used to meet this objective must include the following: An up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses. An active medication list, and An active medication allergy list. We proposed that all summary of care documents must contain the most recent and up-to-date information on these three elements to count in the numerator. We proposed to define problem list as a list of curre nt and active diagnoses. We solicited comment on whether the problem list should be extended to include, \"when applicable, functional and cognitive limitations\" or whether a separate list should be included for functional and cognitive limitations. We proposed to define an up-to-date problem lis t as a list populated with the most recent diagnoses known by the EP or hospital. We proposed to define active medica tion list as a list of medications that a given patient is currently taking. We proposed to define active medication allergy list as a list of medicati ons to which a given patient has known allergies. We proposed to define allergy as an exaggerated immune response or reaction to substances that are generally not harmful. In the event that there are no current or active diagnoses for a pa tient, the patient is not currently taking any medications, or the patien t has no known medication a llergies, confirmation of no problems, no medications, or no medication allergies would satisfy the measure of this objective. Note that the inclus ion and verification of these el ements in the summary of care record replaces the Stage 1 objectives for \"Maint ain an up-to-date problem list,\" \"Maintain active medication list,\" and \"Maintain active medication allergy list.\" Comment : Commenters suggested that the requi red data for each type of referral and 179 transitions varies and that rather than creating a list of elements, the provider should decide what is needed. Response : While we agree that tailoring the summ ary of care document for each referral and transition of care is desirable, we disagree that this means a lis t of basic elements that should be in each summary of care documents is not appr opriate. We note that most organizations that try and tackle the issue of summary of care docum ents have required fields, core sets or other nomenclature for elements that they believe shou ld be in all summary of care documents. For example, the CDA architecture used as the standa rd for the summary of care document contains required and optional fields. The American Colle ge of Physicians in their Neighborhood Model uses a core data set. None of these organizatio ns intend for their list of elements to be limiting and nor do we intend our list to be limiting, but rath er serve as a minimum. In our proposed rule we went further and said that if the provider does not have the information available to populate one or more of the fields listed, either becau se they can be excluded from recording such information (for example, vital signs) or because there is no information to record (for example, laboratory tests), the provider ma y leave the field(s) blank. The only exception to this is the problem list, medication list, and medication allergy list. Therefor e, we are including a list of elements in this final rule. Comment : Commenters stated that their unders tanding is that if any of the fields specifically for problem list, medication list, or allergy list is bla nk (meaning no entry of problems, medications or allergies nor an indi cation that it is known by the provider that the patient has no problems, medication or allergies), the EP or hospital will not meet the measure, but that if any other information is blank, the EP or hospital will still meet the measure. Please clarify whether this is a correct understand ing of the proposal. 180 Response : This understanding of our proposed rule is generally correct. The problem list, medication list and medication allergy list must also either contain problems, medications and medication allergy or a specif ic notation that the patient has none. Leaving the field entirely blank with no entry whatsoever would not meet the measure. However, in cases where the provider does not have the information availabl e to populate one or more of the other fields listed, either because they can be excluded from recording such information (for example, vital signs) or because there is no information to reco rd (for example, laboratory tests), the provider may leave the field(s) blank. Note this does not allow a provider to disable a listed field from being generated by the CEHRT, but rather al lows for when the CEHRT does not contain information on which to genera te an entry for the field. Comment : Some commenters suggested the subs titution of past medical history for historical problem list in the list of required el ements, since past medical history could provide additional information valuable to patient care. Response : CMS' Evaluation and Management Se rvices Guide defines a past medical history as the patient's past \"e xperiences with illnesse cation/Medicare-L earning-Network- MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/eval_mgmt_serv_guide-ICN006764.pdf , p. 11). In our proposed rule, we referred to \"current and historic al problem list\" as this is more concrete and standards based than the definiti on for past medical history. We believe the concept of past medical history is inclusive of current and histor ical problem list. We understand that providers are more familiar with the term past medical history and will evaluate expanding historical problem list to past medical history for Stage 3. However, for Stage 2, we are finalizing current and historical problem list. For summary of car e documents at transitions of care we encourage 181 providers to send a list of items that he or she beli eves to be pertinent and relevant to the patient's care, rather than a list of all problems, whether they are active or resolved, that have ever populated the problem list. While a current prob lem list should always be included, the provider can use his or her judgment in deciding which items historically present on the problem list, PMHx list (if it exists in CEHRT), or surgical history list are included given the clinical circumstances. Comment : Commenters stated that it is t oo burdensome to determine whether the problem list, medication list and medication allergy lis t are included in each summary of care document. Response : We disagree that this is too burdensome. We note that in Stage 1 measuring the completeness of the problem list, medicati on list and medication alle rgy list is already a requirement. Summary of care documents are generated by the CEHRT based on the information available to it. Ther efore, there are only two causes of error that would have to be discovered to make the determination of whether the problem list, medica tion list and medication allergy list are included.. The problem list, medication list and medica tion allergy list do not contain information for a given pa tient and/or there is an error in the generation of the summary of care document. This discovery constitutes the bur den of this measure. We have already noted that the ability to know whether the lists contain information is already a Stage 1 measure. The second issue is prevalent in nearly every mean ingful use measure that requires CEHRT to generate a measurement so that burden is already integral to meaningful use. Comment : Commenters stated that the different descriptions of probl em list throughout the proposed rule create confusion. The four term s used are \"an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses\", \"problem list\", \"Current problem list and any updates to it\" and \"problem 182 list maintained by the hospital on the patient \". CMS should use this term uniformly. Furthermore, the limitation of the problem list to only current and active diagnoses is inconsistent with how problem lists are used a nd historical problems shou ld also be included. Response : We only proposed one definition of the base term \"problem list\", which is a list of current and active diagnoses. We then use descriptors to tailo r the term to the objective in which it is being utilized. For ex ample, \"up-to-date\" means that the problem list in the CEHRT is populated with the most recent diagnoses known by the EP or hospital. The description used for office visit summary \"Current problem list a nd any updates to it\" was intended to separate problems that were known before the visit and thos e that were determined during the visit. We agree that our limitation of the \"problem lis t\" to just current a nd active diagnoses is unnecessarily limiting. The C-CDA, which is the standard adopted for EHR technology certification, for summary of care documents states that \"at a minimum, all pertinent current and historical problems should be list ed\". We revise our definition of \"probl em list\" to include historical problems. This is a minimum. We do not limit the provide r to just including diagnoses on the problem list. We agree that ther e should be just one definition of the base term \"problem list\"; however, we disagree that the same list is appropriate for every case especially with the addition of the historic al problems. Some objectives call for the current problem list which includes only those diagnoses of probl ems currently affecting the patient. Other objectives call for the current and historical problem list, which would include problems currently affecting the patient as well as those th at have been resolved. For purposes of clarity, we are consolidating across all of the meaningful use obj ectives to just two descriptions of our term \"problem list\": \"current problem list\" a nd \"current and historical problem list.\" This consolidation also removes the need for a separate item of past re levant diagnosis as these would 183 be included in a historical prob lem list. We define active medication list as a list of medications that a given patient is currently taking. We define active medi cation allergy list as a list of medications to which a given patient has known alle rgies. We define allergy as an exaggerated immune response or reaction to substances that are generally not harm ful. Information on problems, medications, and medi cation allergies could be obtai ned from previous records, transfer of information from othe r providers (directly or indirectly ), diagnoses made by the EP or hospital, new medications ordered by the EP or in the hospital, or through querying the patient. In the event that there are no current or active di agnoses for a patient, the patient is not currently taking any medications, or the patient has no kn own medication allergie s, confirmation of no problems, no medications, or no me dication allergies would satisfy the measure of this objective. Comment : Many commenters recommended against any specification of problem list content regarding functional and cognitive limita tions citing insufficient consensus around the appropriate classification of thes e functions. Commenters also stat ed that if included, functional and cognitive limitations s hould be further defined. Response : As noted earlier in this final rule under the demographic objective, we wish to clarify that both the concepts of physical and cognitive disabilities as well as the concept of functional limitations that impact an individual's capability to perform ac tivities were included in our description of disability status for the purpos e of this rule. The latter concept is a common metric for care planning and care coordination acro ss settings because knowledge of a patient's abilities (for example, functional and/or cognitive st atus) are also necessary for clinical practice. While many commenters noted the lack of consen sus for the terms and standards necessary to support the inclusion of disabili ty, functional and cognitive stat us assessment and observations into the Consolidated CDA for summary of care records, we understand th at this standard was 184 updated to include section-and data -entry level templates that can describe a patient's functional and cognitive status. However, we agree that there is insufficient defi nitions for disability, functional and cognitive status assessment and observations to include them as part of the problem list. Therefore, we are including \"f unctional status, including functional, cognitive and disability\" as a separate element in the summary of care document. Comment : In regard to the inclusion of \"car e plan field\" in th e list of required information, some commenters believed that the wording was overly prescriptive since CEHRT could utilize multiple fields to structure care plans. Other commenters requested a more detailed definition of care plan and/or the stan dards that are available or required. Response : We agree that the language proposed c ould be viewed as prescriptive, and we do not intend to limit the inclusion of the care plan to a single field. Therefore, we are amending the language to \"Care plan fiel d(s), including goals and instruc tions\" in our list of required elements below. However, we decline to prov ide an alternate definition that would limit the information in the care plan. We believe that the definition we proposed in the proposed rule is sufficient to allow for the inclusion of a variet y of care plans in the clinical summary. For purposes of the clinical summary, we define a car e plan as the structur e used to define the management actions for the various conditions, probl ems, or issues. A care plan must include at a minimum the following components: problem (t he focus of the care plan), goal (the target outcome) and any instructions that the provider has given to the patient. A goal is a defined target or measure to be achieved in the pr ocess of patient care (an expected outcome). Comment : Commenters stated that while the ca re team members are clearly important data elements and key to clini cal coordination, they recommende d further research into true standards to support these elements before any requirements are imposed. 185 Response : Our proposal is to include \"Any additional known care team members beyond the referring or transitioning provider and the receiv ing provider\". We believe that the ability to identify providers is well established. We note that there is no requirement to identify the role of each provider which we would agree are not we ll established beyond PCP and referring provider. We also note that this is only for cases when the other care team members are known by the transitioning provider. These allowances are su fficient to accommodate the current standard limitations and therefore we finalize as proposed. Comment : As referrals are included in the denomi nator as well as transitions of care, the summary of care document should incl ude the reason for the referral. Response : We agree with this comment and add reason for referral for EPs. The reason for the referral is the clinical question the refe rring provider wants answered for a consultation or the procedure to be performed. If the consulta tion is more open ended, then a brief summary of the case details pertinent to referral suffices. After consideration of the comments, all summ ary of care documents used to meet this objective must include the following information if the provider knows it: Patient name. Referring or transitioning provider's name and office contact information (EP only). Procedures. Encounter diagnosis Immunizations. Laboratory test results. Vital signs (height, we ight, blood pressure, BMI). Smoking status. 186 Functional status, including activities of daily living, cogn itive and disability status Demographic information (preferred langu age, sex, race, ethnic ity, date of birth). Care plan field, includ ing goals and instructions. Care team including the primary care pr ovider of record and any additional known care team members beyond the referring or transi tioning provider and the receiving provider. Discharge instructions (Hospital Only) Reason for referral (EP only) In circumstances where there is no informati on available to populate one or more of the fields listed previously, either because the EP, eligible hospital or CAH can be excluded from recording such information (for ex ample, vital signs) or because there is no information to record (for example, laboratory tests), the EP, eligible hospital or CAH may leave the field(s) blank and still meet the objective and its associated measure. In addition, all summary of care documents used to meet this objective must include the following in order to be considered a summa ry of care document for this objective: Current problem list (Providers may al so include historical problems at their discretion) Current medication list, and Current medication allergy list. An EP or hospital must verify these three fields for current problem list, current medication list, and current medication allergy lis t are not blank and include the most recent information known by the EP or hospital as of the time of generating the summary of care document. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 187 (j)(14)(i) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(1 1)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measures: EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs must satisfy both measures in order to meet the objective: The EP, eligible hospital or CAH that transitions or refers their pati ent to another setting of care or provider of care provi des a summary of care record for more than 65 percent of transitions of care and referrals. The EP, eligible hospital or CAH that transitions or refers their pati ent to another setting of care or provider of care electr onically transmits a summary of care record using CEHRT to a recipient with no organizational affiliation and using a different CEHRT vendor than the sender for more than 10 percent of tran sitions of care and referrals. First Measure: We proposed that if the provider to whom the referral is made or to whom the patient is transitioned has access to the medical record ma intained by the referring provider, then the summary of care record would not need to be pr ovided and that patient s hould not be included in the denominators of the measures of this objective. We stated in the proposed rule that different settings within a hospital using the same CEHR T would have access to the same information, so providing a clinical care summary for transfers within the hosp ital would not be necessary. Comment : If as stated in the proposed rule \"the majority chose to defer this measure in Stage 1\", commenters asserted this is insufficient information to justify raising the threshold to 65 percent and move the objective to core. Other commenters a ssert that any measure that moves from menu to core should maintain its St age 1 threshold regardle ss of the particular measure's rate of deferral. Response : After considering the arguments for lowering the threshold to 50 percent and 188 the lack of a robust data set in support of the proposed thresh old, we do lower the threshold to 50 percent. For this measure in particular, we ag ree that since most providers chose to defer this measure in Stage 1 the information available on performance from Stage 1 meaningful EHR users is not as robust as for ot her objectives and measures. We do not agree with the comment that all objectives that move fr om menu to core should maintain the same threshold. We believe such a blanket policy would be arbitrary and not properly account for the information available for each objective and measure. For example, if most Stage 1 meaningful EHR users had reported on this measure, there would be a robus t data set of performance on which to judge a threshold. A blanket policy w ould ignore such information. Comment : Commenters questioned and requested clarification on situations where the recipient of the transition or referral is using the same inst ance of CEHRT or otherwise has access to the CEHRT of the transitioning or refe rring provider. Some of these commenters acknowledged our proposal to address this situ ation were also split between support for our proposal to exclude these from the denominator ve rsus allowing them to be in the denominator and numerator of both measures. Also comment ers expressed concern on whether this was a measurable constraint. Finally, commenters requested clarification on whether our proposal applied to one or both measures. Response : We proposed that if the provider to whom the referral is made or to whom the patient is transitioned has access to the medical r ecord maintained by the referring provider, then the summary of care record would not need to be provided and that patient should not be included in the denominators of the measures of this object ive. We believe that different settings within a hospital using CEHRT would have access to the same information, so providing a clinical care summary for transf ers within the hospital would not be necessary. This is a 189 continuance of our current Stag e 1 policy. In response to comment s, this policy applies to both measures. We clarify the first sentence that access to the medical record could be through several mechanisms. Some providers will be in the same organization and share CEHRT outright. Other providers might grant remote access to their CEHRT to providers not sharing their same CEHRT. We do not limit the mech anisms through which access is granted. We disagree that this access should count in the denominator or nume rator of either measure. A summary of care document generated by CEHRT c onforms to specific standards and could in many cases be automatically integrated into th e recipient's CEHRT. Access provides no such capability. For this reason, we finalize our policy of excluding th ese transitions and referrals from the denominator. However, if a transitioni ng or referring provider provides both access and a summary of care document to providers outside their organization and wishes to include them in their denominator and as appropriate their num erator, they can do so. Finally, while we agree that it some cases it may be difficult to determin e whether the recipient has access to the sender's CEHRT. We do not believe that we should remove an accommodation due to measurement difficulties. It is acceptable for a provider to include these transitions and referrals in the denominator, but only if a summary of care doc ument is provided would it count in the numerator. Comment : Commenters stated that there are so me providers who may engage in a small number of transitions of care a nd referrals and the implementation burden of this objective is too high to require of those with only a small number. This is particul arly true as the requirement for electronic health information exchange is introduced. Response : We have previously allowed for a mo re than zero, but less than 100 exclusion for our other objective requiring el ectronic health information exch ange (eRx); therefore, in 190 response to these comments we will apply that pol icy to this objective and measure as well and raise the exclusion from zero to less than 100 trans itions of care and referrals. Transitions of care and referrals are additive so someone with 50 transitions of care and 75 referrals would not qualify for the exclusion. After consideration of public comments, we are revising the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (j)(14)(ii)(A) and for eligible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(11)(ii)(A) to \"The EP, eligible hospital or CAH that transitions or refers their patient to another setting of care or provider of care provides a summary of care record for more than 50 percent of transitions of care and referrals.\" We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(l) and (b)(2)(i). To calculate the percentage of the first meas ure, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of transitions of care and referrals duri ng the EHR reporting period for which the EP or eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) was the transferring or referring provider. Numerator : The number of transitions of care a nd referrals in the denominator where a summary of care record was provided. Threshold : The percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who transfers a patient to another setting or refers a patient to another provider less than 100 times during the EHR reporting period is excluded from all three 191 measures. Second Measure: For Stage 2, we proposed the additional second measure for electronic transmittal because we believe that the electronic exchange of health information between providers will encourage the sharing of the patient care su mmary from one provider to another and the communication of important inform ation that the patient may not have been able to provide, which can significantly improve the quality and safety of referral care and reduce unnecessary and redundant testing. Use of common standards can signif icantly reduce the cost and complexity of interfaces between different sy stems and promote widespread exchange and interoperability. In acknowledgement of this, ONC has included certain transmission protocols in the proposed 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria. These protocols would allow every provider wi th CEHRT to have the tools in place to share critical information when patients are disc harged or referred, repres enting a critical step forward in exchange and interoperability. Accord ingly, we proposed to limit the numerator for this second measure to only count electronic tr ansmissions which conform to the transport standards proposed for adoption at 45 CFR 170.202 of the ONC standa rds and certification criteria rule.. To meet the second measure of this objectiv e, we proposed that a provider must use CEHRT to create a summary of care document with the required information according to the required standards and electronically transmit th e summary of care document using the transport standards to which its CEHRT has been certified. No other transport standards beyond those proposed for adoption as part of certif ication would be permitted to be used to meet this measure. In the proposed rule, we acknowledged the bene fits of requiring the use of consistently 192 implemented transport standards nationwide, but at the same time want to be cognizant of any unintended consequences of this approach. ONC requested comments on whether equivalent alternative transport standards exist to the ones ONC proposes to exclusively permit for certification. These comments are addressed in the ONC standards and certification final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We noted in the proposed rule that the use of USB, CD-ROM, or other physical me dia or electronic fax would not satisfy the measures for electronic transmittal of a summary of care record. We discussed in the proposed rule, in lieu of requiring solely the transmission capability and transport standard(s) included in a provider's CEHRT to be used to meet this measur e, also permitting a prov ider to count electronic transmissions in the numerator if the provider el ectronically transmits summary of care records to support patient transitions us ing an organization that follows Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) specifications (http://healthit.hhs.gov/porta l/server.pt/community/hea lthit_hhs_gov__nhin_resources/1194 ). This could include those organi zations that are part of the NwHIN Exchange as well as any organization that is identified through a governance mechanism ONC would establish through regulation. We requested public comment on whethe r this additional flexibility should be added to our proposed numerator limitations. In the proposed rule we raised another poten tial concern that anothe r transport standard emerges after CMS' and ONC's rules are finalized th at is not adopted in a final rule by ONC as part of certification, but noneth eless accomplishes the objective in the same way. To mitigate this concern, ONC indicated in its proposed rule that it would pursue an off-cycle rulemaking to add as an option for certification transport standards that emerge at any time after these proposed rules are finalized in order to keep pace with innovation and thereby allow other transport 193 standards to be used and counted as part of th is measure's numerator. We asked for comments on how these standards will further the goal of true health information exchange. Additionally, in order to fo ster standards based-excha nge across organizational and vendor boundaries, we proposed to further lim it the numerator by only permitting electronic transmissions to count towards the numerator if they are made to recipients that are -- (1) not within the organization of the transmitting provide r; and (2) do not have CEHRT from the same EHR vendor. We proposed these numerator limitations because, in collaboration with ONC, our experience has shown that one of the biggest barr iers to electronic exchan ge is the adoption of numerous different transmissi on methods by different providers and vendors. Thus, we explained that it would be prude nt for Stage 2 to include these more specific requirements and conformance to open, national standards as it will cause the market to converge on those transport standards that can best and most readily support electroni c health information exchange and avoid the use of proprietary approaches that limit exchange among providers. We recognized that because the 2011 Edition EHR cer tification criteria did not include specific transport standards for transitions of care, so me providers and vendors implemented their own methods for Stage 1 to engage in electronic he alth information exchange, some of which would no longer be an acceptable means of meeting meaningf ul use if this proposal were finalized. Therefore, in order to determine a reasonable balance that makes this measure achievable yet significantly advance interoperability and electronic exchange, we asked for comment on the following concerns stakeholders may have relati ve to the numerator limitations we proposed previously. We discussed a potential concern related to the feasibility of meeting this proposed 194 measure if an insufficient number of providers in a given geographi c location (because of upgrade timing or some other factor) have EHR technology certified to th e transport standards ONC has proposed to adopt. For example, a c ity might have had a widely adopted health information exchange organization that still us ed another standard than those proposed for adoption by ONC. While it is not ou r intent to restrict providers who are engaged in electronic health information exchange via other transport standards, we believe requiring the use of a consistent transport standard could significantly further our ov erarching goals for Stage 2. We recognized that this lim itation extends beyond the existing parameters set for Stage 1, which specified that providers with access to th e same medical record do not include transitions of care or referrals among themselves in eith er the denominator or the numerator. We recognized that this limitation could severely limit the pool of eligible re cipients in areas where one vendor or one organizational structure using the same EHR technology has a large market share and may make measuring the numerator more difficult. We sought comment on the extent to which this concern could potentially be mitigated with an exclusion or exclusion criteria that account for these unique environments. We belie ve the limitation on organizational and vendor affiliations is important because even if a networ k or organization is using the standards, it does not mean that a network is open to all providers . Certain organizations may find benefits, such as competitive advantage, in keeping their networks closed, even to those involved in the care of the same patient. We believe this limitation will help ensure that electronic transmission of the summary of care record can follow the patient in every situation. Even without the addition of the proposed exclusions under the proposed measure, CEHRT would need to be able to distinguish between (1) electr onic transmissions sent using standards and those that are not, (2) transmission that are sent to recipients with the same 195 organizational affiliation or not, and (3) transmissions that are sent to recipients using the same EHR vendor or not. ONC sought comment in th eir proposed certification rule as to the feasibility of this reporting requirement for CEHRT. Despite the possible unintended consequences of the parameters we proposed for the numerator, in the proposed rule we stated that we believed that these limitations would help ensure that electronic health information exchan ge proceeds at the pace necessary to accomplish the goals of meaningful use. We asked for comments on all these points and particularly suggestions that would both push electronic health information exchange beyond what is proposed and minimize the potential concerns expressed previously. The HIT Policy Committee recommended different thresholds for EPs and hospitals for the electronic transmission measure, with a threshold of only 25 inst ances for EPs. However, we proposed a percentage-based measure is attainab le for both EPs and eligible hospitals/CAHs and better reflects the actual meani ngful use of technology. It also provides a more level method for measurement across EPs. We asked for comments on whether there are si gnificant barriers in addition to those discussed above to EPs meetin g the 10 percent threshold for this measure. Comment : There were several comments that doubted that the technology will be ready for providers to meet this measure. They did not believe there is enough vendor support to create, customize, and implement the changes nece ssary to meet the new measure. Commenters expressed concern that many of the technologies, from EHRs to HIEs and transmission standards, needed to enable electronic health in formation exchange currently does not exist. Response : We disagree that it is premature to in clude this measure for Stage 2. We note that as an incentive program it is expected that the requirements will reach beyond what is common place today. Many organizations and provi ders are successfully engaged in electronic 196 health information exchange today and by incl uding this measure in meaningful use those established practices will be adopted by a greater number of providers. Comment : A commenter suggested that ONC's certification rule was the appropriate place to ensure cross-vendor in teroperability, not the Stage 2 measures and objectives. Response : While we agree that meaningful us e should be enabled by the capabilities included in certification, the concept of meani ngful use is to incentivize the use of such capabilities not just the acquisition of them. Comment : Commenters expressed two concerns on the limitation on the numerator that limited it to recipients with no organizational a ffiliation and using a different CEHRT vendor. First, there was concern that in some market s an organization or CEHRT vendor may control such a significant share of the ma rket that meeting 10 percent is not possible. Second, even if the 10 percent threshold was feasib le in a given market, one or ganization or CEHRT vendor may have enough market share that the provider's referral patterns would inappropriately be influenced to give preference to those us ing different CEHRT ve ndors or outside their organizations. Commenters support appropriate information exchange between all providers, where clinically relevant, regardless of provide r affiliations, but have these concerns on our proposed measure for this objective. Commenters presented severa l different solutions including removing one or both limitations, replacing the li mitations with an error reporting system for instances where electronic health information exchange fails, moving the limitations to the denominator and providing exclusions for areas of high vendor or organizational market penetrations. Response : We agree that the measure as propose d runs both risks stat ed by commenters. Of the solutions presented by commenters, one dir ectly alleviates both of these concerns. In 197 drafting the final rule, we considered movi ng the limitations from the numerator to the denominator of the measure, both concerns are addressed. For example, if a provider makes 500 referrals during the EHR reporting period, 400 of whic h are to providers that either are affiliated with the same organization or use the same CEHRT vendor, then only 100 referrals are even eligible for the proposed numerator. This create s a bar that is much higher than 10 percent, as 50 percent of the eligible instances must be electronically transmitted to meet the proposed measure in this example, which we agree has th e possibility of influenc ing referral patterns. However, applying the limitations of \"no orga nizational affiliation\" and \"different CEHRT vendor\" instea d of the numerator would resu lt, in this example, in a denominator of 100 referrals instead of 500 and a true 10 percent threshold. There would be no need to change referral patterns as there would be no negative effect on the threshold for having a referral partner either in th e same organization or using the same CEHRT vendor. We firmly believe that this solution is the best measure of the type of health inform ation exchange that we proposed to target and that is s upported in principle by nearly all commenters. However, we are not including this solution in the final rule as explained in the respons e to the next set of comments. Instead, we are removing the orga nizational and vendor limitations from this measure solely due to the burden of maki ng these determinations for measurement. Comment : Many commenters expressed concern over the ability to measure this objective especially the organization and vendor limitations. Commenters who were providers expressed concern over the abil ity of their CEHRT vendor to measure this objective, while vendors of CEHRT expressed concern over the abili ty of providers to measure the objective. Combined, it appears that neithe r the provider nor the vendor belie ved they could even measure on their own and had concerns on their part ners on which they placed their hopes for 198 measurement. Response : In the proposed rule we determined th at the CEHRT would have to be able to make three determinations to successfully calcu late the numerator for this measure: (1) electronic transmissions sent usi ng standards and those that are no t; (2) transmission that are sent to recipients with the same organizational affiliati on or not; and (3) transmissions that are sent to recipients using the same EHR vendor or not. We stated that ONC will seek comment in their proposed certificati on rule as to the feasibili ty of this reporting requirement for certified EHR technologies. ONC received comments similar to ours that making the determinations for the numerator was infeasible particul arly in regard to the organi zational and vendor limitations. Therefore, we are removing the organizational and vendor limitations from this measure solely due to the burden of making these determinations for measurement. Commenters did not suggest difficulties with determining that the electroni c transmission was sent using the specified standards. Therefore, we finalize the stip ulation that CEHRT be used, including its accompanying standards for this measure (\"measure 2\"). However, we are not abandoning all efforts to ensure that cross vendor electronic exchange is possible for all meaningful EHR users in Stage 2. As discussed in the prior comment and response, the only reason we are not finalizi ng the stipulations on the denominator is the measurement burden. We believe that a third measure is needed that reduces the burden relative to the proposed measure, but still ensures that all providers have implemented CEHRT in a way that enables them to electronically exchange su mmary of care documents with a recipient using EHR technology designed by a different vendor. Therefore, we have added a third measure (\"measure 3\") that requires provider s to use their CEHRT to either-- Conduct one or more successful electronic exchanges of a summary of care document, 199 which is counted in measure 2 with a recipi ent who has EHR technology designed by a different EHR technology developer than the sender's EHR technology certified to 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2); or Conduct one or more successful tests w ith the CMS designated test EHR during the EHR reporting period. For the first option in measure 3, the sender must verify that the recipient's technology used to receive the summary of care record was not designed by the same EHR technology developer that designed the sender's EH R technology certified to 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2). With respect to the second option in meas ure 3, and recognizing past difficulties and lessons learned from a \"test\" oriented measure in Stage 1, we have collaborated with ONC and NIST to initiate a project that would result in a public facing (hosted onl ine) \"test EHR\" with which EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs could enga ge in electronic exchange. We expect that most providers will satisfy the first option in th e normal course of meetin g measure 2. However, in those rare instances where th at does not occur this other se cond option would give every EP, eligible hospital, or CAH an alternative method to meet measure 3 with minimal burden by successfully testing electronic ex change with the CMS-designated test EHR. If this second option is used, we clarify that th e use of test information about a fictional patient that would be identical in form to what would be sent about an actual patient (for ex ample, \"dummy data\") must be used for the purposes of conducting a test with the CMS-designated test EHR. Providers that use the same EHR technology certified to 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2) and share a network for which their organization either ha s operational control or license to use can conduct one test that covers all providers in the organization. For example, if a large group of EPs with multiple physical locations use the same EHR technology certified to 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2) and those 200 locations are connected using a network that the group has either operational control of or license to use, then a single test would cover all EPs in that group. Similarly, if a provider uses an EHR technology that is hosted (cloud- based) on the developer's netw ork, then a single test would allow all EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs using the EHR technology that is hosted (cloud- based) on the developer's netw ork to meet the measure. While making this does impose a burden on th e provider, we believe the burden is outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that ever y provider who becomes a meaningful EHR user is capable of exchanging a summary of car e document electronically regardless of who developed the sender's EHR and the recipient's EHR. We also seek to note for readers that while we have significantly reduced this objective's burden from what we proposed in measure 2, we continue to believe th at making vendor to vendor standards-based exchange attainable fo r all meaningful EHR users is of paramount importance. In that regard, and as we look towa rd meaningful use Stage 3, we will monitor the ease with which EPs, eligible hospitals, and C AHs engage in electroni c exchange, especially across different vendors EHRs. If we do not see sufficient progress or that continued impediments exist such that our policy goals for standards-based exchange are not being met, we will revisit these more specific measurement limitati ons and consider other policies to strengthen the interoperability requirements included in mean ingful use as well as consider other policies and regulations through which the Department coul d effect the outcome we seek. Finally, we also intend to consider future meaningful us e requirements that increase expectations for standards-based exchange and make information th at is exchanged more searchable and usable for a broad array of clinical pur poses imperative to care improvem ent. We envision that these requirements would rely on metadata tagging as well as more dynamic methods of electronic 201 health information exchange. Comment : Commenters expressed support for in cluding in this measure's numerator electronic transmissions enabled by query-based exchange models, including organizations using NwHIN Exchange specifications. The comm enters indicated that NwHIN Exchange specifications are appropriate for exchange use case s not covered as well by the Direct standards, and use of either standard should be counted. This is particular ly important in cases where the summary is pulled instead of pushed. Providers and organizations that are part of the NwHIN Exchange or other organizations using these st andards should receive cr edit for those exchanges in meeting interoperability measures. Response : In Stage 2, all providers should be ab le to use CEHRT to share summary of care records in a \"push\" manner to support safe transitions and info rmed referrals. \"Pull\" (query) transactions can also support these goals. By \"p ull\" transactions we refer to instances where the receiving provider retrieves the summary of car e document from a location outside their own CEHRT as opposed to \"push\" transactions where the referring or transitioning provider sends the summary of care document to the receiving provider. Thus, such transactions should be counted towards the numerator of the provider initiating th e transitions or referrals when the recipient (the provider \"receiving\" the transition or referr al) actually receives or downloads the patient's summary of care record relevant to the transiti on or referral. The act of uploading the summary of care record to a repository that can be queried by the recipient\u2014 without validation that this query in fact occurred will not be sufficien t to count towards the numerator. While we acknowledge that there may not be a simple, universal way for this to be measured, we believe it is important to make this accommodation for those w ho elect to engage in this form of exchange. Therefore, we are revising the second measure to include in the sending provider's numerator 202 instances where the recipient receives the summary of care record via exch ange facilitated by an organization that is an NwHIN Ex change participant or in a manne r that is consistent with the governance mechanism ONC establishes for the na tionwide health information network. The referring or transitioning provider would use th eir CEHRT to generate a summary of care document and to provide it an organization that is a NwHIN Exchange participant or in a manner that is consistent with the governance mechan ism ONC establishes for the nationwide health information network. More information on NwHIN Exchange participants is available at http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt /community/healthit_hhs_gov__nhin_exchange/1407 . ONC issued a request for information regard ing a governance mechanism for the nationwide health information network that is available at 77 FR 28543. After considering the comment s received, we are modifying the second measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(14)(ii)(B) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(11)(ii )(B) to \"The EP, eligible hospital or CAH that transitions or refe rs their patient to another setting of care or provider of care provides a summary of care record for more than 10 percent of such transitions and referrals either (a) electronically transmitte d using CEHRT to a recipient or (b) where the recipient receives the summary of care record vi a exchange facilitated by an organization that is a NwHIN Exchange participant or in a manner that is consistent with th e governance mechanism ONC establishes for the nationwid e health information network.\" We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(l) and (b)(2). To calculate the percentage of the second measure, CMS a nd ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: 203 Denominator : Number of transitions of care and referrals duri ng the EHR reporting period for which the EP or eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) was the transferring or referring provider. Numerator : The number of transitions of care a nd referrals in the denominator where a summary of care record was a) electronically transmitted using CEHRT to a recipient or b) where the recipient receives th e summary of care record via exchange facilitated by an organization that is a NwHIN Excha nge participant or in a manner that is consistent with the governance mechanism ONC establishes for the na tionwide health information network. The organization can be a third-party or the sender's own organization. Threshold : The percentage must be more than 10 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who transfers a patient to another setting or refers a patient to another provider less than 100 times during the EHR reporting period is excluded from all three measures. Third Measure: After considering the comments received, we are adding a third measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(14)(ii)(C) and fo r eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(11)(ii )(C) to \"An EP, eligible hospital or CAH must satisfy one of the two following criteria: Conducts one or more successful electronic exchanges of a summary of care document, which is counted in \"measure 2\" (for EPs the measure at \u00a7495.6(j)(14)(ii)(B) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs the measure at \u00a7495.6(l)( 11)(ii)(B)) with a re cipient who has EHR technology that was designed by a different EHR technology developer than the sender's EHR technology certified to 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2); or 204 Conducts one or more successful tests w ith the CMS designated test EHR during the EHR reporting period. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(2). Exclusion : Any EP who transfers a patient to another setting or refers a patient to another provider less than 100 times during the EHR reporting period is excluded from all three measures. (c) Public Health Objectives General Public Health Discussion In the proposed rule, due to similar consider ations among the public health objectives, we discussed them together. Some Stage 2 public hea lth objectives are proposed to be in the core set while others are proposed to be in the menu set. Each objective is identified as either core or menu in the following discussion. Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registri es or immunization information systems except where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. Capability to submit electronic reportable la boratory results to public health agencies, except where prohibited, and in accordan ce with applicable law and practice. Capability to submit electronic syndromic surveillance data to publ ic health agencies, except where prohibited, and in accordan ce with applicable law and practice. Capability to identify and report cancer cases to a state cancer registry except where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. Capability to identify and report specific ca ses to a specialized registry (other than a 205 cancer registry), except where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. We proposed the following requirements, which will apply to all of the public health objectives and measures. We propos ed that actual patient data is required for the meaningful use measures that include ongoing submission of patient data. We discussed in the proposed rule situations where PHAs partner with health information exchange (HIE) organizations to facilitate the submission of public hea lth data electronically from EHRs. As we stated in gui dance for Stage 1, (see FAQ #10764 at: https://questions.cms.hhs.gov) we clarified that such arrangements with HIE organizations, if designated by the PHA to simply transport the data, but not transformi ng content or message format (for example, HL7 format), are acceptabl e for the demonstration of meaningful use. Alternatively, if the intermediary is serving as an extension of the EP, eligible hospital or CAH's CEHRT and performing capabilities for which certification is requi red (for example, transforming the data into the re quired standard), then that func tionality must be certified in accordance with the certification program establishe d by ONC. In this situation, the EP, eligible hospital or CAH must still ensure the accomplis hment of ongoing submission of reports to the actual immunization information system or registry (whether performed by the intermediary or not), except in situations when the PHA has e xplicitly designated deliv ery of reports to the intermediary as satisfying these requirements. We proposed that an eligible provider is required to utilize th e transport method or methods supported by the PHA in orde r to achieve meaningful use. Unlike in Stage 1, under our proposed Stage 2 criteria a failed submission will not meet the objective. An eligible prov ider must either have success ful ongoing submission or meet an exclusion criterion 206 We stated in the proposed rule that we exp ect that CMS, CDC and PHAs will establish a process where PHAs will be able to provide lett ers affirming that the EP, eligible hospital or CAH was able to submit the relevant public health data to the PHA. This affirmation letter could then be used by the EP, eligible hospital or C AH for the Medicare and Medicaid meaningful use attestation systems, as well as in the event of any audit. We requested comments on challenges to implementing this strategy. We proposed to accept a yes/no attestation a nd information indicating to which PHA the public health data were submitted to support each of the public health meaningful use measures. Comment : Commenters asked for clarification of ongoing submission; additionally, due to the amount of time needed to prepare fo r submission of data, commenters asked for clarification on the timing to determine if a public health au thority has the capacity to accept electronic data for ongoing submission. Other commen ters noted that being \"in queue\" or in the process of validation for ongoing submission sh ould count as meeting this measure. Commenters also noted that credit should be given for having moved into ongoing submission during Stage 1. Response : To clarify the timing issue, the EP or hospital must determine if the PHA has the capacity to accept electronic data using the specification prescribed by ONC for the public health information for the objectives of meani ngful use within the first 60 days of the EHR reporting period. If the PHA does not have the cap acity to accept reporting (including situations when the PHA accepts electronic data but states it lacks capacity to enroll the EP, eligible hospital or CAH during that reporti ng period), the EP or hospital can claim an exclusion for this measure related to the data that cannot be acc epted. In determining whether the PHA has the capacity, CMS anticipates developing a centralized repository for this information, including a 207 deadline for the PHA to submit information. If th e PHA fails to provide information to this centralized repository by the deadline, the provider could claim the exclusion. In the event, that we are unable to develop a centralized repository, providers will make the determination of PHA capacity by working directly with the PHA as is cu rrently the case for Stage 1 of meaningful use. If the PHA does have the capacity, the measure may be satisfied through any of the following general public health criteria: Ongoing submission was already achieved for an EHR reporting period in a prior year and continues throughout the current EHR reporting period using either the current standard at 45 CFR 170.314(f)(1) and (f)(2) or the standards included in the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria adopted by ONC duri ng the prior EHR reporting period when ongoing submission was achieved. Registration with the PHA or other body to whom the information is being submitted of intent to initiate ongoing submission was made by the deadline (within 60 days of the start of the EHR reporting period) and ongoing submission was achieved. Registration of intent to initiate ongoing submission was made by the deadline and the EP or hospital is still engaged in testing and validation of ongoing electronic submission. Registration of intent to initiate ongoing submission was made by the deadline and the EP or hospital is awaiting invita tion to begin testing and validation. The measure will not be met if the provider-- Fails to register their intent by the deadline; or Fails to participate in th e on-boarding process as demonstr ated by failure to respond to the PHA written requests for action within 30 days on two separate occasions. Comment : Several commenters expressed concer n that no data transport mechanism was 208 included in the Stage 2 rule and/or EHR certificati on. Some expressed concern that the lack of a standard may result in EPs paying more for in terfaces than received in incentive payments. Other commenters supported including no transpor t mechanism to allow maximum flexibility for public health authorities. Response : While we understand the concer n of supporting multiple transport mechanisms, in order for data to flow to public health authority, vendors must support the transport mechanism utilized by the public health au thority to which the EP or hospital reports. Public health authorities have moved to standa rdize transport mechanis ms where feasible, and Health Information Exchanges are often facilitatin g the transport of data to public health. We stand by our policy that allows public health auth orities to dictate the transport mechanism in their jurisdiction. Further, we cl arify that this is independent of the EHR certification criteria as EHR certification does not address tran sport for public health objectives. Comment : Commenters suggested that the expe ctation that public health agencies provide affirmation letters is t oo restrictive in accomplishing the goal of establishe d a record of communication between the provider and the PHA. They maintain that there are simpler and less burdensome ways such as automated acknowledgment messages from immunization submissions. Response : We agree that our proposa l requiring it must be a letter is too restrictive and revise our expectation to allow for any writt en communication (which may be in electronic format) from the PHA affirming that the EP, eligible hospital or CAH was able to submit the relevant public health data to the PHA. Comment : Commenters requested greater cl arification on what is meant by ongoing submission. Some suggested that it be transitioned to a percentage measurement as with other 209 objectives of meaningful use. Response : We do not agree that a transition to a percentage measurement best serves the public health objectives. First, a percentage m easure would only be applicable to those engaged in ongoing submission, and as indicated in an earl ier response, we are allowing four different situations to meet the measure. Second, we believe that the requirement to submit information would be under applicable law, the agreemen ts between the provider and PHA, or through meaningful use which requires submissions except where prohibited, so it is not necessary for meaningful use to monitor the already mandated submission. Fo r greater clarif ication, we describe successful ongoing submission as electr onic submission of repor table data during the normal course of a provider's operations. This is not to say all data that is reportable is sent to the PHA. A provider who is submitting any reportable data during their normal course of their operations is engaged in ongoing su bmission. A provider that can only submit reportable data in a test environment or other circumstance that is not part of their normal operations would not be engaged in ongoing submission. Where a measure states \"in accordance with applicable law and practice,\" this reflects that some public health jurisdictions may have unique requirements for reporting and that some may not currently accept electronic da ta reports. In the former case, the proposed criteria for this objective will not preempt otherwise applicable state or local laws that govern reporting. In the latter case, EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will be excluded from reporting. Comment : Several commenters requested the rem oval of \"except where prohibited\" from the objective, while others expressed support for this phrase. Those that di d not support note that CMS does not have the authority to direct repor ting if not required by la w or regulations, while supporters applauded CMS for supporting reporting where allowed but not required by law. 210 Several commenters suggested removing the phra se \"in accordance with a pplicable law,\" while other commenters wrote in support of the addition of the phrase. Response : We disagree with the commenters su ggesting removal of these phrases and will keep them as part of the final rule. The phrase \"except where prohibited\" is meant to allow exemptions from reporting for providers who cannot by law report to the pub lic health authority within their jurisdiction. For example, a sovere ign Indian Nation may not be permitted to report immunization registry data to th e public health authority in th eir jurisdiction. The phrase is meant to encourage reporting if a provider is authorized to do so. The \"in accordance with applicable law\" phrase allows public health au thorities to utilize their existing laws and regulations for reporting. Proposed Objective: Capability to submit electronic da ta to immunization registries or immunization information systems except where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. We proposed to include this objective in the St age 2 core set for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs as recommended by the HITPC. We di scussed in the proposed rule that the Stage 1 objective and measure acknowledged that our nation's public health IT infrastructure is not universally capable of receiving electronic i mmunization data from CEHRT, either due to technical or resource readiness. Immunizati on programs, their reporting providers and federal funding agencies, such as the CDC, ONC, and CMS, have worked diligently since the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009 to facilitate EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs ability to meet the Stage 1 measure. We proposed for Stage 2 to take th e next step from testing to requiring actual submission of immunization data. In order to achieve improved population health, providers who administer immunizations must share that data electronically, to avoid missed opportunities 211 or duplicative vaccinations. Stage 3 is likely to e nhance this functionality to permit clinicians to view the entire immunization registry/immunization information system record and support bi-directional information exchange. We proposed that the threshold for Stage 2 should move from simply testing the electronic submission of immuniza tion data (with follow-up submissi on if the test is successful) to ongoing submission. However, we asked for co mments on the challenges that moving this objective from the menu set to the core set would present for EPs and hospitals. Comment : Some commenters suggest ed that the term immunization information systems was all encompassing making the inclusion of immunizatio n registries redundant. Response : We agree that an information system could include registries; however, we do not believe that modifying the objective serves a distinct purpose a nd could confuse those accustomed to the term immunization registries. Comment : Commenters, although supportive of m oving immunization registry reporting from menu to core, expressed concern that PHAs did not have the capacity to accept electronic data from additional providers. Response : We agree that not all PHAs will have the resources to onboard providers for immunization registry reporting. Th e final rule allows for an EP or hospital to be excluded from the measure if they operate in a jurisdiction fo r which no immunization re gistry is capable of accepting data. We further clarify that this excepti on applies not only if the technical capacity to receive the data does not exist, bu t also if the resources are not av ailable within the public health authority to initiate ongoing subm ission with the EP or hospital. We also permit (as earlier stated) an EP or hospital to meet the measure so long as they have registered to submit and are either still in the process of testing and validati on (within the time limits established earlier), or 212 are still awaiting an invi tation to begin submission. Comment : Numerous commenters encouraged the inclusion of bidirect ional exchange of data with immunization registri es. Many commenters noted that the EP or eligible hospital cannot take advantage of rich data and clinical decision support contained within an immunization registry without bidirectional exchange. Response : While we agree that the need for bidi rectional data exchange is clear, this measure aligns more with the goals of Stage 3 meaningful use stated in the proposed rule. Additionally, the standards and mechanisms for bi directional data exchan ge need to be more standardized across public health authorities. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (j)(15)(i) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(1 2)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure: Successful ongoing submission of electronic immunization data from CEHRT to an immunization registry or im munization information system for the entire EHR reporting period. Comment : Many commenters noted the lack of na tional standards for the collection of immunization data with specific examples such as CVS versus MVX coding vocabularies and also noted the need for centralized data collection at a national level. Commenters noted that the lack of standardization results in cost-p rohibitive compliance with this measure. Response : We agree that during the impl ementation of Stage 1 reporting of immunization data, the need for a more harm onized standard for immunization reporting was highlighted. To address this issue, the option of using version HL7 2.3.1 versus 2.5.1 for certification was removed and now only an HL7 2.5.1 message can be used for Stage 2 reporting of immunization data. The implementation gui de for HL7 2.5.1 has been updated to remove 213 much of the variability across states for immuni zation registry reporting. However, if EPs prior to CY 2014 and eligible hospitals and CAHs prior to FY2014 have achieved successful ongoing submission using EHR technology certified to th e 2011 Edition EHR certificat ion criteria (HL7 2.3.1 only) it is acceptable to continue this ongo ing submission and meet the Stage 2 measure for as long as HL7 2.3.1 continues to be accepted by the immunizations information system or immunization registry. EPs and eligible hospita ls and CAHs conducting submissions using HL7 2.5.1 will be able to get their arrangement certifie d to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria. After consideration of the public comments received, we ar e finalizing this measure at for EPs at 495.6 (j)(15)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 495.6(l)(12 )(ii) as proposed, but we modify the exclusions to conform with the gene ral criteria for public health objectives and to address redundancy in two of the proposed exclusi ons. In the general criteria for public health objectives section we established a centralized repository of info rmation about PHA capacity. If a PHA does not provide capacity information to this repository in time for it to be made available to providers at the start of their EHR reporting period, then the providers in that PHA's jurisdiction will meet the modified exclusion. We proposed two exclusions: (1) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no immunization registry or immunization information system is capable of receiving electr onic immunization data in the specific standards required for CEHRT at the start of their EHR repor ting period; and(2) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no imm unization registry or immunization information system is capable of accepting the version of the standard that the EP, eligible hospital or CAH's CEHRT can send at the start of their EHR reporting period. In both cases the limitation is the ability of the immunization registry or im munization information system to receive immunization data in the sta ndards required by ONC for EHR certification in 2014. Therefore, 214 we are combining these exclusions. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(f)(1) and (f)(2). However, if EPs prior to CY 2014 and el igible hospitals and CAHs prior to FY 2014 have achieved successful ongoing submission using EHR technology certified to the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria (HL7 2.3.1 only), it is acceptable to continue this ongoing submission and meet the Stage 2 measure for as long as HL7 2.3.1 continues to be accepted by the immunizations information system or immunizati on registry. We note th at our decision to continue to permit the use of EHR technology certified to the 2011 Ed ition EHR certification criteria is a special circumstance and emphasize th at EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will still need EHR technology certified to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria in order to meet the CEHRT definition beginning with th e FY/CY 2014 EHR reporting period. Exclusions : Any EP, eligible hospital or CAH th at meets one or more of the following criteria may be excluded from this objective: (1) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH does not administer any of the immunizations to any of th e populations for which data is collected by their jurisdiction's immunization regi stry or immunization inform ation system during the EHR reporting period; (2) the EP, elig ible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no immunization registry or immunization informati on system is capable of accepting the specific standards required for CEHRT at the start of their EHR reporting period (3) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction wh ere no immunization regi stry or immunization information system provides information timely on capability to receive immunization data; or (4) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no immunization registry or immunization information system that is cap able of accepting the specific standards required 215 by CEHRT at the start of their EHR reporting peri od can enroll additional EPs, eligible hospitals or CAHs. The second exclusion will not apply if an en tity designated by the immunization registry or immunization information system can receiv e electronic immunization da ta submissions. For example, if the immunization registry cannot accept the data directly or in the standards required by CEHRT, but if it has designated a Health Info rmation Exchange to do so on their behalf and the Health Information Exchange is capable of accepting the information in the standards required by CEHRT, the provider could not claim the second exclusion. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective: Capability to submit electronic reportable laboratory results to public health agencies, except where prohib ited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. We proposed that this objective is in the Stag e 2 core set for eligible hospitals and CAHs. The same rationale for the proposed changes betw een this proposed objective and that of Stage 1 are discussed earlier under the immunization regist ry objective. Please refe r to that section for details on our proposals in this regard. Comment : Commenters, although supportive of m oving electronic laboratory reporting from menu to core, expressed concern that PHAs did not have the capacity to accept electronic data from additional providers. Response : We agree that not all PHAs will have the resources to onboard providers for electronic laboratory reporting. Th e final rule allows for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to be excluded from the measure if they operate in a ju risdiction for which no public health authority is capable of accepting electronic laboratory data. We further clarify that this exception applies not only if the technical capacity to receive the data do es not exist, but also if the resources are not 216 available within the public health authority to initia te ongoing submission with the EP, eligible hospital or CAH. We also permit (as earlier stat ed) an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet the measure so long as they have registered to submit and are either still in th e process of testing and validation, or are still awaiting an invitation to begin submission. Comment : Many commenters noted that lack of standards for reporting electronic laboratory data to public health authorities and also noted th e variety of transport methods needed to support reporting to public health. Response : ONC has adopted an updated implemen tation guide for electronic laboratory reporting from EHR technology in its 2014 Edition EH R certification criteria . Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in coordination with th e Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have created the national Reporting Condition Mapping Table (http://www.cdc.gov/EHRmeaningfuluse/rcmt.html ) that provides further guidance on appropriate vocabularies usable for reportable conditions across th e country for reporting of ELR data. Comment : Several commenters wrote in favor of expansion of this requirement to be inclusive of the surveillance of health care associated infections (HAI). Response : While we agree that the reporting of healthcare associated infections is a critical part of public health surveillance, the methods and standards for reporting this information require very different standards for electronic laboratory reporting of reportable conditions. This measure aligns more with the goals of Stage 3 meaningful use. Comment : Numerous commenters suggested th at Electronic Labor atory Reporting is outside the scope of EHRs and should be excluded from the objectives. These commenters note that laboratory information systems (LIMS) al ready have ELR capabilities, and most EHRs do 217 not. One commenter expressed concern that repo rting from both laboratories and providers may cause duplicate reporting of a single case. The same commenter stated that may LIMS systems already have functionality to identify which labor atory results need to be reported to public health, which EHRs do not, and that building that capability into EHRs would be duplicative and burdensome. Response : We disagree with the statement that ELR is \"outside the scope of EHRs and should be excluded\" because we share ONC's br oad interpretation of the term EHR technology. Eligible Hospitals can choose to report data directly from a ny kind of EHR technology that has been certified to the certification criteria a dopted by ONC. This could include EHR technology from a single EHR technology developer, a separa te modularly certified component such as a LIMS certified as an EHR Module, or the technica l capability offered by an HIE that is certified as an EHR Module for elec tronic laboratory reporting. After consideration of the public comments, we are finalizing this objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 495.6(l)(13)(i)as proposed. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure: Successful ongoing submission of electronic reportable laboratory results from CEHRT to a public health agency for the entire EHR reporting period as authorized, and in accord ance with applicable State law and practice.. Please refer to the general public health di scussion regarding use of intermediaries. Most comments received related to this measure have been addressed in the discussion of public health objectives in general or in the di scussion of the objective associated with this measure. Comment: Commenters pointed out that the prop osed measure includes the statement \"as authorized, and in accordance with applicable State law and practice\". Some commenters 218 believed the phrase was simply redundant to the ob jective and was inconsistent with the other public health measures. Other commenters expr essed concern that the addition of the phrase implied a more restrictive measure than other public health measures particularly with the limit to state law as opposed to just law. Response: We agree with commenters that this phrase is redundant to the objective and may introduce confusion. Therefore, we are re vising this measure to remove the phrase and make it consistent with the other public health measures. Based on consideration of those comments, we are modifying this measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(13)(i i) tosuccessful ongoing submission of electronic reportable laboratory results from CEHRT to a public health agency for the entire EHR reporting period\". We also modify the exclusions to conform with th e general criteria for public health objectives. In the general criteria for public h ealth objectives, we plan to esta blish a centralized repository of PHA capacity information. If a PHA does not provid e capacity information to this repository in time for it to be made available to providers at the start of their EHR re porting period, then the providers in that PHA's jurisdiction will meet th e modified exclusion. If the repository is not established, the eligible hospital or CAH must consult their PHA jurisdiction for guidance. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an eligible hospital or CAH must use the capabilities and sta ndards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(f)(4). Exclusions : The eligible hospital or CAH that meets one or more of the following criteria may be excluded from this objective: (1) operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency is capable of r eceiving electronic reportable labora tory results in the specific standards required for Certified EHR Technology at the start of the EH R reporting period; (2) operates in a jurisdiction where no public he alth agency provides information timely on 219 capability to receive electronic re portable laboratory results or (3) the eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no public he alth agency that is capable of accepting the specific standards required by CEHRT at the start of their EHR reporting period can enroll additional eligible hospitals or CAHs. Proposed Objective: Capability to submit electroni c syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies except where prohibite d, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. We proposed that this objective is in the Stag e 2 core set for eligib le hospitals and CAHs and the Stage 2 menu set for EPs. The Stage 1 objective and measure acknowledged that our nation's public health IT infrastructure is not universally capable of receiving syndromic surveillance data from CEHRT, e ither due to technical or reso urce readiness. Given public health IT infrastructure improvements and new implementation guidance, for Stage 2, we proposed that this objective and measure be in th e core set for hospitals and in the menu set for EPs. It is our understanding from hospitals and the CDC that many hospitals already send syndromic surveillance data. The CDC has i ssued the PHIN Messaging Guide for Syndromic Surveillance: Emergency Depart ment and Urgent Care Data [http://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/Syndromic.html ] as cited in the ONC final rule on EHR standards and certification. However, per the CDC and a 2010 survey completed by the Association of State and Territori al Health Officials (ASTHO), ve ry few public health agencies are currently accepting syndromic surveillance data from ambulatory, non-hospital providers, and there is no corresponding implementation guide at the time of this final rule. CDC is working with the syndromic surveillance community to develop a new implementation guide for ambulatory and inpatient discha rge reporting of syndromic surv eillance information, which it 220 expects will be available in the spring 2013. We anticip ate that Stage 3 might include syndromic surveillance for EPs in the core set if the collection of ambul atory syndromic data becomes a more standard public health practice in the interim. The HIT Policy Committee recommended making this a core objective for Stage 2 for EPs and hospitals. However, we did not propose to adopt their recommendation for EPs. We specifically invited comment on th e proposal to leave syndromic surveillance in the menu set for EPs, while requiring it in the core set for eligible hospitals and CAHs. Comment : Commenters noted that keeping the objective as menu for EPs is still problematic as most public health agencies are unable to accept the data. Commenters also expressed that for providers that have already reporting this object ive, it makes sense to keep it as a menu set option. Response : We agree that although not all public health authorities are able to accept syndromic surveillance data from Eligible Prof essionals, since many EPs already report this measure and some public health authorities have the ability to accept this data, the measure will remain as a menu set option. Comment : Commenters noted that moving the obj ective as core is premature due to public health readiness. Commenters also ex pressed that for hospitals that have already reporting this objective, it makes sense to move the measure to core. Response : We agree that not all pu blic health authorities are able to accept syndromic surveillance data from hospitals; however, our exclusion criteria addresses this situation. Since many hospitals already report this measure and many public health authorities have the ability to accept this data, the measure will remain as core. If there are no public h ealth authorities for the hospitals to report syndromic surveillance da ta to, the hospital can claim an exemption 221 Comment : Many commenters noted that lack of standards for reporting syndromic surveillance data to publi c health authorities. Response : While a single national implement ation guide exists for syndromic surveillance data of emergency department data from hospitals, currently an implementation guide does not exist for syndromic surveillance re porting from the eligible professional. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working in conjunction wi th the International Society for Disease Surveillance and draft guidan ce is currently available for the reporting of ambulatory based syndromic surveillance. Comment : Several comments expressed concern about the level of reporting. Concern was expressed from entities with multiple locatio ns that would need to report by facility or provider lever rather th an as an organization. Response : Currently public health departments that collect syndromic surveillance data streamline the data collection process and collect data at an organiza tion or facility level depending on the provider. Syndromic surveillance data is not collected at the provider level, although attestation would be at the provider level where repor ting by a single organization or facility could count for multiple providers. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this objective for EPs in the menu set at \u00a7495.6(k)(3)(i) and for elig ible hospitals and CAHs in the core set at \u00a7495.6(l)(14)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure: Successful ongoing submission of electronic syndromic surveillance data from CEHRT to a public health agency for the entire EHR reporting period. All comments received related to this measur e have been addressed in the discussion of public health objectives in general or in the di scussion of the objective associated with this 222 measure. After consideration of these public comments, we ar e finalizing this measure as proposed for EPs in the menu set at \u00a7495.6(k)(3)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs in the core set at \u00a7495.6(l)(14)(ii) as proposed, but we modify the ex clusions to conform with the general criteria for public health objectives and to address redundancy in two of the proposed exclusions. In the general criteri a for public health objectives, we plan to establish a centralized repository of PHA capacity information. If a PHA does not provide capacity information to this repository in time for it to be made available to providers at the start of their EHR reporting period, then the providers in that PHA's jurisd iction will meet the modified exclusion. We proposed two exclusions: (1) th e EP, eligible hospital, or C AH operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency is capable of rece iving electronic syndromic surveillance data in the specific standards required for Certified EHR Technology at the start of their EHR reporting period; and (2) the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency is capable of accepting the version of the standard that the EP's, eligible hospital's or CAH's CEHRT can send at the start of th eir EHR reporting period. In both cases the limitation is the ability of the PHA to receive syndromic surveillance data in the standards required by ONC for EHR certification in 2014. Ther efore, we are combining these exclusions. We expect that the CDC will be issui ng (in Spring 2013) the CDC PHIN Messaging Guide for Ambulatory Syndromic Surveillance a nd we may rely on this guide to determine which categories of EPs will not collect such information. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(f)(3). However, if EPs prior to CY 2014 and eligible hospitals and CAHs prior to FY 2014 have achieved successful ongoing submission using EHR technology certified to the 2011 Edition 223 EHR certification criteria (HL7 2.3.1 only), it is acceptable to continue this ongoing submission and meet the Stage 2 measure for as long as HL7 2.3.1 continues to be accepted by the PHA in that jurisdiction. We note that our decision to con tinue to permit the use of EHR technology certified to the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria is a spec ial circumstance and emphasize that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will still need EHR technol ogy certified to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria in order to meet the CEHRT definition beginning with the FY/CY 2014 EHR reporting period. Exclusions : Any EP, eligible hospital or CAH th at meets one or more of the following criteria may be excluded from this objective: (1 ) the EP is not in a ca tegory of providers that collect ambulatory syndromic surveillance in formation on their patients during the EHR reporting period; (2) the eligible hospital or CAH does not have an emergency or urgent care department; (3) the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency is capable of receiving electroni c syndromic surveillance data in the specific standards required by CEHRT at the start of th eir EHR reporting period; (4) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction wher e no public health agency provides information timely on capability to receive syndromic surveill ance data; or (5) the EP, eligible hospital or CAH operates in a jurisdiction for which no public he alth agency that is capable of accepting the specific standards required by CEHRT at the start of their EHR reporting period can enroll additional EPs, eligible hospitals or CAHs.. As was described under the immunization re gistry measure, the third and fourth exclusions do not apply if the PHA has designate d an HIE organization or other intermediary to collect this information on its behalf and that intermediary can do so in the specific Stage 2 standards and/or the same standard as the pr ovider's CEHRT. An urgent care department 224 delivers ambulatory care, usually on an unscheduled, walk-in basis, in a fac ility dedicated to the delivery of medical care, but not classified as a hospital emergency department. Urgent care centers are primarily used to treat patients who ha ve an injury or illness that requires immediate care but is not serious enough to wa rrant a visit to an emergency de partment. Often urgent care centers are not open on a continuous basis, unlik e a hospital emergency department, which will be open at all times. (d) New Core and Menu Set Objectives and Measures for Stage 2 We proposed the following objectives for inclusi on in the core set for Stage 2: \"Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transmit information about a hospital admission\" and \"Automatically track medication orders us ing an electronic medication administration record (eMAR)\" for hospitals; \"Use secure electronic messaging to communicate with patients\" for EPs. We proposed all other new objectives for inclusion in the menu set for Stage 2. While the HIT Policy Committee reco mmended making all objectives mandatory and eliminating the menu option, we believe a menu set is necessary for some of these new objectives in order to give pr oviders an opportunity to implem ent new technologies and make changes to workflow processes a nd to provide maximum flexibility for providers in specialties that may face particular challenges in meeting new objectives. Proposed Objective: Imaging results and informa tion are accessible through CEHRT. In the proposed rule, we outlined the following benefits for this objective. Making the image that results from diagnostic scans and accompanying inform ation accessible through CEHRT increases the utility and efficiency of both the imaging technology and the CEHRT. The ability to share the results of imaging scans w ill likewise improve the efficiency of all health care providers and increase their ability to share information with their patients. This will reduce 225 the cost and radiation exposure from tests that ar e repeated solely because a prior test is not available to the provider. We stated in the proposed rule that most of the enabling steps to incorporating imaging relate to the certification of EHR technologies. As with the objective for incorporating lab results, we encourage the use of electronic exch ange to incorporate imaging results into the CEHRT, but in absence of such exchange it is acceptable to manually add the image and accompanying information to CEHRT. Comment : Some commenters expresse d concerns over the ability of CEHRT to store the images. Response : We did not propose that CEHRT stor e the images. Storing the images natively in CEHRT is one way to make them accessible through CEHRT, but there are many other ways. Comment : Commenters stated that unless a HIE organization existed to facilitate imaging exchange, building out an unique interfa ce for each imaging provider is cost prohibitive. Second, commenters were concerned that because stand-alone radiology cen ters are not subject to the EHR Incentive Program they may not agreei ng to provide their images electronically to the provider through their EHR. These commente rs therefore suggest that it is premature to include this objective. Response : We agree that many advances in infrast ructure are needed to fully enable this objective. We believe that from publication of this final rule to the start of Stage 2 significant progress will be made in part due to the inclusi on of this objective in St age 2. We do agree that these improvements in infrastruc ture will vary based on local conditions such as the presence of HIEs, the willingness of radiology centers to link to EHRs, and ot her factors and note that is a 226 primary reason for this being a menu objective. We will also consider these comments below in relation to setting the thre shold for the measure. Comment : The resolution required for viewing im aging for diagnostic purposes requires specific hardware which would be cost prohibiti ve for all EPs. CMS should clarify that the image can be of any resolution. Response : We do not impose limitations on the reso lution of the image. To the extent this is a concern, it would be a capability of CEHRT not a requ irement of meaningful use. Comment : Commenters requested clarification on whether both the image itself and the accompanying results and information must be available, or just one or the other. Response : The objective as proposed was intended to convey that the image itself is the result and that narratives/explanations a nd other information would be the additional information. Due to the many comments we rece ived requesting clarific ation, we are revising the objective for clarity. Comment : Commenters requested a more specific definition of imaging. Response : We believe that imaging is a well understood term in the provider community. However, we agree that a more specific definition is required for purposes of measuring meaningful use. We adopt the description of radiology services from the Stage 2 CPOE objective as the minimum description of imaging. Providers are free to use a more expansive definition of imaging. After review of the comments, we are revi sing the objective for EP s at 495.6 (k)(1)(i) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 495.6(m)(2)(i) to \"Imaging results consisting of the image itself and any explanation or other accompanying informati on are accessible through CEHRT.\" Proposed Measure: More than 40 percent of all scans and tests whose result is one or 227 more images ordered by the EP or by an author ized provider of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emerge ncy department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are acce ssible through CEHRT. For Stage 2, we did not propose the image or accompanying information (for example, radiation dose) be required to be structured data . Images and imaging results that are scanned into the CEHRT may be counted in the numerator of this measure. We defined accessible as either incorporation of the image and accompanying information into CEHRT or an indication in CEHRT that the image and accompanying informa tion are available for a given patient in another technology and a link to that image and accompanying information. Incorporation of the image means that the image and accompanying inform ation is stored by the CEHRT. We did not propose that meaningful use would impose any a dditional retention requirements on the image. A link to the image and accompanying information means that a link to where the image and accompanying information is stored is available in CEHRT. This link must conform to the certification requirements associated with th is objective in the ONC final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We encouraged comments on the necessary level of specification and what those specifica tions should be to define accessible and what constitutes a direct link. Comment : Commenters suggested that the prop osed threshold of 40 percent was too high given the dependency on the image provider and electronic exchange infrastructure discussed in the objective. The most popular su ggested threshold was 10 percent. Commenters also suggested that an exclusion be created for providers who have no access to electronic images. A few of the commenters pointed to the lack of an imaging provider that could make electronic images available. Others were concer ned that when a provider uses multiple imaging 228 providers, 40 percent might be too high of a thres hold even if at least one imaging provider that could make electronic images available. Response : After reviewing the comments, we ag ree that 40 percent is too high of a threshold for this measure and revise it to 10 pe rcent. Providers, especially EPs, may use many imaging providers, and we do not want an EP to have to defer this objective simply because they have three imaging providers, and the one al lowing electronic access represents less than 40 percent of their orders. The co mment regarding complete lack of an imaging provider that could make electronic images available speaks to the need for an exclusion. In considering an exclusion for those providers who have no access to electronic images, we take into account that it is a menu objective and also that there may be providers who fall into a situation where access is more than zero, but less than 10 percent. In re gards to the menu, while it is true that a provider may defer this measure, the number of measures in the menu set are fewer and more specialized than in Stage 1. Furthermore, as an exclus ion no longer counts towards meeting a menu objective, we are not concerned providers would choose this objective only to exclude it. For this reason, we are finalizing an exclusion for pr oviders who have no access to electronic images. For those who cannot meet the 10 percent threshold even with access to an imaging provider who makes electronic images available, deferral remains a possibility as well as shifting more orders to imaging providers that do allow electronic access. Comment : Several commenters disagreed with the proposed exclusion for EPs and believed it was inconsistent with the objective. These commenters believe the objective is intended for EPs who order imaging, whether or not they interpret the imaging studies themselves. These commenters suggested changi ng the exclusion to \"Any EP who orders (less than 100/50/no) diagnostic scans or tests whos e result is an image during the EHR reporting 229 period\". Response : Our intention with th e proposed exclusion was to distinguish between ordering providers who have need of the imag e and those that do not. Based on the comments the need to view the image depends on a combina tion of factors includin g previous experiences with the type of image, the imag ing facility, the circumstances of the patient, whether a similar image has been ordered before fo r the patient and the reading clinician. Given the wide variety of factors, we agree that it is not possible to create a distinct line between ordering providers who need the image and those that do not. We believe this line can be partly drawn by adopting the exclusion recommended by comments with a high count of 100. This is both consistent with our other objectives and as a high number indicates a particular benefit to the provider as well as increasing the likelihood that factors align fo r the ordering provider to need the image. Comment : Commenters stated that the use of the term \"scan\" is confusing and unnecessary. Scan frequently app lies to actions and concepts othe r than certain types of imaging procedures. Response : We agree that the term scan has multip le uses, as any scan would be an image and could be classified as a test. Therefore, we remove the word scan from the measure as duplicative. After reviewing the comments, we modify the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(1)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(2)(ii) to: More than 10 percent of all tests whose result is one or more images ordered by the EP or by an authorized provider of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpa tient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are accessible through CEHRT. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible 230 hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(12). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this measure: Denominator : Number of tests whose result is one or more images ordered by the EP or by an authorized provider on behalf of the elig ible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 and 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of results in the de nominator that are accessible through CEHRT. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be mo re than 10 percent in order to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who orders less than 100 te sts whose result is an image during the EHR reporting period; or Any EP who has no access to electronic imaging results at the start of the EHR reporting period. No access means that none of the imaging pr oviders used by the EP provide electronic images and any explanation or other accompanyi ng information that are accessible through their CEHRT at the start of the EHR reporting period. We solicited comments on a potential sec ond measure for this objective that would encourage the exchange of imaging and results betw een providers. We considered a threshold of 10 percent of all scans and tests whose result is one or more images ordered by the EP or by an authorized provider of the eligible hospital or CAH for patients admitted to its inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period and accessible through CEHRT also be exchanged with another provider of care. 231 Comment : While most commenters agree with th e principle of exchange of images among providers of care, they near ly all agreed that th is measure would be premature for Stage 2 due to infrastructure concerns. Some suggested th at it be considered for St age 3 as a logical next step from our proposed Stage 2 measure. Response : Given the comments, we ar e not including this measur e in our final rule. We will consider the input provided when we develop our proposal for Stage 3. Proposed Objective: Record patient family health history as structured data In the proposed rule, we noted that every provider currently requests a family health history from the patient in order to obtain it. However, EHRs can allow the patient to contribute directly to the record and a llow the record to be shared among providers, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency of collecting family health histories. Family health history is a major risk indicator for a variety of chronic conditions for which e ffective screening and prevention tools are available. Comment : Commenters generally supported the in clusion of recording family health history as a menu set measure for EPs, eligib le hospitals and CAHs, while some suggested deferring the measure until Stage 3 when they exp ect more robust standards will be available. Some commenters also suggested family health history is best collected by primary care physicians, not hospitals. Others still suggested modifying this objective to allow for the use of unstructured data. Response : ONC has adopted standards requirin g CEHRT to be able to use SNOMED- CT or the HL7 Pedigree standard to record a patient's family health history. We refer readers to ONC's standards and certification cr iteria final rule that is publis hed elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . As a readily available standard is being adopted, we are maintaining this 232 objective as proposed and including it in the menu set. We continue to believe that family history is part of regular physic ian and hospital workflow - even if it's collected at a very high level. While it may primarily be the physicians working in the hospital that consider this information, these same physicians typically use the hospital EHR when evaluating their hospitalized patients so having this information in the hospital EHR is just as important as having it in the physician's own EHR. We will also finalize the exclusion for EPs who have no office visits during the EHR repor ting period to account for scope of practice concerns and the common collection of this inform ation directly from patients. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(2)(i) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(3)(i) as proposed. Proposed Measure: More than 20 percent of all un ique patients seen by the EP, or admitted to the eligible hospital or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period have a structured data entry for one or more first-degree relatives. We proposed to adopt the defi nition of first degree relative used by the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health. A first degree relative is a family member who shares about 50 percent of their genes with a particular individual in a family. First degree relatives include parents, offspring, and siblings. We considered other definitions, including those that address both affinity a nd consanguinity relati onships and encourage comments on this definition. We noted that this is a minimum and not a limitation on the health history that can be recorded. We did not propose a time limita tion on the indication that the family health history has been reviewed. The re cent nature of this capability in EHRs will impose a de facto limitation on review to the recent past. 233 We proposed an exclusion to this measure fo r EPs who have no office visits during the EHR reporting period. We believe that EPs who do not have office visits will not have the face-to-face contact with patients necessary to obtain family health history information. Comment : Many commenters wondered why record ing family health history was limited to first-degree relatives. They noted that a patient's grandpare nts or other relatives may have equally relevant medical information that should be included in the EHR. Other commenters pointed out that not all patients may know their fa mily health history, particularly patients who were adopted, and suggested including a code for \" unknown\" or \"not relevant.\" They noted that in some cultures, the patient may not be willing to provide the data or that the data they have may be unreliable (such as informal a doptions in Native American tribes). Response : While information about second degr ee relatives may be useful for some diagnoses and conditions, we belie ve collecting medical history from first degree relatives is the floor, not the ceiling and encourage providers to co llect additional information as they see fit. Additionally, we understand concerns about patient s who may not know their family history. In these situations, we would find it acceptable for th e provider to record the patient's family history as \"unknown.\" Either a structured data entry of \"unknown\" or any structured data entry identified as part of the patient's family history a nd conforming to the standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(13) must be in the provider's CEHRT for th e patient to count in the numerator. Comment : Some commenters suggested we in troduce this measure with a lower threshold as this is a new requirement, but did not specify a threshold. Th ey noted that providers who might have previously captured family history might not have that in a structured format or not coded against the standards chosen for CEHRT. This history would have to be 234 redocumented. Response : We proposed a low threshold of 20 percen t. As this measure is not reliant on other organizations and providers the way imaging is we do not believe that is necessary to lower the threshold further. Comment : Some commenters suggested this meas ure may not apply to certain specialty providers (for example, Urgent Care, Ort hopedics) and suggested including an exclusion. Response : We proposed an exclusion to this measure for EPs who have no office visits during the EHR reporting period. We continue to believe that EPs who do not have office visits would not have the face-to-face contact with pati ents necessary to obtain family health history information. However, this exclusion may not apply to certain specia lty providers (like the aforementioned). We continue believe that r ecording family health history, regardless of specialty, is can be an important indicator for chronic conditions. Additionally, as this measure is being finalized as part of th e menu set, providers are not requir ed to report on this objective. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(2)(ii) and for e ligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(3)(i i) to \"More than 20 percent of all unique patients seen by the EP, or admitted to the eligible hospital or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23), during th e EHR reporting period have a structured data entry for one or more first-degree relatives\". We are finalizing the exclusion as proposed at \u00a749 5.6(k)(2)(iii).. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(13). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: 235 Denominator : Number of unique patients seen by the EP or admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency departments (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of patients in the denomina tor with a structured data entry for one or more first-degree relatives. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be mo re than 20 percent in order to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who has no office visi ts during the EHR reporting period. Proposed EP Objective: Capability to identify and repor t cancer cases to a state cancer registry, except where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. We outlined the following benefits of this objective in the proposed rule. Reporting to cancer registries by EPs would addr ess current underreporting of cancer , especially certain types. In the past most cancers were diagnosed and/or treated in a hospital setting and data were primarily collected from this source. Howeve r, medical practice is changing rapidly and an increasing number of cancer cases are never seen in a hospital or are care d for primarily in the outpatient setting. Data collection from EPs presents new challenges since the infrastructure for reporting is less mature than it is in hospitals. Certified EHR technology can address this barrier by identifying reportable cancer cases and treat ments to the EP and facilitating electronic reporting either automatically or upon verification by the EP. We proposed to include \"except where prohibi ted and in accordance with applicable law and practice\" because we want to encourage all EPs to submit cancer cases, even in rare cases where they are not required to by state/local la w. Legislation requiri ng cancer reporting by EPs exists in 49 states with some variation in specific requirement s, per the 2010 Council of State 236 and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) (http://www.cste.org/dnn/Program sandActivities/PublicHealthInformatics/StateReportableCondit ionsQueryResults/tabid/261/Default. aspx).\" If EPs are authorized to submit, they should do so even if it is not required by e ither law or practice.\" In acco rdance with applicable law and practice\" reflects that some public health ju risdictions may have unique requirements for reporting, and that some may not currently accept el ectronic provider reports. In the former case, the proposed criteria for this objective would not pr eempt otherwise applicable state or local laws that govern reporting. In the latte r case, eligible professionals would be exempt from reporting. Comment : Nearly all commenters who wrote in support of the objective stated that the rule would decrease reporting burden for EPs b ecause cancer diagnosis reporting in mandatory in most states. One commenter noted that the rule may increase compliance with mandatory reporting by reducing time and effort needed to submit cancer diagnosis report. Also, it was noted that incorporation of cancer reporting in meaningful use Stag e 2 for eligible providers will improve completeness and quality of cancer re porting. Conversely, seve ral of the commenters who recommended moving the objective to Stage 3 or remove the objective completely stated that inclusion of this object would place undue burden on EPs, especially because primary care providers rarely report to can cer registries. A commenter noted that the necessary EHR functionality currently exists primarily in oncol ogy specialty EHRs, and EPs may be required to purchase additional modules to meet this object , and further states that this would be cost-prohibitive to EPs who only rarely diagnos e cancer. One commenter suggested that the detailed reporting requirements would be too time-consuming for most EPs. Another commenter questions if responsibility for re porting cases, or presumptive cases , would shift to primary care providers. Other commenters suggest that the objective should be removed until such time that a 237 national central repository can be established to simplif y point-to-point connections. Response : We agree that inclusion of this requirement is likel y to reduce reporting burden for those already required to report to cancer registries. We also agree with commenters that this objective is not relevant to all prov iders. For those EPs who do not meet the proposed exclusion of not diagnosing or di rectly treating cancer, yet are not already under a requirement to report to cancer registries, we note that this is a menu objectiv e and can be deferred. Between the proposed exclusions and the option to defe r, we do not believe the measure imposes a reporting burden on providers who would not normally report to cancer registries. Comment : The objectives of specialized registri es and cancer registri es reporting should be combined. Response : In review of comments we found no compelling reason to change our proposal. No commenter disputed that the reporti ng to cancer registries has different level of existing reporting requirements and supporting standards than ot her specialized registries. Comment : One commenter suggested changing the final rule to read, \"public health central cancer registry\" to clea rly distinguish them from hosp ital-based cancer registries. Response : We agree that the term public health cen tral cancer registry is better than just cancer registries and more inclusive than just st ate cancer registries as used in the proposed objective, but not the proposed measure. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are modifying this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(4)(i) to \"Cap ability to identify and report cancer cases to a public health central cancer registry, except where prohibited, and in a ccordance with applicable law and practice.\" Proposed EP Measure: Successful ongoing submission of ca ncer case information from CEHRT to a cancer registry fo r the entire EHR reporting period. 238 Comment : Commenters are concerned that und er the proposed menu set providers will be required to choose one of: (1) syndromic surv eillance; (2) submitting to cancer registries; or (3) submitting to specialty registries if they do not meet the exclusions for all three. The commenters believe that CMS s hould be providing physicians with a legitimate selection of menu set measures from which to choose. Response : Stage 2 does contain a more specialized and smaller menu set than Stage 1. We see this as a natural result of moving up th e staged path towards improved outcomes. We also see it as necessary for meaningful use to be applicable to all EPs. We use exclusions to ensure that only those EPs who create reportable data have the obligati on under meaningful use to report it so this would not be a barrier to m eeting meaningful use. Furthermore, we added an objective to the menu set in this final rule for EP s so it is no longer true that an EP would be required to pick one of the three menu objectives mentioned by commenters. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are modifying this measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(4)(ii) to \"Successful ongoing submission of cancer case information from CEHRT to a public health central cancer regist ry for the entire EH R reporting period\" and modify the exclusions to conform with the general criteria for public health objectives. We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT 45 CFR 170.314(a),(c) (l), (f)(5), and (f)(6). Exclusions : Any EP that meets at least 1 of the following criteria may be excluded from this objective: (1) The EP does not diagnose or directly treat cancer; (2) the EP operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency is capable of receiving electronic cancer case information in the specific standards require d for CEHRT at the beginning of their EHR reporting period; (3) the EP operates in a ju risdiction where no PHA provides information 239 timely on capability to receive el ectronic cancer case information; (4) the EP operates in a jurisdiction for which no public health agency that is capable of receiving electronic cancer case information in the specific standards require d for CEHRT at the beginning of their EHR reporting period can enroll additional EPs. Proposed EP Objective: Capability to identify and report specific ca ses to a specialized registry (other than a cancer registry), ex cept where prohibited, and in accordance with applicable law and practice. In the proposed rule, we outlined the following be nefits of this objective. We believe that reporting to registries is an in tegral part of improving population and public health. The benefits of this reporting are not limited to cancer repor ting. We include cancer re gistry reporting as a separate objective because it is more mature in its development than other registry types, not because other reporting is excluded from meaningful use. We have included this objective to provide more flexibility in the menu objectives that EPs can choose. We be lieve that specialized registry reporting could provide many EPs with meaningful use me nu option that is more aligned with their scope of practice. Comment : The overwhelming majority of in dividuals and groups who commented on this objective expressed concern about the lack of specificity of this objective. Their concerns include: (1)lack of specificity of the potential types of regist ries make planning for vendors and EPs very difficult; (2)lack of information abou t who would define which registries may be included; (3) leaving dozens or hundreds of possibilitie s; (4) lack of clarity as to the definition of 'specialized registry; (5) lack of standards for many registries; (6) or potential of needing to comply with standards not identified in the propose d rule; and (7) lack of public health readiness to accept data from EHRs. 240 Response : The purpose of this objective and measur e is to give meaningful use credit to those EPs who are engaged in ongoing submission with specialized registries. It is not expected that every EP will select this objective and meas ure from the menu nor even that every EP will have the capability to submit to a specialized registry. We are purposefully general in our description of specialized registry because we do not wish to ex clude certain registries in an attempt to be more specific. The only limita tion we place on our descri ption of specialized registries is that the specialized registry cannot be duplicative of any of the other registries included in other meaningful use objectives and m easures. This means that an EP cannot meet the immunization, syndromic surveillance or cancer objectives and this objective by reporting to the same registry. EPs who either do not wish to participate with a specialized registry or cannot overcome the barriers to doing so can defer or excl ude this measure as thei r situation warrants. Comment : Commenters expressed support for expansion of the requirement to streamline and improve surveillance of healthcare-associated infec tions (HAIs), with the goal of improving patient care and safety. Response : A registry that is focused on healthca re associated infec tions could certainly be considered a specialized registry. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(5)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measure: Successful ongoing submission of specific case information from CEHRT to a specialized registry for the entire EHR reporting period. Comment : Since the lack of specificity and name d standards make it difficult to select this measure from the menu set, the actual viable measures available in the menu set are reduced to four and burdensome for providers who may n eed to pay for interfaces, costing the EPs extra 241 time and money above the cost of the CEHRT. Response : Stage 2 does contain a mo re specialized and smaller menu set than Stage 1. We see this as a natural result of moving up th e staged path towards improved outcomes. We also see it as necessary for meaningful use to be applicable to all EPs. We include exclusions that allow for those providers who do not create reportable data so ever y provider who would is required to report public health da ta would have public health data to report. Furthermore, we added an objective to the menu in th is final rule for EPs so it is no longer true that an EP would be required to pick one of the three menu objectiv es. The purpose of this measure is to provide meaningful use credit to those providers engaged in the benefi cial use of CEHRT of participating in specialized registries. Othe r EPs can either meet the exclus ions or defer this objective and thereby avoid the burden of comp liance with this objective. Comment : Given the large number of specialized registries, many of which have national scope, the exclusions are rendered meaningless. Response : We agree with this comment, and fo r purposes of the exclusion only, we limit it to registries sponsored by nati onal specialty societies and specia lized registries maintained by PHAs. We believe this provides needed limitati ons on the exclusions. This limitation does not apply to the specialized registries that can be used to satisfy th e measure as the benefits are not limited only to reporting to registries operated by Public Health Agencies or national medical specialty organizations. Specialized registries operated by patient sa fety organizations and quality improvement organizations also enable knowledge generation or process improvement regarding the diagnosis, therapy and prevention of various conditions that affect a population. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we are finalizing this measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(5)(ii) as proposed, but we modify the exclusions to conform with the general 242 criteria for public health objectiv es and in response to comments. We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standa rds of CEHRT 45 CFR 17 0.314(f)(5) and (f)(6). Exclusions : Any EP that meets at least 1 of the following criteria may be excluded from this objective: (1) The EP does not diagnose or directly trea t any disease associated with a specialized registry sponsored by a national specialty society for which the EP is eligible, or the public health agencies in their jurisdiction; (2 ) the EP operates in a jurisdiction for which no specialized registry sponsored by a public health agency or by a national specialty society for which the EP is eligible is capable of receiving electronic specific case information in the specific standards required by CEHRT at the begi nning of their EHR reporting period; (3) the EP operates in a jurisdiction where no public health agency or national specialty society for which the EP is eligible provides information timely on capability to receive information into their specialized registries ; or (4) th e EP operates in a jurisdiction for which no specialized registry sponsored by a public health agency or by a na tional specialty society for which the EP is eligible that is capable of receiving electronic sp ecific case information in the specific standards required by CEHRT at the beginning of their EH R reporting period can enroll additional EPs. Proposed EP Objective: Use secure electronic messagi ng to communicate with patients on relevant health information. In the proposed rule, we outlined the follo wing benefits of using secure electronic messaging to communicate with patients: Electroni c messaging (for example, e-mail) is one of the most widespread methods of communicatio n for both businesses and individuals. The inability to communicate through electronic messaging may hinder the provider-patient relationship. Electronic messaging is very inex pensive on a transactional basis and allows for 243 communication even when the provider and patient ar e not available at the same moment in time. The use of common email services and the security measures that may be used when they are sent may not be appropriate for the exchange of protected health inform ation. Therefore, the exchange of health information through elec tronic messaging requires additional security measures while maintaining its ease of use for communication. While e-mail with the necessary safeguards is probably the most widely used me thod of electronic messaging, for the purposes of meeting this objective, secure electronic messaging could also occur through functionalities of patient portals, PHRs, or other stand- alone secure messaging applications. We proposed this as a core objective for EPs for Stage 2. The additional time made available for Stage 2 implementation made possibl e the inclusion of some new objectives in the core set as proposed in the proposed rule. We c hose to identify objectives that address critical priorities of the country's National Quality Strategy (NQS) (http://www.healthcare.gov/law/ resources/reports/quality03212011a.html), with a focus on one for EPs and one for hospitals. For EPs, secure electronic messaging is crit ically important to two NQS priorities-- Ensuring that each person/family is engaged as partners in their care; and Promoting effective communicat ion and coordination of care. Secure messaging could make care more affordable by using more efficient communication vehicles when appr opriate. Specifically, research demonstrates that secure messaging has been shown to improve patient ad herence to treatment plans, which reduces readmission rates. Secure messaging has also b een shown to increase patient satisfaction with their care. Secure messaging has been named as one of the top ranked features according to patients. Also, despite some trepidation, provi ders have seen a reduc tion in time responding to 244 inquires and less time spent on the phone. We specifically sought comment on whether there may be special concerns with this objec tive in regards to behavioral health. Comment : Some commenters noted that pa tient engagement and enhanced patient-provider communications facilitated by an EHR are important goals, and secure messaging between EPs and patients is an approp riate objective to consider for Meaningful Use criteria. Response : We appreciate the commenters support of this objectiv e and agree that electronic patient-provider communication is important to improving the overall quality of patient care. Comment : Some commenters suggested that this object ive should be part of the menu set instead of a core objective for Stage 2. This w ould permit EPs who do not believe they can meet the measure at this time to select different objectives. Response : As we noted in the proposed rule, we placed this objective in the core because we believe it addresses critical priorities of the country's National Quality Strategy (NQS) (http://www.healthcare. gov/law/resources/rep orts/quality03212011a.html ): Ensuring that each person/family is engaged as partners in thei r care; and promoting effective communication and coordination of care. We also believe that s ecure messaging could make care more affordable by using more efficient communication vehicles when appropriate. Sp ecifically, research demonstrates that secure messaging has been sh own to improve patient adherence to treatment plans, which reduces readmission rates (see Rose nberg SN, role in guide line compliance: a controlled study\" American Journal of Managed Care 14(11):737 -44; Gustafson DH, Hawkins R, Boberg E, Chan a patient-centered, computer-based health 245 information/support system\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine 16(1):1-9). Secure messaging has also been shown to increase patient satisfaction with their care (see Ralston JD, Carrell D, Reid R, Anderson M, Moran M, Herefo rd J (2007) \"Patient web services integrated with a shared medical record: patient use and satisfaction\" Jo urnal of the American Medical Informatics Association 14(6):798-8 06). Therefore, we are leaving this as a core objective for EPs for Stage 2. Comment : Several commenters responded to our question about whether there were special concerns about implementing this object ive for behavioral health patients. These commenters indicated that they did not believe th is objective posed a special concern and that it would help behavioral health patients obtain needed support from clinicians. Response : We appreciate the feedback from co mmenters regarding behavioral health. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6(j)(17)(i) as proposed. Proposed EP Measure: A secure message was sent using the electronic messaging function of CEHRT by more than 10 percent of unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period. Comment : Many commenters voiced objections to the measure of this objective and the concept of providers being held accountable for patient actions. The commenters believed that while providers could be held accountable for ma king electronic messaging capabilities available to patients and encouraging pati ents to use electronic messaging, they could not control whether patients actually utili zed electronic messaging. However, so me commenters believed that the measure was a reasonable and necessary step to require vendors to make electronic messaging tools more widely available and for providers to incorporate electronic messaging into clinical 246 practice. In addition, commenter s pointed to the unique role that providers can play in encouraging and facilitating their patients' and their families' use of secure messaging. Response : While we recognize that EPs cannot directly control whether patients use electronic messaging, we continue to believe that EPs are in a unique position to strongly influence the technologies patients use to impr ove their own care, includ ing secure electronic messaging. We believe that EPs' ability to infl uence patients coupled with the low threshold make this measure achie vable for all EPs. Comment : Other commenters did not object to th e principle of providers being held accountable for patient actions but noted that th e potential barriers of limited internet access, computer access, and electronic messaging platform s for certain populations (for example, rural, elderly, lower income, visually impaired, non-En glish-speaking, etc.) might make the measure impossible to meet for some providers. Comment ers suggested a number of possible solutions to allow providers to overcome these barriers: gran ting exclusions for certain patient populations, lowering the proposed threshold of the measure, or eliminating the percen tage threshold of the measure. Response : We recognize that certain patient populations face greater challenges in utilizing electronic messaging. We address the po tential barrier of limited internet access in the comment regarding a broadband exclusion below. While we agree that excluding certain patient populations from this requirement would make th e measure easier for EPs to achieve, we do not know of any reliable method to quantify these po pulations for each EP in such a way that we could standardize exclusions for each population. In addition, we are concerned that blanket exclusions for certain disadvant aged populations could serve to extend exis ting disparities in electronic access to health informa tion. We also decline to elimin ate the percentage threshold of 247 this measure because we do not believe that a simple yes/no attestation for implementation of electronic messaging is adequate to encourage a minimum level of patient usage. However, in considering the potential barriers faced by these patient populations, we agree that it would be appropriate to lower the proposed threshold of th is measure to more than 5 percent of unique patients sending an electronic message. We believ e that this lower threshold, combined with the broadband exclusion detailed in the response below, will allow all EPs to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : Several commenters suggested that the exclusion for FCC-recognized areas with under 50 percent broadband av ailability, which was proposed in the objective to \"Provide patients the ability to view onlin e, download, and transmit their health information,\" should be extended to the electroni c messaging objective. Response : We agree that the infrastructure required for electronic messaging is similar to the infrastructure required for successful usage of an online patient portal as described in the objective to \"Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transmit their health information.\" Therefore, we believe an exclusio n to this measure based on the availability of broadband is appropriate and are finalizing the exclusion in the language below. We note that since publication of our propos ed rule the website has changed to www.broadbandmap.gov and the speed used has changed from 4Mbps to 3Mbps. We updated our exclusion. Comment : Some commenters expresse d concern about including all patients seen by the EP in the denominator and suggested limiting the denominator instead to patients who have indicated secure electronic messaging as thei r communication preferen ce. Other commenters suggested the denominator should not be limite d to patients seen by the EP and should also include patients who make inquiries or who atte mpt to make an appointment with the EP during 248 the reporting period. Response : We do not agree that li miting the denominator to pa tients who have indicated secure electronic messaging as their communication preference is appropriate. The purpose of the measure is for EPs to promote wider use of electronic messaging as a regular communication vehicle for their patients, and we are concerne d that limiting the denominator in the manner suggested would not lead to an increase in the promotion or usage of electronic messaging as an important communication vehicle between patients and providers. We also do not agree that expanding the denominator to pa tients not seen by the EP dur ing the reporting period is appropriate. Another purpose of the measure is for secure messaging to include clinically relevant information, and we do not believe that patients seeking introductory information or making an appointment are likely to include clinically relevant information in secure messaging. Comment : Some commenters noted that patients whose only o ffice visit with an EP occurs near the end of the reporting period might not be able to send an electronic message in time to be included in the numerator of the measure. Response : While we agree that patients with a single office visit near the end of the reporting period may not utilize electronic messa ging and be eligible for inclusion in the numerator of the measure during the EHR reporting period, we believe that the threshold of this measure will be sufficiently low to permit EP s to meet the measure even without the participation of these patients. Comment : Several commenters requested clarif ication on the definition of a secure message. Response : We define a secure message as any electronic communication between a provider and patient that ensu res only those parties can acc ess the communication. This 249 electronic message could be email or the elect ronic messaging function of a PHR, an online patient portal, or any other electronic means. However, we note that the secure message also must use the electronic messaging function of CEHR T in order to qualify for the measure of this objective. Comment : Some commenters suggested that EPs or patients should be permitted to use an electronic messaging function that is not pa rt of CEHRT in order to meet the measure. Response : We believe that allowing patient s to use multiple electronic messaging functions in order to communicate with the provi der under this measure co uld create confusion for the EP and potentially lead to electronic messages that are missed or not responded to. We also believe that by encouraging pa tients to use the electronic me ssaging function that is part of CEHRT EPs can better ensure that electronic me ssages are sent securely to protect patient's health information. Finally, we are concerned that CEHRT would not be able to track electronic messaging that is not part of the EHR, which woul d place an extra burden for reporting on EPs in meeting this measure. For all of these reasons , we require that patients use the electronic messaging function that is part of CEHRT in order to be included in the measure of this objective. Comment : Commenters agreed with our decision not to include in the definition for this measure \"relevant health information.\" Comm enters did not believe CEHRT could support the categorization of electronic messages in a wa y that would satisfy such a requirement. Response : We appreciate the support offered by commenters. As we stated in the proposed rule, the secure messages sent should contain relevant heal th information specific to the patient in order to meet the measure of this objec tive. We believe the EP is the best judge of what health information should be considered rele vant in this context. We do not specifically 250 include the term \"relevant health information\" in the measure because we believe the provider is best equipped to determine whether such informati on is included. We agree that it would be too great a burden for CEHRT to determine whether the information in the secure message has such information. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed concerns that we did not propose to measure provider response to pati ent electronic messaging. These commenters believed that the proposed measure places too much focus on patient messaging and should instead focus on communication between patient and provider. Some commenters suggested that the measure be modified for responsiveness of an EP or staff to patient messaging rather than the proposed percentage of patients who send a secure message. Response : As we stated in the proposed rule, th ere is an expectation that the EP would respond to electronic messages sent by the pati ent, although we do not specify the method of response or require the EP to document his or he r response for this measure. We decline to specify the method of provider response because we believe it is best left to the provider's clinical judgment to decide the course of action which should be taken in response to the patient's electronic message. An EP or staff member could decide that a follow-up telephone call or office visit is more appropria te to address the concerns rais ed in the electronic message. Therefore, we decline to alter the m easure to include provider response. Comment: Commenters asked for clarification as to whether the EP had to respond personally to electronic messaging or whether members of the EP's staff could respond. Commenters also asked for clarification re garding whether or not messages sent by a patient-authorized representative woul d be recorded in this measure. Response : There is not an expectat ion that the EP must persona lly respond to electronic 251 messages to the patient. Just as an EP's st aff respond to telephone inquiries or conduct office visits on behalf of the EP, staff could also res pond to electronic messages from the patient. We also intend for electronic message s sent by a patient-authorized re presentative to be included in the measure of this objective and have modified the language of the measure below accordingly. Comment : Some commenters raised concerns regarding the securi ty of electronic messaging, specifically citing instances where family members might have access to the patient's account or elderly patients who would not know how to use a computer and would have to give account access to a caregiver. Other commenters raised concerns regard ing their liability in providing access to such information or in responding to an electronic message. Response : We do not believe that secure elec tronic messaging poses greater risks to exposure of protected health information than other medium s such as telephone messaging, paper records, etc. In some cases secure electronic messaging can provide even greater protection of health information. We note that many patients gran t access to health information to family members and caregivers to facilitate care, and we expect the same access to continue with secure electronic messaging. Nor do we be lieve that secure electronic messaging exposes providers to greater liability (for example, in areas of privacy protection or malpractice) than other mediums such as telephone, mail, paper record s, etc. Previous res earch has demonstrated that better patient-provider comm unication reduces the likelihood of malpractice claims being filed. Comment : Some commenters noted that the potential financia l burden of implementing securing messaging as a part of their clinical or administrativ e workflow. These commenters noted that EPs are not reimbursed for the time spen t responding to electronic messages and that it can be time consuming for an EP to have multiple exchanges with a patient via email. 252 Response : We do not believe that impleme nting electronic messaging imposes a significant burden on providers. While we note that in some scenarios it may be possible for an EP to receive reimbursement from privat e insurance payers for online messaging, we acknowledge that EPs are genera lly not reimbursed for time spent responding to electronic messaging. However, it is also true that EPs ar e generally not reimbursed for other widely used methods of communication with pati ents (for example, telephone). As we noted in the proposed rule, many providers have seen a reduction in time responding to inquires and less time spent on the phone through the use of electronic messaging. In addition, we note that EPs themselves do not have to respond to electronic messages personally and can delegate this ta sk to staff, just as many EPs currently delegate telephone exchanges with patients to staff. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use measure for EPs as \"A secure message was se nt using the electroni c messaging function of CEHRT by more than 5 percent of unique patients (or their authorized representatives) seen by the EP during the EHR reporting period\" at \u00a7495.6( j)(17)(ii) and the exclusion for EPs as \"Any EP who has no office visits during the EHR repor ting period, or any EP who conducts 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters in a c ounty that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 3Mbps broadband availability according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EH R reporting period\" at \u00a7495.6(j)(17)(iii). We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(e)(3). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients seen by the EP during the EHR reporting 253 period. Numerator : The number of patients or patient -authorized representatives in the denominator who send a secure electronic message to the EP that is received using the electronic messaging function of CEHRT dur ing the EHR reporting period. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 5 percent in order for an EP to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any EP who has no office visits during the EHR repor ting period, or any EP who conducts 50 percent or more of his or her patient encounters in a county that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units wi th 3Mbps broadband availa bility according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EHR reporting period. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective: Automatically track medications from order to administration using assi stive technologies in conjunction with an electronic medication administration record (eMAR). In the proposed rule, we outlined the follo wing benefits of automatically tracking medications with eMAR: eMAR increases the accuracy of medication administration thereby increasing both patient safety and efficienc y. The HIT Policy Committee has recommended the inclusion of this objective for hosp itals in Stage 2, and we proposed this as a core objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs. The additional time made available for Stage 2 implementation makes possible the inclusion of some new objectiv es in the core set. eMAR is critically important to making care safer by reducing me dication errors which may make care more affordable. eMAR has been shown to lead to significant improvements in medication-related adverse events within hospitals with associated d ecreases in cost. eMAR cuts in half the adverse drug event (ADE) rates for non-timing medication errors, according to a study published in the 254 New England Journal of Medicine (Poon et al., 2010, Effect of Bar-Code Technology on the Safety of Medication Administration http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMsa0907115? query=NC). A study done to evaluate cost-benefit of eMAR (Maviglia et al., 2007, Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Hospital Pharmacy Bar Code Solution http://archinte.ama -assn.org/cgi/content/full/167/8/788) demonstrated that associated ADE cost savings allowed hospitals to break even after 1 year and begin reaping cost savings going forward. We proposed to define eMAR as technology that automatically documents the administration of medication into CEHRT using el ectronic tracking sensors (for example, radio frequency identification (R FID)) or electronically readable ta gging such as bar coding). The specific characteristics of eMAR for the EHR Incen tive Programs will be further described in the ONC standards and certification criteria final rule published el sewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . By its very definition, eMAR occurs at the point of care so we di d not propose additional qualifications on when it must be used or who must use it. Comment : Some commenters suggested that this should be a menu objective for Stage 2. Response : As we stated in the proposed rule, we believe that eMAR is critically important to making care safer by reducing medica tion errors which may also make care more affordable. eMAR has been shown to lead to significant improvements in medication-related adverse events within hospitals with associated d ecreases in cost. Therefore, we believe that the benefits to patient safety from eMAR warrant the inclusion of this as a Stage 2 core objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use 255 objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(16)(i) as proposed. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure: More than 10 percen t of medication orders created by authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EH R reporting period are tracked using eMAR. Comment : A number of commenters questioned wh ether the measure should apply to at least one instance of the administration of a dos e connected with a medication order or whether each individual dose connected with a medication order should be included in the measure. Some commenters believed that a single instan ce of administration of a dose should constitute fulfillment of the measure, while others believed that all doses administered rather than orders administered would be a more precise and meaningful measurement. Response : We believe that including each indi vidual dose connected with a medication order through this measure could yield denominator s that are very large. However, we believe that the benefits to patient safety from eMAR are seen when all doses of a medication order are tracked. Therefore, we clarify that we include in the numerator of this objective medication orders for which all doses are tracked using eMAR, and we are amending the measure language below to reflect this clarificati on. If a medication is ordered but not all doses of the medication are tracked using eMAR, then that order may not be included in the numerator of the measure. Comment : Some commenters raised the concer n that certain rural and low volume hospitals might face undue financial burden in implementing this objective and proposed an exclusion for hospitals with either a limited number of inpatient beds or a low average inpatient volume. Some commenters suggested there should be an exclusion for very small hospitals for whom eMAR could be a prohibitively expensive unde rtaking. Other commenters noted that the difficulties in implementing eMAR were outweighed by the significant benefits to patient safety. 256 Response : We agree with commenters who sugg ested that the potential benefits to patient safety of eMAR are significant. While we agree that certain hospitals may face challenges in implementing eMAR on a wider scale, we believe that the low threshold for this measure lessens the burden associated with im plementation of eMAR for most rural and low volume hospitals. We also note that CEHRT w ill include eMAR capabilities, so the primary barrier to implementation for most hospitals will be workflow. However, we are also concerned that very small hospitals may have local technical support and training issues that may make an au tomated eMAR solution act ually less effective than other approaches. We also believe that ve ry small hospitals will have fewer health care professionals involved in the pr ocess of medication administrati on and fewer patients for whom duplicative orders could present an issue, wh ich would also make an eMAR solution less effective. Therefore, we believe these hospitals would not benefit from eM AR as much as larger facilities and are finalizing an exclusion for thes e hospitals. Any hospital with an average daily inpatient census of fewer than 10 patients may be excluded from meeting the measure of this objective. For purposes of this exclusion, we defi ne an average daily inpatient census as the total number of patients admitted during the previ ous calendar year divided by 365 (or 366 if the previous calendar year is a leap year). Comment : Some commenters stated that the percentage thres hold of this measure should be replaced with the implementa tion of eMAR in one ward or unit of the hospital to limit burdensome measurement requirements. Other co mmenters argued that changing the measure to one ward or unit of the hospital would introduce ambiguity regarding what constitutes a ward or unit, while a percentage threshold would allow hospitals the flexibility to implement eMAR capabilities on a limited basis. 257 Response : We believe that the low thres hold of this objective does not impose burdensome measurement requirements on hospitals , especially since we do not anticipate a significant difference in the way CEHRT will measure eMAR usage regardless of where it is implemented. We agree that limiting the measure to implementation in a single ward or unit could introduce ambiguity regardi ng the precise definition of ward or unit, especially since some hospitals combine the locations and workflows of certain units. We further note that the percentage threshold does allow hospitals to implement eMAR in a limited capacity, and that a hospital could potentially meet the low measur e of this objective by implementing in a single ward or unit or by implementing in several smalle r wards or units that combine to yield more than 10 percent of medication orders create d during the EHR reporting period. We believe the percentage measure of this objective yields maximum flexibility for a hospital to implement eMAR in a way that is clinically relevant to its in dividual workflow. Comment : Some commenters requested clarif ication on whether eMAR could be implemented solely in portions of an inpatient de partment or solely in portions of an emergency department in order to meet the measure, as opposed to implementing eMAR in both the inpatient and emergency departments. Response : As stated previously, we have attemp ted to provide maximum flexibility for a hospital to implement eMAR in a way that is cl inically relevant to its individual workflow. Therefore, we do not require that eMAR is implemented in both inpatient and emergency departments in order to meet this measure, only that more than 10 percent of medication orders created by authorized providers of either the inpatient or emerge ncy department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period ar e tracked using eMAR. Hospita ls could implement eMAR in the inpatient department, the emergency department , or both departments in order to meet the 258 threshold of this measure. After consideration of the pub lic comments, we modify the meaningful use measure as \"More than 10 percent of medica tion orders created by authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency depa rtment (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period for which all doses are tracked using eMAR\" for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(16)(ii) and finali ze the exclusion as \"Any eligible hospital or CAH with an average daily inpatient census of fewer than 10 patients\" at \u00a7495.6(l)(16)(iii). We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an eligible hospital or CAH must use the capabilities and sta ndards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(16). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of medication orders created by au thorized providers in the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emer gency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of orders in the denomina tor for which all doses are tracked using eMAR. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 10 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any hospital with an average daily i npatient census of fewer than ten (10) patients. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective: Generate and transmit permissible discharge prescriptions electronically (eRx) In the proposed rule, we outlined the following benefits of electronic prescribing: The 259 use of electronic prescribing has several advantages over having th e patient carry the prescription to the pharmacy or directly faxing a handwritten or typewritten prescription to the pharmacy. When the hospital generates the prescription electronicall y, CEHRT can recognize the information and can provide decision support to promote safety and quality in the form of adverse interactions and other treatment possibilities. The CE HRT can also provide decision support that promotes the efficiency of the h ealth care system by alerting the EP to generic alternatives or to alternatives favored by the pati ent's insurance plan that are equally effective. Transmitting the prescription electronically promotes efficiency and safety through reduced communication errors. It also allows the pharmacy or a third party to automatically compare the medication order to others they have received fo r the patient. This comparison allows for many of the same decision support f unctions enabled at the generati on of the prescription, but bases them on potentially greater information. We have combined the comments and responses for this objective with the measure below. After consideration of the public co mments, we are finalizing the meaningful use objective for eligible hospitals a nd CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(4)(i) as proposed. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure: More than 10 percen t of hospital discharge medication orders for permissible prescriptions (for new or changed prescriptions) are compared to at least one drug formulary and tr ansmitted electronically using CEHRT. Comment : Most commenters voiced support for this as a menu set item, with some commenters noting that the threshold for this measure should remain low for Stage 2 because of the difficulty of using electronic prescribi ng for all prescriptions, including controlled substances. Response : We appreciate the support for this objective, and we note that the measure of 260 the objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs for Stage 2 is set at more than 10 percent of all discharge medication orders for permissible prescrip tions. We believe this sets a sufficiently low threshold that would allow most hospitals to achi eve this measure and eliminates the inclusion of controlled substances, which are not included as permissible pres criptions for the purposes of this measure. Comment : Most commenters noted that disti nguishing new and alte red prescriptions from refills would be unnecessari ly burdensome for hospitals. Response : Although we had initially proposed to limit this measure to only new and altered prescriptions because we believed that hospitals would not issue refill prescriptions, we agree with the commenters that distinguishing ref ills from new and altered prescriptions could be unnecessarily burdensome for hospitals. Therefor e, we are not imposing this limitation and include new, altered, and refill prescriptions in the measure of discharge medication orders for permissible prescriptions. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed concerns about patient requests for paper prescriptions instead of el ectronic prescriptions. Response : We believe that the more than 10 percent of discharge medication orders threshold is sufficiently low to accommodate pati ent requests for paper prescriptions and still allow most, if not all, hospitals to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : Some commenters asked whether prescr iptions electronically transmitted to in-house pharmacies should be included in the measure and if the standards specified by ONC for this measure would apply to these transmissions. Response : We are continuing the policy from Stage 1 that prescriptions transmitted electronically within an organization (the same le gal entity) would be coun ted in the measure and 261 would not need to use the standards specified by ONC for this objective. However, a hospital's CEHRT must meet all applicable certification crite ria and be certified as having the capability of meeting external transmission requirements. In addition, the EHR that is used to transmit prescriptions within the organization would need to be CEHRT. The hospital would include in the numerato r and denominator both types of electronic transmission (those within and outside the organi zation) for the measure of this objective. We further clarify that for purposes of counting discharge prescriptions \"generated and transmitted electronically,\" we considered the generation and transmission of prescriptions to occur simultaneously if the prescriber and dispenser ar e the same person and/or are accessing the same record in an integrated EHR to create an order in a system that is electronically transmitted to an internal pharmacy. Comment : Some commenters asked for clarific ation regarding whether drug-formulary checks had to be enabled for the entire EH R reporting period, as required by the Stage 1 measure. Response : No. The Stage 1 objective for drug-formulary checks has been combined with this Stage 2 objective for generating and transmitting permissible discharge prescriptions electronically. Although the measure of the St age 1 objective required the capability for drug- formulary checks to be enabled for the entire reporting period, the measure of the Stage 2 objective specifies drug-formulary checks should be performed for more than 10 percent of hospital discharge medication orders for permissi ble prescriptions. We recognize that not every patient will have a formul ary that is relevant for him or her. Therefore, we require not that the EHR check each prescription against a formulary relevant for a given patient, but rather that the EHR check each prescription for the existence of a re levant formulary. If a relevant formulary is 262 available, then the information can be provided. We believe that this initial check is essentially an on or off function for the EHR and should not add to the measurement burden. Therefore, with this clarification of the check we are refe rring to, we are finalizi ng the drug formulary check as a component of this measure. We look forward to the day when a relevant formulary is available for every patient. We modified the meas ure to use the word query instead of compare. Comment : Some commenters asked whether the measure of this objective applied to inpatient departments, emer gency departments, or both. Response : We specify that the measure of this objective applies to medication orders for patients discharged from either the inpatient (POS 21) department, the emergency department, or both the inpatient and emergency departments of an eligible hospital or CAH during the EHR reporting period. Comment : One commenter asked for clarification of whether a patient for whom no relevant drug formularies are av ailable could be counted in the numerator of the measure if the discharge prescription for that patient is generated and transmitted electronically. Another commenter suggested that patients for whom no re levant formularies are available should not be counted in the measure. Response : As noted in the proposed rule, we belie ve that the inclusion of the comparison to at least one drug formulary enhances the effici ency of the healthcare sy stem when clinically appropriate and cheaper alternatives may be available. In the even t that a relevant formulary is unavailable for a particular patie nt and medication combination, a discharge prescription that is generated and electronically transm itted should still be included in the numerator of the measure. We do not agree that prescriptions for patients for whom relevant formularies are unavailable should be excluded from this measure. 263 Comment : Several commenters believed that the exclusion based on the availability of a pharmacy capable of receiving electronic prescrip tions within 25 miles of the hospital's location was not adequate for all areas, particularly rural areas. Some commenters suggested that 10 miles is a more appropriate distance. Response : We appreciate the commenters' concerns about this exclusion. As stated in the proposed rule, we recognize that certain areas may not have widespre ad availability of electronic prescribing in all pharmacies, we believ e that most hospitals will be able to fulfill electronic prescriptions through an internal pharmacy. However, we agree with commenters that basing the exclusion on a 25-mile radius could pl ace a significant burden on patients to travel to fill prescriptions, especially in rural areas. Theref ore, we are finalizing a 10-mile radius at the start of the EHR reporting period. Hospitals that do not have an internal pharmacy and that are located 10 miles from a pharmacy th at can receive electronic prescr iptions at the start of the EHR reporting period would be able to cl aim the exclusion for this measure. We also believe that the low threshold of more than 10 percent of disc harge prescriptions transmitted electronically would make it possible for all hospitals to meet this measure. Comment : Some commenters requested for cl arification of whether CEHRT would provide the capability to determin e the availability of a pharmacy capable of receiving electronic prescriptions within 25 mile s of the hospital's location. Response: CEHRT will not provide the capability to determine whether a hospital meets the exclusion for this measure. As stated in the previous response , we are finalizing the exclusion for the availability of a pharmacy capab le of receiving electronic prescriptions within 10 miles of the hospital's location. Therefore, eligible hospitals and CAHs may use their own resources to make a determination regarding the availability of a pharmacy capable of receiving 264 electronic prescriptions within 10 miles of the hospital's location. After consideration of the pub lic comments, we modify the meaningful use measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs as \"More than 10 percent of hospital disc harge medication orders for permissible prescriptions (for new, changed, a nd refilled prescriptions) are queried for a drug formulary and transmitted electronically usi ng CEHRT\" at \u00a7495.6(m)(4)(ii) and we modify the exclusion for eligible hospita ls and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(4)(iii) by changing the radius from 25 miles to 10 miles. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an eligible hospital or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(10) and (b)(3). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of new, changed, or refill prescriptions written for drugs requiring a prescription in order to be dispensed other than controlled substances for patients discharged during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of prescrip tions in the denominator generated, queried for a drug formulary and transmitted electronically. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be mo re than 10 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any eligible hospital or CAH that doe s not have an internal pharmacy that can accept electronic prescriptions and is not lo cated within 10 miles of any pharmacy that accepts electronic prescriptions at th e start of their EHR reporting period. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective: Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and transmit information about a hospital admission. 265 In the proposed rule, we noted that studi es have found that patients engaged with computer based information sources and decision support show improvement in quality of life indicators, patient satisfaction and health outc omes. (Ralston, Carrell , Reid, Anderson, Moran, & Hereford, S, Graziano, & CL, 1999) (Riggio, Sorokin, Moxey, Mather, Gould, & Kane, 2009) (Gustafson, et al., 2001). In addition, we noted that this objective aligns with the FIPPs,5 in affording baseline privacy pr otections to individuals. We stated that we believe this information is integr al to the Partnership fo r Patents initiative and reducing hospital readmissions. Wh ile this objective does not require all of the information sources and decision support used in these studies, having a set of basic information available advances these initiatives. The ability to ha ve this information online means it is always retrievable by the patient, while the download function ensures that the patient can take the information with them when secure internet acce ss is not available. However, providers should be aware that while meaningful use is limited to the capabilities of CEHRT to provide online access, there may be patients who cannot access their EHRs electronically because of their disability. Additionally, other he alth information may not be accessible. Finally, we noted that providers who are covered by civil rights laws mu st provide individuals with disabilities equal access to information and appropriate auxiliary aids and services as provided in the applicable statutes and regulations. We proposed this as a core objective for hospita ls for Stage 2. We also specified in the proposed rule the information that must be made available as part of the objective, although we noted hospitals could choose to provide additional information (77 FR 13730). Comment : Some commenters suggested that this object ive should be part of the menu set 5 Ibid. 266 instead of a core objective for Stage 2. This w ould permit eligible hospitals and CAHs that do not believe they can meet the measure at this time to select different objectives. Response : We do not agree that this objective s hould be part of the menu set. We proposed this objective as part of the core for el igible hospitals and CAHs because it is intended to replace the previous Stage 1 core objective of \"Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request\" and the Stage 1 core objective of \"Provi de patients with an electronic copy of their disc harge information.\" Although CEHRT will provide added capabilities for this objective, we do not believe the objective itself is suffi ciently different from previous objectives to justify placing it in the me nu set. Also, we believe that patient access to their discharge information is a high priority for the EHR Incentive Programs and this objective best provides that access in a timely manner. Comment : Some commenters expre ssed the opinion that this objective should not be included as part of meaningf ul use and was more appropria tely regulated under HIPAA and through the Office for Civil Rights. Response : We do not agree that this objective s hould not be included in meaningful use. Although we recognize that many issues concerni ng the privacy and security of information online are subject to HIPAA requirements, we be lieve that establishing an objective to provide online access to health information is within the regulatory purview of the EHR Incentive Programs and consistent with the statut ory requirements of meaningful use. After consideration of the public comments, we are fina lizing the meaningful use objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(8)(i) as proposed. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure : There are 2 measures for this objective, both of which must be satisfied in order to meet the objective. 267 More than 50 percent of all patients who are discharged from the inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) of an eligible hos pital or CAH have thei r information available online within 36 hours of discharge. More than 10 percent of all patients who are discharged from the inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) of an eligible hosp ital or CAH view, download or transmit to a third party their information duri ng the EHR reporting period. Comment : A commenter questioned how long data should be made available online before it can be removed. Response : It is the goal of this objective to make available to the pa tient both current and historical health information re garding hospital discharg es. Therefore, we would anticipate that the data should be available online on an ongoing basis. However, an eligible hospital or CAH may withhold or remove information from online access for purposes of meaningful use if they believe substantial harm may aris e from its disclosure online. Comment : Some commenters asked for clarifica tion on whether online access had to be made available using CEHRT or if the informa tion could be made available through other means (patient portal, PHR, etc.). Response : Both of the measures for this objective must be met using CEHRT. Therefore, for the purposes of meeting this objective, the cap abilities provided by a patient portal, PHR, or any other means of online access and that would permit a patient or authorized representative to view, download, or transmit their personal health information would have to be certified in accordance with th e certification requirements adopted by ONC. We refer readers to ONC's standards and certification cr iteria final rule that is publis hed elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . 268 Comment : Some commenters asked for clarif ication on how access by the patient is defined. Response : We define access as having been given when the patient possesses all of the necessary information needed to view, download, or transmit their discharge information. This could include providing patients with instructions on how to access their health information, the website address they must visit for online access, a unique and registered username or password, instructions on how to cr eate a login, or any other instructions, tools, or materials that patients need in order to view, download, or transmit their discharge information. Comment : Some commenters suggested that patients under the age of 18 should not have the same access to the same information to wh ich adult patients have access and requested a separate list of required elements for patients under the age of 18. Response : An eligible hospital or CAH may decide that online access is not the appropriate forum for certain health information for patients under the age of 18. Within the confines of the laws governing guardian access to medical records for patients under the age of 18, we would defer to the eligib le hospital's or CAH's judgment regarding which information should be withheld for such patients. In lieu of providing online access to patients under the age of 18, eligible hospitals or CAHs could provide online access to guardia ns for patients under the age of 18, in accordance with state and local laws, in order to meet the measure of this objective. Providing online access to guardians in accordance to state and local laws would be treated the same as access for patients, and guardians coul d then be counted in the numerator of the measure. We recognize that state and local laws may restrict the inform ation that can be made available to guardians, and in th ese cases such information can be withheld and the patient could still be counted in the nu merator of the measure. 269 Comment : Many commenters voiced objections to the second measure of this objective and the concept of providers being held acc ountable for patient actions. The commenters believed that while providers could be held ac countable for making information available online to patients, providers could not control whethe r patients actually acce ssed their information. Many commenters also noted that the potential barriers of limited internet access, computer access, and patient engagement with health IT for certain populations (for example, rural, elderly, lower income, non-English-speaking, etc.) might make the measure impossible to meet for some providers. There were also a number of comments stating that metrics used to track views or downloads can be misleading and are not necessarily the most accurate measure of patient usage. Commenters suggested a number of possible solutions to allow providers to overcome these barriers, including eliminating the percentage threshold of the measure or requiring providers to offer and tr ack patient access but not requiri ng them to meet a percentage measure in order to demonstrate meaningful use. However, some comment ers believed that the measure was a reasonable and necessary step to ensure that providers had accountability for engagement of their patients in use of electronic health information and integration of it into clinical practice. In addition, co mmenters pointed to the unique ro le that providers can play in encouraging and facilitating their patients' and their families' use of online tools. Response : While we recognize that eligible hospitals and CAHs cannot directly control whether patients access th eir health information online, we c ontinue to believe that eligible hospitals and CAHs are in a unique position to st rongly influence the tec hnologies patients use to improve their own care, including viewing, downloading, and transmitting their health information online. We believe that the eligible hospital's or CAH's ability to influence patients coupled with the low threshold of more than 10 percent of patients w ho view online, download, 270 or transmit to a third party their information make this measure achievable for all eligible hospitals and CAHs. We recognize that certain patient populations face greater challenges in online access to information. We address the potential barrie r of limited internet access in the comment regarding a broadband exclusion below. We addr ess the potential barrier to individuals with disabilities through ONC's rules requiring that EH Rs meet disability a ccessibility standards. While we agree that excluding certain patient popul ations from this requ irement would make the measure easier for eligible hospitals and CAHs to achieve, we do not know of any reliable method to quantify these populations for each eligib le hospital and CAH in such a way that we could standardize exclusions fo r each population. We also declin e to eliminate the percentage threshold of this measure because we do not beli eve that a simple yes/no attestation for this objective is adequate to encourage a minimum leve l of patient usage. However, in considering the potential barriers faced by these patient populations, we agree that it would be appropriate to lower the proposed threshold of this measure to mo re than 5 percent of uni que patients who view online, download, or transmit to a third party th eir information. In a ddition, we are concerned that blanket exclusions for certain disadvant aged populations could se rve to extend existing disparities in electronic access to information and violate civil rights laws. All entities receiving funds under this program are subject to civil rights laws. For mo re information about these laws and their requirements (see http:/ /www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/index.html ). We believe that this lower threshold, combined with the broadband excl usion detailed in the re sponse later in this section, will allow all eligible hospitals and CAHs to meet the measure of this objective. Comment : Some commenters suggested maki ng the numerator and denominator language for this measure consistent with the language used for this measure for EPs. 271 Response : We agree that there are some sli ght variations in language between the measure for EPs and the measure for hospitals. To the extent possible, we have harmonized the language between both. Comment : Some commenters asked for clar ification on how view is defined. Response : We define view as the patient (or authorized representa tive) accessing their health information online. Comment : Some commenters noted that the potential financia l burden of implementing an online patient portal to provide patients online access to discharge information. These commenters noted the added time burden for staff in handling the additional patient use of online resources, which may increase costs through the hiri ng of additional staff, as well as the need to modify their existing workflow to accommodate pot ential online messages from patients. Some commenters also believed that th ere would be an additional cost for sharing content before standards exist for content types and formats. Response : As noted in the proposed rule, studies have found that patients engaged with computer based information sources and decision support show improvement in quality of life indicators, patient satisfaction and health outc omes (see Rosenberg SN, role in guideline compliance: a controlled study\" American Journal of Managed Care 14(11):737 -44; Gustafson DH, Hawkins R, Boberg patien t-centered, computer- based information/support system\" Journal of Pr eventive Medicine 16(1):1-9; Ralston JD, Carrell D, Reid R, Anderson M, Mora n M, Hereford J (2007) \"Patient web services integrated with a shared medical record: patient use and satisfaction\" Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 14(6):798-806). We believe that the information provided as 272 part of this measure is integr al to the Partnership for Patent s initiative and reducing hospital readmissions. We do not believe that impl ementing online access for patients imposes a significant burden, financial or otherwise, on provid ers. While we note that in some scenarios it may be possible for an eligible hospital or CAH to receive reimbursement from private insurance payers for online messaging, we acknowledge that el igible hospitals and C AHs are generally not reimbursed for time spent responding to electronic messaging. However, it is also true that eligible hospitals and CAHs are generally not reimbursed for other widely used methods of communication with patients (for example, telephone). In ad dition, it will be part of the capability of CEHRT to automatically populate most of the list of required elements to meet this measure, which significantly reduces the admini strative burden of providing this information. Finally, we believe that the standards estab lished for this objective by ONC will serve as a content standard that will allow this informati on to be more easily transmitted and uploaded to another certified EHR, thereby reduci ng the cost of sharing information. Comment : Some commenters noted th at patient engagement coul d occur effectively with or without online access, and patients should be encouraged to use any method (for example, telephone, internet, traditional mail) that suits them. These commenters noted that engagement offline reduces both the need and value for engagement online. Response : We agree that patient engagement can occur effectively th rough a variety of media, and we also believe that electronic access to discharge information can be an important component of patient compliance and improving longitudinal care. We do not believe that offline engagement reduces the need for online a ccess, as patients may opt to access information in a variety of ways. Because of the vari ety of ways that patients/families may access information, we keep the threshold for this m easure low. Measuring other means of accessing 273 health information is beyond the scope of the EH R Incentive Programs. We also note that online access to health information can enhance offline engagement\u2014f or example, patients could download information from a hospital admission to bring with them for a consult on follow-up care\u2014which is one of the primary goals of the EHR Incentive Programs. Comment : Some commenters expresse d concern that vendors woul d not be able to make these capabilities available as part of CE HRT in time for the beginning of Stage 2. Response : Many CEHRT vendors already make patien t portals available that would meet the certification cr iteria and standards required for this m easure. Although th e Stage 2 eligible hospital/CAH measure requires some additional required elements and fields capabilities, we believe vendors will be able to make these ca pabilities available in time for the beginning of Stage 2. Comment : Some commenters suggested that ba sing the exclusion on the broadband data available from the FCC website (www.broadband.gov ) was suspect since the data originates from vendors. Response : The broadband data made available from the FCC was collected from over 3,400 broadband providers nationwide. This data was then subject to ma ny different types of analysis and verification methods, from drive testing wireless broadba nd service across their highways to meeting with community leaders to receive feedback. Representatives met with broadband providers, large and small, to confirm data, or suggest changes to service areas, and also went into the field looking for infrastructure to validate service offerings in areas where more information was needed. Therefore, we beli eve the data is appropriate for the exclusion to this measure. We note that si nce publication of our proposed rule the website has changed to www.broadbandmap.gov and the speed used has changed from 4Mbps to 3Mbps. We are 274 updating our exclusion to re flect these changes. Comment : Some commenters believ e that broadband exclusions should be based on the patients' locations instead of the providers, si nce county-level data may not be granular enough to capture all areas of low broadband av ailability within a particular region. Response : Although we agree that a broadband exclusion based primarily on the individual locations of each patient seen would be more accurate, we do not believe that there is any method of making this determination for ev ery patient without placing an undue burden on the provider. We continue to believe that limite d broadband availability in the eligible hospital's or CAH's immediate practice area, coupled with th e low threshold of this measure, adequately serves as an acceptable proxy for determining ar eas where online access can present a challenge for patients. Therefore, after consideration of the public comments rece ived, we are finalizing the broadband exclusion as proposed. Comment : Some commenters suggested that th e required element of \"Problem list maintained by the hospital on the pa tient\" should be made consistent with the required element in the objective of the same name and changed to \"Problem list.\" Other commenters asked for clarification of \"Relevant past diagnoses known by the hospital\" and how this element differs from \"Problem list.\" Response : We agree that this language should be made standard. By \"Relevant past diagnoses known by the hospital\" we mean to indi cate historical entries in the patient's problem list. Therefore, we are eliminating the \"Relevant past diagnoses\" element and modifying the problem list element to \"Current and past problem list\" in the list of required elements below. Comment : Some commenters suggested that displaying all historical medications for each patient under the required el ement of \"Medication list main tained by the hospital on the 275 patient (both current admission a nd historical)\" would be too burdensome for hospitals. These commenters suggested amending the required el ement to only the active medication list maintained by CEHRT. They also expressed confusion over the use of the term \"current admission\" since the information for this measure would be posted after th e patient's discharge. Response : We believe that just as providing a hi storical problem list for the patient can be useful, so too can providing a hi storical list of all medications. To clarify the intention of this objective, we are modifying the language in the li st of required elements below to read \"Active medication list and medication history. Cu rrent admission referred to the admission and subsequent discharge that pl aces the patient in the denominator for this measure. Comment : Some commenters suggest ed that \"Laboratory test results (available at discharge)\" could result in a large number of test results that could be confusing to patients. They suggested limiting this required element to a s ubset of lab results of a particular type or lab results from the last 24 hours of admission. Response : We believe that a list of all laboratory test resu lts can be beneficial to longitudinal care, therefore, we decline to modi fy this required element either by type of lab result or by any time period beyond those lab test results available at discharge. Comment : Some commenters suggested that th e required element of \"Care transition summary and plan for next provider of care (for transitions other than home)\" should be made consistent with the required element in the ob jective of the same name and changed to \"Care plan field, including goals and in structions.\" Some commente rs also suggested that care transition plans are more appropria te for providers than patients. Response : By \"care transition summary and plan for next provider of care\" we mean for eligible hospitals and CAHs to include bot h the care plan field( s), including goals and 276 instructions, and a copy of the summary of care document that hospitals must generate and provide for the core objective of \"The eligible hospital or CAH that transitions their patient to another setting of care or provide r of care or refers their pati ent to another provider of care should provide summary care record for each transiti on of care or referral.\" While we believe that the summary of care documents are best exch anged directly with the provider to whom the hospital is transitioning care or re ferring the patient, we also belie ve that providing an electronic copy with discharge information w ill ensure that the provider can easily access the information after the transition of referral. We have modifi ed the language in the list of required elements below to reflect this. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the first meaningful use measure for elig ible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6( l)(8)(ii)(A) as proposed. We are modifying the second meaningful use measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs to be \"More than 5 percent of all patients (or their authori zed representatives) who are discharged from the inpatient or emergency departme nt (POS 21 or 23) of an e ligible hospital or CAH view, download or transmit to a third party their in formation during the EHR reporting period\" at \u00a7495.6(l)(8)(ii)(B), and the exclusio n for eligible hospitals and C AHs at \u00a7495.6(l)(8)(iii) as \"Any eligible hospital or CAH that is located in a coun ty that does not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 3Mbps broadband availability according to the latest information available from the FCC on the first day of the EHR re porting period is excluded from the second measure.\" We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an eligible hospital or CAH must use the capabilities and sta ndards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(e)(1). To calculate the percentage of the first m easure for providing patients timely access to 277 discharge information, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients discharg ed from an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of patients in the denomi nator whose information is available online within 36 hours of discharge. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be mo re than 50 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. To calculate the percentage of the second measure for reporting on the number of unique patients discharged from an elig ible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporti ng period (or their au thorized represen tatives) who view, download or transmit health information, CMS a nd ONC have worked together to define the following for this objective: Denominator : Number of unique patients discharg ed from an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (P OS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of unique patients (or thei r authorized representatives) in the denominator who have viewed online, downloaded, or transmitted to a third party the discharge information provided by the el igible hospital or CAH. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 5 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion : Any eligible hospital or CAH will be excluded from the second measure if it is located in a county that doe s not have 50 percent or more of its housing units with 3Mbps broadband availability according to the latest in formation available from the FCC on the first day 278 of the EHR reporting period. The following information must be available to satisfy the objective and measure: Patient name. Admit and discharge date and location. Reason for hospitalization. Care team including the attending of r ecord as well as other providers of care. Procedures performed during admission. Current and past problem list. Current medication list and medication history. Current medication allergy list and medication allergy history. Vital signs at discharge. Laboratory test results (available at time of discharge). Summary of care record for transitions of care or referrals to another provider. Care plan field(s), incl uding goals and instructions. Discharge instructions for patient. Demographics maintained by hospital (sex, race, ethnicity, date of birth, preferred language). Smoking status. As noted in the proposed rule, this is not in tended to limit the information made available by the hospital. A hospital can make available additional information and still align with the objective. Please note that while some of the information made available through this measure is similar to the information made available in the summary of care document that must be provided following transitions of care or referrals, the list of info rmation above is specific to the 279 view online, download, and transmit objective. Patients and provide rs have different information needs and contexts, so CMS has established separate required fields for each of these objectives. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Objective : Record whether a patient 65 years old or older has an advance directive. In our proposed rule, we noted that the HIT Policy Committee reco mmended making this a core objective and also requiri ng eligible hospitals and CAHs to either store an electronic copy of the advance directive in the CEHRT or link to an electron ic copy of the advance directive. However, we proposed to maintain this objective as part of the menu set for Stage 2, and we did not propose the requirement of an el ectronic copy or link to the adva nce directive. As we stated in our Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44345), we have continuing con cerns that ther e are potential conflicts between storing advance directives a nd existing state laws. Also, we believe that because of state law restrictions, an advance directive stored in an EHR may not be actionable. Finally, we believe that eligible hospitals and CAHs may have other methods of satisfying the intent of this objective at this time, although we recognize that these workflows may change as EHR technology develops and becomes more widely adopted. Therefore, we did not propose to adopt the HIT Policy Committee's recommendations for this objective. The HIT Policy Committee has also recommended the inclusion of this objective for EPs in Stage 2. In our Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 4434 5), we indicated our belief that many EPs will not record this information under current standard s of practice and will only require information about a patient's advance directive in rare circumstances. We conti nue to believe this is the case and that creating a list of specialties or types of EPs that will be excluded from the objective will be too cumbersome and still might not be compre hensive. Therefore, we did not propose the recording of the existence of advance directives as an objective for EPs in Stage 2. However, we 280 solicited public comment on this decision and encouraged comm enters to address specific concerns regarding scope of pr actice and ease of compliance for EPs. And we note that nothing in this rule compels the use of advance directives. Comment : While some commenters supported the HIT Policy Committee's recommendations, many recommended that we keep this measure as part of the menu set. We received several comments about a link or copy of the advance di rectives, and these commenters generally supported our proposal of not including this as part of the objective. Response : While we appreciate the commenters support and the HITPC's reiteration of their recommendation, neither the HITPC nor othe r commenters provided new information that would address our concerns regard ing conflicting state laws. Comment: While most commenters agreed that this objective should not be extended to EPs at this time, a select few suggested adding it as part of the menu set. Response : We are not extending this objective to EPs. Our belief that many EPs would not record this information under current sta ndards of practice was supported by commenters. Also, we continue to believe th at creating a list of specialties or types of EPs that would be excluded from the objective would be too cumb ersome and would not be comprehensive. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this objective for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(1)(i) as proposed. Proposed Eligible Hospital/CAH Measure: More than 50 percent of all unique patients 65 years old or older admitted to the eligible hos pital's or CAH's inpatient department (POS 21) during the EHR reporting period have an indication of an advance directive status recorded as structured data. In the proposed rule, we explained that the calculation of the denominator for the 281 measure of this objective is limited to unique patients age 65 or older who are admitted to an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient department (POS 21). Patients admitted to an emergency department (POS 23) should not be included in the calcu lation. As we discussed in our Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44345), we believe that this information is a level of detail that is not practical to collect on every patient admitted to the eligible hospital's or CAH's emergency department, and therefore, have limited this measure only to the inpatient department of the hospital. Comment : A commenter indicated that nearly 70 percent of hospitals could meet this measure in Fall 2011. Response : Data collected from Stage 1 attestat ions shows that less than 15 percent of hospitals deferred this measure. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing this measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(1)(ii) as propose d. We are maintaining the exclusion for any eligible hospital or CAH that admits no pati ents age 65 years old or older during the EHR reporting period. We further specify that in order to meet th is objective and measure, an EP must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(17). Denominator : Number of unique patients age 65 or older admitted to an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient department (POS 21) during the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of patients in the denomi nator who have an indication of an advance directive status ente red using structured data. Threshold: The resulting percentage must be more than 50 percent in order for an eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. Exclusion: Any eligible hospital or CAH that ad mits no patients age 65 years old or 282 older during the EHR reporting period. (f) HIT Policy Committee Recommended Objectiv es Discussed in the Proposed Rule without Proposed Regulation Text We did not propose these objectives for Stage 2 as explained at each objective, but we solicited comments on whether th ese objectives should be inco rporated into Stage 2. Hospital Objective: Provide structured electronic lab results to eligible professionals. Although the HITPC recommended this as a co re objective for Stage 2 for hospitals, we did not propose this objective for the following reasons as expl ained in the proposed rule. Although hospital labs supply nearly half of all lab results, they are not the predominant vendors for providers who do not share or cannot acce ss their technology. Independent and office laboratories provide over half of th e labs in this market. We stat ed that we were concerned that imposing this requirement on hospital labs would unfairly disadvantage them in this market. Furthermore, not all hospitals offer these servic es so it would create a natural disparity in meaningful use between those hospitals offering th ese services and those th at do not. Finally, all other aspects of meaningful us e in Stage 1 and Stage 2 focus on the inpatient and emergency departments of a hospital. This objective is not related to these de partments, and in fact excludes services provided in these departments. We asked for comments on both the pros and cons of this objective and whether it should be consider ed for this final rule as recommended by the HITPC. Comment : Nearly all of the commenters that supported the inclusion of this objective based their support wholly or in part on the conc ept that the benefits of hospitals providing structured electronic lab results outweigh the costs of doing so. They point to specific benefits, such as making it more likely that EPs will be able to meet the meaningful use measure of 283 incorporating clinical lab-test results into CEHR T as structured data, as well as more general benefits of structured electronic results. Response : The large number of commenters in support of this objective and the associated benefits they identified make a comp elling case for inclusion. In particular, inclusion of this objective will enable EPs to incorporat e laboratory test result s into the CEHRT as structured data, which in turn adds to the ab ility of CEHRT to provide CDS and to calculate clinical quality measures. In addition, this objective will improve consistency in the market by incentivizing the use of the uniform standard fo r laboratory exchange transactions included in CEHRT as established in ONC's certification criteria at (ONC reference once available). However, the benefits identified are somewh at tempered by the makeup of the commenters supporting the inclusion of this objective, who are usually those who stand to benefit (EPs, patient advocates and others), whereas those who did not support inclusion are us ually those who would bear the burden (hospitals and vendors). We summarize and respond to the comments in opposition later. However, due to the strong disagreements among commenters about the inclusion of this objective, and also concern for market impact discussed in the comments later, we will include it in the menu set of Stage 2 a nd not in the core set as recommended by the HITPC and supported by some of the commenters. Comment : Several commenters questioned the applicability of this objective to meaningful use. Most stated th at it was not applicable for seve ral reasons. First, commenters asserted it is beyond the statutory authority of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program, which is established in sections of the statute that govern payment for ho spital inpatient services, whereas laboratory services are paid unde r a different payment system. Second, as meaningful use is currently constrained to the inpa tient and emergency departments, it would be inconsistent to 284 expand it to include lab results for patients that are not admitted to ei ther the inpatient or emergency department of the hospital. Third, systems used by hospitals to process and send laboratory results are not traditi onally considered part of CEHRT, and including those systems in CEHRT could have many unintended consequences and costs. Response : We believe the statute supports a defi nition of meaningful use that is not limited to actions taken within the inpatient de partment of a hospital. The meaningful use incentive payments and payment adjustments for Me dicare eligible hospita ls are established in sections of the Act that are under the hospita l inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) (sections 1886(n) and 1886(b)(3)(B )(ix) of the Act, respectively). However, the statutory definition of a \"meaningful EHR user\" under sect ion 1886(n)(3) of the Act does not constrain the use of CEHRT to the inpatient department of the hos pital. The definition re quires in part that an eligible hospital must use CEHRT \"for the electr onic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care, such as promoti ng care coordination\" (sec tion 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii)), which the objective of providing st ructured electronic lab results to ambulatory providers would support. Moreover, the majority of hospital objectives for Stages 1 and 2 of meaningful use take into account actions performed in the emergency de partment as well as the inpatient department. In the Stage 1 final rule, we i ndicated that we may consider a pplying the Stage 2 criteria more broadly to all hospital outpatient settings be yond the emergency department (75 FR 44322). One of the primary reasons not to include outpatient se ttings in meaningful us e for hospitals is the potential for overlap with settings where EPs ty pically would use CEHRT. We believe there is minimal risk of such overlap with this objective, as it involves a function that is controlled by the hospital, and for which EPs are a recipient and not a provider of information. In regards to the third reason identified by comment ers, CEHRT and meaningful use already include the ability to 285 report electronic lab results to public health ag encies, so consequences and costs of such inclusion should have already occu rred. The impact of including these systems in certification is addressed in the ONC regulation publishe d elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . Comment : A few commenters supported this object ive because they believe that hospital labs have lagged behind independent la bs in providing el ectronic results. Response : We agree that hospital lab repor ting should be included as a menu set objective, but without actual data demonstrating lags by hospitals in laborat ory exchange with ambulatory providers, we do not find this to be a compelling reason to include the objective as part of the core set. Comment : Commenters believed this objective is inappropriate because the meaningful use regulations do not apply to commercial clinical laboratories, leading to an adverse market impact for hospitals in competition with others that process laboratory results for physician offices. The operational impacts of this objective are significant. In th e absence of functional health information exchanges, hospitals w ould need to create and maintain separate, system-to-system interfaces with each physic ian office that receive s laboratory results electronically, at considerable cost and effort. Th e transition to using standardized code sets in laboratories that must continue to function is challenging and burde nsome, particularly for small hospitals. Response : For these reasons, we in clude this objective and m easure in the menu set. Those hospitals that see competitive benefits in providing electronic lab results to ambulatory providers may wish to select this as a menu se t objective. Those who believe that building out the capability to provide electronic lab results is not beneficial in their competitive market environments can defer the objective. Similarly, those hospitals that c onsider the burden too 286 high can defer this objective. After consideration of public comments, we are including this objective in the menu set for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(6)(i) as \"Provide struct ured electronic lab results to ambulatory providers.\" For each objective, we outline the benefits e xpected from that objective. We did not include these benefits in our propos ed rule and we are adding them to this final rule. Hospitals sending structured lab results electronically to EPs using CEHRT and in accordance with designated standards will directly enhance the ability of EPs to meet meaningful use objectives, including incorporating laboratory te st results into the EHR as stru ctured data, generating lists of patients with particular conditions, utilizing clini cal decision support, an d enhancing the ability to calculate clinical quality measures. The addition of this objective will help improve consistency in the market, in contrast to t oday's environment in which inconsistencies in interface requirements are hindering the delivery of structured hospital lab results to ambulatory EHRs. This objective will also benefit hospitals by creating a uniform standard for laboratory exchange transactions, which will eliminate variation, reducing interface costs and time to deploy. Hospital Measure: Hospital labs send (directly or indirectly) struct ured electronic clinical lab results to the ordering provider for more than 40 percent of electronic lab orders received. The measure for this objective recommended by the HIT Policy Committee is that 40 percent of clinical lab test results electronica lly sent by an eligible hospital or CAH will need to be done so using the capabilities CEHRT. Th is measure requires that in situations where the electronic connectivity between an eligible hospita l or CAH and an EP is established, the results 287 electronically exchanged are done so using CEHR T. To facilitate the ease with which this electronic exchange may take place, ONC propo sed that for certification, ambulatory EHR technology will need to be able to incorporate lab test results formatted in the same standard and implementation specifications to which inpatien t EHR technology will need to be certified as being able to create. Comment : Some commenters who support this ob jective raised concerns that small hospitals might not be able to comply due to the burden involved and suggest an unspecified exclusion for them. Response : By including this objective as a menu set item, those hospitals that view lab reporting to ambulatory pract ices as too burdensome can defer this measure. Comment : Some commenters suppor ting the measure indicated that they would like to see hospital reference labs that are already providing electronic lab results to ordering providers \"grandfathered\" into the measure. Response: There are two reasons that a hospita l providing electronic lab results already would need special consideration. First, they are not using the sta ndards of CEHRT where available. Second, they may not have gotten the sy stem they use certified. As it is meaningful use of CEHRT we do not believe that we should include exceptions to the use of CEHRT in meaningful use. We do not believe that provid ers must \"rip and replace\" existing systems. Existing systems that support the standards of CEHRT can be certified for inclusion and those that do not support the standards can defer the objective until they upgrade to the standards of CEHRT. Comment : Commenters expressed concern that if the objective is included in meaningful use that the threshold is unattainable. They noted that for a hospital to send electronic lab results 288 the EP must be able to receive electronic resu lts and that current adopt ion rates do not indicate that 40 percent of EPs will be able to receive electronic lab results. Response : The measure uses a denominator of el ectronic lab orders received so this consideration is already built into the measure. However, we do agree with commenters that 40 percent is a high threshold for this completely new measure as it is dependent on electronic health exchange. For the final measure we re duce the threshold to 20 percent. While we considered lowering the threshold to 10 percent, the denominator limitation that the lab order must be received electronically already limits the measure to thos e ordering providers capable of submitting electronic orders and implies at least some electronic health information exchange has been established between the hos pital and the ordering provider. After considering the comments, we are finalizi ng this measure for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(6)(ii) as \"Hospital labs send stru ctured electronic clini cal lab results to the ordering provider for more than 20 percen t of electronic lab orders received.\" In order to be counted in the numerator, th e hospital would need to use CEHRT to send laboratory results to the ambulat ory provider in a way that has the potential for electronic incorporation of those results as structure data. Methods that have no potential for automatic incorporation such as \"p ortal view\" do not count in the numerat or. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use the capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(b)(6). Denominator: The number of electronic lab orders received Numerator: The number of structured clinical lab re sults sent to the ordering provider. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be greater than 20 percent. EP Objective/Measure: Record patient preferences for communication medium for 289 more than 20 percent of all unique patie nts seen during the EH R reporting period. We proposed that this require ment is better incorporated with other obj ectives that require patient communication and is not necessary as a standalone objective. Commenters were supportive of the incorpora tion of this objective and we continue to believe that it is better incorporated; therefore, we are finalizing this provision as proposed. Objective/Measure : Record care plan goals and patient instructions in the care plan for more than 10 percent of patient s seen during the reporting period. We proposed that this require ment is better incorporated with other obj ectives that require summary of care documents and is not necessary as a standalone objective. Commenters were supportive of the incorpora tion of this objective as proposed and we continue to believe that it is better incorporated ; therefore, we are finali zing this provision as proposed. Objective/Measure : Record health care team member s (including at a minimum PCP, if available) for more than 10 percent of all pa tients seen during the reporting period; this information can be unstructured. We proposed that this require ment is better incorporated with other obj ectives that require summary of care documents and is not necessary as a standalone objective. Commenters were supportive of the incorpora tion of this objective as proposed and we continue to believe that it is better incorporated; therefore, we are finalizing as proposed. Objective/Measure : Record electronic notes in patient records for more than 30 percent of office visits. In the proposed rule, we encouraged public comment regarding the inclusion of this objective/measure. We noted that narrative entr ies are considered an important component of 290 patient records and complement the structured data captured in CEHRT. We also noted our understanding that electronic note s are already widely used by providers and therefore may not need to include this as a meaningful use objective. Comment : Commenters agreed that existing technology has the capability to capture notes in an electronic form for inclusion in the patient record. Other co mmenters mentioned that not all CEHRT in use currently include the cap ability to incorporat e narrative clinical documentation. Response : We reiterate the statement in the proposed rule regarding the important contribution of narrative clinical documentation in the patient reco rd. In light of the comments that not all CEHRT currently ha s the capability to incorporate this clinical documentation, we agree to incorporate this functi onality to record electronic note s as an additional menu objective for Stage 2 of meaningful use. The ONC standards and certification criteria final rule associated with this objective/measure is publishe d elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. We believe that inclusion of electr onic patient notes to the meaningf ul use menu objectives is another incremental step towards maximi zing the potential of EHR technology. Comment : The HIT Policy Committee commented that this objective/measure should apply to both EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs because some certified EHRs do not have clinical documentation and because they believe that a co mplete record (including progress notes) is required to deliver high quality, efficient care. Response : We agree and are adopting this objective in the menu set for Stage 2 for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs in order to allow pr oviders access to the most accurate and complete patient information available electronically to support quality of care effo rts across patient care settings. 291 Comment : A commenter suggested that if this objective/measure becomes part of the final rule it will require a clear definition of how notes are defined and who may create, edit and sign them in order to be included in the m easure numerator. Othe r commenters requested clarification of the term electronic note and whether it woul d include nursing notes, flow sheets, operative reports, discharge summaries, consults , etc. in addition to basic progress notes. Response : For this objective, we have determ ined that any EP as defined for the Medicare or Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, or an authorized provider of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency depa rtments (POS 21 or 23) may author, edit, and provide an electronic signature for the electronic notes in order for them to be considered for this measure. We further define electronic notes as electronic progress notes for the purpose of this measure. We will rely on providers own dete rminations and guidelines defining when progress notes are necessary to communicat e individual patient circumstan ces and for coordination with previous documentation of patient observations, tr eatments and/or results in the electronic health record. Comment : Many commenters agreed with the inclusion of the text searchable certification requirement and agreed that portions of clinical no tes are already being collected electronically. The HIT Policy Committee recommended inclusion of this measure because some certified EHRs do not have clinical docu mentation, and believe that the benefit of a complete patient record, includi ng progress notes, is required to deliver high quality, efficient care. Several commenters were opposed to the in clusion of this additional measure in order to limit the number of reporting objectives. Response : Based on the multiple reasons stated in this preamble we agree with the benefits of including the electronic progress no tes measure in the menu set for the Stage 2 292 meaningful use objectives. We envision continue d technological advances in the capture and processing of text and diagrammatic data such as research of natural la nguage processing. We also believe there is added value in collecting both narrative data and structured data in the EHR and using that information to track key clinic al conditions and communi cating that information for care coordination purposes. Therefore, we ar e including this objective/measure to record electronic notes in the patient records for more than 30 percent of office visits or unique patients admitted to an eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS21 or 23) as was originally recommended by the HITPC. After consideration of public comments, we ar e finalizing this objective for EPs at \u00a7495.6 (k)(6)(i) and for eligible hospita ls and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(5)(i) as \"Record electronic notes in patient records.\" We are adding the measure for EPs at \u00a7495.6(k) (6)(ii) and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at \u00a7495.6(m)(5)(ii) of our regulati ons to include this new measure: EP Menu Measure: Enter at least one electronic progress note created, edited and signed by an EP for more than 30 percent of unique patients with at least one office visit during the EHR reporting period. Electronic progress note s must be text-searcha ble. Non-searchable notes do not qualify, but this does not mean that all of the content has to be character text. Drawings and other content can be included with searchable te xt notes under this measure. Eligible Hospital/CAH Menu Measure : Enter at least one electronic progress note created, edited and signed by an authorized provider of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) for more than 30 percent of unique patients admitted to the eligible hospital or CAH's inpatient or emergency department during the EHR reporting period. Electronic progress notes must be text-sea rchable. Non-searchable notes do not qualify, 293 but this does not mean that all of the content has to be character text. Drawings and other content can be included with searchab le text notes under this measure. We further specify that in order to meet this objective and measure, an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must use th e capabilities and standards of CEHRT at 45 CFR 170.314(a)(9). To calculate the percentage, CMS and ONC have worked together to define the following for these measures: Denominator : Number of unique patients with at least one office vi sit during the EHR reporting period for EPs or admitted to an eligible hospital or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) dur ing the EHR reporting period. Numerator : The number of unique patients in th e denominator who have at least one electronic progress note from an eligible profe ssional or authorized pr ovider of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency de partment (POS 21 or 23) recorded as text- searchable data. Threshold : The resulting percentage must be more than 30 percent in order for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to meet this measure. 294 TABLE B5: STAGE 2 OBJECTIVES AND MEASURES Stage 2 Objectives Health Outcomes Policy Priority Eligible Professionals Eligible Hospitals and CAHs Stage 2 Measures CORE SET Improving quality, safety, efficiency, and reducing health disparities Use computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medication, laboratory and radiology orders directly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines Use computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medication, laboratory and radiology orders directly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines More than 60 percent of medication, 30 percent of laboratory, and 30 percent of radiology orders created by the EP or authorized providers of the eligible hospital's or CAH's inpatient or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting period are recorded using CPOE.

Reporting on Clinical Quality Measures Using Certified EHR Technology by Eligible Professionals, Eligible Hospitals, and Critical Access Hospitals The following sections address CQMs repor ting requirements using CEHRT. These include: EHR technology certificatio n requirements; criteria for CQ M selection; time periods for reporting CQMs; issues related to specifications for CQMs and transmission formats; reporting options and CQMs for EPs; reporting methods for EPs; reporting options and CQMs for eligible hospitals and CAHs; and reporting methods for eligible hospitals and CAHs. 1. Time Periods for Reporting CQMs This section addresses the re porting periods and submission periods as they relate to reporting CQMs only. For a summary of the re porting and submission periods proposed for CQMs, please refer to Table 5 in the Stage 2 proposed rule (77 FR 13742). We proposed that the reporting period for CQ Ms, which is the period during which data collection or measurement for CQMs occurs, woul d continue to track with the EHR reporting periods for the meaningful use objectives and measures: EPs: January 1 through December 31 (calendar year). Eligible Hospitals and C AHs: October 1 through September 30 (federal fiscal year). EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs in their first year of meaningful use for Stage 1, any continuous 90-day period within the calendar year (CY) or federal fi scal year (FY), respectively. To avoid a payment adjustment, Medicare EPs and eligible hospitals that are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use in the year immediately preceding any payment adjustment year would have to ensure that their 90-day EHR reporting period ends at least 3 months before the end of the CY or FY, and that all submission is completed by October 1 or July 1, respectively. For more information on paymen t adjustments, see section II.D. of this final 303 rule. The submission period is the time during whic h EPs, eligible hosp itals, and CAHs may submit CQM information. We proposed the subm ission period for CQM data generally would be the 2 months immediately following the end of the EHR reporting period as follows: EPs: January 1 th rough February 28. Eligible Hospitals and CAHs : October 1 through November 30. EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs in their first year of Stage 1: Anytime after the end of their 90-day EHR reporting period until the e nd of the 2 months immediately following the end of the CY or FY, respectively. However, fo r purposes of avoiding the payment adjustments, Medicare EPs and eligible hospitals that are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use in the year immediately preceding a payment adjustment year must submit their CQM data no later than October 1 (EPs) or July 1 (eligible hospitals) of such preceding year. Comment : Several commenters stated that the first year of a new stage for reporting CQMs should only require a 90-day or 180-day re porting period instead of a 365-day reporting period. Response : We agree that vendors, EPs, eligib le hospitals, and CAHs may need more time to develop, test, and implement EHR technology certified to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria and to be able to meet the CQM reporti ng requirements that we proposed beginning in 2014. Therefore, for the reasons disc ussed in this section, we are modifying the reporting periods for CQMs in 2014 to match the EHR reporting periods th at we are finalizing for 2014. By using 3-month quarters as the repo rting periods in 2014 for providers that are beyond their first year of demonstrating meaningf ul use instead of requiring a full year as proposed, we allow vendors and health care providers as much as 9 months more time to 304 program, develop, and implement CEHRT, and meet the requirements for meaningful use in 2014. We note that the 3-month quarter repor ting period is only applicable for 2014. For 2015 and subsequent years, we are finalizing our prop osal of a full year reporting period for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs that are beyond their first year of demonstrating meaningful use. We have selected 3-month quart ers rather than any continuous 90-day period to promote more ready comparisons of data. This is particularly important for eligible hospitals and CAHs since many of the CQMs that we are finalizing for 2014 and subsequent years are also used in the CMS Hospital IQR Program. We have indicated our desire to transition the CMS Hospital IQR Program to collecting EHR-based quality data. Having data from hospitals for comparable quarter timeframes as used for the CMS Hospital IQR Program will be beneficial for comparing chart abstracted data with data derived from CEHRT and will facilitate data collection mode for potential future usage for Hospital Compare publ ic reporting and the CMS Hospital Value Based Purchasing programs. After consideration of the public comments received, we ar e finalizing th e reporting and submission periods as follows. The reporting period for CQMs generally will be the same as an EP's, eligible hospital's, or CAH's respectiv e EHR reporting period for the meaningful use objectives and measures, with the exceptions discu ssed later in this section. Please note that Medicare EPs who choose to report CQMs through the options we are finalizing that rely on other CMS programs (namely, Option 2 - PQRS (see section II.B.6.c. of this final rule) and the group reporting options - Physician Quality Repo rting System (PQRS) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) (see secti on II.B.6.d. of this final rule) w ould be subject to the reporting periods for CQMs established for those programs. As an exam ple using CY 2014, for Medicare EPs who choose to submit CQMs under Option 2 (PQRS EHR Reporting Option) for purposes 305 of satisfying the CQM reporting component of m eaningful use, the reporting periods for the PQRS EHR reporting that fall with in CY 2014 would apply. Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals must submit CQM data for a repo rting period that is the same as their EHR reporting period using the reporting methods and submission periods specified by their state Medicaid agency. In 2013, the reporting period for CQMs will continue to be an EP's, eligible hospital's or CAH's respective EHR reporting period. The submission period will be the 2 months immediately following the end of the CY or FY, respectively (EPs: January 1 through February 28, 2014; eligible hospitals and C AHs: October 1 through November 30, 2013). EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs in their first year of meaningful use may submit CQM data anytime after the end of their 90-day EHR reporting peri od until the end of the 2 months immediately following the end of the CY or FY, respectively. Beginning in 2014 and in subsequent years, for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs that are in their first year of meaningful use, the reporting period for CQMs will be their respective 90-day EHR reporting period, and they must subm it CQM data by attesta tion. The submission period will be anytime after the end of their re spective 90-day EHR reporting period until the end of the 2 months immediately following the end of the CY or FY, respectively. However, for purposes of avoiding a payment adjustment, Medicare EPs and eligible hospitals that are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use in the year immediately preceding a payment adjustment year must submit their CQM data no la ter than October 1 (EPs) or July 1 (eligible hospitals) of such preceding year . We note that these deadlines do not apply to CAHs. For more details on submission deadlines specif ic to CAHs, please refer to sec tion II.D.4. of this final rule. Beginning in 2014 and in subsequent years, EP s, eligible hospitals and CAHs that are beyond their first year of meaningful use mu st electronically submit CQM data unless the 306 Secretary lacks the capacity to accept electronic submission. In the unlikely event that the Secretary does not have the capacity to accept electronic submission, then consistent with sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(ii) and 1886(n)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, we would continue to accept attestation as a method of reporting CQMs. We would inform the pub lic of this fact by publishing a notice in the Federal Register and providing instructions on how CQM data should be submitted to us. For additional details on th e reporting methods for EPs, please refer to sections II.B.6.c. and II.B.6.d. of this final ru le, and for the reporting methods for eligible hospitals and CAHs, please refer to section II.B.8.b. of this final rule. The reporting periods for CQMs in 2014 for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that are beyond their first year of meaningful use are as follows: EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs may report CQM data for the full CY or FY 2014, respectively, if desired. Alternatively, they ma y report CQM data for the 3-month quarter(s) that is/are their respectiv e EHR reporting period. ++ For EPs, the 3-month quarters are as follows: -- January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2014 -- April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014 -- July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014 -- October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 ++ For eligible hospitals and CAHs , the 3-month quarters are as follows: -- October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013 -- January 1, 2014 through March 31, 2014 -- April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014 -- July 1, 2014 through September 30, 2014 307 In all cases of electronic submission, th e submission period will be the 2 months immediately following the end of the CY or FY, respectively. This submission period will apply regardless of whether an EP, elig ible hospital or CAH reports CQ M data for the full CY or FY, respectively, or only for a 3-month quarter: EPs: January 1, 2015 through February 28, 2015. Eligible Hospitals and CAHs: October 1, 2014 through November 30, 2014. The reporting periods for CQMs in 2015 and in subsequent years for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that are beyond their first year of meaningful use will be the full CY or FY, respectively. For EPs, we expect to accept a single annual submission. For eligible hospitals and CAHs, we expect to align with the submissi on frequency of the Hospital IQR program for electronic reporting of CQMs. We summarize the reporting and submi ssion periods beginning with CY/FY 2014 for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs reporting CQ Ms via attestation in Table 5 and reporting CQMs electronically in Table 6. TABLE 5: REPORTING AND SUBMISSI ON PERIODS FOR EPs, ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS AND CAHs IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF MEANINGFUL USE SUBMITTING CQMs VIA ATTESTAT ION BEGINNING WI TH CY/FY 2014 Provider Type Reporting Period for First Year of Meaningful Use (Stage 1) Submission Period for First Year of Meaningful Use (Stage 1)* EP 90 consecutive days Anytime immediately following the end of the 90-day reporting period, but no later than February 28 of the following calendar year.

EHR Technology Certification Re quirements for Reporting of CQMs ONC adopts certification criteria for EHR technology and proposed a 2014 Edition of certification criteria in a propos ed rule (77 FR 13832). As such, we proposed to require that CEHRT, as defined by ONC, must be used by EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to satisfy their CQM reporting requirements (77 FR 13743). We proposed that CQM reporting methods could include the following: Aggregate reporting methods (EPs , eligible hospitals, and reporting methods: ++ The PQRS EHR reporting option, the group reporting options for PQRS, the Medicare SSP or Pioneer ACOs (note: these are reporting methods for EPs) ++ The manner similar to the 2012 Medi care EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs. 309 For the attestation and aggreg ate electronic reporting methods, we proposed that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs must only submit CQMs that their EHR technology had been certified to \"incorporate and cal culate\" (45 CFR 170.314(c)(2) in ONC's rule). For example, if an EP's CEHRT was certified to calculate CQMs #1 #8 and #25, the EP would not have met th e meaningful use requirement for reporting CQMs because his/her CEHRT was not certified to calculate CQM #25. Fo r the attestation and aggregate electronic reporting methods, we pr oposed that CEHRT must be certified to the \"reporting\" certification crit erion proposed for adoption by ONC at 45 CFR 170.314(c)(3) and which focused on EHR technology's capability to create and transmit a standard aggregate XML-based file that CMS can electronically accept. Comment : Most commenters supported the requ irement that EHR technology certified to the 2014 Edition EHR certification cr iteria should be able to capt ure, accurately calculate and transmit CQM data. Many of these commenters pointed out EHR tec hnology certified to the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria did not pr oduce accurate results and was not explicitly tested and certified for accurate CQM calculation. As a result of experiences in Stage 1, some commenters recommended requiring that EHR technol ogies be able to calculate all measures finalized by CMS in order to be certified rather than requiring only one CQM to be certified, as was proposed by ONC to satisfy the Base EHR definition. Others supported EHR technology's output of data to another product for calcula tion or output in the Quality Reporting Data Architecture (QRDA) format. Many comment ers also supported consistency among EHR technologies based on certificati on and adequate testing of th e systems during certification, including use of test data. One commenter recommended closer oversight of vendors by ONC and a remediation process for vendors who do not properly implement CEHRT. 310 Many commenters stated that the specific XML-based format required by CMS for CQM reporting should be incorporated into ONC's cer tification criteria. One commenter suggested that all vendors focus on codified data collect ion and provide complete CCD extractions to another system (such as PopHealth ) and allow that system to ma nage the calculations and data tables as well as provide the ex traction of data for a QRDA report, stating that this method would save time and money because it would not requir e testing each individual EHR product. Another commenter supported the use of CQM definition s that include standa rds for technical and electronic specifications that allow for interope rability across EHRs a nd consistent use among end users. Response : Comments on EHR technology certifi cation requirements are outside the scope of this final rule and are addressed in ONC's Standards and Certification Criteria (S&CC) final rule published elsewh ere in this issue of the Federal Register . ONC has addressed the CQM requirements for the Base EHR definition, the standards necessary for the submission of CQM data to CMS, and has made other confor ming revisions to the proposed certification criteria in response to public comments received. Comment : Several commenters stated that it wa s unrealistic to expect the transition to EHR technology certified to the 2014 Edition EHR certific ation criteria to be feasible for all EPs and all eligible hospitals and CAHs at the same time. These commenters explained that EHR vendors would need to develop, te st, distribute upgraded products , and provide user support for a large number of clients in a short amount of time. Furthermore, EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs would need to devote time and resources as well as have qualified staff to purchase and implement the upgraded technology, including testing the system and training staff, which may include designing new clinical workflows. The commenters requested a more reasonable 311 approach to transitioning to the upgraded technology that would ensure proper implementation and avoid compromising patient safety. Response : We acknowledge that the transition to upgraded EHR technology will be a challenge for all parties involved. Due to se veral interrelated factor s addressed by ONC and CMS to relieve regulatory burden in our respectiv e final rules, we have respectively included certain new flexibilities for EPs, eligible hosp itals, and CAHs in order to allow for a more reasonable transition to the upgraded technology. ONC has decided to finalize a more flexible CEHRT definition for the EHR reporting periods in FY/CY 2013, which would permit EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to use EHR t echnology that has been certified only to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria. For EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs that seek to use EHR technology certified only to the 2014 Edition EHR certifica tion criteria in FY/CY 2013, we note that EHR technology certified to these criteria refl ect the new set of CQMs we adopt in this rule for reporting beginning with FY/CY 2014. We also note that the reporting requirements in FY/CY 2013 are otherwise the same as for FY/CY 2011 and 2012, including reporting on the CQMs that were finalized in the July 28, 2010 Stage 1 final rule . For EPs, the reporting schema for CY 2013 will remain 3 core or alternate core CQMs, and 3 additional CQMs, as explained in section II.B.5.b. of this final rule. We note that EHR technology certified to the 2014 Edit ion certification criteria will exclude the three CQMs that we are removing from the list of EP CQMs for reporting beginning in CY 2014 (NQF 0013, 0027, 0084). NQF 0013 is in the list of core CQMs in the Stage 1 final rule, but just as in the case where one of the core CQMs woul d not apply to an EP's scope of practice or unique patient population, EP s can select one CQM fro m the list of alternate core CQMs to replace NQF 0013. Therefore, in or der to meet the CQM reporting criteria for 312 meaningful use in CY 2013, EPs who seek to use EHR technology cer tified only to the 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria could only select from CQMs that are included in both the Stage 1 and Stage 2 final rules. For eligible hospitals and CAHs, the reporting schema for FY 2013 will remain all 15 of the CQMs finaliz ed for reporting in FYs 2011 and 2012 because all CQMs that were included in the Stage 1 final ru le are also included in the Stage 2 final rule. Comment : Most commenters stated that CQM exceptions (allowable reason for non-performance of a quality measure for patients that meet the denominat or criteria and do not meet the numerator criteria) should be incorpor ated into the CQM certif ication requirements. Many commenters also stated that EPs should not be penalized if it is later determined that a vendor has not met the certification requirement as it would be burdensome and expensive to then purchase additional certified modules and modify workflows after an existing EHR is determined to be non-certified. The same co mmenters believed that EPs should have an exemption from CQM reporting requirements of mean ingful use until measur es have been tested and vendors have shown they have me t the certification requirements. Some commenters requested de laying implementation of CQMs that require information from Labor and Delivery information systems until they are certified. One commenter stated that EHR technology should be based on the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria. Another commenter stated that very few vendors are providing QI measure data integrity and error-checking algorithms, citing the informati on in FAQ 10839 which in cludes that CMS does not require providers to record all clinical data in their CEHRT but that providers should report the CQM data exactly as it is ge nerated as output from CEHRT. Response : We do not agree with the suggestio n that EHR technology should based on the 2011 Edition EHR certification criteria. The 2014 Edition EHR certification criteria are 313 significantly enhanced compared to 2011 Edition and we believe that it is important for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs to adopt, implem ent, and use EHR technology based on the updated certification criteria. We expect that the enhancements in the 2014 Edition certification criteria will address the accuracy of outputs from CEHRT. We agree generally with the rest of the comm ents. All CQMs included in this final rule will have electronic specificati ons available at or around the time of publication. Certification requirements are outside the scope of this rule . We refer readers to ONC's S&CC final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register for information of certification requirements for items such as CQM exceptions. We discuss the testing of CQM specifications in section II.B.4. of this final rule. We encourag e EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs to refer to the Certified HIT Products List when selecting an EHR product (http://oncchpl.force.com/ehrcert ). We also encourage EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to discuss their intent to partic ipate in the EHR Incentive Progra ms with their vendors, and for vendors to communicate intentions related to ce rtification of a product with EPs, eligible hospitals or CAHs. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the proposals related to EHR technology certification require ments for reporting of CQMs subject to the discussion earlier. They include: The data reported to CMS for CQMs must originate from an EP's, eligible hospital's, or CAH's CEHRT that has been certified to \"capture and export\" in accordance with 45 CFR 170.314(c)(1) and submission\" in accordance with 45 CFR 170.314(c)(3). For attestation and the a ggregate electronic reporting met hods, the only CQMs that can be reported are those for which an EP's, eligible hospital's, or CAH's CEHRT has been certified 314 ac cordance with 45 170.314(c)(2). In FY/CY 2013, if an EP, eligible hospi tal, or CAH seeks to use EHR technology certified only to the 2014 Edition EHR certificati on criteria for reporting CQMs, they can only report those CQMs that are included in both the Stag e 1 and Stage 2 final rules. For EPs, this would exclude the option of reporting NQF 0013, 0027, 0084 from the CQMs in the Stage 1 final rule. Since NQF 0013 is a core CQM in the Stage 1 final rule, EPs would select one of the alternate core CQMs to replace it. All 15 CQMs for eligible hosp itals and CAHs in the Stage 1 final rule are included in the Stage 2 final rule. 3. Criteria for Selecting CQMs We solicited comment on a wide-ranging list of 125 potential CQMs for EPs and 49 potential CQMs for eligible hospitals and CAHs. We stated that we expected to finalize only a subset of these proposed CQMs. We discussed se veral criteria that we used to select the proposed CQMs. In the proposed rule, we stated our commi tment to align quality measurement and reporting among our programs (for example, IQR, PQRS, CHIPRA, ACO programs). We noted that our alignment efforts focus on several fronts including using the same measures for different programs, standardizing the measure developmen t and electronic specification processes across CMS programs, coordinating quality measurem ent stakeholder involvement efforts, and identifying ways to minimize multiple submission requirements and mechanisms. In the proposed rule, we gave the example that we are working toward allowing CQM data submitted via CEHRT by EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs to apply to other CMS quality reporting programs. A longer-term vision would be hospita ls and clinicians reporting through a single, aligned mechanism for multiple CMS programs. We stated our belief that the alignment options 315 proposed for PQRS/EHR Incentive Program would be a first step toward such a vision. Comment : There was strong support for aligning CQMs and reporting mechanisms across multiple quality reporting programs as well as alignment with the goals of the National Quality Strategy and the HIT Policy Committee r ecommendations. However, some commenters addressed utility of the CQMs within the EHR Incentive Program as follows: Removal of measures that are not incl uded under other quality reporting programs. Alignment in other areas such as sp ecifications, reporting methods and to whom measures are reported. Concern that the penalties that will be applied in 2015, given the many problems that were encountered implementing Stage 1 CQMs. Administrative burden required by multiple submission requirements and multiple reporting mechanisms. Where possible, one co mmenter encouraged CMS to promote and/or mandate similar action for state, accred itation body, and privat e payer reporting. Response : We appreciate the comments receive d and have made every effort to accommodate the concerns by aligning quality re porting for EPs with the PQRS EHR Reporting Option and establishing an infrastructure for elig ible hospitals and CAHs that could be used by IQR and other hospital reporting progra ms to electronically report CQMs. We continue to explore how data intermed iaries and state Medicaid Agencies could participate in and further enab le these quality measurement and reporting alignment efforts, while meeting the needs of multiple Medicare and Medicaid programs (for example, ACO programs, Dual Eligible initiatives, Medicaid shared savings efforts, CHIPRA and Affordable Care Act measure sets). Through these effort s, we intend to lesse n provider burden and harmonize with our data exchange priorities. 316 In addition to statutory require ments for EPs (see section II. B.5.a. of this final rule), eligible hospitals (see sections II.B.7.a. of this fi nal rule), and CAHs (see s ection II.B.7.a. of this final rule), we relied on other criteria to se lect the proposed CQMs for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs such as measures that can be techni cally implemented within the capacity of the CMS infrastructure for data collection, analysis, and calculation of reporting an d performance rates. This includes measures that are ready for im plementation, such as those with developed specifications for electronic submission that ha ve been used in the EHR Incentive Program or other CMS quality reporting initia tives, or that will be ready s oon after the expected publication of the final rule in 2012. This also includes meas ures that can be most efficiently implemented for data collection and submission. Comment : There were several comments on infra structure regarding quality measures, the selection of quality measures, challenges of implementing EHRs and the lack of coordination between measure developers and software vendor s. These comments included the following: CQMs require data that is not coded in a structured form at within the EHRs and thus require significant resources a nd effort, including specialized coding and training, in order to build CQMs within the EHR systems that can produce accurate results. CMS should only include measures which have been sufficiently field tested and validated. The National Qualify Forum's (NQF) Quality Data Model (QDM) and Measure Authoring Tool (MAT) have not be en sufficiently tested to ensu re valid and accurate EHR CQM calculations. A general lack of communication be tween vendors and measure stewards. There were also several comments providing ad ditional recommendations for selecting quality measures, including CQMs that: 317 Can be automatically abstracted from an EHR. Rely on data that is cons idered viable and accurate. Definitively support qua lity care improvement. Align with current quality programs. Response : The CQMs that we are finalizing for reporting beginning with 2014 have either undergone feasibility testing in EHR systems and clinical settings or were finalized in the Stage 1 final rule for reporting in 2011 and 2012 and specifications have been updated based on experiences with reporting those CQMs. In addition, ONC's 2014 Edition certification criteria explicitly require that the data elements be captured for certification (see 45 CFR 170.314(c), as discussed in ONC's final rule). We have take n into account the recommen dations of commenters in our selection of the CQMs finalized for re porting beginning in 2014, and we are finalizing measures that align with current clinical quality programs as well as definitively support quality care improvements. Comment : Commenters pointed out the limita tions of current CQMs in addressing longitudinal patient care mana gement and population health. Response : We are finalizing CQMs for EPs, eligib le hospitals, and CAHs that will have electronic specifications available at or around the time of publicati on of the final rule and also meet the selection criteria described in this rule . We agree with the importance of the clinical quality measurement goals mentioned by the commenters and are working with measure stewards and measure developers to create a br oader set of electronic CQMs that would address these goals. We also identified the following as cr iteria used in selecting CQMs: CQMs that can be technically implemented within the capacity of the CMS 318 infrastructure for data collection, analysis, and calculation of reporting and performance rates. This includes CQMs that are ready for impl ementation, such as those with developed specifications for electronic submission that ha ve been used in the EHR Incentive Program or other CMS quality reporting initia tives, or that will be ready s oon after the expected publication of the final rule in 2012. This also includes CQ Ms that can be most efficiently implemented for data collection and submission. CQMs that support CMS and HHS priorities for improved quality of care for people in the United States, which are based on the March 2011 report to the Congress, \"National Strategy for Quality Improvement in Hea lth Care\" (National Quality Strategy, NQS) (http://www.healthcare.gov /law/resources/reports/nat ionalqualitystrategy032011.pdf ) and known ga ps in quality of care, su ch as measures in which performance rates are currently low or for which there is wide variab ility in performance, or that address known drivers of high morbidity and/or cost for Medicare and Medicaid. CQMs that address areas of care for differe nt types of EPs (for example, Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible physicians, and Medica id-eligible nurse-practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, dentists , physician assistants). In an effort to align the CQMs used within the EHR Incentive Program with the goals of CMS and HHS, the NQS, and the HITPC's r ecommendations, we have assessed all proposed CQMs against six domains based on the NQS's six priorities, which were further developed by the HITPC Workgroups, as follows: 319 Patient and Family Engagement . These are CQMs that reflect the potential to improve patient-centered care and the quality of care delivered to patients. They emphasize the importance of collecting patient-reported data and the ability to impact care at the individual patient level as well as the population level thro ugh greater involvement of patients and families in decision making, self care, activation, and und erstanding of their health condition and its effective management. Patient Safety . These are CQMs that reflect the safe delivery of clinic al services in both hospital and ambulatory settings and include processes that would reduce harm to patients and reduce burden of illness. These measur es should enable longitudinal assessment of condition-specific, patient-focused episodes of care. Care Coordination . These are CQMs that demonstrat e appropriate and timely sharing of information and coordination of clinical and pr eventive services among health professionals in the care team and with patients, caregivers, a nd families in order to improve appropriate and timely patient and care team communication. Population and Public Health . These are CQMs that reflect the use of clinical and preventive services and achieve improvements in the health of the population served and are especially focused on the leading causes of mort ality. These are outcome-focused and have the ability to achieve longitudinal measurement th at will demonstrate improvement or lack of improvement in the health of the US population. Efficient Use of Healthcare Resources . These are CQMs that reflect efforts to significantly improve outcomes and reduce errors. These CQMs also impact and benefit a large number of patients and emphasize the use of evid ence to best manage high priority conditions and determine appropriate use of healthcare resources. 320 Clinical Processes/Effectiveness . These are CQMs that reflect clinical care processes closely linked to outcomes based on evidence and practice guidelines. We solicited comments on these domains, and wh ether they would adequately align with and support the breadth of CMS and HHS activit ies to improve quality of care and health outcomes. Comment : Many commenters supported the NQS initiative. Many commenters stated that the domains were imprecise and some CQ Ms can be placed in multiple domains. Some commenters recommended that the Care Coordina tion domain include pre- and post-acute care providers and that the CQMs be carefully assigned to the appropriate domains. Response : We appreciate the supportive comments with respect to the NQS. We agree with commenters that certain CQMs do not fit in only a single domain. When we considered CQMs for selection, we also considered to what extent a domain is alre ady represented in the meaningful use objectives and measures, which use performance thresholds. For example, in the area of care coordination, to be a meaningful EH R user, a provider must provide a summary of care record for more than 50 percen t of their transitions of care a nd referrals. In addition, in the area of patient and family engagement, to be a meaningful EHR user a provider must make patients' health information available to them a nd potentially their caregivers and families and is responsible for ensuring that at least 5 percent of their patients or their caregivers and families actually access that information. For these reas ons, we are relaxing the requirement to report CQMs in each domain as discussed in section II.B.5.c. of this final rule for EP reporting requirements and II.B.7.c. of this final rule for eligible hospital and CAH reporting requirements. We stated in the proposed rule that we also considered the recommendations of the Measure Applications Partnershi p (MAP) for inclusion of CQMs. The MAP is a public-private 321 partnership convened by the National Qualit y Forum (NQF) for the primary purpose of providing input to HHS on selec ting performance measures fo r public reporting. The MAP published draft recommendations in thei r Pre-Rulemaking Report on January 11, 2012 (http://www.qualityforum.org/map/ ), which includes a list of, and rationales for, all the CQMs that the MAP did not support. The MAP did not review the CQMs for 2011 and 2012 that were previously adopted for the EHR Incentive Program in the Stage 1 final rule. We stated in the proposed rule that we included some of the CQ Ms not supported by the MAP in Tables 7 (EPs) and 8 (eligible hospitals and CAHs) to ensure alignment with other CMS quality reporting programs, address recommendations by other Federa l advisory committees such as the HITPC, and support other quality goals such as the Million Hearts Campai gn. We also stated that we included some CQMs to address sp ecialty areas that may not have had applicable CQMs in the Stage 1 final rule. We stated in the proposed rule that we an ticipated that only a subset of these CQMs would be finalized. We stated th at in considering which measures to finalize, we would take into account public comment on the CQMs themselves and th e priorities listed previously. We also stated that we intended to prioritize CQMs in order to align with and support to the extent possible the measurement needs of CMS program ac tivities related to quality of care, delivery system reform, and payment reform, especially the following: Encouraging the use of outcome measures , which provide foundational data needed to assess the impact of these programs on population health. Measuring progress in pr eventing and treating priority conditions, including those affecting a large number of CMS beneficiaries or contributing to a large proportion of program costs. 322 Improving patient safety and reducing medical harm. Capturing the full range of popula tions served by CMS programs. Comment : Several commenters support the inclusion of CQMs recommended by the MAP. A commenter supported CQMs which ar e both MAP evaluated and NQF endorsed. Another commenter raised concern that CMS did not have enough time to consider the MAP recommendations as the CQMs published in the proposed rule differ from those recommended by the MAP. Some commenters were con cerned that limiting the CQMs to MAP-supported and/or NQF-endorsed CQMs would discourage CQM innovation and the creation of novel CQMs and those that cover more specialties. Response : We carefully considered the MAP recommendations and took NQF endorsement status into consideration when making our CQM selections for reporting beginning with 2014. In order to align with other quality reporting programs and address recommendations by other Federal advisory committees, such as the HITPC, as well as consider CQMs endorsed by other multistakeholder groups, we considered CQ Ms that were not supported by the MAP. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizi ng the policies on criteria for selecting CQMs as proposed. 4. CQM Specification We stated in the proposed rule that we do not intend to use notice and comment rulemaking as a means to update or modify CQM speci fications. In general, it is the role of the measure steward to make changes to a CQM in te rms of the initial patie nt population, numerator, denominator, and potential exclusions. We recogn ized that it may be necessary to update CQM specifications after they have b een published to ensure their c ontinued relevance, accuracy, and validity. Measure specifications up dates may include administrative changes, such as adding the 323 NQF endorsement number to a CQM, correcting fau lty logic, adding or deleting codes as well as providing additional implementation guidance for a CQM. These changes would be described in full through supplemental update s to the electronic specifications for EHR submission provided by CMS. We stated that measures would be tracked on a version basis as updates to those CQMs ar e made, and we would require EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to submit the versions of the CQMs as identified on our website. We stated in the proposed rule that the co mplete CQM specifications would be posted on our website ( https://www.cms.gov/QualityMeasures /03_ElectronicSpecifications.asp ) at or around the time of the final rule. In order to assist the public in considering the proposed CQMs, we published tables titled \"Proposed CQMs for 2014 CMS EHR Incentive Programs for Eligible Professionals\" and \"Proposed CQMs for 2014 CM S EHR Incentive Programs for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs\" on this website. These tables contain additional information for the EP, eligible hospital, and CAH CQ Ms, respectively, which may not be found on the NQF website. We noted that some of the CQMs were still bein g developed and that the additional descriptions provided in the tables may still change before the final rule is published. We noted that the titles and descriptions for the CQMs included in thes e tables were updated by the measure stewards and therefore may not match the informa tion provided on the NQF website. We proposed that, under certain circumstances , it may be necessary to remove a CQM from the EHR Incentive Programs between rulemaki ng cycles. We stated in the proposed rule that when there is reason to believe the continue d collection of a CQM as it is currently specified raises potential patient safety c oncerns and/or is no longer scie ntifically valid, we would take immediate action to remove the CQM from the EHR Incentive Programs and not wait for the next rulemaking cycle. Likewi se, we stated if a CQM undergoes a substantive change by the 324 measure steward between rulemaking cycles such that the measure's intent has changed, we would remove the measure immediately from the EHR Incentive Programs until the next rulemaking cycle when we could propose the re vised CQM for public comment. Under this proposed policy, we would promptly remove such CQMs from the set of CQMs available for EPs or eligible hospitals and CAHs to repor t under the EHR Incentive Programs, confirm the removal or propose the revised CQM, in the ne xt EHR Incentive Programs rulemaking cycle, and notify providers (EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs) and the public of our decision to remove the CQM(s) through the usual communica tion channels (memos, email notification, web site postings). Comment : Numerous commenters indicat ed the importance of having CQM specifications and implementation guides as soon as possible. Several commenters pointed out that CQMs without electronic specifications should be re-tooled as eMeasures prior to inclusion in meaningful use. Response: We will provide complete CQM speci fications at or around the time of the publication of this final rule on our website (https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiative s-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityMea sures/ElectronicSpecifications.html ). All of the CQMs that we are finalizing will be fully specified. Comment : Many commenters noted that more than 6 months is needed to deploy and adequately test upgrades that may affect c linician workflows and patient safety. Other commenters stated that software developers need at least 18 to 24 months to alter their systems and allow for installation of software to comp lete process updates, development, testing, error checks, training, and roll-out before the reporti ng periods begin. Multiple commenters requested 325 notification and a scheduled approach to maki ng changes to CQM specifications. Commenters suggested that CMS post the CQMs and update s in one place for easy reference. Response : We understand health care providers and software de velopers need sufficient time to accommodate CQM specification updates. However, we must balance this with our policy priority for CQMs to remain consistent with clinical practice guidelines and any new scientific data related to effi cacy. To address the timing concerns mentioned by commenters, we expect to make the updated specifications, which will be tracked on a version basis, publicly available through our website (https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiative s-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityMea sures/ElectronicSpecifications.html ) approximately 6 months in advance of the beginning of the CY and FY for EPs and hospitals, respectively. We will make every effort to have updated specifications made available earlier and ensure th at measure updates are limited in scope. In the event that we remove CQMs between rulemakings, we will post this information on the same website and notify the public through listserv a nd any additional communi cation channels that may be appropriate. Comment : Many commenters stated that CQM sp ecifications should not have to be updated in CEHRT during the period for which th e EHR product is certified. Some commenters pointed out the burden and complexity of supporting multiple versions of the CQMs concurrently (that is, the speci fications authorized for use w ithin the current reporting period, and the updated specifications in tended for implementation in the following reporting period). Response : CQM specifications are updated to main tain alignment with current clinical guidelines and ensure that the CQM remains rele vant and actionable within the clinical care setting. We believe the benefits of having the ability to update specifica tions more frequently 326 than the rulemaking cycle for the EHR Incentive Programs outweighs the burden and complexity identified by commenters. As a result of aligning with other quality reporting programs (for example, PQRS), the CQMs and specifications are being used in multiple programs. If we do not have the ability to update specifications annually, th en our respective programs may no longer align. Furthermore, without having the ability to upda te the specifications at least annually, the CQMs could become obsolete and would not adequately reflect curr ent best practices. The majority of the administrative changes expected in the annual sp ecification updates would reflect updates that vendors would routinely push to their clients' EHR technologies (for example, drug code updates). We did not receive any co mments on our proposed policy to remove CQMs between rulemaking cycles under certain circumstances. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the following policies on CQM specifications. Updates to CQM specificati ons may be provided annually approximately 6 months in advance of the FY/CY for hospitals and EPs, respectively. Providers will not be required to use the updated specifi cations for purposes of submitting the CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program unless specified in futu re rulemaking. We note that EPs choosing to submit CQMs through another quality reporting pr ogram (for example, PQRS) would need to use the updated specifications if required by the other program. We are finalizing the policy on removing CQMs between rulemaking cycles under certain circumstances as proposed. In the event that one or more CQMs are removed betw een rulemakings, the number of CQMs that an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must report would be reduced by the number of CQMs removed. For example, if one EP CQM was removed from the set of CQMs finalized for EPs in Table 7, 327 EPs would only be required to submit 8 CQMs in stead of 9. Likewise, if a hospital CQM is removed from the set of CQMs finalized in Tabl e 8, eligible hospitals and CAHs would only be required to submit 15 CQMs instead of 16. The requirement that the CQMs submitted cover at least 3 domains will remain the same unless all CQMs for a particular domain have been eliminated. EPs that are not affected by such a removal of a CQM between rulemakings and could report on other CQMs are ex pected to continue reporting on 9 CQMs. Likewise, eligible hospitals and CAHs that are not affected a nd could report on other CQMs are expected to continue reporting on 16 CQMs. 5. CQMs for EPs (a) Statutory and Other Considerations Sections 1848(o)(2)(A )(iii) and 1903(t)(6)(C) of the Ac t provide for the reporting of CQMs by EPs as part of demonstrating meaningful use of CEHRT. For further explanation of the statutory requirements, we refer readers to the discussion in our proposed and final rules for Stage 1 (75 FR 1870 through 1902 and 75 FR Under sections 1848(o)(1)(D)(iii ) and 1903(t)(8) of the Act, the Secretary must seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid dupl icative requirements from federal and state governments for EPs to demonstrate meaningful use of CEHRT under Medicare and Medicaid. Therefore, to meet this requirement, we con tinued our practice from Stage 1 of proposing CQMs that would apply for both the Medicare and Me dicaid EHR Incentive Programs, as listed in sections II.B.5.b. and II.B.5.c. of this final rule. Section 1848(o)(2)(B)(ii i) of the Act requires that in selecting CQMs for EPs, and in establishing the form and manner of reporting, the Secretary shall seek to avoid redundant or duplicative reporting otherwise re quired, including reporting under s ubsection (k)(2)(C) (that is, 328 reporting under the PQRS). Consistent with th at requirement, we proposed to select CQMs for EPs for the EHR Incentive Programs that align with other quality reporting programs mentioned in the proposed rule (77 FR 13745) . We stated in the proposed rule that when a CQM is included in more than one CMS quality reporting program and is reported using CEHRT, we would seek to avoid requiring EPs to report the same CQM to separate programs through multiple transactions or mechanisms. Section 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(I) of the Act requires the Secretary to give preference to CQMs endorsed by the entity with a contract with the Secretary under secti on 1890(a) (namely, the NQF). We proposed CQMs for EPs for 2013, 2014, and 2015 (and potentially subsequent years) that reflect this preference, al though we note that the Act does not require the selection of NQF endorsed CQMs for the EHR Incentive Programs. CQMs listed in this final ru le that do not have an NQF identifying number are not NQF endorsed, but are included in this final rule with the intent of eventually obtaining NQF endorsement of those CQMs determined to be critical to our program. We stated our intent to increase the total number of CQMs for EPs to include areas such as behavioral health, dental care, long-term care, speci al needs populations, and care coordination. We proposed new pediatric CQMs, an obstetric CQM, behavioral/mental health CQMs, CQMs related to HIV medical visits and antiretroviral ther apy, two oral health CQMs, as well as other CQMs that address NQS goals. Although we did not propose additional CQMs in the areas of long-term and post-acu te care due to the lack of elec tronic specifications, we stated that we would continue to develop or identify CQMs for these areas for future years. We received public comments related to statutory and other considerations. We have responded to those comments in later sections of this final rule, including comments related to form and 329 manner and the clinical areas covered by specific CQMs (see sections II.B.6.c. or II.B.6.d. of this final rule). (b) CQMs for EPs for CY 2013 We proposed that for the EHR reporting peri ods in CY 2013, EPs must submit data for the CQMs that were finalized in the Stage 1 final rule for CYs 2011 and 2012 (75 FR 44398 through 44411, Tables 6 and 7). We stated that we expected to post updates to the CQMs' electronic specifications on the EH R Incentive Program website at least 6 months prior to the start of CY 2013. As required by the Stage 1 fina l rule, EPs must report on 3 core or alternate core CQMs, plus 3 additional CQMs. We referred readers to the discussion in the Stage 1 final rule for further explanation of the require ments for reporting those CQMs (75 FR 44398 through 44411). We received no public comments and are finali zing these proposals for EPs for CY 2013. We have posted updates to the CQM specifica tions on the EHR Incentive Program website (https://www.cms.gov/apps/ama/license.asp?file= /QualityMeasures/Dow nloads/QMEPSuppleme ntal.zip ) and note that they will be optiona l with respect to CY 2013 reporting. (c) CQMs and Reporting Options for EPs Beginning with CY 2014 (i) Reporting Options We proposed two reporting options that would begin in CY 2014 for Medicare and Medicaid EPs, as described as follows: Options 1 and 2. We proposed the CQMs listed in Table 8 of the proposed rule (77 FR 13749 through 13757) for all EPs (Medicare and Medicaid) for the EHR reporting periods in CYs 2014, 2015, and poten tially subsequent ye ars, regardless of whether an EP is in Stage 1 or Stage 2 of meani ngful use. We stated that the policies and CQMs proposed for CYs 2014 and 2015 would continue to apply in CY 2016 and s ubsequent years until 330 a new rule is published. Ther efore, we referred to CQMs th at apply ''beginning with'' or ''beginning in'' CY 2014. We stated that fo r Medicaid EPs, although the reporting method for CQMs may vary by state, the set of CQMs from which to select would be the same as for Medicare EPs. We stated that Medicare EPs w ho are in their first year of Stage 1 may report CQMs by attestation. For Option 1, we proposed two alternatives (O ptions 1a and 1b), but stated that we intended to finalize only a single method. We pr oposed that Medicare EPs who participate in both the PQRS EHR reporting option and the EHR Incentive Program may choose Option 2 instead of Option 1. Option 1a: We proposed that EPs would select and report 12 CQMs from those listed in Table 8 of the proposed rule (77 FR 13749 to 13757), including at least 1 CQM from each of the 6 domains, which are described in section II.B .3. of this final rule. EPs would select the CQMs that best apply to their sc ope of practice and/or unique pa tient population. If an EP's CEHRT does not contain patient data for at le ast 12 CQMs, then the EP must report the CQMs for which there is patient data and report the remaining required CQMs as ''zero denominators'' as displayed by the EPs CEHRT. If there are no CQMs applicable to the EP's scope of practice or unique patient populations, EPs must still report 12 CQMs even if zero is the result in either the numerator and/or the denominator of the CQM. If all applicable CQMs have a value of zero from their CEHRT, then EPs must report any 12 of the CQMs. We noted one advantage of this approach is that EPs can choose CQMs that be st fit their practice and patient populations. However, because of the large number of CQMs to choose from, this approach would result in fewer EPs reporting on any given CQM, and lik ely only a small sample of patient data 331 represented in each CQM. We proposed that EP s would submit the CQM data in an XML-based format on an aggregate basis reflective of all patients without regard to payer. Option 1b: We proposed that EPs would report 11 \"core\" CQMs listed in Table 6 of the proposed rule (77 FR 13746 to 13747), plus 1 \"menu\" CQM from Table 8 of the proposed rule (77 FR 13749 to 13757). We noted that the '' core'' CQM set reflected the national priorities outlined in section II.B.3. of the proposed rule . EPs would select 1 CQM to report from the \"menu\" set based on their respective scope of practice and/or unique patient population. We explained one advantage of this approach is that quality data would be collected on a smaller set of CQMs, so the resulting data for each CQM w ould represent a larger number of patients and therefore could be more accurate. However, this approach could mean that more CQMs are reported with zero denominators (if they are not a pplicable to certain prac tices or populations), making the data less comprehensive. We stated that the policy on reporting ''zeros'' in the numerator and/or denominator of a CQM, as di scussed previously under Option 1a, would also apply for Option 1b. Option 2: Submit and satisfactorily report CQMs under the PQRS's EHR Reporting Option. We proposed that Medicare EPs who partic ipate in both the PQRS EHR reporting option and the EHR Incentive Program may choose Option 2 instead of Option 1. In order to streamline quality reporting options for EPs participating in both programs, we proposed that Medicare EPs who submit and satisfactorily re port PQRS CQMs under the PQRS 's EHR reporting option using CEHRT would satisfy the CQ M reporting requirement under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. We referred readers to 42 CFR 414. 90 and the CY 2012 Medicare PFS final rule with comment period (76 FR 73314) for more informa tion about the existing requirements of the 332 PQRS and stated that EPs who choose this Opti on 2 would be required to comply with any changes to the requirements of the PQRS that may apply in future years. Comment : Many commenters preferred Option 1a instead of 1b since it offers more flexibility and a larger selection of CQMs, especially for specialties including surgery, otolaryngology, urology, and ps ychiatry. However, they also indicated that it would be difficult to report 1 CQM from each of the 6 domains that apply to their scope of practice and/or unique patient population. Other commenters supported Option 1b over 1a as long as it limits the number of CQMs to those that vendors would be required to support. A few co mmenters suggested removing the \"one menu CQM\" requirement entirely. Many commenters suggested a modification of Options 1a and 1b to require reporting a specific number of core CQMs (fewer than the 11 proposed) and a specific number of menu CQMs (more than 1 as proposed) along with so me changes to the domain requirement. Many commenters suggested a reporting option requiring EPs to report 6 clinically relevant CQMs covering at least 2 domains, and if no CQMs are clinically relevant fo r an EP, they must demonstrate zeros in the denominator for 6 CQMs covering at least 2 domains. A few commenters suggested requiring up to 9 CQMs covering a range of 2 to 4 domains. One commenter also advocated for the retention of al l three reporting options (1a, 1b, and 2) so that EPs could select the one most appropriate to their practice. Response : We agree that a modified appro ach for Option 1 would provide a more optimal reporting schema for most EPs. In our modified approach, we included the positive and minimized the negative components of each of the two proposed options where possible. The Option 1 that we are finalizing (a s explained in detail later) decreases the number of CQMs that 333 EPs must select to report, d ecreases the total number of doma ins required to be covered among the selected CQMs, recommends but does not requi re reporting from a \"core\" set of CQMs, and offers specialist EPs the flexibility to select CQMs that are applicab le to their scope of practice. We note the following CQMs in the finalized recommended core se ts for adults and children were included in the proposed set: NQF 0018, 0022, the referral loop: receipt of specialist report. Comment : We also received many comments on Option 2. Numerous commenters supported Option 2, including the submission of CQ M data via the PQRS program and receiving credit for both PQRS and meaningful use. Ho wever, some of these commenters indicated that not all EPs qualify to participat e in PQRS. Another concern was that the patient population reported differs between the two programs in that PQRS requires reportin g on Medicare patients only, whereas meaningful use reflects all patients without regard to payer. Response : For the reporting of CQMs, we are fina lizing Option 2 as proposed in order to reduce reporting burden on EPs who participate in both programs and attain the goal of alignment with the PQRS EHR re porting option. EPs who do not participate in PQRS may submit CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program usi ng Option 1. Regardless of whether an EP chooses Option 1 or Option 2 for CQM reporting, we note that all EPs must also report the meaningful use objectives and meas ures through attesta tion, as well as meet all other meaningful use requirements. We acknowledge that under the PQRS, only Medicare patient information is submitted. In general, our preference is to measure quality at the all patient level, based on samples of all patient data (that is, patients that meet the denominator criteria of each reported CQM). We believe this provides a better assessment of ove rall care quality rendered by EPs. However, 334 although meaningful use reflects al l patients without regard to pa yer, we believe Option 2 is appropriate because it is a step in the direction of the longer- term goal of a single, aligned mechanism for multiple CMS programs. After consideration of th e public comments received, a nd for the reasons discussed earlier, we are finalizing two re porting options beginning with CY 2014 for EPs in all stages of meaningful use. These options wi ll continue to apply in the even t that we have not engaged in another round of rulemaking by CY 2016. Option 1: Report 9 CQMs covering at least 3 domains. Medicare and Medicaid EPs selecting this reporting option will be required to submit a total of 9 CQMs covering at leas t 3 domains from Table 7. We expect EPs would select the CQMs that best apply to their scope of practice and/or unique patient population. For this reporting option, CQMs will be submitted on an aggreg ate basis reflective of all patients without regard to payer. We are not re quiring the submission of a core set of CQMs, but we identify two recommended core sets, one for adults and one fo r children, that we enco urage EPs to report to the extent those CQMs are applicable to an EP's scope of practice and patient population. If an EP's CEHRT does not contain patient data for at least 9 CQMs coveri ng at least 3 domains, then the EP must report the CQMs for which there is patient data and report the remaining required CQMs as \"zero denominators\" as displayed by the EP's CEHRT. If there are no CQMs applicable to the EP's scope of practice a nd patient population, EPs must still report 9 CQMs even if zero is the result in ei ther the numerator or the denomin ator of the measure. If all applicable CQMs have a value of zero from th eir CEHRT, then EPs must report any 9 CQMs from Table 7. Option 2: Submit and satisfactorily re port CQMs under the PQRS's EHR Reporting 335 Option. Under this option, Medicare EPs who partic ipate in both the PQRS and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program will satisfy the CQM repor ting component of meaningful use if they submit and satisfactorily report PQRS CQMs un der the PQRS's EHR reporting option using CEHRT. EPs choosing to report under this option for purposes of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program will be subject to the reporting periods established for the PQRS EHR reporting option, which may be different from their EHR reportin g period for the meaningful use objectives and measures. For example, in CY 2014, an EP who is beyond his or her first year of meaningful use will have a 3-month quarter EHR reporting pe riod for the meaningful use objectives and measures, but the reporting periods for the PQRS EHR reporting option th at fall within CY 2014 would apply for purposes of reporting CQMs. We emphasize that EPs who are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use in the year immediately preceding a payment adjustment year cannot choose this Option 2 for reporting CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program. For purposes of avoiding a payment adjustment, they must subm it their CQM data by attestation no later than October 1 of such preceding year. For more information on the requirements of the PQRS, we refer readers to 42 CFR 414.90 and the CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44805 through 44988). EPs who choose this option to satisfy the CQM reporting component of meaningful use under the Medicare EHR Incentive Program will be required to comply with any changes to the PQRS that may apply in future years. (ii) CQMs We proposed to remove three CQMs beginni ng with CY 2014 for EPs at all stages of meaningful use for the following reasons: 336 NQF # 0013 - The measure steward did not submit this CQM to the NQF for continued endorsement. We included other CQMs that address high blood pressure and hypertension in Table 8 in the proposed rule. NQF #0027 - We determined this CQM is very similar to NQF #0028 a and b; therefore, to avoid duplication, we propos ed to only retain NQF # 0028 a and b. NQF #0084 - The measure steward did not submit this CQM to the NQF for continued endorsement. Additionally, CMS has decided to remove this CQM because there are other FDA-approved anticoagulant ther apies available in addition to Warfarin. We proposed to replace this measure, pending avai lability of electroni c specifications, with Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter: Chronic Anticoagulation Therapy. We did not receive public comments and are finalizing the elimination of measures NQF #0013, NQF #0027, and NQF #0084 beginning with CY 2014 fo r EPs at all stages of meaningful use. We proposed to replace NQF #0084 with NQF #1525, which was determined to contain data elements that were difficult to capture in EHRs after additiona l feasibility testing. Therefore, we are implementing an Advers e Drug Events CQM to replace NQF #0084: Title: ADE Prevention and Monitoring: Warfarin Time in Therapeutic Range. Description: Average percentage of time in wh ich individuals with atri al fibrillation who are on chronic anticoagulation have In ternational Normalized Ratio (IN R) test results within the therapeutic range during the measurement period. For a list of all the CQMs proposed for EPs to report for the EHR Incentive Programs beginning with CY 2014, please refer to Table 8 in the Stage 2 proposed rule (77 FR 13749 to 13757). We stated that we expected to finalize on ly a subset of the CQMs listed in Table 8 based on public comments and the priorities discusse d in section II.B.3. of the proposed rule. 337 We noted that some of these CQMs had not yet been submitted for consensus endorsement consideration or were under revi ew for endorsement consideration by the NQF. We stated that we expect that any measure pr oposed in Table 8 for inclusion beginning with CY 2014 would be submitted for endorsement cons ideration by the measure steward. Because measure specifications may need to be updated mo re frequently than our expected rulemaking cycle will allow for, we stated that we woul d provide updates to the specifications at least 6 months prior to the beginning of the calendar year for which the measures would be required, and we expected to update specifications annually. Comment : Many commenters indicated support for CMS's efforts to include CQMs that are broadly applicable across primary care and sp ecialist EPs. However, many commenters also stated that most of the proposed CQMs apply to primary care practices an d preventive medicine and requested more CQMs that apply to spec ialist practices or to adjust the reporting requirements to match the number of clinica lly available CQMs for nonprimary care EPs. Another commenter requested pediatricians be excluded from having to report on CQMs for patients older than 18 years old rather than ha ving to demonstrate zero denominators on a population that does not apply to them. Many commenters stated that there were too many CQMs, citing issues with implementation of such a large set of measures as well as diluting the impact of quality measurement. Some of these commenters beli eved that CMS should focus on a smaller set of CQMs to refine for accuracy in implementation. Th ey also did not believe that they should have to build CQMs into their CEHRT if those CQMs di d not apply to their scope of practice because those CQMs would only yield zero denominators. Some suggested alternatives to building out all CQMs included allowing EPs to attest to ha ving a low denominator, such as 25 or fewer 338 patients, or for CMS to assign the primary care or specialty fields that each CQM applies to, whereby EPs whose field is not listed for a par ticular CQM would be exem pt from reporting that CQM. Many of the proposed EP CQMs received support from the public. Some commenters gave feedback on specific proposed CQMs, includi ng questions on the feasib ility of reporting the CQM, issues with specific requirements of th e CQM, and preferences for preventative CQMs. A few commenters did not support finalizing CQ Ms that were not NQF endorsed. We also received suggestions for additional CQMs that were not included in the list of 125 proposed EP CQMs. A few commenters expresse d concern about the lack of tr ansparency in the development of the CQMs. Response : We stated in the Stage 2 proposed rule that we would be finalizing a subset of the proposed CQMs. We convened a Quality Meas ures Task Force (QMTF), which is made up of stakeholders from across the Department a nd includes representation from different quality reporting programs. Through the QMTF and with senior leadership, we considered public comments, feasibility of the electronic specifica tions to be captured in EHRs, and the goals stated in section II.B.3. of this final rule when selecting the finalized list of EP CQMs. By including such a large representa tion of stakeholders, we believe that we have prioritized CQMs that align with other programs, which include s CQMs that are not used in other programs currently but could be implement ed in other programs as they include more electronically specified CQMs in their respective CQM lists. This will move us closer to our longer-term goal of having a single, aligned mechanism for CQM reporting. Since the measure stewards are responsibl e for any information that affects the requirements of the CQM, we have shared th e feedback on specific CQ Ms with the respective 339 measure stewards. Consideration of both evidence and expert consensus are integral parts of the NQF's measure endorsement process. More information on this Consensus Development Process is available on the NQF website: http://www.qualityforum.org/Measuring_Perfo rmance/Consensus_Development_Process.aspx . Although we give preference to CQMs that have been endorsed by NQF, section 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(I) of the Act does not require the selection of NQF-endorsed CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program. Please refer to section II.B.3. of this final rule for the discussion on criteria for inclusion of a CQM. We appreciate the commenters' suggestions for additional CQMs that apply to specialties that may not have been as represented in th e measure set as primary care or preventative medicine. Although we cannot in this final rule select CQMs that were not proposed in the proposed rule, we will consider the suggested CQMs for future inclusion. As for the commenters' request to adjust the reporting re quirements or exclude certain specialties from reporting certain CQMs, we belie ve that our policy on allowing \"zero denominators\" to be reported allows specialists to meet the CQM re porting requirements of me aningful use and is a continuation of our policy from the Stage 1 final rule. Comment/Response : Table 7 summarizes the public comments received on specific proposed EP CQMs and the CMS rationale (tha t is, our response to the CQM-specific comment(s)) for finalizing or not finalizing the CQM for reporting beginning with CY 2014. 340 TABLE 7: SUMMARY OF EP CQM-SP ECIFIC COMMENTS AND RATIONALE TO FINALIZE OR THE CQM CQM Number Commenters Support Finalized Rationale NQF 0002 No comments No comments Yes Addresses efficient use of resources; alignment with other programs NQF 0004 Supports measure Privacy concerns; concerned that it could be difficult to implement.

NQF describes its consensus development process at http://www.qualityforum.org/Me asuring_Performance/Consensu s_Development_Process.aspx . After consideration of th e public comments received a nd the CQM selection criteria discussed, we are finalizing the list of 64 CQMs fo r EPs included in Table 7. We note that the CQMs that do not have a CQM numb er in Table 7 are those that are not NQF endorsed. EPs will identify these CQMs by the eMeasure ID and ve rsion number that will be included in the CQM specifications that will be made available on our website. We also note that three of the CQMs listed with a CQM number of TBD in Table 7 were proposed with NQF numbers but are changed to \"TBD\" in this final rule as follows: NQF 0407 is now HIV/AIDS: RNA control for Patients with HIV NQF 1335 is now Children who have dental decay or cavities NQF 1419 is now Primary Caries Prevention Intervention as Part of Well/Ill Child Care as Offered by Primary Care Medical Providers NQF 0407 referenced antiretroviral therapy as the means for RNA control. This CQM is 353 scheduled for NQF review and, due to changing clinical guidelines regarding therapies, significant change in this measur e is expected. Due to the nature of HIV/AIDS, the virus mutates frequently, necessitating frequent changes in clinical guidelines with respect to treatments. By respecifying the CQM to remove antiretroviral therapy as the specific treatment and only focus on the outcome of RNA control, th e intent of this CQM remains the same. The respecified CQM will be submitted to NQF for endorsement. NQF 1335 was endorsed as population-based CQMs rather than individual provider-level CQMs and will be respecified to include individual provider reporting, and NQF 1419 was endorsed at the indivi dual provider level but only for primary care physicians and will be respecified to include dental providers. Both will undergo additional testing, and the results for each CQM will be submitted to NQF to determine whether the respecification warrants a new NQF number. Ho wever, the intent of each of these CQMs will remain the same as proposed. The CQMs finalized in the recommended core sets are included in Table 7 and are denoted with a \"*\" for adult populations (9 CQMs) and \"**\" for pediatri c populations (9 CQMs). We believe this approach suppor ts the NQS and provides flexibili ty for specialists whose scope of practice may not be adequately represented in the proposed core CQM set. Controlling blood pressure has been and continues to be a high pr iority goal in many national health initiatives, including the Million Hearts campaign. Theref ore, we emphasize the importance of reporting NQF #0018 as a primary recommended core CQ M. We will monitor reporting on NQF #0018 and consider ways to increase its reporting. This may include, th rough future rulemaking, requiring EPs in relevant specialties such as pr imary care and cardiovascula r care to report this CQM. We note that the designation of being re commended for the adult population or pediatric population does not limit an EP from reporting the CQM only for those populations as long as 354 the patients still fit the criteria to be included in the measure (for example, the CQM numbered \"TBD - Closing the referral loop: receipt of specialist report\" is designated as a recommended core CQM for adult populations, but it can apply to pediatric populations as well).

Reporting Methods for CQMs for EPs (a) Reporting Methods for Medicaid EPs For Medicaid EPs, we stated in the proposed ru le that states are, and will continue in Stage 2 to be, responsible for determining whet her and how electronic reporting would occur, or whether they wish to continue to allow reporting through attestation. If a state does require such electronic reporting, the stat e is responsible for sharing the detail s of the process wi th its provider community. We stated that we anticipate th at whatever means states have deployed for capturing Stage 1 CQMs electronical ly would be similar for repor ting in CY 2013. However, we note that subject to our prior ap proval, this is within the stat es' purview. Beginning in CY 2014, we proposed that the states w ould establish the method and requirements, subject to CMS prior approval, for the electronic capture and reporting of CQ Ms from CEHRT. Comment : Commenters suggested unified Medicaid CQM reporting to reduce the burden on EPs operating in multiple states. Response : For the purposes of the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, EPs report CQMs to the state making the EHR incentive payment. However, data from all practice locations that are equipped with CEHRT will be used for reporti ng CQMs, even if the practice locations are in different states. After consideration of the public comments received, we ar e finalizing the policies for electronic reporting of CQMs for Medicaid EPs as proposed. As part of certification for EHR technology, ONC is including testing for data capture, CQM calcula tion, and electronic submission. For CQMs, this includes certificat ion criteria for the QRDA Category I (QRDA-I) and QRDA Category III (QRDA-III) transmission fo rmats. We expect the states that have 368 electronic reporting options for CQMs might choos e to adopt QRDA-I for patient-level data and/or QRDA-III for aggregate data as the form in which EPs would report CQM data. By adopting the same QRDA-I and/or QRDA-III th at CMS is requiring for CQM reporting, the states would be able to levera ge the development of the speci fications by CMS and the industry as well as the testing done by ONC for certification of EHR t echnology. This would reduce the burden on EHR vendors to implement a nd test different specifications. (b) Reporting Methods for Medicare EPs in CY 2013 In the Stage 2 proposed rule, we did not pr opose any reporting methods for Medicare EPs in 2013. However, in the CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44988), we proposed that EPs may continue to report by attestation CQM results as cal culated by CEHRT, as they did for 2011 and 2012. For further explanation of re porting CQMs by attestation, please see the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44430 through 44434). We also proposed in the CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44988) to continue th e voluntary electronic reporting pilot for CQMs (the PQRS - Medicare EHR Incentive Pilot) for 2013, which we had previously established for 2012. We expect to finalize in the CY 2013 Medi care PFS final rule the reporting methods that would apply in 2013 for EPs participating in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. (c) Reporting Methods for Medica re EPs Beginning with CY 2014 Under section 1848(o)(2)( A)(iii) of the Act, EPs must submit information on the CQMs selected by the Secretary \"in a form and manne r specified by the Secretary\" as part of demonstrating meaningful use of CEHRT. We proposed that Medica re EPs who are in their first year of Stage 1 may report CQMs through attest ation for a continuous 90-day EHR reporting period. We proposed that Medicare EPs who choose Option 1 for reporting CQMs would submit through an aggregate reporting method, whic h would require the EP to log into a 369 CMS-designated portal and submit through an upload process data produced as output from their CEHRT in an XML-based format specified by CMS. We proposed that Medicare EPs who choose to report CQMs as described in Op tion 2 would submit in accordance with the requirements of the PQRS program. Comment : We received several comments on the proposal to use an XML-based format for transmitting aggregate results. Those comm enters were generally in favor of using an aggregate XML and that the technical structure al igns with the PQRS registry reporting option. One commenter noted that the aggregate-level st andard QRDA-III is not currently mature. Some commenters indicated a prefer ence that the aggregate repor ting method should only require submission of one data file instead of multiple files, citing that submitting multiple files is onerous and may not be manageable due to the number of files EPs would need to upload. Response : We acknowledge that there is curr ently no consensus standard for the electronic transmission of aggregate results of CQMs. However, the 20 14 Edition certification criteria adopt the QRDA-III specif ication. As a result, we expect to be able to receive data submitted using the QRDA-III specification. We proposed to consider an \"interim subm ission\" option for Medicare EPs who are in their first year of Stage 1 and who participate in PQRS. Under this option, EPs would submit the PQRS CQM data for a continuous 90-day EHR re porting period, and the data must be received no later than October 1 to meet the requirement s of the EHR Incentive Program. We proposed that the EP would report the rema inder of his/her CQM data by th e deadline specified for PQRS in order to meet the requirements of the PQRS program. We solicited public comment on this potential option. Comment : Many commenters indicated the prop osed interim submission option for 370 Medicare EPs in their first year of Stage 1 is unclear and would involve a prohibitive amount of effort. The commenters also suggested removi ng this option. Other commenters supported the interim submission option. Response : This option was intended to accommodate Medicare EPs who are demonstrating meaningful use for the first time in 2014 and want to choose Option 2 (the PQRS EHR reporting option) for reporting CQMs. As proposed, however, it would require two submissions. We agree with the commenters th at the \"interim submissi on option\" is complex and potentially burdensome. We are not finalizing the interim submission option. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the following reporting methods for Medicare EPs beginning in CY 2014: Option 1: Aggregate reporting through a CMS-designated electronic transmission method using CEHRT. The format required for aggregate reporting will be the QRDA-III, which is an XML-based format. The electronic transmission method for aggregate reporting differs from reporting via attestation in that the QRDA-III repo rt would be generated by the EPs CEHRT and transmitted electronically rather than the aggreg ate results manually input into the Registration and Attestation system. EPs who are in thei r first year of Stage 1 must report CQMs under Option 1 through attestation (please refer to the St age 1 final rule for an explanation of reporting CQMs through attestation (75 FR 44430 thr ough 44434)). Consistent with section 1848(o)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, in the unlikely event that the Secret ary does not have the capacity to receive CQM data electronically, EPs who are beyond the first year of Stage 1 may continue to report aggregate CQM results through attestation. Option 2: Patient-level reporting via PQRS through the transmission methods 371 established for the PQRS EHR-based reporting mechanisms and using CEHRT. Please refer to 42 CFR 414.90 and the CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44988) for more information on the PQRS. (d) Group Reporting Option for Medicare a nd Medicaid EPs Beginning with CY 2014 For Stage 1, EPs were required to report the CQMs on an individual basis and did not have an option to report the CQMs as part of a group practice. Under section 1848(o)(2)(A) of the Act, the Secretary may provide for the use of alternative means for EPs furnishing covered professional services in a group pr actice (as defined by the Secretar y) to meet the requirements of meaningful use. Beginning with CY 2014, we proposed three group reporting options to allow EPs within a single group pr actice to report CQM data on a group level. We proposed that all three methods would be available for Medi care EPs, while only the first one would be possible for Medicaid EPs, at states' discretion. We proposed each of these options as an al ternative to reporting CQM data as an individual EP under the proposed options and reporting methods disc ussed earlier in this rule. These group reporting options would only be av ailable for reporting CQMs for purposes of the EHR Incentive Program and only if all EPs in the group are beyond th e first year of Stage 1. EPs would not be able to use these group reporting options for any of the other meaningful use objectives and associated measures in the EHR Incentive Programs. The three group reporting options that we proposed for EPs are as follows: Two or more EPs, each identified with a unique NPI associated with a group practice identified under one tax identification number (TIN) may be considered an EHR Incentive Group for the purposes of reporting CQMs for the Medicare EHR Incentive Pr ogram. This group reporting option would only be available for el ectronic reporting of CQMs and would not be 372 available for those EPs in their first year of Stage 1. The CQMs re ported under this option would represent all EPs within the group. EPs who choose this group reporting option for CQMs would have to individually satisfy the objectives and associated measures for their respective stage of meaningful use. We proposed that st ates may also choose this option to accept group reporting for CQMs, based upon a predetermined definition of a \"group practice,\" such as sharing one TIN. Medicare EPs participating in the Medica re SSP and the testing of the Pioneer ACO model who use CEHRT to submit ACO measures in accordance with the requirements of the Medicare SSP would be considered to have sa tisfied their CQM reporting requirement as a group for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. The Medicare SSP does not require the use of CEHRT. However, all CQM data would have to be extracted from CEHRT in order for the EP to qualify for the Medicare EHR Incentive Progra m if an EP intends to use this group reporting option. EPs would have to indivi dually satisfy the objectives and associated measures for their respective stage of meaningful use, in addition to submitting CQMs as part of an ACO. EPs who are part of an ACO but do not enter the data used for reporting the CQMs (which excludes the survey tool or claims-based measures that ar e collected to calculate the quality performance score in the Medicare SSP) into CEHRT would not be able to meet meaningful use requirements. For more information about the requirements of the Medicare SSP, see 42 CFR 425 and the November 2, 2011 final rule (76 FR 67802). EPs who use this group reporting option for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program would be requ ired to comply with any changes to the Medicare SSP that may apply in the future. EPs w ould be required to be pa rt of a group practice (that is, two or more EPs, each identified with a unique NPI associated with a group practice identified under one TIN) to be able to use this group reporting option. 373 Medicare EPs who satisfactorily repor t PQRS CQMs using CEHRT under the PQRS Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO), would be considered to have satisfied their CQM reporting requirement as a group for the Me dicare EHR Incentive Program. For more information about the PQRS GPRO, see 42 CFR 414.90 and the CY 2012 Medicare PFS final rule (76 FR 73314) and CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule (77 FR 44805 through 44807). EPs who use this group reporting option for th e Medicare EHR Incentive Program would be required to comply with any changes to the PQRS GPRO that may apply in the future and would have to individually satisfy the objectives and as sociated measures for their respective stage of meaningful use. Comment : We received numerous comments on the proposed group reporting options. Generally, most commenters supported includin g group reporting. Many commenters indicated group reporting options are consiste nt with the intent of many of the measures and would promote a more patient focused healthcare expe rience. A commenter requested clarification regarding whether group reporting was confined to CQMs or other objectives in meaningful use as well. Other commenters requested more detail on how new EPs or EPs leaving group practices might affect reporting and validation. Commenters indi cated the requirement that only EPs beyond Stage 1 be able to use this option be eliminated because new providers join practices frequently. A commenter requeste d that new members of a practice be able to report at the same level that the group is currently reporting. Many commenters request ed greater specificity in the final rule and clarification whet her all EPs under the same TIN n eed to submit as a group, or if some can submit as a group and others individu ally. A commenter recommended that not all EPs under the same TIN should have to have ac cess to CEHRT at all gr oup practice locations. Other commenters stated that th e proposed option for group reporting is complex and suggested 374 the files submitted contain only data related to providers within the group or practice that have met the measures. A commenter indicated that the addition of multiple reporting options has made it exceedingly difficult for providers already presented with multiple reporting options across state and federal programs. Response : We agree with commenters as to the benefits of reporting and measurement at the group level. We believe it can lessen the complexity and burden of reporting and also promote a greater patient focus. Group leve l reporting can avoid the need for multiple professionals in the same practi ce to report the same information on single patient that they may each treat. It can promote team work and th e recognition that quality care often depends on interplay of multiple professionals rather that solely on a particular individual professional. Therefore, we agree that we should include the option of group reporting of CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program. With respect to applicability to measur es other than CQMs, as proposed the group reporting options in section II.B.6.d. of the pr oposed rule (77 FR 13758) would apply only to CQM reporting and not to other meaningful us e objectives and associated measures. EPs reporting CQMs under a group reporting option must still attest to the meaningful use objectives and associated measures individually or through the batch reporting proce ss we are finalizing in section II.C.1.c of this final rule to successfully demonstrate meaningful use. As for the three options for group reporting we proposed, we agree with the potential for complexity of group reporting under which different individuals within a group would be treated differently, such as the proposed requirement that all EPs in the group mu st be beyond their first year of meaningful use. We believe that this would be comp lex and difficult to operationalize, so we are not finalizing this requirement. We note that for the group reporting option under 375 PQRS and for professionals participating in th e Medicare SSP and the testing of the Pioneer ACO model, all individual s within a group are treated as bein g part of the group for the purposes of quality reporting. As a result, for the Medicare EHR Incentiv e Program, we are finalizing the following two group reporting options for the purposes of CQM reporting: Medicare EPs participati ng in the Medicare SSP and th e testing of the Pioneer ACO model who use CEHRT to submit ACO CQMs in accordance with the requirements of the Medicare SSP would be considered to have sa tisfied their CQM reporting requirement as a group for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. Medicare EPs who satisf actorily report PQRS CQMs us ing CEHRT under the PQRS GPRO would be considered to have satisfied their CQM reporting requirement as a group for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. Under the CY 2013 Medicare PFS proposed rule, additional group reporting options are proposed. We note that the proposed claims and registry options for GPRO, which do not involve the use of CE HRT, would not satisfy the CQM reporting requirement for the EHR Incentive Program. Ho wever, the options for GPRO involving the use of CEHRT, which include submissions from CEHRT directly to CMS or through a data intermediary to CMS, could satisfy the CQ M reporting requirement for the EHR Incentive Program. Under the PQRS GPRO, CQM submission is at the group level, not at the level of any individual EP that is part of the group. Each individual EP who is a member of the group would meet the CQM reporting requirement for the EH R Incentive Program if the group meets the requirements for PQRS, with the exception of the EPs in the group who are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use as noted later in this section. We do not finalize any additional requiremen ts beyond those of the programs themselves 376 for group reporting, with the exception that th e group must use CEHRT in connection with submitting CQMs. Although a group may include EPs that are demonstrating meaningful use for the first time, we emphasize that these EPs cannot use e ither of these group reporting options for reporting CQMs for the EHR Incentive Program. CQM data collected by EPs that are part of a group and are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use could still be part of the group's collective data submission. However, for purpos es of avoiding a payment adjustment, EPs who are in their first year of demonstrating mean ingful use in the year immediately preceding a payment adjustment year must individually subm it their CQM data by attestation no later than October 1 of such preceding year. We encour age EPs who would like to use the group reporting options beginning in 2014 to become meaningful EHR users in 2013. Please see section II.D.2. of this final rule for more details on payment adjustments. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, the st ates will have the option to allow group reporting of CQMs through an update to their Stat e Medicaid HIT plan, which must describe how they would address the issue of EPs w ho switch group practices during an EHR reporting period. 7. CQMs for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (a) Statutory and Other Considerations Sections 1886(n)(3)(A )(iii) and 1903(t)(6)(C) of the Ac t provide for the reporting of CQMs by eligible hospitals and CAHs as part of demonstrating meaningful use of CEHRT. For further explanation of the statut ory requirements, we refer reader s to the discussion in our Stage 1 proposed and final rules (75 FR 1870 through 1902 and 75 FR 44380 through 44435, respectively). 377 Section 1886(n)(3)(B)(i)(I) of the Act requires the Secretary to give preference to CQMs that have been selected for the purpose of appl ying section 1886(b)(3)(B)(vii i) of the Act (that is, measures that have been selected for the Hosp ital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program) or that have been endorsed by the ent ity with a contract w ith the Secretary unde r section 1890(a) of the Act (namely, the NQF). We proposed CQ Ms for eligible hospitals and CAHs for 2013, 2014, and 2015 (and potentially subsequent years) that reflect this preference, although we note that the Act does not require the selection of such CQMs for the EHR Incentive Programs. CQMs listed in this final rule that do not have an NQF identifying number are not NQF endorsed. Under section 1903(t)(8) of the Act, the Secretary must seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid dup licative requirements from federal and state governments for eligible hospitals and CAHs to demonstr ate meaningful use of CEHRT under Medicare and Medicaid. Therefore, to meet this requirement, we propos ed to continue our pr actice from Stage 1 of proposed CQMs that would apply for both the Medi care and Medicaid EH R Incentive Programs. In accordance with CMS and HHS quality goals as well as the HHS National Quality Strategy recommendations, the hospital CQMs that we proposed beginning with FY 2014 can be categorized into the following six domains, whic h are described in sectio n II.B.3. of this final rule: Patient & Family Engagement. Patient Safety. Care Coordination. Population & Public Health. Efficient Use of Healthcare Resources. 378 Clinical Process/Effectiveness. The selection of CQMs we proposed for eligible hospita ls and CAHs was based on statutory requirements, the HITPC's recommenda tions, alignment with other CMS and national hospital quality measurement programs such as the Joint Commission, the Medicare Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program a nd Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) Program, the National Quality Strategy (NQS), and other considerations discussed in sections II.B.7.b. and II.B.7.c. of the proposed rule. Section 1886(n)(3)(B )(iii) of the Act requires that in selecting measures for eligible hospitals and CAHs, and in establishing the form and manner of reporti ng, the Secretary shall seek to avoid redundant or duplicative repor ting with reporting othe rwise required. In consideration of the importance of alignment with other measure sets that apply to eligible hospitals and CAHs, we analyzed the Hosp ital IQR Program, hospital CQMs used by state Medicaid agencies, and the Joint Commission' s hospital CQMs when selecting the proposed CQMs to be reported under the EHR Incentive Pr ogram. Furthermore, as we noted in the proposed rule, we placed emphasis on those CQ Ms that are in line with the NQS and the HITPC's recommendations. Comment : Many commenters supported alignment of measure sets and reporting methods with other quality repo rting programs and agency go als, such as Hospital IQR Program, HVBP, and NQS. These commenters commended CMS's intentions to reduce duplicative requirements between programs, prevent hospitals from calculating both electronic and paper-based repo rts for the same CQMs, avoid c onfusion and move towards a single, aligned quality reporting mechanism. However, several commenters requested that we provide a timeline for these alignment effort s as well as additional clarification regarding 379 how we intend to pursue and achieve alignment across quality report programs and what this means operationally for eligible hospitals and CAHs. One co mmenter requested that we also align with the Center for Disease Contro l and Prevention's (CDC's ) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) to make hospital acquired infections (HAI) a national healthcare priority. Other commenters requested that we seek alignment and accura cy in other areas of quality measurement, including el ectronic specifications, data reporting methodologies, and vendor certification requirements. One commen ter also urged that we continuously align electronic specifications for all CQMs acr oss quality reporting programs as measure stewards update and maintain their CQMs. Response : We appreciate the supportive comments regarding alignment. Our principal goals in alignment of the Hospital IQR, a nd the Medicare and Me dicaid EHR Incentive Programs are to: (1) provide a single set of CQ Ms for hospital reporting; (2) to the extent possible, avoid duplicate reporti ng by hospitals by using a single submission for multiple purposes as appropriate; and (3) transition from manual chart abstraction to automated extraction and electronic report ing based on the use of EHR technology. In the FY 2012 Inpatient Prospective Pa yment Systems/Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (IPPS/LTCH PPS) proposed rule (76 FR 25893), we stated our intention to explore mechanisms for Hospital IQR Program data collection using EHRs, and gave FY 2015 as an example of when hospitals might be able to switch to EHR-based reporting of manually chart-abstracted Hospita l IQR measures. The CQMs we are finalizing beginning in 2014 for reporting under the EH R Incentive Program are electronically specified versions of current IQR chart abstr acted CQMs. The 2015 target date would allow for at least 1 year of electronic submi ssion of CQMs through the EHR Incentive Program 380 prior to our targeted date to begin EHR-based reporting for IQR. We must assess any data collection mode differences between EHR-base d reporting and chart abstracted measures using a diverse and robust sample of hospita ls before proposing in rulemaking to use EHR data collection in the Hospital IQR program. Am ong other factors, our ab ility to transition to EHR-based reporting for IQR will depend on whether EHR-based reporting is accurate and reliable. Our goal would be to phase out ma nual chart abstraction fo r hospital reporting. We did not propose the IQR CQMs on HAI for the EHR Incentive Program. Hospitals may electronically submit HAI info rmation to the CDC, although this is not required. Information of el ectronic submissi on through the NHSN can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/CDA_eSurveillance.html . NHSN data is based on surveillance data rather than chart abstraction. We will consider the NHSN measures for the EHR Incentive Program in future years. (b) CQMs for Eligible Hosp itals and CAHs for FY 2013 For the EHR reporting periods in FY 2013, we pr oposed to require that eligible hospitals and CAHs submit information on each of the 15 CQMs that were finalized for FYs 2011 and 2012 in the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44418 throu gh 44420). We refer readers to the discussion in the Stage 1 final rule for further explanati on of the requirements for reporting those CQMs (75 FR 44411 through 44422). We did not receive any public comments on our proposals, and we are finalizing the CQMs for FY 2013 as proposed. (c) CQMs for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs Beginning with FY 2014 (i) Reporting Options 381 We proposed to require eligib le hospitals and CAHs to re port 24 CQMs from a menu of 49 CQMs beginning with FY 2014, including at leas t 1 CQM from each of the following 6 domains, which are discussed in se ction II.B.3. of this final rule: Patient and Family Engagement. Patient Safety. Care Coordination. Population and Public Health. Efficient Use of Healthcare Resources. Clinical Process/Effectiveness. For the remaining CQMs, we proposed that eligib le hospitals and CAHs would select and report CQMs that best apply to their patient mix. We solicited comments on the number of CQMs and the appropriateness of th e CQMs and domains for eligible hospitals and CAHs. Comment : A few commenters stated that th e requirement to report 24 CQMs was too difficult and adds to the administrative bur den placed on eligible hospitals and CAHs, especially rural hospitals. Many commenters suggested th at CQM reporting requirement beginning with 2014 remain at 15 CQMs due to the number of issues experienced by hospitals when implementing the Stage 1 CQ Ms, although other commenters stated that requiring up to 18 CQMs would be reasonable. A few commenters noted that CQMs were not evenly distributed among the 6 domains, ma king the requirement to report at least one CQM from each domain difficult for some hospita ls. One commenter recommended that if a domain did not have at least 4 CQMs eligible hospitals and CAHs should not be required to report that domain. Multiple commenters stated that eligible hospitals and CAHs in Stage 1 in FY 2014 may have difficulty meeting th e CQM requirement beginning in 2014 and 382 recommend that the Stage 1 CQMs meet the requirements for those hospitals. Alternatively, the commenters recommended that if the CQMs beginning in 2014 ar e required, that the number of CQMs being reported be reduced for the eligible hospitals and CAHs in Stage 1 beginning in FY 2014. One commenter stated th at CQM requirements fa iled to align with other meaningful use objectives. Response : We acknowledge that increasing the nu mber of CQMs required to be reported from 15 in 2011, 2012, and 2013 to 24 beginning in 2014 increases implementation burden on hospitals. We have stated our intention to implement EHR-base d reporting of CQMs in other quality reporting programs, such as the Hospita l IQR Program. One purpose of our proposal to increase the number of CQMs repor ted electronically for the EHR Incentive Program is to create an electronic reporting infrastruc ture that we can also use for other quality reporting programs. We also acknowledge that the requi rement of reporting 24 CQMs for hospitals in their first year of Stage 1 in 2014 is a significant increase from the reporting requirement for hospitals that entered Stage 1 before 2014. We also acknowledg e the difficulty in meeting the requirement to report at least 1 CQM in each of the 6 domains. For these reas ons, we have finalized a policy that decreases the number of CQMs required from the proposal and decreases the total number of domains required to be cove red among the selected CQMs. After consideration of th e public comments received a nd for the reasons discussed previously, we are finalizi ng the following policy on reporting requirements for CQMs for eligible hospitals and CAHs beginning in 2014: Eligible hospitals and CAHs must report a total of 16 CQMs covering at least 3 domains from Table 8. We expect eligible hospitals and CAHs will select measures that best apply to their patient mix. As we proposed, if an elig ible hospital's or CAH's CEHRT does not contain 383 patient data for at least 16 CQ Ms covering at least 3 domains, th en the eligible hospital or CAH must report the CQMs for which there is patient da ta and report the rema ining required CQMs as \"zero denominators\" as displayed by their certif ied EHR technology. In the unlikely event that there are no CQMs applicable to th e eligible hospital's or CAH's patient mix, eligible hospitals or CAHs must still report 16 CQMs even if zero is the result in either the numerator or the denominator of the measure. If all CQMs have a value of zero from their CEHRT, then eligible hospitals or CAHs must select any 16 CQMs from Table 8 to report. We stated in the proposed rule that our experience from Stage 1 in impl ementing the current set of 15 CQMs in specialty and low volume eligible hospitals illuminated several challenges. For example, children's hospitals rarely see patients 18 years or older. One of the exceptions to this generality is individuals with sickle cell disease. National In stitutes of Health Guidelines (NIH Publication 02-2117) list the conditions under which thrombolyt ic therapy cannot be recommended for adults or children with sickle cell diseas e. This, plus the fact that ch ildren's hospitals have on average two or fewer cases of stroke per year, have cr eated workflow, cost, and clinical barriers to demonstrating meaningful use as it relate s to the CQMs for stroke and VTE. We proposed to consider whether a case num ber threshold would be appropriate, given the apparent burden on hospitals th at very seldom have the types of cases addressed by certain CQMs such that hospitals that do not have e nough cases to exceed th e threshold would be exempt from reporting those CQMs. We solicite d comments on what the numerical range of threshold should be, how hospitals would demonstr ate to CMS or state Medicaid agencies that they have not exceeded this threshold, whether it should apply to only certain hospital CQMs (and if so, which ones), and the extent of the bur den on hospitals if a case number threshold is not adopted given that they are allowed to repo rt \"zeroes\" for the measures. We solicited 384 comments on limiting the case threshold exemption to only children's, cancer hospitals, and a subset of hospitals in the Indian Health System as they have a much narrower patient base than acute care and critical access hospitals. We requested comments on whether such thresholds should be established for 2013, noting that the i ssue could be mitigated beginning in 2014 by our proposal to establish a larger menu set of CQMs from which hospitals would select. Comment : Many commenters noted that the implementation of a case number threshold for CQM reporting would help reduce the burden placed on hospitals that very seldom have cases in the denominator of certain CQMs. However, commenters suggested differing mechanisms by which to implement a case number threshold. Many commenters suggested that we use Medicare claims data from the year pr ior to a hospital's CQM submission or another historical data source to determine whether a ho spital should be exempt from reporting certain CQMs. Another commenter suggested that the si mplest option would be to continue to allow hospitals to report zeroes in the denominators for CQMs. A few commente rs requested that we implement a case number threshold for all hospital types, not just specialty hospitals or CAHs, since some acute care hospitals do not provide a full range of services. A nother commenter suggested that we work with children's hospita ls and CAHs and other ty pes of hospitals with unique patient populations to ensure that meaningf ul use requirements are feasible for them. Some commenters stated that lo w volume eligible hospitals an d CAHs would not know at the beginning of a reporting period which CQMs wo uld not meet a case number threshold and therefore should not have to select the CQMs in advance ba sed on this criterion. This commenter suggested that the hosp itals select the CQMs to report that are most appropriate for their patient populations. One commenter requested that a case number threshold be implemented for all CQM reporting for FY 2013. 385 In terms of a specific case number threshold, one commenter suggested five or fewer cases per month as an appropriate threshold number to exempt any type of hospital from reporting a CQM. This same commenter also suggested that if a hospital does not have a least one CQM in a domain with a denominator great er than five, then th at hospital should be exempt from reporting on that entire domain. Another commenter suggested exempting eligible hospitals and CAHs from reporting a CQM if the relevant patient population comprised less than 10 percent of their discharges. Other commenters suggested that children's hospitals be excluded from all CQMs that are only applicable to patients 18 years of age or older. Another commenter recommended that we set a case number threshold of 30 cases and require hospitals to va lidate this exemption through attestation. Other commenters did not suggest a specific case nu mber threshold, but requested that we empirically derive this value and that it be aligned with va lues across quality reporting programs. Response : We recognize the potential cost and work flow challenges when hospitals have a low volume of cases per year that apply to a particular CQM. We note that under the Hospital IQR Program, we do not require a hospita l that has 5 or fewer inpatient discharges (Medicare and non-Medicare combined ) in a topic area during a quart er in which data must be submitted to submit patient-level data for that topic area for the quarter (76 FR 51641). For the Hospital IQR Program, the hospita l is still required to subm it its aggregate population and sample size counts for Medicare and non-Medicare discharges for the topic areas each quarter, and hospitals that qualify for this exception for a particular topic can still elect to voluntarily submit their patient-level data. In order to align with the Hospital IQR Program, we will adopt a similar policy for all eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in the EHR Incentive Program, whereby hospitals with 5 or fewer inpatient di scharges per quarter or 20 or fewer inpatient 386 discharges per year (Medicare and non-Medicare combined) as defined by a CQM's denominator population would be exempted fr om reporting on that CQM. After consideration of th e public comments received a nd for the reasons discussed earlier, we are finalizing the follo wing policy on case threshold exemptions for eligible hospitals and CAHs in all stages of meaningful use begi nning in FY 2014. However, eligible hospitals and CAHs that are demonstrating meaningful use for the first time must submit their CQMs through attestation and will not be able to qualify for this exemption. The burden of submitting the aggregate population and sample size counts in order to qualify for the exemption would be at least equal to the effort required to obtain and attest to the calculated CQM data. Eligible hospitals and CAHs that have 5 or fewer discharges per quarter in the same quarter as their reporting period in FY 2014, or 20 or fewer discharges per full FY reporting period beginning in FY 2015, for which data is being electronically submitted (Medicare and non-Medicare combined) as defined by the CQM' s denominator population are exempted from reporting the CQM. For exampl e, if the CQM's denominator population is ischemic stroke patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age, then the threshol d would be 5 or fewer ischemic stroke patients aged 18 years or older discharged from the hospital in the quarter for which data is being submitted (the hospital's FY 2014 3-month quarter reporting period). To be eligible for the exemption, hospitals must submit their ag gregate population and sample size counts for Medicare and non-Medicare discharges for the CQM for the reporting period no later than the 2-month submission period of October 1 thr ough November 30 immediately following the reporting period (please s ee section II.B.1. of this final rule for a description of reporting and submission periods). Hospitals will report this information in the same manner as for the Hospital IQR Program (76 FR 51639 through 51641) (www.qualitynet.org ) and the CMS/Joint Commission Sp ecifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures, located on the QualityNet website, for technical information about data submission requirements. Hospitals that do not seek an exemption under the EHR Incentive Program do not have to subm it aggregate population and sample size counts for any CQMs for the purposes of the EHR Incentive Program. (ii) Clinical Quality Measures We proposed CQMs in Table 9 of the Stage 2 proposed rule (77 FR 13760 to 13763) that would apply for all eligible hospitals and C AHs beginning with FY 2014, regardless of whether an eligible hospital or CAH is in Stage 1 or Stag e 2 of meaningful use. The set of 49 CQMs that we proposed included the curren t set of 15 CQMs that were finalized for FYs 2011 and 2012 in the Stage 1 final rule. The CQM titles and descriptions in Table 8 reflect the most current updates, as provided by the measure stewards who are re sponsible for maintaining and updating the measure specifications, and therefore may not refl ect the title and/or de scription as presented on the NQF website. Comment : Many commenters requested that we finalize fewer than 49 CQMs. The most common reasons given for reducing the co mplete list of CQMs included limitations of the vendors to program and deploy systems and fo r hospitals to effectively implement those systems, especially among resource-limited organizations. Several commenters recommended that CQ Ms that are suspended from the Hospital IQR program, not NQF endorsed, only apply to certain regions of the country or not electronically specified should not be cons idered for CQM reporting beginning in 2014. Additionally, some commenters suggested th at no new CQMs be added until CEHRT can 388 produce accurate calculations of the existi ng CQMs. A few commenters stated that increasing the number of CQMs in such a na rrow timeframe would be challenging for organizations in terms of designing, creati ng, and implementing new workflows, building, testing and modifying configurations to ensure proper discrete data capture, and training staff. O ne of these commenters requested a pha sed-in approach for calculating CQMs through EHRs and requested that we do not add any new manually abstracted CQMs in other CMS quality reporting programs. One commenter stated that it was unclear if mid-cycle modifications of measures would require hospitals to resubmit data and recommended that if a measure were modified or deleted mid-cycle that hospitals no t have to modify measures selected. Response : Some of the CQMs that were propos ed but not finalized were not submitted by the measure stewards for continued NQF endorsement (NQF 0136 Heart Failure (HF)-1 Detailed Discharge Instructions, NQF 0481 Firs t Temperature Measured within One Hour of Admission to the NICU, and NQF 0482 First NICU Temperature < 36 degrees C). We are not finalizing NQF 0143 and NQF 0144, both related to pediatric asthma, for CQM reporting beginning in 2014 because hospital performance on th ese measures in the IQR program is at or near 100 percent. While pediatric asthma is a priority for CMS, we recognize that there are greater opportunities to improve care than in meas uring the provision of re lievers and systemic corticosteroids, which are now common practic e. Our future quality measurement and improvement efforts will focus on other aspects of the clinical care for children with asthma, targeting for inclusion in CQM reporting with St age 3 rulemaking. We have also taken into consideration the ability of the eligible hospitals and CAHs to report CQMs from CEHRT when selecting the set of CQMs for reporting beginning in 2014. 389 CQM specifications will be updated on an annual basis. We will not require resubmission of data as a result of these updates. If we remove a CQM from the program, we would not require data to be submitted on any additional CQMs nor would this affect data submitted prior to removal of the CQM. See s ection II.B.4. of this final rule for additional details on this policy. Comment : Some commenters requested denomin ator definitions such as elective delivery vs. delivery based on a physician's orde r, and clarification on age ranges. A few commenters requested that some of the measure st ewards listed in Table 9 of the proposed rule be corrected. Response : Clarifications on denominator definiti ons will be provided in the electronic specifications that will be poste d on or about the publication of the final rule.

Reporting Methods for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (a) Reporting Methods in FY 2013 In the Stage 2 proposed rule, we did not propose any reporting methods for Medicare eligible hospitals and CAHs in 2013. Ho wever, in the CY 2013 OPPS proposed rule (77 FR 45188), we stated that elig ible hospitals and CAHs may c ontinue to report by attestation CQM results as calculated by CEHRT, as they did for 2011 and 2012. For further explanation of reporting CQMs by attestation, please see the St age 1 final rule (75 FR 44430 through 44434). We also proposed in the CY 2013 OPPS proposed rule (77 FR 45188) to continue for 2013 the voluntary electronic reporting pilot for CQMs (the Medicare EHR Incent ive Program Electronic 401 Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs), which we had previously established for 2012. We expect to finalize in the CY 2013 Hospital O PPS final rule the reporting methods that would apply in 2013 for eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. (b) Reporting Methods Beginning with FY 2014 Under section 1886(n)(3)( A)(iii) of the Act, eligible hospitals and CAHs must submit information on the CQMs selected by the Secr etary \"in a form and manner specified by the Secretary\" as part of demonstr ating meaningful use of CEHRT. We proposed that Medicare eligible hospitals and CAHs would select one of the following two options for submitting CQMs electronically. Option 1: Submit the selected 24 CQMs through a CMS-designated portal. We proposed that CQM data would be s ubmitted in an XML-based format on an aggregate basis reflective of all patients without regard to payer. This method would require eligible hospitals and CAHs to log into a CM S-designated portal and submit through an upload process data that is based on specified stru ctures produced as output from their CEHRT. Option 2: Submit the selected 24 CQMs in a manner similar to the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilo t for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs using CEHRT. We proposed that, as an alternative to the aggregate-level reporting schema described previously under Option 1, Medica re eligible hospitals and CAHs that successfully report CQMs through an electronic reporting method simila r to the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospital s and CAHs using CEHRT would satisfy their 402 CQMs reporting requirement under the Medicare EH R Incentive Program. Please refer to the CY 2012 OPPS final rule (76 FR 74489 thr ough 74492) for details on the pilot. We noted that the Hospital IQR program does not currently have an electronic reporting mechanism. We solicited comments on whether an electronic reporting op tion is appropriate for the Hospital IQR Program and whether it w ould provide further al ignment with the EHR Incentive Program. Comment : One commenter preferred Option 1 b ecause it seems less burdensome. This commenter believed that a third party data wareh ouse to store patient-lev el data and aggregate the results would be necessary prior to implementing Option 1. The commenter also believed that the hospital should be able to calculate its own results. Response : Hospitals have access to patient-level data. A hospital could use a CEHRT that can calculate CQM results and also directly report patient-level data to CMS, so these functions are not mutually exclusive. No data warehouse is necessary. Comment : One commenter supported both the aggregate XML-based reporting option and the option similar to the 2012 Medicare EH R Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot as well as the longer-term goal of attaining full automatic electronic reporting. Another commenter urged us to make the strategy for auto mating the reporting of CQM data clear, so that hospitals can avoid reporting the same quality data through multiple reporting mechanisms. One commenter urged us to make the necessary investment to estab lish the infrastru cture for the flow of EHR data, with careful consideration gi ven to how we will ensure reliable, valid, and complete CQM data. Response : We are working to align the EHR Incentive Program with various other quality reporting programs in orde r to reduce duplicative reportin g to the extent feasible and 403 practical, beginning with the Hospital IQR Program. Under the Hospital IQR Program, hospitals report some measures by submitting chart- abstracted patient-level data, reflective of all patients without regard to payer. Mo re information on the Hospital IQR Program, including the chart-abstracted mea sure data submission process, can be found in the \"Guide to CMS Hospital IQR Program\" \"Hospitals - Inpatient\" dropdown menu and click on the link to the guid e from the \"Handbooks \" menu on the right side of the page). We expect to establish a similar mechanism for electronic submission of CQM data for the EHR Incentive Program. The Hospital IQR Program does not curren tly have an EHR reporting option or requirement, but eligible hospitals and CAHs ha ve been able to meet the CQM requirement for the EHR Incentive Program via the electronic reporting pilot. However, we expect that the Hospital IQR Program will transition to EHR-ba sed reporting in a manner similar to the electronic reporting pilot, using an electronic transmission format such as the QRDA-I (for patient-level data). If the Hospital IQR Program establis hes an EHR reporting option or requirement, we would consider whether we should allow hospita ls to report CQMs through that mechanism using CEHRT for purposes of satisfying the CQM reporting component of the EHR Incentive Program. We proposed to consider an \"interim submi ssion\" option for Medicare eligible hospitals and CAHs that are in their fi rst year of Stage 1 beginning in FY 2014 through an electronic reporting method similar to the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs. Under th is option, eligible hospitals and CAHs would electronically submit CQM data for a conti nuous 90-day EHR reporting period, and the data 404 would have to be received no late r than July 1 to meet the requirements of the EHR Incentive Program for purposes of avoiding a payment adju stment in the following year. We solicited public comment on this potential option. Comment : One commenter supported an \"interim submission\" option for those in their first year, which the commenter st ated could also serve as a tran sitional step for those catching up. Response : Since we are allowing eligible hospita ls and CAHs to submit their CQM data through attestation if they are in their first year of Stage 1, we are not finalizing the proposed interim submission option. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the following policy for CQM reporting methods for eligible hospitals and CAHs beginning in FY 2014. Eligible hospitals and CAHs that are in th eir first year of Stage 1 must report the selected 16 CQMs through attestatio n (please refer to the Stage 1 final rule for an explanation of reporting CQMs through atte station (75 FR 44430 through 44434)). For purposes of avoiding a payment adjustment, eligible hospitals that are in their first year of demonstrating meaningful use in the ye ar immediately preceding a payment adjustment year must submit their CQM data no later than July 1 of such precedi ng year. We note that this deadline does not apply to CAHs. For more details on submissi on deadlines specific to CAHs, please refer to section II.D.4. of this final rule. Eligible hospitals and CAHs that are beyond th eir first year of meaningful use will be required to electronically submit the selected 16 CQMs using CEHRT using one of the options listed in this section of this fi nal rule. Consistent with section 1886(n)(3)(B )(ii) of the Act, in the unlikely event that the Secretary does not have the capacity to receive CQM data 405 electronically, eligible hospitals and CAHs ma y continue to report aggregate CQM results through attestation. Option 1: Submit the selected 16 CQMs on an aggregate basis through a CMS-designated transmission method using CEHRT. The CQM data will be submitted in the QRDA-III format reflective of all patients without regard to payer. This method will re quire transmitting the data via a CMS-designated transmission method. Option 2: Submit the selected 16 CQMs on a pa tient-level basis in a manner similar to the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electr onic Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs using CEHRT. As long as the CQ M data originates from CEHRT, it may be submitted directly from the hospital's CEHRT to CMS or through a data intermediary to CMS. The electronically reported patient-level CQM data must use the QRDA category I (release 2) based on the Quality Data Model (QDM), which will include only patients that meet the denominator criteria of each reported CQM w ithout regard to payer. For example, if a hospital selects NQF #0438 to report, the denominator criteria include ischemic stroke patients, so the QRDA-I for this CQM would include only ischemic stroke patients. This method will require submitting the data via a transmissi on method similar to the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot for Eligible Hospitals and CAHs (76 FR 74122). The requirement that eligible hospitals and CAHs submit patient-level data under the EHR Incentive Program is consistent with the requir ement that hospitals submit patient-level data under other quality reporting programs su ch as the Hospital IQR Program. We proposed to consider the following 4 op tions of patient popul ation - payer data submission characteristics: 406 All patients - Medicare only. All patients - all payer. Sampling - Medicare only, or Sampling - all payer. Currently, the Hospital IQR program uses th e \"sampling - all payer\" data submission characteristic. We solicited public comment on e ach of these 4 sets of characteristics and the impact they may have to vendors and hospitals, in cluding but not limited to potential issues with the respective size of data files fo r each characteristic. We proposed to select 1 of the 4 sets as the data submission characteristic for the electro nic reporting method for eligible hospitals and CAHs beginning in FY 2014. Comment : Many commenters favored the all patien t-all payer submission option. Nearly all of these commenters supported this option b ecause of challenges identifying whether a patient is covered by Medicare or not. One commenter also noted that sampling Medicare patients alone would severely decrease the population of pati ents reported in the denominator for many CQMs, and that it is difficult to validate that the sa mpling is being done correct ly. The commenter also argued that since data is captured at the time of care, there should be no difficulty submitting the data and therefore no need for sampling. A nother commenter advised against permitting sampling for CQM reporting beginning in 2014 as it adds an additional level of complexity. One commenter stated that the ideal solution would be having bot h - all patient- all payer, and all patient-Medicare only, which would allow for Medicare vs. non-Medicare comparisons. Some commenters who favored the all patient-all payer data submission option suggested that sampling-all payer be made availa ble as an alternative option, with one noting that a no-sampling method may be burdensome for hospital staff who must manually enter 407 clinical data that is not captured electronically . If sampling is adopted, the commenter asks that it align with existing Hospital IQR Prog ram sampling methodologies. One commenter preferred the sampling-all payer submission option, noting that it ali gns with the reporting method for the Hospital IQR Program. Response : We acknowledge hospitals' conce rns about accurately distinguishing Medicare patients from other patients in their populations, and recognize that reporting data on Medicare patients only would re duce the population of patients for whom data are reported in most cases. Since payer will be collected as a supplemental data element for all CQMs beginning in 2014, we will be able to stratify measure results by payer. In the 2014 Edition certification criteria, ONC has increased the focus on CEHRT's capabil ity to capture the structured data elements required for reporting the CQMs finalized in this rule. Therefore, the burden on hospital staff to manually enter data fr om a source other than the CEHRT should be greatly reduced. We also e xpect to propose electronic samp ling algorithms in future rulemaking. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing the \"sampling- all payer\" option for patient-level data. This submission characteristic will only include patients that meet the denomina tor criteria of the CQMs that the eligible hospital or CAH selects to report to CMS and only the data el ements listed in the CQM and transmission specifications for those patie nts would be sent to CMS. (c) Electronic Reporting of Clinical Quality Measures for Medicaid Eligible Hospitals States that have launched their Medicaid EH R Incentive Programs plan to collect CQMs electronically from CEHRT used by eligible hospitals. Each state is responsible for sharing the details on the process for electronic reporting with its provider community. We anticipate that 408 whatever means states have deployed for captu ring CQMs included in the Stage 1 final rule electronically will be similar for CQMs beginning in 2014. However, we note that subject to our prior approval, the process, requirements, and the timeline is within the states' purview. Comment : Commenters suggested unified Medicaid CQM reporting to reduce the burden on eligible hospitals operating in multiple states. Response : For the purposes of the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, eligible hospitals only have to report CQMs to the state making the EHR incentive payment. However, data from all practice locations that are equipped with CE HRT will be used for reporting CQMs, even if the practice locations are in different states. After consideration of the public comments received, we ar e finalizing the policies for electronic reporting of CQMs for Me dicaid eligible hospitals as pr oposed. We are clarifying that dually-eligible hospitals may submit their CQMs vi a the methods outlined in section II.B.8.b. of this final rule. As part of certification fo r EHR technology, ONC is including testing for data capture, CQM calculation, and el ectronic submission. For CQMs, this includes certification criteria for the QRDA-I and QRDA-III transmission format. We expect the states that have electronic reporting options for CQMs might choos e to adopt QRDA-I for patient-level data and/or QRDA-III for aggregate data as the form in which eligible hospitals would report CQM data. By adopting the same QRDA-I and/or QR DA-III formats that CMS is requiring for CQM reporting, the states would be able to leverage th e development of the specifications by CMS and the industry as well as the tes ting done by ONC for cer tification of EHR technology. This would reduce the burden on EHR vendors to implem ent and test different specifications. 409 C. Demonstration of Meaningful Use and Other Issues 1. Demonstration of Meaningful Use a. Common Methods of Demonstr ation in Medicare and Medicaid We proposed to continue our common method for demonstrating meaningful use in both the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. The demonstration methods we adopt for Medicare will automatically be available to the st ates for use in their Me dicaid programs. The Medicare methods are segmented into CQMs a nd meaningful use objectives, both of which meaningful users must meet. (We note that the discussion in this pa rt of the preamble discuss the methods for meaningful use objec tives. For the discussion on CQM reporting, please refer to II.B. of this final rule). We did not receive any comments on this general policy and for this final rule will continue the policy th at was proposed (that is, common methods of demonstration with some flexibility for states as described in II.A.3.c of this final rule). b. Methods for Demonstration of the Stage 2 Criteria of Meaningful Use Except for the batch reporting option discussed in section II.C.1.c. of this final rule, we proposed no other changes to the attestation process for Stage 2 meaningful use objectives. We proposed several changes to reporting for CQMs beginning 2 014, regardless of Stage, as discussed in section II.B. of this final rule. An EP, eligible hospital or CAH must successfully attest to the Stage 2 meaningful use objectives and su ccessfully submit clinical quality measures to be a meaningful EHR user. We have revi sed \u00a7495.8 to accommodate the Stage 2 objectives and measures, as well as changes to Stage 1. As discussed in our proposed rule (77 FR 13764), as HIT matures we expect to base demonstration more on automated reporting by CEHRT, such as the direct electronic reporting of measures, both clinical and nonclin ical, and documented participati on in HIE. As this occurs, 410 fewer objectives will be demons trated through attestation. As explained in the proposed rule, however, we do not believe that the current a dvances in HIT and the certification of EHR technologies allow an alternative to attestation fo r the Stage 2 final rule. We will continue to evaluate possible alternatives to attestation and the accompanyi ng changes to certification and meaningful use. In addition, in lieu of EP-by-EP attestat ion, we proposed a batch file process for attestation. This batch file proc ess would continue to require th at meaningful use measures be assessed at the individual EP, eligible hospital or CAH level. It would be available no later than January 1, 2014. Batch reporting would allow larg e group practices to su bmit a large number of attestations at once, while still maintaining i ndividual assessments of meaningful use. We proposed that a batch file pro cess as discussed later would oc cur through the CMS attestation website. Each EP would still meet the require d meaningful use thresholds independently; our proposal did not allow the use of group averages or any other method of group demonstration. We explained that CMS and the st ates could continue to test op tions, such as registries or the direct electronic reporting of some measures; however, any such testing would be voluntary. c. Group Reporting Option of Meaningful Use Core and Menu Objectives and Associated Measures for Medicare and Medi caid EPs Beginning with CY 2014 As explained previously, we proposed a batc h reporting process that would allow groups of EPs to report each individual EP's core and menu objective data throu gh a batch process, but would maintain individual assessm ents of meaningful use. (We note that the discussion in this part of the preamble does not discuss CQM reporti ng, which is discussed in II.B. of this final rule). 411 Specifically, we proposed to establish a file format in which groups could submit core and menu objective information for individual Medi care EPs (including the stage of meaningful use the individual EP is in, numerator, denomin ator, exclusion, and yes/no information for each core and menu objective) as well as a pr ocess for uploading such batch files. We proposed that states would have the opt ion, but not be requir ed to, offer batch reporting of meaningful use data for Medicaid EP , and that states would outline their approaches in their state Medicaid HIT Plans (under cu rrent regulatory require ments in \u00a7495.332(c)(2) and (c)(3)). We proposed the following policies w ould apply to batch reporting: Define a Medicare EHR Incentive Group as 2 or more EPs, each identified with a unique NPI associated with a group practice iden tified under one tax identification number (TIN) through the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). States choosing to exercise this option will have to clearly define a Medicaid EHR Incentive Group via their state Medicaid HIT Plan. None of the EPs in either a Medicare or Medicaid EHR Incentive Group could be hospital-based according to the definiti on for these programs (see 42 CFR 495.4). Any EP that successfully attests as part of one Medicare EHR Incentive Group will not be permitted to also attest individually or attest as part of a batch report for another Medicare EHR Incentive Group. Because EPs can only participate in ei ther the Medicare or Medicaid incentive programs in the same payment year, an EP that is part of a Medicare EHR Incentive Group will not be able to receive a Medicaid EHR incentive pa yment or be included as part of a batch report for a Medicaid EHR Incentive Group or vice versa. 412 The group reporting option discussed in this section is limited to data for the core and menu objectives and does not include the reporting of clinical qua lity measures, which is also required to demonstrate meaningful use and receiv e an EHR incentive paymen t. Clinical quality measures must be reported separately thr ough other electronic submission options. (These options are described in section II.B. of this final rule.). Because we proposed multiple group reporting methods for clinical quality measures, EPs will not have to report core and menu objective data in the same EHR Incentive Group as they report clinical quality measures. An EP will be able to submit the core and menu objectives as part of a group and the clinic al quality measures as an individual or submit the core and menu objectives as an individual and the clinical quality measures as part of a group. Batch reporting would not be required by CMS and t EPs will be permitted to attest individually through the CMS attesta tion website (as long as they did not also report as part of a group). As in Stage 1, EPs will be required to individually meet all of the thresholds of the core and menu objectives and could not use gr oup averages or any other method of group demonstration. Batch reporting would not change the policy that payment adjustments will be applied to individual EPs and not to Medicare EHR Incentiv e Groups. This policy is described in section II.D. of this final rule. Batch reporting would not change incentive payment assignment. That is, as with Stage 1, an EP's incentive payment will not be automatically assigned to the Medicare EHR Incentive Group with which they batch report under this option. The EP will still have to select the payee TIN during the registration process. 413 An EP who chooses the group reporting op tion will be required to include in such reporting core and menu objective information on all outpatient encounters (that is, all encounters except those in the inpatient and emer gency departments) where CEHRT is available, even if some encounters occurred at locations not associated with the EP's Medicare EHR Incentive Group. We explained that this policy is required because EPs who practice in multiple practices or locations are responsible for submitti ng complete information for all actions taken at practices/locations equipped with CEHRT. U nder \u00a7495.4, to be considered a meaningful EHR user, an EP must have 50 per cent or more of their outpatient encounters in practice(s) or location(s) where CEHRT is available. In th e July 28, 2010 final rule (75 FR 44329), we also made clear that an EP must include outpatie nt encounters for all lo cations equipped with CEHRT. There would not be a minimum participati on threshold for reporting as part of an EHR Incentive Group; in other words, an EP who is ab le to meet the 50 percent threshold of patient encounters in locations equipped with CEHRT coul d report all of their core and menu objective data as part of an EHR Incentive Group in whic h they had only 5 percent of their patient encounters with that group, provide d they report all of the data from the other locations through the same batch reporting process with the EHR Incentive Group. Many commenters supported our proposal to institute a batch reporting process. Some commenters offered comme nts or requested clarification. The summary of the comments and our responses follow: Comment : A few commenters questioned the st atement that a group for purposes of batch reporting is two or more EPs, each identif ied with a unique NPI associated with a group practice identified under one tax identification number (TIN) th rough the Provider Enrollment, 414 Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). Thes e commenters suggested that the difference between this definition of a group and the one under the Physician Qu ality Reporting System (PQRS) is confusing and shoul d be harmonized or aligned. Response : Generally we agree with the principle of aligning definitions when possible. However, this rulemaking does not address PQRS definitions. Alignment with the current PQRS definition would entail changing our policy from 2 or more EPs to 25 or more EPs. We do not believe the benefits of alignment are greater th an the administrative relief to group practices made up of 2 to 24 EPs. However, we note that in the Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule, DM E Face-to-Face Encounters, Elimination of the Requirement for Termination of Non-Random Pr epayment Complex Medical Review and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2013 proposed rule (77 FR 44722) we proposed to revise the PQRS definitions to 2 or more EPs. If finalized, the PQRS definition would align with our policy. Therefore, we are finalizing our policy that would allow batc h reporting for groups with 2 (or more) EPs that meet the rules for such reporting. After consideration of the comments, we will establish a file format in which groups coul d submit core and menu objective information for individual Medicare EPs (including the stage of meaningful use the individual EP is in, numerator, denominator, exclusion, and yes/no information for each core and menu objective) and also establish a process through which groups would submit this batc h file for upload as proposed. As noted previously, this batch file reporting process does not apply to CQM reporting, which is discussed in se ction II.B of this final rule. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e finalizing this option as proposed. There is no accompanying regulation text for this policy, as it governs the procedures for attestation, but not the m eaningful use requirements. 415 We also sought public comment on a group repo rting option that measures performance at a group, rather than at an i ndividual, level (referred to as the \"group performance\" option.) Rather than proposing a set of rules for such group performance, we requested comment on a host of topics. Many commenters supported a gr oup performance option; however, we received very few detailed comments on many of the spec ific issues we put forth for discussion. Therefore, we continue to beli eve that additional policy devel opment is necessary to address specifically how group performan ce would operate. We are not finalizing the group performance policy at this time, as we wish to consider it further. EPs will continue to be required to individually meet all of the thresholds of the core and menu objectives. The following comments were received on issues rela ting to group performance. We requested comments on the definition of \"group,\" noting that the PQRS Group Reporting Option requires a physician group practice to have a single tax payer identification number (TIN), with 25 or more individual elig ible professionals who have reassigned their billing rights to the TIN. Commenters respond ed that 25 is too larg e a number, with some suggesting 4 to 6, or even 2 or more, as an a ppropriate range. Commenters recommended that each EP within the TIN, be given the choice of pa rticipation in the group or individually. Some commenters also questioned whether a consistent TIN indicates a coherent group practice with care coordination. We requested comments on whether there s hould be a self-nomination process for groups, as in PQRS, or an alternative proce ss for identifying groups. Commenters generally supported self-nomination, if it is a simple process. We also asked whether groups should be re quired to use the same CEHRT. Some commenters believed such a requirement would be onerous, explaining that in some cases 416 imaging providers, such as radiologists have their own CEHRT. Other commenters supported using the same CEHRT to en sure consistent reporting. We questioned whether a group could be eligib le for group reporting if CEHRT (same or different) were not available to all associated EPs at all locati ons. Some commenters responded yes, that in large systems clinics may be added or upgraded at different points in time and there may be transition times during which some clinic s may not have CEHRT. Commenters stated that a threshold could be used to ensure that the EHR is available for most of the services provided by the group. Others stated that, no, groups should be held to the same standard; if the group as a whole is not eligible, individuals could still demonstrate meaningful use on an individual basis. We requested comment on the appropriate policy when a group uses multiple certified EHR technologies that cannot shar e data easily. Some commenters stated th at because the group as a whole should still have to meet the meaningf ul use objectives, interope rability should not be a barrier to group performance. These commenters stated that while in teroperability is the ultimate goal of EHR technology, it should not beco me a requirement prematurely and providers and vendors are best positioned to remedy interope rability problems. Commenters also urged us to ensure that clearinghouses and software vendo rs are within the scope of the covered entities that must comply with the rule , although no authority was cited fo r requiring such compliance. We questioned how meaningful use activities should be calculated, particularly when an EP practices individually and with a group, or in multiple group practices. Some commenters stated that meaningful use would al ways be at the group level. Othe rs stated that if there are EPs practicing across two or more groups, then ne ither group should use the group reporting option, as this could result in different menu measur e selections and other complications. Other 417 commenters recommended that the EP's covered serv ices be calculated as a whole to generate the incentive payment amount and separate payments be made to each TIN based on the percentage of the EP's covered servi ces that were assigned to each TIN. We noted that the HITECH Act provides EP s who are meaningful users an incentive payment equal to 75 percent of Medicare allowa ble charges for covered professional services furnished by the EP in a payment year. Thus, we questioned how covere d professional services performed by EPs in some other practice c ould be assigned to another group's TIN. Commenters suggested that groups could submit lists of EPs covered under its group submission and that have reassigned payment to the TIN. The covered services s hould include all covered services for the EP, regardle ss of TIN under which the servic es were billed. Commenters asserted that this process is not different from the current method in which individual EPs that work for multiple TINs can still reassign their in centive payments to a single TIN. Others recommended that for purposes of determining the 75 percent, CMS should simply limit its analysis to those services furnished at that practice. We solicited public comment on how meaningful use activities perfor med at other groups should be included. Some comment ers stated that groups should attest only for the services within the group practice, not services outside of the group. These commenters expressed concern about not being able to validate outside data. If meaningful use ac tivities outside the group were not included in group performance, we asked what the CMS policy should be for these activities perfor med outside the group. Commenters recommended that only the group activ ities should be consid ered, and that those activities performed outsi de the group should essentially be ignored. We solicited input on what our policy should be if an EP reports as part of a group, but he 418 or she actually fails to meet a measure individuall y. Commenters generally stated that individual performance should be subsumed in the group perf ormance. They assert that groups will have their own internal incentives to ensure that EPs are properly using the EHR system. Along the same lines, we requested informati on on what should happen if an EP rejects a particular objective completely. Should such an EP be considered a meaningful EHR user as long as the EP's non-participation still allows group compliance w ith a percentage threshold? Again, commenters recommended measurement solely at the group level. Again, they stated that the group practice would have its own incentives to ensure EPs within the group properly use CEHRT. We questioned how yes/no objectives s hould be handled in group reporting. Commenters again recommended measurement at th e group level: A yes would mean that the group has \"enabled\" and is using that functionality of its CEHRT. We questioned how group performance would operate in cases when some EPs in the group participate in Medicaid whil e others participate in Medicar e. Commenters stated that groups could provide lists of EP s and indicate which EPs are covered under Medicare versus Medicaid. However, in any case we, could also encourage states to accept the group's submission as applying to Medica id, as well as Medicare. While another commenter suggested that Medicare should be the default choice for a group, unless they all participate in Medicaid. As to our question of whethe r any incentive payment would be reassigned to the group automatically, or whether the EP would assign it to the group at registra tion, commenters gave conflicting recommendations. Some stated th at individual EPs could reassign incentive payments to a TIN, and that the group could, at the end of the period, pr esent a list of EPs who are within the TIN and reassigned payment to such TIN. Others favored automatic reassignment 419 to the group demonstrating group performance, partic ularly when an EP is employed or contracts with only one group, or when a state does not permit assignment to an entity promoting the adoption of EHR technology. A commenter requested clarification on how an EP joining midyear would be handled. We requested comments on the policies that w ould apply if an EP participates in one group's performance and the incentive payment we re reassigned to the group automatically, but the EP also has covered services bi lled to other TINs. Commenters stated that if an EP leaves a group, there should be a mechanism for reporting th is and allowing the EP to report individually or become part of another group; regardless , the automatic reassignment should stand. We solicited information on how to address s ituations when an EP leaves a group during an active EHR reporting period. Commenters reco mmended that incentives could be pro-rated on this basis, perhaps with \"beginning and endi ng dates\" included in the group performance file to streamline the proration. We requested information regarding payment adjustments, and whether they should also be applied at the group level. Some stated th at group performance should be consistent at the incentive and payment adjustment phases of th e EHR Incentive Program. Thus, if groups can receive incentives based on group performance, then group performance should also dictate payment adjustments at a group level. Others favored maintaining payment adjustments at the individual EP level. Finally, we solicited alternat ive options for reporting mean ingful use, while capturing necessary data. One commenter recommende d a \"sub-TIN\" group reporting option where a specific department, specialty or clinic c ould report performance on a group basis. 420 2. Data Collection for Online Posting, Progr am Coordination, and Accurate Payments In addition to the data already being co llected under our regulations at \u00a7495.10, we proposed to collect the business em ail address of EPs, e ligible hospitals and CAHs to facilitate communication with providers. We proposed to begin collecting the information as soon as the registration system can be updated following the publication of this final rule for both the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incen tive Programs. We did not propose to post this information online. In our preamble, we proposed to amend \u00a7495.10 accordingly. However, no regulation text appeared. We did not receive any comment s on our proposal. We are finalizing regulation text at \u00a7495.10(a)(3) to collect business email address. We note that we did not propose any changes to the registration for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, to the rules on EPs switching between programs, or to the record retention requirements in \u00a7495.10. We did not propose any changes to the registration for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs, to the rules on EPs switching between programs, or to the record retention requirements in \u00a7495.10. We did not receive any comm ents and we are finalizing these provisions as proposed. 3. Hospital-Based Eligible Professionals Our only proposed changes to the definition of hospital-based eligible professional were to allow the determination of hospital-based to continue once the payment adjustments go into effect, and to propose that the ho spital-based analysis at the payment adjustment phase would, for Medicare, be based on federal FY 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year . (See proposed \u00a7495.4 and section II.D.2. of this final rule.) 421 We also requested comments on whether th e definition of hospital-based should be refined to exclude from the definition those EPs who are not furnishi ng professional services \"through the use of the facilities and equipment, including qualified electronic health records, of the hospital\" (section 1903(t)(3 )(D) and 1848(o)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act). We noted that during implementation of Stage 1, we were asked about situations where clin icians may work in specialized hospital units, the clinicians ha ve independently procured and utilize EHR technology that is completely distin ct from that of the hospital, and the clinicians are capable, without the facilities and equipment of the hosp ital, of meeting the elig ible professional (for example ambulatory, not inpatient) de finition of meaningful use. We stated our belief that such situations would be uncommon and might not be generalized under the uniform definition used by place of service codes. We specifically requested co mments on the following subjects: (1) how to determine whether specialized hospital units are using stan d-alone certified EHR t echnology separate from that of the hospital; and (2) how to determin e whether EPs using stand-alone certified EHR technology separate from that of the hospital are truly not acce ssing the facilities and equipment of the hospital. We proposed that hospital f acilities and equipment w ould include the physical environment needed to support the necessary hard ware; internet connections and firewalls; the hardware itself, including servers; and system interfaces necessary for de monstrating meaningful use, for example, to health information exchanges, laboratory information systems, or pharmacies. We proposed possibly using attestati on for such elements, and noted our belief that any such attestations would be subject to audit and the False Claims Act. We also requested comments on whether th e criteria for ambulatory EHRs and the meaningful use criteria that apply to EPs could be met in cases where EPs are primarily 422 providing inpatient or Emergency Department serv ices. By definition, the EPs affected by this issue are those who provide 90 percent or more of their services in the inpatient or emergency department, and who provide less than 10 per cent of their services , and possibly none, in outpatient settings. However, since the beginning of the program, we have been clear that for EPs, meaningful use measures will not include pa tient encounters that occu r within the inpatient or emergency departments (POS 21 or 23) . See for example, FAQ 10068, 10466, and FAQ 10462 at http://questions.cms.gov or in sec tion II.A.3.d.(2). of this final rule. Some of our meaningful use criteria for EPs are measured based on office visits (clinical summaries) and others assume an ou tpatient type of setting (patient reminders). The certification rules at 45 CFR part 170 differentiate between am bulatory and inpatient EHRs, and we requested comments on whether the EPs in this case woul d have inpatient or ambulatory technology. Comment : We received detailed comments addre ssing the majority of the questions we asked about how EPs would demons trate they are not hospital-ba sed were we to revise our definition of hospital-based to exclude EPs using stand-alone CEHRT separa te from that of the hospital. These comments explained in a comprehensive manner how EPs use stand-alone CEHRT separate from that of the hospital, and also provide the faciliti es and equipment that make the use of CEHRT possible, including internet connections and firewalls. Commenters supported using the ambulatory certification criter ia and the EP meaningful use objectives and measures with the inclusion of inpatient and emergency departme nt encounters in meeting such measures. Response : Given such comprehensive comments, we believe that it is possible for EPs to provide CEHRT in the hospital environment, that is, sufficiently independent of the facilities and equipment, including qualified elec tronic health records, of the hos pital. In the Stage 1 final 423 rule, we explained why we were not interpre ting the statute to provide for individualized determinations of whether EPs were hospital- based. We focused on language in the statute stating that \"The determination of whether an el igible professional is a hospital-based eligible professional shall be made on the basis of the site of service.\" (See 75 FR 44440 through 44441). We continue to believe that this interpretation was reasonable based on the Congressional directive regarding site of servi ce. However, we are now persuaded that the statute is also capable of the interpretation advanced by the commenters. Thus, while we continue to believe our prior in terpretation was proper, we are c onvinced that other permissible interpretations may also be put forward through rulemaking. Therefore, we have added a new \u00a7495.5 to allow us to exclude EPs who can demonstrate to us that the EP funds the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of Certifie d EHR Technology, including supporting hardware and any interfaces necessary to meet meaningful use without re imbursement from an eligible hospital or CAH; and uses such Certified EHR Technology in the inpatient or emergency department of a hospital (instead of the hospital's CEHRT). Once an EP registers for a given year they wi ll know whether they are hospital based or not. An EP who is designated as hospital base d, but wishes to be determined non hospital-based due to their funding of the acquisition, implem entation and maintenance of CEHRT, including supporting hardware; and use of such CEHRT at a hospital, in lieu of using the CEHRT of such hospital will utilize an administrative proce ss throughout the incentive payment year (and extending 2 months after the end of the incentiv e payment year) to provide documentation and seek a non-hospital based determination. Following a successful non-hospital based determination, the EP must attest each subsequent year that they continue to be in the same situation of funding of the acquisition, implem entation and maintenance of CEHRT, including 424 supporting hardware; and use of such CEHRT at a hospital without reimbursement from an eligible hospital or CAH, in lieu of using the Certified EHR Technology of such hospital, but would not have to provide the supporting docume ntation again. If and when a nonhospital-based determination has been made, the EP would then have to meet the same requirements of the EHR incentive program as any other EP including being subject to payment adjustments if applicable with a sole exception: The EP would include in their attestation to meaningful use all encounters at all locations, including those in the inpatient and emergency departments of the hospital, rather than just outpatient locations (other than the em ergency department) as is the case for all other EPs. 4. Interaction with Other Programs There were no proposed changes to the ability of providers to partic ipate in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs and other CMS programs, and we are not finalizing any new policies in this area. We continue to work on aligning the data co llection and reporting of the various CMS programs, especially in the area of clinical quality meas urement. See section II.B. of this final rule for the proposed alignm ent initiatives for clinical quality measures. Comment : Several commenters suggested ch anges to other CMS programs. Response : Our proposed rule included policies for the EHR incentive program, and not other programs. Therefore, we are not addr essing comments on rules other than the EHR incentive program, as these programs are out side the scope of this rulemaking. 425 D. Medicare Fee-For-Service 1. General Background and Statutory Basis As we discussed in the Stage 1 final ru le, sections 4101(b) and 4102(b) of the HITECH Act provide for reductions in payments to EPs, hospitals, and CAHs that are not meaningful users of CEHRT; beginning in CY 2015 for EPs, FY 2015 for hospitals, and in cost reporting periods beginning in FY 2015 for CAHs. We discu ss the specific statutory requirements for each of these payment reductions in th e following three sections. In th ese sections, we also present our specific policies for implementing th ese mandatory payment reductions. 2. Payment Adjustment Effective in CY 2015 and Subsequent Years for EPs who are not Meaningful Users of CEHRT for an Applicable Reporting Period Section 1848(a)(7) of the Act, as amended by section 4101(b) of the HITECH Act, provides for payment adjustments effective fo r CY 2015 and subsequent years for EPs, as defined in \u00a7495.100 of the regula tions, who are not meaningful EHR users during the relevant EHR reporting period for the year. In general, beginning in 2015, if an EP is not a meaningful EHR user for the EHR reporting period for the ye ar, then the Medicare physician fee schedule (PFS) amount for covered professional services furnished by the EP during the year (including the fee schedule amount for purposes of determ ining a payment based on the fee schedule amount) is adjusted to equal the \"applicable per cent\" (defined later) of the fee schedule amount that will otherwise apply. As we also discu ss later, the HITECH Act includes an exception, which, if applicable, could exempt certain EPs from this payment adjustment. The payment adjustments do not apply to hospital-based EPs. The term \"applicable percent\" is defined in the statute to mean: \"(I) for 2015, 99 percent (or, in the case of an eligible professional w ho was subject to the application of the payment 426 adjustment [if the EP is not a successful elec tronic prescriber] under section 1848(a)(5) of the Act for 2014, 98 percent); (II) for 2016, 98 percen t; and (III) for 2017 and each subsequent year, 97 percent.\" In addition, section 1848(a)(7 )(iii) of the Act provides that if, for CY 2018 and subsequent years, the Secretary finds that the proportion of EP s who are meaningful EHR users is less than 75 percent, the applicable percent shall be decreased by 1 pe rcentage point for EPs who are not meaningful EHR users from the applicab le percent in the preceding year, but that in no case shall the applicable percent be less than 95 percent. Section 1848(a)(7)(B) of the Act provides that the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt an EP who is not a meaningful EH R user for the reporting period for the year from the application of the payment adjustment if th e Secretary determines that compliance with the requirements for being a meaningful EHR user would result in a si gnificant hardship, such as in the case of an EP who practices in a rural area without sufficient Internet access. The exception is subject to annual renewal, but in no case ma y an EP be granted an exception for more than 5 years. a. Applicable Payment Adjustments in CY 2015 and Subsequent Calendar Years for EPs who are not Meaningful Users of CEHRT Consistent with these provisi ons, in the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44572), we provided in \u00a7495.102(d)(1) and (2) that, beginning in CY 2015, if an EP is not a meaningful EHR user for an EHR reporting period for the year, then the Medi care PFS amount that will otherwise apply for covered professional services furnished by the EP during the year will be adjusted by the following percentages: for 2015, 99 percent (or, in the case of an EP who was subject to the application of the payment adju stment for e-prescribing under s ection 1848(a)(5) of the Act for 427 2014, 98 percent); (2) for 2016, 98 percent; and (3) for 2017 and each subsequent year, 97 percent. However, while we discussed the applicati on of the additional adjustment for CY 2018 and subsequent years if the Secretary finds that the proportion of EPs who are meaningful EHR users is less than 75 percent in the preamble to the final rule (75 FR 44447), we did not include a specific provision for this adjustment in the regu lations text. Therefore, we proposed to revise the current regulations, to provide specifically that, beginning with CY 2018 and subsequent years, if the Secretar y has found that the propor tion of EPs who are mean ingful EHR users under \u00a7495.8 is less than 75 percent, the applicable percent is decrease d by 1 percentage point for EPs who are not meaningful EHR users from the applicab le percent in the preceding year, but that in no case is the applicable percent less than 95 percent. In th e proposed rule, we stated our expectation that we would base the determinatio n of the proportion of EPs each year on the most recent CY for which we have sufficient data (t hat is, most likely, the data available as of October 1, 2017, as this is the last date for EPs to register and attest to m eaningful use to avoid a payment adjustment in CY 2018). We proposed that the computation will be based on the ratio of EPs who have qualified as meaningful users in the numerator, to Medicare-enrolled EPs in the denominator. In the proposed rule we also ex plained that because hospital-based EPs and EPs are granted an exception meet the definition of \"EP,\" we would not include such EPs in the denominator, because such EPs would not be subject to a determination of meaningful use status \"under subsection (o)(2).\" We also stated that we would provide more specific detail on this computation in future guidance after the final regulation is published. In general terms, the two aforementioned pr ovisions for payment adjustments to EPs who are not meaningful users of EHR technology have the following effects for CY 2015 and 428 subsequent years. The adjustment to the Me dicare PFS amount that will otherwise apply for covered professional services furnished by the EP will be 99 percent in CY 2015. However, for CY 2015 the adjustment for an EP who, in CY 2014, was subject to the application of the payment adjustment for e-prescribing under section 1848(a)(5) of the Act will be 98 percent of the Medicare PFS amount. In CY 2016, the adjust ment to the Medicare PFS amount that will otherwise apply will be 98 percent. Similarly, the adjustment to the Medicare PFS amount that will otherwise apply will be 97 percent in CY 2017. Depending on whether the proportion of EPs who are meaningful EHR users is less than 75 percent, the adjustment to the Medicare PFS amount can be as low as 96 percent in CY 2018, and 95 percent in CY 2019 and subsequent years. We did not receive any comments on our proposed methodology for making the determination of the applicable payment adjustment for Medicare EPs, including our proposed methodology for making the \"75 percent determin ation\" beginning for CY2018. Therefore, we are finalizing these provisions as proposed. We noted in our proposed rule that some e ligible professionals ma y be eligible for both the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives, and have opted for the Medicaid EHR incentive. Under that program, in the first year of their pa rticipation, EPs may be eligible for an incentive payment for having adopted, implemented, or upgr aded (AIU) to CEHRT. However, AIU does not constitute meaningful use of CEHRT. Th erefore, those EPs who receive an incentive payment for AIU will not be considered meaningful EHR users for purposes of determining whether EPs are subject to the Medicare payment adjustment. Medicaid EPs who meet the first year requirements through AIU in either 2013 or 2014 will still be subject to the Medicare payment adjustment in 2015 if they are not mean ingful EHR users for the applicable reporting 429 period. However, Medicaid EPs can, avoid this consequence by making sure that they meet meaningful use in 2013 (or 2014 if this is the first year of demonstrating m eaningful use). Since the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program allows EPs to in itiate as late as 2016, AIU can still be an important initial step for providers who misse d the window to avoid th e Medicare penalties, assuming they then demonstrate meaningful use in the subsequent year. Comment : Commenters stated universal support for our proposal that EPs who are meaningful EHR users under the Medicaid EHR In centive Program for an applicable reporting period will also be considered meaningful EHR us ers for that period for purposes of avoiding the Medicare payment adjustments. Response : We agree with commenters and are finalizing this provi sion as proposed for the reasons outlined in the proposed rule. Comment : A few commenters suggested that we allow Medicaid AIU to be used to avoid the payment adjustment. Response : The statute (section 1848 (a)(7) of the Act) specif ically requires that the Medicare payment adjustment be applied to an EP \"who is not a meaningful EHR user... for an EHR reporting period for the payment year.\" As we have discussed previously, AIU does not involve the demonstration of meaningful use. Therefore, we cannot accept the commenters' recommendation that demonstrati on of AIU be accepted to allow an EP to avoid the Medicare payment adjustment. After consideration of the pub lic comments received, we ar e finalizing these provisions as proposed. 430 TABLE 11: PERCENT ADJUSTMENT FOR CY 2015 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, ASSUMING THAT, FOR CY 2018 AND SUBS EQUENT YEARS, THE SECRETARY FINDS THAT LESS THAN 75 PERCENT OF EPs ARE MEANINGFUL EHR USERS EPs who are non-meaningful users 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020+ EP is not subject to the payment adjustment 2014 99% 98% 97% 96% 95% 98% 98% 97% 96% 95% 95% TABLE 12: PERCENT ADJUSTMENT FOR CY 2015 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, ASSUMING THAT THE SECRETARY ALWAYS FINDS THAT, FOR CY 2018 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS, AT LEAST 75 PERCENT OF EPs ARE MEANINGFUL EHR USERS EPs who are non-meaningful users 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020+ EP is not subject to the payment adjustment 2014 99% 98% 97% 97% 97% 2014 98% 98% 97% 97% 97% 97% of the word, \"during,\" in secti on 1848(a)(7) of the Act, which states: \"... if the eligible professi onal is not a meaningful EHR user (as determined under subsection (o)(2) for an EH R reporting period for the year , the fee schedule amount for such services furnished by such professional dur ing the year (including the fee schedule amount for purposes of determining a payment based on su ch amount) shall be equa l to the applicable percent of the fee schedule am ount that would otherwise apply to such services under this subsection (determined after application of paragra ph (3) but without regard to this paragraph).\" The commenter asserted that the phrase \"during the year\" allows the Secretary to apply the payment adjustment for any amount of time dur ing the year and does not require that the payment adjustment be applied for the entire year. Response : We disagree with this interpretation. Other parts of the statute clearly show the payment adjustment applies for a year at a time, and the Congress' intent was to have the 431 physician fee schedule adjusted for an entire cale ndar year (that is, 99 percent (or 98 percent) in 2015, 98 percent in 2016, 97 percent in 2017, and so on.) The interpretation presented by the commenters would lead to absurd results, because it would allow the payment adjustment to be minimized to the point where it has no impact on the EP. Therefore, we are finalizing the payment ad justment percentages and time periods as proposed. b. EHR Reporting Period for Determining Whether an EP is Subject to the Payment Adjustment for CY 2015 and Subsequent Calendar Years In the Stage 1 final rule, we did not speci fically discuss the EHR reporting periods that will apply for purposes of determining whether an EP is subject to the payment adjustments for CY 2015 and subsequent years. Section 1848(a)(7)(E )(ii) of the Act provides broad authority for the Secretary to choose the EHR reporting period fo r this purpose. Spec ifically, this section provides that \"term 'EHR reporti ng period' means, with respect to a year, a period (or periods) specified by the Secretary.\" Thus, the statute ne ither requires that such reporting period fall within the year of the payment adjustment, nor precludes the re porting period from falling within the year of the payment adjustment. In developing our proposals in the case of EPs, we sought to establish appropriate reporting periods for purposes of the payment ad justments in CY 2015 and subsequent years to avoid creating a situation in which it might be ne cessary either to recoup overpayments or make additional payments after a determination is ma de about whether the payment adjustment should apply. We noted that this consideration is especi ally important in the cas e of EPs because, unlike the case with eligible hospitals and CAHs, there is not an existing mechanism for reconciliation or settlement of final payments subsequent to a payment year, based on the final data for the 432 payment year. (Although, as we discussed in relation to our proposals on the payment adjustments for eligible hospita ls in CY 2015 and subsequent y ears, this consideration also carries significant weight even where such a reconciliation or settlement mechanism is available.) Similarly, we did not want to create any scenario s under which providers would be required either to refund money, or to seek addi tional payment from beneficiaries, due to the need to recalculate beneficiary coinsurance after a determination of whether the payment adjustment should apply. If we were to esta blish EHR reporting periods that run concurrently with the payment adjustment year, we would not be able to safeguard against such retroactive adjustments (potentially including adjustments to beneficiary copayments, which are determined as a percentage of the Medicare PFS amount). Therefore, we proposed that EHR reporting periods for payment adjustments will begin and end prior to the year of th e payment adjustment. Furthermore, we proposed that the EHR reporting periods for purposes of such determin ations will be far enough in advance of the payment adjustment year to give us sufficient time to implement the system edits necessary to apply any required adjustments correctly, and that EPs will know in advance of the payment adjustment year whether or not they are subject to the adjustments that we have discussed. Specifically, we proposed that th e following rules would apply fo r establishing the appropriate reporting periods for purposes of determini ng whether EPs are subject to the payment adjustments in CY 2015 and subsequent years: Except as provided in the following bu lleted paragraph for EPs who become meaningful users for the first time in 2014, we proposed that the EHR reporting period for the 2015 payment adjustment would be the same EH R reporting period that applies in order to receive the incentive for payment year 2013. We st ated that this proposal would align reporting 433 periods for multiple physician reporting programs. For EPs we proposed that the period would generally be a full calendar year of 2013 (unl ess 2013 is the first year of demonstrating meaningful use, in which case a 90-day EH R reporting period would apply). Under our proposed policy, an EP who receives an incentive for payment year 2013 would be exempt from the payment adjustment in 2015. An EP who recei ved an incentive for payment years in 2011 or 2012 (or both), but who failed to demonstrate m eaningful use in 2013 would be subject to a payment adjustment in 2015. (As all of these year s will be for Stage 1 of meaningful use, we stated our belief that it is unnece ssary to create a special proce ss to accommodate providers that miss the 2013 year for meaningful use). For each year subsequent to CY 2015, we proposed an EHR reporting period for the payment adjustment th at is the calendar year 2 years prior to the payment adjustment period, subject again to the special exception for new meaningful users of the CEHRT as follows: We proposed an exception for those EPs who never successfully attested to meaningful use prior to CY 2014. For these EPs, as it would be their first year of demonstrating meaningful use, for the 2015 payment adjustme nt, we proposed to allow a continuous 90-day reporting period that begins in 2014 and that ends at least 3 mont hs before the end of CY 2014. In addition, the EP would have to successfully register for and a ttest to meaningful use no later than the date that occurs 3 months before the e nd of CY 2014. For EPs, we stated that under our proposal, the latest day the EP must successfully re gister for the incentive program and attest to meaningful use, and thereby avoid applica tion of the adjustment in CY 2015, would be October 1, 2014. Thus, the EP's EHR reporting period would need to begin no later than July 3, 2014 (allowing the EP a 90-day EHR reporting period, followed by 1 extra day to successfully submit the attesta tion and any other information necessary to earn an incentive 434 payment). We proposed that this policy would c ontinue to apply in subsequent years for EPs who are in their first year of demonstrating mean ingful use in the year immediately preceding the payment adjustment year. Comment : Many commenters disagreed with our in terpretation of the statute. These commenters asserted that both th e Congressional intent and the language of the statute required an EHR reporting period aligned with the paym ent adjustment year. Thus, these commenters maintained that an EP should be subject to a payment adjustment during a payment year only if he or she fails to demonstrate meaningful us e during that payment year. These commenters proposed several alternative methods for employi ng an EHR reporting period that is concurrent to the payment adjustment year for EPs. Th ese recommended methods involved either making a determination of meaningful use early in a payment year, and then applying the payment adjustment (where applicable) for only a later pa rt of the year, or developing a reconciliation process at the end of the year in which the pa yment adjustment is either collected from or refunded to the EP as appropriate. Response : We disagree with the commenters' in terpretation of the statutory language. As the commenters note, section 1848(a)(7) of the SSA specifi cally requires that the Medicare payment adjustment be applied to an EP \"w ho is not a meaningful EHR user... for an EHR reporting period for the payment year.\" However, as we discussed in th e proposed rule, section 1848(a)(7)(E)(ii) of the Act specifically provides that \"term 'EHR reporting period' means, with respect to a year, a period (or periods) specified by the Secretary.\" Thus, the statute neither requires that such reporting period fall within the year of the pa yment adjustment, nor precludes the reporting period from falling w ithin the year of the payment ad justment. Rather, the statute allows the Secretary the discretion to set the EH R reporting period and link to a year of payment 435 adjustments. Indeed, given that Congress directed that the payment reduction that is applied to the physician fee schedule also apply for purposes of determining coinsurance, we believe there was an underlying intent to ensure that th e physician fee schedule amount (and whether a percentage reduction applies) w ould be known at the time coinsura nce is calculated. This would explain why Congress provided flexibility to the Secretary in determining which reporting period dictates whether the EP is subject to a payment adjustment. Finally, we note that other payment adjustment programs, such as the e-prescrib ing program, and the physician quality reporting system, also use a prior reporting period. Thus, it is consistent for us to adopt a prior reporting period for the EHR program as well. Comment : Commenters also raised two more pr actical objections to our proposal to use a prior EHR reporting period. One objection is th at there is insufficient vendor capacity for all providers to purchase CEHRT and achieve meani ngful use prior to 2015, in order to avoid the payment adjustment in 2015. Some of these commen ters asserted that the practical deadline for beginning the process of adop ting and implementing CEHRT ha s already passed for some popular vendors; thus, vendor choice is limite d by the proposed timeline. Commenters also assert that this issue is compounded because EHR vendors must upgrade current clients to 2014 CEHRT at roughly the same time. Response : We understand the commenters' con cerns. However, EPs have known for several years that they would face a payment adjustment beginning in 2015, and we believe that they have thus had adequate time to make appropr iate preparations. Duri ng the last 2 years there has been a significant adoption of CEHRT w ith over 100,000 EPs receiving an incentive for adoption/implementation/upgrade or meaningful use. We also acknowledge the concerns expressed by many commenters about vendor capacity, and esp ecially about whether every 436 vendor will be available to every EP seeking to establish meaningful use. We note that to avoid the payment adjustment in 2015, all providers wi ll be required to establish only Stage 1 of meaningful use in the applicable reporting period. For the payment adjustment in 2016, only those who first demonstrated meaningful use in 2011 or 2012 will have to demonstrate Stage 2 in the applicable reporti ng period and we are finalizing a s horter EHR reporting period for these EPs to account for the time limitations. We also believe other factors outweigh the concerns noted by commenters. As discussed previously, we do not believe the statute should be read to allow payment adjustments for only part of the y ear. Each of the other alternative suggestions presented by commenters would require reprocessing of claims for EPs, as well as addressing the difficult issue of how to adjust co -insurance in the contex t of this reprocessing (that is, to refund some coinsurance or to collect additional co insurance, depending upon the results of the reprocessing on each claim). The administrative and financial cost of the reprocessing that would be required would be quite significant for bot h CMS and the affected EPs. Especially for smaller dollar claims, it is possible that in 2015 the cost of reprocessing for CMS and EPs could exceed that payment adjustment. For example, a claim of $100 will be reduced $1 or $2 in CY 2015. If that claim was reprocessed, CMS Me dicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) would have to reprocess the claim, utilize the banking system to send the payment; the EP's accounting process would have to accept the new payment and update the old claim and possibly incur the costs of collecting or refunding coinsurance. As the pa yment adjustments increase, the balance between the cost of the payment adjustments weighed against the cost of claim reprocessing may shift. In addition, as time pa sses we also anticipate th at the supply of CEHRT and supporting services will increa se to better match demand, lessening the concerns presented by the commenters. Therefore, we are finali zing the EHR reporting period for determining 437 whether an EP is subject to the payment adju stment for CY 2015 and subsequent calendar years as proposed. The issue requiring al l providers regardless of stage of meaningful use to upgrade to 2014 CEHRT is addressed by ONC in their final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We note that all providers, regardle ss of stage, will use a 3-month EHR reporting period in 2014. c. Exception to the Applicati on of the Payment Adjustment to EPs in CY 2015 and Subsequent Calendar Years As previously discussed, section 1848(a)(7)(B ) of the Act provides that the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt an EP from the application of the payment adjustments in CY 2015 and subsequent CYs if the Secretary dete rmines that compliance with the requirements for being a meaningful EHR user will result in a si gnificant hardship, such as in the case of an EP who practices in a rural area without sufficient In ternet access. As provided in the statute, the exception is subject to annual renewal, but in no case may an EP be granted an exception for more than 5 years. We note that the HITEC H Act does not obligate the Secretary to grant exceptions. Nonetheless, in the proposed rule, we expressed our belief th at there are hardships for which an exception should be granted. We th erefore proposed three types of exceptions in the proposed rule and discussed a potential f ourth. The three proposed exceptions were, by definition, time limited and we stated that the circumstances justifying such exceptions should not be present for more than 5 years. The four th exception related to ce rtain EPs and did not, by definition, involve time limited circumstances . Nevertheless, we noted that the 5 -year limitation is statutory and cannot be altere d by regulations, and that barriers to achieving meaningful use should be minimized over time. Comment : Some commenters suggested that the exception be gr anted for an all 5 years 438 rather than an annual determination to redu ce the burden on EPs seeki ng the exception and the burden on CMS to process the exceptions. Response : Section 1848(a)(7)(B) of the Act makes the hardship exception subject to annual renewal. Therefore, we would not grant an exception for more than 1 year unless we are certain that the circumstances that qualify an EP for an exception will not change for 5 years. The only such definitive case is for new EPs, and we grant a 2-year exception for such new EPs, because the date when an individual becomes an EP is a fixed point in time and not subject to change. However, all other exceptions discus sed in the proposed rule depend on variable circumstances and could change from year to ye ar. For example, although the exception we are finalizing for certain EPs (see \u00a7495.102(d)(4)(iv)) c ould depend on scope of practice, which may be relatively fixed, it also depends on the abilit y to control the availabi lity of CEHRT, which could easily change from year to year. Therefore, for these ca ses, we are not adopting this recommendation, and are finalizing a requirement for annual renewal. As mentioned previously, we proposed three specific exceptions and a potential fourth in the proposed rule. First, we proposed that th e Secretary may grant an exception to EPs who practice in areas without sufficien t Internet access. We noted th at section 1848(a )(7)(B) of the Act specifically allows the Secretary to establish a significant hardship \"in the case of an eligible professional who practices in a rural area without suffi cient Internet access.\" However, our proposal recognized that a nonrural area may al so lack sufficient Internet access to make complying with the requirements for being a mean ingful EHR user a significant hardship for an EP. We noted that exceptions on the basis of insufficient Internet connectivity must intrinsically be considered on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, we proposed to require that EPs 439 must demonstrate insufficient In ternet connectivity to qualify for the exception through an application process. As we disc ussed in the proposed rule, the ra tionale for this exception is that lack of sufficient Internet connectivity rende rs compliance with the meaningful EHR use requirements a hardship, particularly for mee ting those meaningful us e objectives requiring Internet connectivity, such as, summary of care documents, electronic prescribing, making health information available online, and submission of public health information. Therefore, we proposed that the application must demonstrate in sufficient Internet connectivity to comply with the meaningful use objectives and that there are insurmountable barrie rs to obtaining such infrastructure, such as a high cost of extending the Internet infrastr ucture to their facility. We also proposed that an EP must establish the exis tence of the hardship wa s for the year that is 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year . Therefore, we propos ed to require that applications be submitted no later than July 1 of the calendar year before the payment adjustment year in order to provide sufficient time for a determination to be made and for the EP to be notified about whether an exception has been grante d prior to the payment adjustment year. This proposed timeline for submission and considerati on of hardship applications was intended to allow sufficient time to adjust our payment syst ems so that payment adjustments are not applied to EPs who have received an exception for a specific payment adjustment year. In our proposed rule, we also encouraged EPs to apply for the exception as soon as possible, which is after the first 90 days (the earliest EHR reporting pe riod) of CY 2013. If applications are submitted close to or on the latest date possibl e (that is, July 1, 2014 for the 2015 payment adjustment year), then the applications could not be processe d in sufficient time to conduct an EHR reporting period in CY 2014 in th e event that the application is denied. Comment : Commenters stated universal s upport for this exception. However, 440 commenters expressed the concer n about the situation of an EP who might have sufficient internet access in the 2 year s prior, but lose it in 2014. Response : We are finalizing our proposed signifi cant hardship exception for insufficient Internet connectivity with one modification. We be lieve that it is extremely unlikely that an EP would lose sufficient internet access at one locati on. However, an EP may relocate to a location without sufficient Intern et access. Therefore, we are finalizing our proposal with the modification to allow for the demonstration of insufficient internet access for any 90-day continuous period between the start of the year 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year and through the application submission da te of July 1 of the year pr ior to the payment adjustment year. The 90-day period should be within this timeframe (for example, for payment adjustment year 2015, the hardship would need to be shown for any continuous 90-day period that begins on or after January 1, 2013 and ends on or before July 1, 2014. Second, we proposed to provide an excepti on for new EPs for a limited period of time after the EP has begun practicing. Newly practici ng EPs will not be able to demonstrate that they are meaningful EHR users for a reporti ng period that occurs prior to the payment adjustment year. Therefore, we proposed that fo r 2 years after they begi n practicing, EPs could receive an exception from the payment adjustme nts that will otherwis e apply in CY 2015 and thereafter. We also proposed that, for purposes of this excepti on, an EP who switches specialties and begins practicing under a new specialty wi ll not be considered newly practicing. For example, an EP who begins practicing in CY 2015 will receive an exception from the payment adjustments in CYs 2015 and 2016. However, as di scussed previously, the new EP will still be required to demonstrate meaningful use in CY 2016 in order to avoid being subject to the payment adjustment in CY 2017. In the absence of demonstrating meaningful use in CY 2016, 441 an EP who had begun practicing in CY 2015 will be subject to the payment adjustment in CY 2017. We proposed to employ an application process for granting this exception, and will provide additional information on the timeline and form of the application in guidance subsequent to the publication of the final rule. Comment : Commenters stated universal support for this exception in public comments, and we are finalizing this excep tion as proposed for the reasons outlined in the proposed rule. Third, we proposed an additional exception in this final rule for extreme circumstances that make it impossible for an EP to demonstr ate meaningful use requirements through no fault of her own during the reporting period. Such circumstances might in clude: a practice being closed down; a hospital closed; a natural disaster in which an EHR system is destroyed; EHR vendor going out of business; and similar circumstances. Because exceptions on extreme, uncontrollable circumstances must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, we proposed to require EPs to qualify for the exception through an application process. Comment : Many commenters supported this ex ception. However a number of the supporters requested that various circumstances be added to the list of example circumstances that we provided. These examples dealt primarily with concerns related to vendors of CEHRT. Specifically, commenters were concerned abou t vendors of CEHRT not maintaining their certification status, ability to meet implementation schedules, and ability to find a vendor of CEHRT willing to work with them. In addition, commenters suggested that the provider facing severe financial distress, such as bankruptcy or restructuring of debt s hould be included as an example. Response : In evaluating these circumstances, we considered whether first and foremost they met the criteria of making it impossible for the EP to demons trate meaningful use 442 requirements through no fault of his or her own during the EHR reporting period. Second, we considered whether they establish a definitive circ umstance that would always rise to the level of the exception or whether they would be dependent on the individual scenario. We are including two examples submitted by commenters in the preamble of the final rule that match the former criteria. First, we would consider the case an EP whose CEHRT loses its certification either through revocation or because the vendor di d not upgrade their CEHRT to the latest requirements as an extreme circumstance that might qualify for this exception. Second, we would consider the case of an EP suffering severe financial dist ress resulting in a bankruptcy or restructuring of debt as an extreme circum stance that might qualify for this exception. We require applications to be submitted no later than July 1 of the calendar year before the payment adjustment year in order to provide sufficient time for a determination to be made and for the EP to be notified about whether an exception has been granted prior to the payment adjustment year. This timeline for submission a nd consideration of hardship applications also allows for sufficient time to adjust our payment systems so that payment adjustments are not applied to EPs who have received an excepti on for a specific payment adjustment year. The purpose of this exception is to accomm odate EPs who would have otherwise been able to become a meaningful EHR user and avoid the payment adjustment for a given year in the absence of the extreme circumstances they face. Therefore, it is necessary to establish whether the relevant circumstances exis t during the EHR reporting period for a given payment adjustment year rather than the payment adjustment year itself. In the proposed rule, we explained the inherently case-by-case nature of this exception request. While we discussed circumstances that arise in \"either of the 2 calenda r years before the payment adjustment year,\" our intent was to ensure that the regulations recognized the two different EHR reporting periods for new 443 meaningful users (that is, those demonstrating meaningful use for the first time in the year immediately prior to the payment adjustment yea r), versus current meaningful users (that is, those demonstrating meaningful use in the calend ar year that is two years before the payment adjustment year). Obviously, a \"current\" meani ngful user, who is requi red under our regulations to demonstrate meaningful use in the calendar year two years before the payment adjustment year, may not receive an exception for circumst ances that occur after that reporting period. While a new meaningful user might be able to demonstrate that extreme circumstances that occurred prior to the reporting period conti nue to warrant an exce ption, we believe the case-by-case nature of the exception requests w ould allow such \"new\" m eaningful users this opportunity to demonstrate that a significant ha rdship continues to exist during the reporting period. Therefore, in this fina l rule, we are clarifying our regu lation to distinguish between new and current meaningful users, to be clear that the extreme circumstances must exist during the period in which the provider would otherwise be required to demonstrate meaningful use. EPs should apply for this exception on the basis of circ umstances arising in th e CY 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year, or, in the case of EP s who have never attested to meaningful use, the year immediately prior to the payment adjustment year. Finally, we solicited comment on the appropr iateness of granting a fourth exception for EPs meeting certain specific general criteria that might render demonstration of meaningful use very difficult. The criteria that we discussed were-- Lack of face-to-face or telemedicine interaction with patients, thereby making compliance with meaningful use criteria more diffi cult. Meaningful use requires that a provider collect a considerable amount of information about the patient and is able transport information online (to a PHR, to another provider, or to a pa tient) and is significantly easier if the provider 444 has direct contact with the patient and a need for follow up care or contact. Certain physicians often do not have a consultative interaction with the patient. For example, pathologist and radiologists seldom have direct c onsultations with patients. Rath er, they typically submit reports to other physicians who review th e results with their patients; Lack of follow up with patients. Again, the meaningful use requi rements for collecting information about the patient and transporting information online are significantly easier to meet if a provider has direct contact with a patient and a need to follow-up with the patient; and Lack of control over th e availability of CEHRT at their practice locations. In our proposed rule, we stated that we did not believe any one of these barriers taken independently would constitute an insurmountable hardship; however, our experience with Stage 1 of meaningful use suggests th at, taken together, they may po se a substantial obstacle to achieving meaningful use. Therefore, we discus sed several options in the proposed rule. One option was to provide a time-lim ited, 2-year payment adjustment exception for all EPs who meet the previous criteria. This approa ch would allow us to reconsider this issue in future rulemaking. Another option was to provide such an exception w ith no specific time limit. However, we noted that even under this less restrictive option, by statute no i ndividual EP can receive an exception for more than 5 years. As discussed earlier, we believe the proliferation of both CEHRT and health information exchange will reduce the ba rriers faced by specialties with less CEHRT adoption over time as other providers may be provi ding the necessary data fo r these specialties to meet meaningful use. We particularly re quested comment on how soon EPs who meet the previous criteria will reasonably be ab le to achieve meaningful use. In the proposed rule, we encouraged comment on whether these criteria, or additional criteria not accounted for in the meaningful use exclusions, constitute a significant hardship to 445 meeting meaningful use. We indicated that we that we would consider whether to adopt an exception based on these or similar criteria in the final rule, and, if so, whether such an exception should apply to individual EPs or across-the-boa rd based on specialty or other groupings that generally meet the a ppropriate criteria. Comment : Numerous commenters expressed su pport for including this exception. Some commenters agreed with CMS' assertion that all three barriers must be in place for this to be considered a significant hardship, while others maintained that any one of these barriers constitutes a significant hardship. Commenters from specific groups also presented arguments that they face one or more (up to all three) of the barriers presented in a sufficiently uniform way to have the exception apply acr oss the board to their group. Response : After reviewing the comments on this issue, we believe that the hardships presented are significant. Some EPs in the specialties that fa ce all three barriers have already successfully attested to meaningf ul use. Thus, even when all three barriers are present, meaningful use may be difficult, but not impossible to achieve. In establishing the criteria for meaningful use itself, we have adopted exclusions and constructed the meas ures to lower the first two barriers as much as possible. For example, EPs with no office visits (that is, without direct patient contact) do not have to provide visit su mmaries, nor do they have to provider patient reminders. Due to both the allowanc es built into the meaningful use criteria and the fact at least a few EPs in nearly all specialties have attested to meaningful us e, we do not believe that each barrier stands alone as a signifi cant hardship. However, in co nsidering the ha rdships and how they would be overcome there are significant diffe rences between the first two and the latter (lack of control of CEHRT). Lack of face- to-face and need for follow up are both overcome through robust health information exchange. However, we do not believe that the existing 446 availability health information exchange is suffi cient to overcome these hardships. Therefore, we are finalizing an exception for those EPs who lack both face-to-face inte ractions with patients and those who lack the need to follow up with patie nts. An EP may apply for this exception only on the grounds that they meet both of these criter ia (lack of face-to-face interactions and lack the to follow up with patients). We consider lack of face-to-face and need for follow-up care to be situations where the EP has no or nearly no f ace-to-face patient intera ctions or need for follow-up care. The EP would need to demons trate either a complete lack of face-to-face interactions and follow-up or that cases of f ace-to-face interaction and follow-up are extremely rare and not part of normal scope of practice for that EP. In reviewing the arguments presented for a group determination as well as considering common knowledge about the scope of practice of various specialties, we agree with commenters that the specialties of anesthesio logy, radiology, and pathology lack face-to-face interactions and need to follow up with patients with sufficient frequency to warrant granting an exception to each EP with one of these primary specialties. We note th at anesthesiologists do interact with patients, but not in a manner that is conducive to collecting the information needed for many aspects of meaningful use. As discu ssed previously, this ex emption is subject to annual renewal. In future rulemaking we will consider whether the proliferation of health information exchange or any other developments are sufficient to remove lack of face-to-face interaction as a barrier, and whet her the proliferation of CEHRT is sufficient to remove lack of control over the availability of CEHRT as a barrie r. We will consider these issues in relation both to the exception itself and its application to the specialties of anesthesiology, radiology, and pathology. As such, physicians in these three specialties should not expect that this exception will continue indefinitely, nor should they expect that we will grant the exception for the full 5- 447 year period permitted by statute. We will consider the extent to which these specialties continue to face these barriers in the Stage 3 rule and in other future rulemaking. We will also work to develop strategies to assist physicians who lack face-to-face interactions and the need to follow up with patients in demonstrating meaningful us e. We may develop su ch strategies in the context of future rulemaking (for example, the St age 3 rule) or in the fo rm of additional guidance to physicians in these sp ecialties. We also encourage all an esthesiologists, radiologists, and pathologists to continue to build out their ability to participate in health information exchange, adopt CEHRT and apply for the Medicare or Me dicaid EHR incentives. Those seeking the Medicare EHR incentives can start through 2014, while those seeking the Medicaid EHR incentives can start through 2016. As hospital-based anesthesiologists, radiologis ts, and pathologists are not eligible for the incentive and are thus exempted from the paymen t adjustment, the excep tion discussed in this section relates to these specia lists in nonhospital settings. With regard to the third ba rrier (lack of control over th e availability of CEHRT at practice locations), we believe that in cases where an EP practices at multiple locations just this one barrier could be sufficient to constitute a si gnificant hardship. In such cases, the EP would have to truly have no control over the availabi lity of CEHRT. Cont rol does not imply final decision-making authority. For example, we woul d generally view EPs pr acticing in a large, corporate, group as having control over the avai lability of CEHRT, because they can influence the group's purchase of CEHRT, they may reassi gn their claims to the group, they may have a partnership/ownership stake in the group, or any payment adjust ment would affect the group's earnings, and the entire impact would not be borne by the individual EP. These EPs can influence the availability of CEHRT and the group's earnings are directly affected by the 448 payment adjustment. Thus, such EPs would not, as a general rule, be view ed as lacking control over the availability of CEHRT a nd would not be eligible for the hardship exception based solely on their membership in a group prac tice that has not adopted CEHRT. On the other hand, there are EPs who practice at multiple locations who truly have little to no control over whether CEHRT is available at their locations. These might include, surgeons using ambulatory surgery centers or physicians tr eating patients in a nursing home. In these cases, the surgeon or physician lik ely would bear the entire impact of any payment adjustment - and such adjustment would not affect the earnin gs of the ambulatory surgery center or nursing home. In addition, because the su rgeon or physician merely sees pa tients at the center or home, and does not have any other interest in the faci lity, we believe they would exert little to no influence over whether the nursing home, center, or other similar outpa tient site adopts and implements CEHRT. We note that we already have in place an elig ibility requirement that allows for an EP to still qualify as a meaningful EHR user even if up to 49.9 percent of the EP's outpatient encounters are in locations that lack CEHRT. Thus, our excepti on would apply only in the case of EPs practicing in multiple locations where the l ack of control (as discussed previously) exists for a majority (50 percent or mo re) of their outpatient encounters at such locations, causing such EPs to not be eligible to become meaningful EHR users. (In addi tion, we wish to make clear that we will not grant the exception to EPs that lack control in their practice locations but where those locations have adopted CEHRT woul d mean that the EP could become a meaningful EHR user.) For the reasons discussed earlier, we have a dopted a final regulation that allows an EP practicing at multiple locations to demonstrate that the EP was truly unable to control the availability of CEHRT at either one or a combin ation of locations that constitute more than 50 449 percent of their outpatient enc ounters. Inpatient hospital and emergency department encounters would not be included in either the numerato r or the denominator for purposes determining whether the 50 percent threshold is met. This approach is cons istent with the categories of encounters that are considered to be outpatient for purposes of de termining hospital based status. (As noted previously, the locations cited by the EP for purposes of qualifying for this exception could not have CEHRT available - otherwise, we would view the EP as being potentially able to demonstrate meaningful use.) After considering the public comments, we are finalizing an exception by adding a new \u00a7495.102(d)(4)(iv) to the regulations. EPs whose primary specialty is listed in PECOS as anesthesiology, radiology or path ology 6 months prior to the fi rst day of the year in which payment adjustments that would otherwise appl y will be deemed to qualify for this exception, subject to the 5-year limit that applie s to all exceptions under this paragraph. Comment : Many commenters requested that these and other commenter proposed exceptions apply to other programs besi des the Medicare EHR incentive program. Response : This final rulemaking focuses on th e EHR Incentive program, and we did not propose to make changes to other programs. We encourage interest ed parties to submit comments on proposed rules (if any) for those other programs. Comment : Commenters suggested the following additional exceptions: All EPs over 60 or eligible for Social Secu rity and for all practices with 5 or fewer physicians. EPs who make a good faith effort, but fa il to reach the thres holds thereby making a distinction between those who make an effo rt and those who do not attempt to become meaningful EHR user. 450 EP is not practicing for a significant period of time during the reporting period. EP working in a practice without CEHRT changes to a new to a practice that has CEHRT during the reporting period. Response : We address each of these in turn. We agree that there is evidence that older EPs and those in smaller practices have been slower to adopt CEHRT6 7. The HITECH Act even acknowledged the problems for smaller practices by creating assistance programs for EPs in individual or small practices in Title XIII, se ction 3012(c)(4) of the Act. However, based on attestation information submitted to us, EPs in both groups are successfully meeting meaningful use in significant numbers. Therefore, we do not be lieve that either an EP's age or practice size constitutes a significant hardship. In addition, we believe it woul d be problematic to exempt a category of EPs based on age or si ze of practice given th at the intent of the payment adjustments and incentives is to ensure wide spread modernization to electroni c health records. We do not believe that these elements, in themselves, demonstrate that the EP experiences a \"significant hardship\" in becoming a meaningful EHR user. The next exception suggested by commenters is for EPs who attempt to become a meaningful EHR user, but fail to do so. Because we have already adopted an exception for EPs who face circumstances beyond their control, the a pplication of this sugge sted exception would necessarily be limited to EPs who face normal diffi culties, rather than significant hardship, in becoming meaningful EHR users. Again, the st atute requires demonstrat ion of a significant hardship as the basis for an exception, and we do not believe that a good faith attempt, in and of itself, demonstrates the existen ce of a significant hardship exis ts sufficient to prevent the EP 6 Chun-Ju Hsiao, Sandra L. Decker, Esther Hing and Jane E. Sisk Most Physicians Were Eligible For Federal Incentives In 2011, But Few Had EHR Systems That Met Meaningful Use Criteria, Health Affairs ,31 , No. 5 (2012) 7 Sandra L.Decker, Eric W. Jamoom and Jane E. Sisk Physicians In Nonprimary Care And Small Practices And Those Age 55 And Older Lag In Adopting Electronic Health Records Systems Health Affairs , 31, No. 5 (2012) 451 from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Furtherm ore, Congress set the benchmark for receiving full payment, without being subj ect to payment adjustment, on th e achievement of meaningful use rather than on the attempt to achieve meaningf ul use. Therefore, we do not believe that EPs who attempt, but fail, to meet meaningful use and do not qualify for one of our other exceptions should be granted a signifi cant hardship exception We also do not believe that it is appropr iate to establish an exception for EPs not practicing for significant time pe riods during the EHR reporting period. First, we already proposed (and are finalizing) an exception for newly practicing EPs. Second, EPs who are not newly practicing, but only practi ce for part of the EH R reporting period should be able to report in the numerator and denominators simply the nu mbers that pertain to the time during which they are practicing. For example, a measure based on nu mber of patients seen or actions taken would include only those patients/actio ns during the time the EP is pr acticing during the applicable reporting period. We recognize that some mean ingful use measures, such as drug-drug and drug-allergy interaction checks, re quire a functionality to be enab led for the entire EHR reporting period. In this case, the EP would have the functi onality enabled for the period s/he is practicing. The final exception suggested by commenters is for an EP work ing in a practice without CEHRT who changes to a new practice with CE HRT. Again, the commenters did not explain why such a circumstance, by itself, supports a sign ificant hardship that prevents the EP from becoming a meaningful EHR user. Moreover, if the EP has never demonstrated meaningful use he or she should have an initial 90-day repor ting period that allows the EP to demonstrate meaningful use in a shorter period. In addition, u nder current guidance, if the EP has more than 50 percent of their outpatient encounters at th e new practice equipped with CEHRT then they would be able to exclude the old practice from their meaningful use measures. 452 After considering the public comments, we are not finalizing these exceptions recommended by the commenters. The following ta ble summarizes the timeline for EPs to avoid the applicable payment adjustment by demonstr ating meaningful use or qualifying for an exception from the application of the payment adjustment: TABLE 13: TIMELINE FOR ELIGIBLE PROFESSIONALS (OTHER THAN HOSPITAL-BASED) TO AVOID PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT EP Payment Adjustment Year (Calendar Year) Demonstrate MU during EHR Reporting Period 2 Years Prior to Year of Payment Adjustment OR For an EP Demonstrating Meaningful Use for the First Time in the Year Prior to the Payment Adjustment Year, EHR Reporting Period is a Continuous 90-day Reporting Period Beginning No Later Than: OR Apply or Otherwise Qualify for an Exception No Later Than: 2015 CY 2013 (with submission no later than February 28, 201) July 3, 2014 (with submission no later than October 1, 2014) July 1, 2014 2016 CY 2014 (with submission no later than February 28, 2015) July 3, 2015 (with submission no later than October 1, 2015) July 1, 2015 2017 CY 2015 (with submission no later than February 29, 2016) July 3, 2016 (with submission no later than October 1, 2016) July 1, 2016 2018 CY 2016 (with submission no later than February 28, 2017) July 3, 2017 (with submission no later than October 1, 2017) July 1, 2017 2019 CY 2017 with submission no later than February 28, 2018) July 3, 2018 (with submission no later than October 1, 2018) July 1, 2018 Notes: (CY refers to the calendar year , January 1 through December 31 each year.) The timelines for CY 2020 and s ubsequent calendar years will follow the same pattern. TABLE 14: PERIOD HARDSHIP MUST BE SHOWN WITH APPLICATION DATE Exception Period of Consideration for Exception Application For CY2015 Submitted No Later Than Insufficient internet access Demonstrate insu fficient internet access for any continuous 90-day period from the start of the CY 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year to July 1 of the year prior to the payment adjustment year (For CY 2015 - January 1, 2013 - July 1, 2014) July 1, 2014 New EP New EP granted an exception for the year they become an EP and the following year (For CY 2015, the EP would have to be new in either CY 2014 or CY 2015) Guidance to be issued following publication of the final rule 453 Exception Period of Consideration for Exception Application For CY2015 Submitted No Later Than Extreme Circumstances outside of the EP's Control For an EP who has previously demonstrated meaningful use, the EP must demonstrate extrem e circumstances that affect either of the CYs in the 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year.

For all EPs, if they are regist ered in PECOS with a primary specialty of anesthesiology, pathology or radiology 6 months prior to first day of the payment adjustment year they meet the exception. (For CY2015 - July 1, 2014) For applications only: July 1, 2014 d. HPSA Bonus Technical Change In this final rule we are also making a technical change to our regulations to correctly reflect our policy on EPs who predominantly furnish services in a geographic HPSA. This change is necessary to reflect the current policy that the 50 percent determination is based on the covered professional services provided during the paym ent year, in accordance with the preamble discussion in the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44444 through 44445). The current regulation erroneously uses the phrase \"the year prior to the payment year,\" which conflicts with our preamble discussion in both the proposed (75 FR 1908 through 1909) and final Stage 1 rules. We note that we are not changing the policy (a lready adopted) that the HPSA must be so designated by December 31 of the year prior to the payment year. e. Payment Adjustment Not Applicable To Hospital-Based EPs Section 1848(a)(7)(D) of the Act provides that no EHR payment adjustments otherwise applicable for CY 2015 and subsequent years \"may be made... in the case of a hospital-based eligible professional (as defined in subsection (o)(1)(C )(ii)) of the Act.\" We proposed that the 454 same definition of hospital-based should appl y during the incentive a nd payment adjustment phases of the Medicare EHR incentive program (tha t is, those eligible to receive incentives will also be subject to adjustments). Therefore, we proposed that our regulations at \u00a7495.100 and \u00a7495.102(d) would retain, during the payment adju stment phase of the EHR Incentive Program, the definition of hospital-based eligible professional at \u00a7495.4. For purposes of the Medicare EHR incentive payment program, the determination of whether an EP is hospital-based is made on the basis of data from \"the Federal FY prior to the payment year.\" In the preamble to the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44442), we also stated that \"in order to provide information regarding the hospital-based status of each EP at the begi nning of each payment year, we will need to use claims data from an earlier period. Therefore, we will use claims data from the prior fiscal year (October through September). Under this approac h, the hospital-based status of each EP will be reassessed each year, using claims data from th e fiscal year preceding the payment year. The hospital-based status will be available for viewin g beginning in January of each payment year.\" We proposed to retain the c oncept established in the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 44442) of making hospital-based determinations based upon a pr ior fiscal year of data. However, in the proposed rule we expressed concerned about ensu ring that EPs are aware of their hospital-based status in time to purchase EHR technology and meaningfully use it during the EHR reporting period that applies to a payment adjustment year . EPs who believe that they are not hospital based will have already either worked toward s becoming meaningful EHR users or planned for the payment adjustment. EPs who believe that they will be determined hospital based may not have done so. EPs in these circumstances will n eed to know they are not hospital based in time to become a meaningful EHR user for a 90-day EHR reporting period in the year prior to the payment adjustment year. To use the exampl e of the CY 2015 payment adjustment year, a 455 determination based on FY 2013 data will allow an EP to know whether he or she is hospital-based by January 1, 2014. This timeline w ould give the EP approximately 6 months to begin the EHR reporting period, which could last from July through September of 2014. We stated in the proposed rule that we did not believe this to be sufficient time for the EP to implement CEHRT. Therefore, we proposed to base the hospital base d determination for a payment adjustment year on determinations made 2 years prior. Again using CY 2015 payment adjustment year as an example, the determin ation would be available on January 1, 2013 based on FY 2012 data. This proposed determination da te will give the EP up to 18 months to implement CEHRT and begin the EHR repor ting period to avoid the CY 2015 payment adjustment. In the proposed rule, we asserted that this a reasonable time frame to accommodate a difficult situation for some EPs. However, we also are aware that there may be EPs who are determined nonhospital-based under this \"2-years prior\" policy when they will be determined hospital-based if we made the determination just 1-year prior. Again, us ing the example of the CY 2015 payment adjustment year, an EP dete rmined nonhospital-based as of January 1, 2013 (using FY 2012 data) may be found to be hospita l-based as of January 1, 2014 (using FY 2013 data). In this situation, we st ated in the proposed rule that we did not believe the EP should be penalized for having been nonhospital based as of January 1, 2013, especially if the EP has never demonstrated meaningful use, a nd the EP's first EHR reporting period will have fallen within CY 2014. Therefore, in the proposed rule we reque sted comments on expanding the hospital-based determination to encompass determinations made eith er 1or 2 years prior. Under this alternative, if the EP were determined hospital based as of ei ther one of those dates, then the EP would be exempt from the payment adjust ments in the corresponding paym ent adjustment year. This would mean that for the CY 2015 payment adjustme nt year, an EP determined hospital based as 456 of either January 1, 2013 (using FY 2012 data) or January 1, 2014 (using FY 2013 data) would not be subject to the payment adjustment. In a ll cases, we would need to know that the EP is considered hospital based in sufficient time for the payment adjustment year. Comment : Commenters provided only genera l supportive comments on this proposal. Response : We thank the commenters for the su pport. For the reasons stated in the proposed rule, we are finalizing a rule that wi ll determine hospital base d using either of the following fiscal year's data: (1) th e fiscal year before the year that is 1 year prior to the payment adjustment year (for example, FY 2013 data for payment adjustment year 2015); or (2) the fiscal year before the year that is 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year (for example, FY 2012 data for payment adjustment year 2015). If the da ta from either year result in a hospital-based determination, then the EP would not be subjec t to the payment adjustments for the relevant year. We discuss one aspect of determini ng hospital-based status, specifically the circumstances of EPs who fund the acquisition, implementation, and maintenance of their own CEHRT in a hospital based setting, in section II.C.3. of the preamble to this final rule. 3. Incentive Market Basket Adjustment Effectiv e in FY 2015 and Subsequent Years for Eligible Hospitals that are not Meaningful EHR Users For an Applicable Reporting Period Section 1886(b)(3)(B )(ix)(I) of the Act, as ame nded by section 4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act, provides for an adjustment to the applicable percentage increase to the IPPS payment rate for those eligible hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users for the associated EHR reporting period for a payment year, be ginning in FY 2015. Specifically, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Act provi des that, \"for FY 2015 and each subsequent FY,\" an eligible hospital that is not \"a meaningful EHR user... for an EHR reporting period\" will receive a 457 reduced update to the IPPS standardized amount. This reduction will apply to \"three-quarters of the percentage increase otherwise applicable.\" The reduction to th ree-quarters of the applicable update for an eligible hospital that is not a meaningful EHR user will be \"33 1/3 percent for FY 2015, 66 2/3 percent for FY 2016, and 100 percent fo r FY 2017 and each subsequent FY.\" In other words, for eligible hospitals that are not me aningful EHR users, the Secretary is required to reduce the percentage increases ot herwise applicable by 25 percent (33 1/3 percent of 75 percent) in 2015, 50 (66 2/3 percent of 75 percent) per cent in FY 2016, and 75 percent (100 percent of 75 percent) in FY 2017 and subsequent years. Section 4102(b)(1)(B) of the HITECH Act also provides that such \"reduction sha ll apply only with resp ect to the FY involved and the Secretary shall not take into account such reduction in computing the applicable percentage increase ... for a subsequent FY.\" TABLE 15: PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN APPLICABLE HOSPITAL PERCENTAGE INCREASE FOR HOSPITALS THAT ARE NOT MEANINGFUL EHR USERS 2015 2016 2017+ Hospital payment update is subject to EHR payment reduction 25% 50% 75% Section 1886(b)(3)(B )(ix)(II) of the Act, as ame nded by section 4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act, provides that the Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis exempt a hospital from the application of the percentage increase adjustment for a fiscal year if the Secretary determines that requiring such hospital to be a meaningful EHR user will result in a significant hardship, such as in the case of a hospital in a rural area without sufficient Internet access. This section also provides that such determinations are subj ect to annual renewal, and that in no case may a hospital be granted such an exemp tion for more than 5 years. 458 Finally section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(III) of the Act, as amended by sect ion 4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act, provides that, for FY 2015 and each s ubsequent FY, a state in which hospitals are paid for services under section 1814(b)(3) of the Ac t shall adjust the paym ents to each eligible hospital in the state that is not a meaningful EHR user in a manner that is designed to result in an aggregate reduction in payments to hospitals in the state that is equivalent to the aggregate reduction that will have occurred if payments ha d been reduced to each eligible hospital in the state in a manner comparable to the reduction in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Act. This section also requires that the stat e shall report to the S ecretary the method it will use to make the required payment adjustment. (At present, secti on 1814(b)(3) of the Act applies to the state of Maryland.) As we discussed in the Stage 1 fi nal rule establishing the EHR incentive program (75 FR 44448), for purposes of determining whethe r hospitals are eligible for receiving EHR incentive payments, we employ the CMS Certificati on Number (CCN). We also proposed to use CCNs to identify hospitals for purposes of determ ining whether the reduction to the percentage increase otherwise applicable for FY 2015 and s ubsequent years applies. (In other words, whether a hospital was a meaningful EHR user for the applicable EHR reporting period will be dependent on the CCN for the hospital.). We noted the results of this policy for certain cases in which hospitals change ownership, merge, or otherwise reorganize and the applicable CCN changes. In cases where a singl e hospital changes ownership, we determine whether to retain the previous CCN or to assign a new CCN depending upon whether the new owner accepts assignment of the provider's prior participation agreement. Where a change of ownership has occurred, and a new CCN is assigned due to th e new owner's decision not to accept assignment of the prior provider agreement, we proposed not to recognize a meaningful use determination that was established under the prior CCN for purposes of determining whether the payment 459 adjustment applies. Where the new owner accepts the prior provider agreement and is assigned the same CCN, we proposed to continue to rec ognize the demonstration of meaningful use under that CCN. The same policy was proposed for merging hospitals that use a single CCN. For example, if hospital A is not a meaningful EHR user (for the a pplicable reporting period), and it absorbs hospital B, which was a meaningful EHR user , then the entire hospital will be subject to a payment adjustment if hospital A's CCN is the surviving identifier. The converse is true as well - if it were hospital B's CCN that survived, th e entire merged hospital will not be subject to a payment adjustment. (The guidelines for dete rmining CCN assignment in the case of merged hospitals are described in the State Operations Manual, sections 2779A ff. http://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/ Guidance/Manuals/Internet-Only-Manuals-IOM s-Items/CMS1201984.html ) We advised hospitals that are changing ownership, merging, or otherwise reorganizing to take this policy into account. Comments received on the treatment of CCNs and new hospitals are addressed in the context of discussing our exception for ne w hospitals later in this section. a. Applicable Market Basket Adjustment for Eligible Hospitals who are not Meaningful EHR Users for FY 2015 and Subsequent FYs In the stage 1 final rule on the Medicar e and Medicaid Electr onic Health Record Incentive Payment Programs, we revised \u00a7412.64 of the regulations to provide for an adjustment to the applicable percentage increase update to th e IPPS payment rate for those eligible hospitals that are not meaningful EHR users for the EH R reporting period for a payment year, beginning in FY 2015. Specifically, \u00a7412.64(d) (3) now provides that-- Beginning in fiscal year 2015, in the case of a \"subsectio n (d) hospital,\" as defined under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, that is no t a meaningful electronic health record (EHR) 460 user as defined in part 495, three-fourths of the applicable percentage change specified in paragraph (d)(1) is reduced-- ++ For fiscal year 2015, by 33 1/3 percent; ++ For fiscal year 2016, by 66 2/3 percent; and ++ For fiscal year 2017 and subseq uent fiscal years, by 100 percent. In order to conform with this new update reduction, as required in section 4102(b)(1)(A) of the HITECH Act, we also revised \u00a7412.64(d)(2 )(C) of our regulations to provide that, beginning with FY 2015, the reduction to the IPPS a pplicable percentage in crease for failure to submit data on quality measures to the Secret ary shall be one-quarter of the applicable percentage increase, rather th an the 2 percentage point re duction that applies for FYs 2007 through 2014 in \u00a7412.64(d)(2)(B). The effect of this revision is that the combined reductions to the applicable percentage increase for meaningful EHR use and quality data reporting will not produce an update of less than zero for a hospital in a given FY as long as the hospital applicable percentage increase remains a positive number. We did not propose any changes to the estab lishment of the payment adjustment amounts We did propose the applicable EHR reporting pe riod, for purposes of determining whether a hospital is subject to the applic able percentage increase adjustment for FY 2015 and subsequent FYs, as a prior EHR reporting period (as defi ned in \u00a7495.4 of the regulations). We also proposed an amendment to \u00a7412.64(d) to provide for the hardship and other exceptions we discuss later, as well as the application of th e applicable percentage increase adjustment in FY 2015 and subsequent FYs to a state operati ng under a payment waiver provided by section 1814(b)(3) of the Act. We discuss these proposal s and the comments relating to them in the following sections of this preamble. 461 b. EHR Reporting Period for Determining Whether a Hospital is Subject to the Market Basket Adjustment for FY 2015 and Subsequent FYs Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(IV) of the Act makes clear that the Secretary has discretion to \"specify\" as the EHR reporting peri od \"any period (or periods)\" that will apply \"with respect to a fiscal year.\" Thus, as in th e case of designating the EHR reporting period for purposes of the EP payment adjustment, the statute governing the ap plicable percentage in crease adjustment for hospitals that are not meaningf ul users of EHR technology neither requires that such reporting period fall within the year of the payment ad justment, nor precludes th e reporting period from falling within the year of the payment adjustment. As in the case of EPs, we sought to avoi d creating a situation in which it might be necessary to make large payment adjustments, either to lower or to increase payments to a hospital, after a determination is made about whether the applicable percentage increase adjustment should apply. We stat ed in the proposed rule that we believe that this consideration remains compelling in the case of hospitals, despite the fact that the IPPS for acute care hospitals provides, unlike the case of EPs, a mechanism to make appropriate changes to hospital payments for a payment year through the cost reporting pro cess. Despite the availability of the cost reporting process as a mechanism for correct ing over- and underpayments made during a payment year, we seek to avoid wherever possible circumstances under which it may be necessary to make large adjustme nts to the rate-based payments that hospitals receive under the IPPS. Since the EHR payment adjustment in FYs 2015 and subsequent years is an adjustment to the applicable percentage increase used in dete rmining prospective payments, we believe that it is far preferable to determine whether the adju stment applies on the basis of an EHR reporting period before the payment period, rather than to make the adjustment (where necessary) in a 462 settlement process after the payment period on th e basis of a determination concerning whether the hospital was a meaningful us er during the payment period. Therefore, we proposed, for purposes of de termining whether the relevant applicable percentage increase adjustment applies to hos pitals who are not meaningful users of EHR technology in FY 2015 and subsequent years, th at we would establish EHR reporting periods that begin and end prior to the year of the paym ent adjustment. Furthermore, we proposed that the EHR reporting periods for purposes of such determinations would be far enough in advance of the payment year that we have sufficient tim e to implement the system edits necessary to apply any required applicable per centage increase adjustment corre ctly, and that hospitals will know in advance of the payment year whether or not they are subject to the applicable percentage increase adjustment. Specifically, we proposed the following rules establishing the appropriate reporting periods for purposes of determining whether hospitals are subject to the applicable percentage increase adjustment in FY 2015 and subsequent years (parallel to the rules that we proposed previously for determining wh ether EPs are subject to the payment adjustments in CY 2015 and subsequent years): Except as provided in second bulleted para graph for eligible hospitals that become meaningful users for the first time in 2014, we proposed that the EHR reporting period for the FY 2015 applicable percentage in crease adjustment will be the same EHR reporting period that applies in order to receive the incentive for FY 2013. For hospitals this will generally be the full fiscal year of 2013 (unless FY 2013 is the first y ear of demonstrating meaningful use, in which case a 90-day EHR reporting period will apply). Under our proposed policy, a hospital that receives an incentive for FY 2013 would be exempt from the payment adjustment in FY 2015. A hospital that received an incentive for FYs 2011 or 2012 (or both), but that failed to demonstrate 463 meaningful use for FY 2013 will be subject to a payment adjust ment in FY 2015. (As all of these years will be for Stage 1 of meaningful use, we do not believe that it is necessary to create a special process to a ccommodate providers that miss the 2013 year for meaningful use). For each year subsequent to FY 2015, the EHR reporti ng period payment adjustment will continue to be the FY 2 years before the payment adjustme nt period, subject again to the special provision for new meaningful users of CEHRT. We proposed an exception for those hospitals that have never successfully attested to meaningful use prior to FY 2014. For these hospitals, as it is thei r first year of demonstrating meaningful use, we proposed to allow a continuous 90-day reporting period that begins in 2014 and that ends at least 3 months prior to the end of FY 2014. In addition, th e hospital would have to actually successfully register for and attest to meaningful use no later than the date that occurs 3 months before the end of the year. For hospitals , this means specifically that the latest day the hospital must successfully register for the incentiv e program and attest to meaningful use, and thereby avoid applicatio n of the adjustment in FY 2015, is July 1, 2014. Thus, the hospital's EHR reporting period must begin no later than April 2, 2014 (allowing the hospital a 90-day EHR reporting period, followed by 1 extra day to successfully submit the attestation and any other information necessary to earn an incentive pa yment). In the proposed rule we used the date April 3, 2014 which would only allow an 89-day period through June 30, 2014. The correct date is April 2, 2014 to allow September 30, 2014 to be the last day of the 90 day EHR reporting period with the extra day (Oct 1, 2014) to atte st. This policy would continue to apply in subsequent years. If a hospital is demonstrating meaningful use fo r the first time for the fiscal year immediately before the applicable percenta ge increase adjustment year, then the reporting period will be a continuous 90-day period that begins in such prior fiscal year and ends at least 464 3 months before the end of such year. In a ddition, all attestation, re gistration, and any other details necessary to determine whether the hospital is subject to a applicable percentage increase adjustment for the upcoming year will need to be completed by July 1. (As we discuss later, exception requests will be due by the April 1 befo re the beginning of the payment adjustment fiscal year.) In conjunction with adopting these rules for establishing the EHR Reporting Period for determining whether a hospital is subject to the applicable percentage increase adjustment for FY 2015 and subsequent FYs, we proposed to re vise \u00a7412.64(d)(3) of our re gulations to insert the phrase \"for the applicable EH R reporting period,\" so that it is clear that the EHR reporting period will not fall within the year of the market basket adjustment. We stated our belief that these propose d EHR reporting periods provide adequate time both for the systems changes that will be requir ed for CMS to apply any applicable percentage increase adjustments in FY 2015 and subsequent years, and for hospitals to be informed in advance of the payment year whether any adjustment(s) will apply. They also provide appropriate flexibility by allowing more r ecent adopters of EHR technology a reasonable opportunity to establish their meaningful use of the technology and to av oid application of the payment adjustments. Comment : As with the comments on the EHR reporting period for EPs, many commenters made the same assertion that an EHR reporting period aligned with the payment adjustment year would be more consistent with the Congressional intent a nd the language of the statute. Some commenters contended that the st atutory language requires the reporting period and payment adjustment year to coincide. Response : We believe our response to this comment in the context of the EP payment 465 adjustments applies equally to his eligible hospital comment. The language in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Act is substantially si milar to the language in section 1848(a)(7) of the Act. As in the case of EPs, Congress provid ed the Secretary with flex ibility to determine the EHR reporting period applicable to the payment adjustment year. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(IV) of the Act specifically provides th at \"term 'EHR reporting period' m eans, with respect to a fiscal year, any period (or periods) sp ecified by the Secretary.\" In addition, because the payment adjustment will be used to reduce the applicable percent increase that is used in the prospective ratesetting for hospitals, it is reasonable to concl ude that this Secretarial flexibility was granted precisely because Congress understo od that the Department needed to have final determinations on meaningful use prior to the fi scal year that is the payment adjustment year. As we have previously noted, other payment adjustment progr ams, such as the e-prescribing program, and the physician quality reporting syst em, also use a prior reporting pe riod. Thus, it is consistent for us to adopt a prior reporting period for the EHR program as well. Comment : Commenters made the same comment s as they did for EPs (relating to insufficient vendor capacity; the practical deadline having passe d for adopting and implementing CEHRT, especially for popular vendors; and the issu es surrounding upgrading current clients to 2014 CEHRT). As with EPs, the options presen ted by commenters all invo lved a reconciliation process, in this case, using the cost reporting process. Response : The issue of upgrading to 2014 CEHRT is addressed by ONC in their final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . We appreciate the concerns of vendor capacity raised by the commenters. We di scuss this situation and the reasons we are not revising our timetables in our prev ious discussion of the parallel policy for EPs. In the hospital context, the commenters correctly point out th e existence of a payment reconciliation method, 466 the hospital cost report, that it unavailable within the payment systems for EPs. We have carefully considered whether it is feasible to adopt a later reporting period (perhaps even the payment year itself) as the basis for determining whether eligible hospitals are subject to the EHR payment adjustment, and then to employ th e cost reporting process to correct over and under payments in regards to the payment ad justments, as a number of commenters recommended. As a matter of course in the rate setting system, the basi c rates and applicable percentage increase updates are fixed in advance and are not matters that are taken into account in the settlement of final paym ent amounts under the cost report r econciliation process. As the payment adjustment directly affects this rate we believe that it would not be possible to employ a cost report settlement process, but that claims would have to be reprocessed. It is true, as several commenters pointed out, that several components of the IPPS, including DSH and IME payments, are settled in th e cost reporting process on the basis of final data (for example, bed days, resident FTEs) from the payment year. However, changes in other aspects of the payment system, such as outlier payments, cannot reconciled within the cost reporting process, but require reprocessing of claims. App lication of the EHR payment adjustment changes the standardized amount upo n which IPPS payments are based. Any change in the standardized amount applicable to a hospital changes the number of outlier payments the hospital would receive, and the amount of thos e payments. If we were to base final determination of whether the EHR payment adju stment should apply on m eaningful use status during the payment year, it would be necessary to increase the standardized amount for some hospitals, that is, those that we re assumed not to meet meaningf ul use requirements for purposes of making interim payments, but that subseque ntly established mean ingful use during the payment year. Conversely, it would be necessary to decrease the standardized amount for those 467 hospitals that had been assume d to meet meaningful use requirements for purposes of making interim payments, but that subsequently failed to meet those requirements during the payment year. In both cases, mass reprocessing of payments would be necessary in order to adjust outlier payments. Generally, hospitals whose standardi zed amounts are decreased at the time of final payment determination (due to application of a payment adjustment that was not applied to interim payments) would generally receive gr eater outlier payments. Conversely, hospitals whose standardized amounts are increased at th e time of final payment determination (due to application of the full update that was not applied to interim pa yments) would generally receive lower outlier payments. (Reprocessing would also be necessary for new technology add-on payments, although the claims volume and dollar amounts involved in such reprocessing would be significantly lower.) Such reprocessing imposes significant costs on both the eligible hospital and CMS. As in the case of EPs, then, we cont inue to believe that the timeline we proposed is the most realistic approach to making payment adjustment determinations in an effective manner. Therefore, we are finalizing the proposed EHR reporting period for determining whether an eligible hospital is subject to the payment adjustment fo r CY 2015 and subsequent calendar years as proposed. c. Exception to the Application of the Market Basket Adjustme nt to Hospitals in FY 2015 and Subsequent FYs As mentioned previously, s ection 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(II) of th e Act, as amended by section 4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act, provides that th e Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis exempt a hospital from the application of the applicable pe rcentage increase adjustment for a fiscal year if the Secretary determines that requiring such hospital to be a meaningful EHR user will result 468 in a significant hardship , such as in the case of a hospital in a rural area without sufficient Internet access. This section also provides th at such determinations are subject to annual renewal, and that in no case may a hospital be gr anted such an exception for more than 5 years. We proposed to add a new \u00a7412.64(d)(4), sp ecifying the circumstances under which we will exempt a hospital from the application of the applicable percentage increase adjustment for a fiscal year. To be considered for an ex ception, a hospital must submit an application demonstrating that it meets one more of the exception criteria. As noted previously, the st atute does not mandate the circumstances under which an exception must be granted, but (a s in the case of a similar exce ption provided under the statute for EPs) it does state that the exception may be granted when \"requiring such hospital to be a meaningful EHR user during such fi scal year will result in a signi ficant hardship, such as in the case of a hospital in a ru ral area without sufficient Internet ac cess.\" Therefore, we proposed to provide in new \u00a7412.64(d)(4) that the Secretary may grant an ex ception to a hospital that is located in an area without sufficient Internet acce ss. Furthermore, while the statute specifically states that such an exception ma y be granted to hospitals in \"a rural area without sufficient Internet access,\" it does not require that such an exception be restricted only to rural areas without such access. While we believe that a lack of sufficient Internet a ccess will rarely be an issue in an urban or suburban area, we do not believe that it is n ecessary to preclude the possibility that, in very rare and exceptiona l cases, a nonrural area may also lack sufficient Internet access to make complying with meaningful use requirements a significant hardship for a hospital. Therefore, we proposed that the Secretary may grant su ch an exception to a hospital in any area without sufficient Internet access. Because exceptions on the basis of insufficien t Internet connectivity must intrinsically be 469 considered on a case-by-case basis, we proposed to require hospitals to demonstrate insufficient Internet connectivity to qualify fo r the exception through an applic ation process. The rationale for this exception is that lack of sufficient Internet connectiv ity renders compliance with the meaningful EHR use requirements a hardship pa rticularly those objectives requiring internet connectivity, summary of care documents, electr onic prescribing, making health information available online, and submission of public health information. Th erefore, we proposed that such an application must demonstrate insufficient Internet c onnectivity to comply with the meaningful use objectives listed previously and insurmount able barriers to obtaining such internet connectivity such as high cost to build out Internet to their facility. As with EPs, the hardship would be demonstrated for period that is 2-year s prior to the payment adjustment year (for example, FY 2013 for the payment adjustment in FY 2015). As with EPs, we will require applications to be submitted 6 months before the beginning of the payment adjustment year (that is, by April 1 before the FY to which the adjustme nt will apply) in order to provide sufficient time for a determination to be made and for the hospital to be notified about whether an exception has been granted. This timeline fo r submission and consideration of hardship applications also allows for sufficient time to adjust our payment systems so that payment adjustments are not applied to hospitals who ha ve received an excepti on for a specific FY. (Please also see our previous discussion of the para llel exception for EPs, with respect to encouraging providers to file thes e applications as early as possible, and th e likelihood that there will not be an opportunity to subsequently demonstr ate meaningful use if hospitals file close to or at the application deadline of April 1.) Comment : Commenters provided universal s upport for this proposed exception. However, some commenters raised concern about the s ituation of hospitals that might have 470 Internet access in the 2-years prior, but lose it in the next year. Response : We are finalizing this exception as proposed with one modification. We appreciate the commenters' concern about hospitals that might have sufficient internet access in the 2 years prior to the adjustment period, but lose it in next year. We believe this is even less likely for hospitals than EPs, but as there is no downside to extending the time, we are finalizing a modification of our proposal to allow for the demonstration of insufficient internet access for any 90-day period between the star t of the year 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year through the application submission da te of April 1 of the year pr ior to the payment adjustment year. For the same reasons we proposed an excepti on for new EPs, we proposed an exception for a new hospital for a limited period of time afte r it has begun services. We proposed to allow new hospitals an exception for at least 1 full year cost reporting period af ter they accept their first patient. For example, a hos pital that accepted its first patient in Ma rch of 2015, but with a cost reporting period from July 1 through June 30, would receive an exception from payment adjustment for FY 2015, as well as for FY 2016. However, the new hospital would be required to demonstrate meaningful use within the 9 months of FY 2016 (regi ster and attest by July 1, 2016) to avoid being subject to the payment adjustment in FY 2017. In proposing such an exception for new hospita ls, however, we wanted to ensure that the exception would not be available to hospitals that have already been in operation in one form or another, perhaps under a different owner or merely in a different location, and thus have in fact had an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology. Therefore, for purposes of qualifying for this exception, we proposed th at the following hospitals would not be considered new hospitals under the exception: 471 A hospital that builds new or replacement facilities at the same or another location even if coincidental with a change of ow nership, a change in management, or a lease arrangement. A hospital that closes and subsequently reopens. A hospital that has been in operation for mo re than 2 years but has participated in the Medicare program for less than 2 years. A hospital that changes its status from a CAH to a hospital that is subject to the Medicare hospital in patient prospective payment systems. It is important to note that we proposed to c onsider a hospital that ch anges its status from a hospital (other than a CAH) that is exclude d from the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) to a hospital that is subjec t to the IPPS to be a new hospital for purposes of qualifying for the proposed exception. These IPPS-exempt hospitals, such as long-term care hospitals, inpatient psychiatric f acilities, inpatient rehabilitati on facilities children's hospitals, and cancer hospitals, are excluded from the defini tion of \"eligible hospital\" for purposes of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program and have not n ecessarily had an opport unity to demonstrate meaningful use. On the other hand, CAHs are eligible for incentive payments and subject to payment adjustments. Under the guidelines fo r assigning CCNs to Medicare providers, a CAH that changes status to an IPPS hospital will necessarily receive a new CCN. This is because several digits of the CCN encode the provider' s status (for example, IPPS, CAH) under the Medicare program, However, we proposed to a llow the CAH to register its meaningful use designation obtained under its pr evious CCN in order to avoi d being subject the hospital payment adjustment. It is worth noting that we adapted the proposed definition of \"new hospital\" for these purposes from similar ru les that have been employed in the capital 472 prospective payment system in \u00a7412.300(b) of our regulations. We invited comment concerning the appropriateness of adapti ng these rules to the exception under the EHR program, and about whether modifications or other revisions to thes e rules will be appropriate in the EHR context. Comment : Several commenters recommended th at the new hospitals exception for at least 1 full year cost reporting period be triggered not when the hospital accepts its first patient, but rather when it accepts its first Medicare cove red patient. These commenters point out that there can be significant lapse between the time wh en a hospital accepts its first patient and the time when it accepts its first Medicare covered pa tient. Because the EHR payment adjustment applies to the Medicare payments, the commente rs argued it is more appropriate to base the beginning of the new hospital ex ception on the admission of its fi rst Medicare covered patient. Response : We agree with the commenters and ar e revising the new hospital exception in this final rule to run for at least one full year cost reporting period afte r the hospital accepts its first Medicare-covered patient. Th is change renders our third crit erion (a hospital that has been in operation for more than 2 years but has partic ipated in the Medicare program for less than 2 years) for not considering a hos pital new moot as the exception is now based on the admission of the first Medicare-covered pati ent, which we believe is su fficiently analogous to starting participation in the Medicare program to allow us to remove this criterion. Comment : Some commenters argued that a ho spital that undergoe s a change of ownership and has a new CCN assigned due to the new owner's decisi on not to accept the assignment of the prior provider agreement should be allowed to register its meaningful use designation for the old CCN in the same manner a CAH that becomes an inpatient PPS hospital would. Response : When a hospital has a new CCN assigne d due to the new owner's decision not 473 to accept the assignment of the prior provider ag reement it is not cons idered a change of ownership. Rather the hospital is terminated from the Medicare program and then reapplies for a new CCN. We disagree with the commenters th at the history of the old CCN should carry forward in this case. In cases where a new owner decides not to accept the previous provider agreement and a new CCN is assigned by CMS, th e new owner is in effect, making a conscious decision to create a rupture with significant, and relevant, aspects of the hospital's history. Specifically, when a new owner acquires a Medica re participating hospital, CMS automatically assigns the provider agreement to the new owner. The new owner must then decide whether to accept or reject assignment of the existing agreem ent. If the new owner accepts assignment, the provider agreement remains intact and the owner retains all the bene fits and liabilities of that agreement (as provided under 42 CFR 489.18 of the regulations). If the new owner rejects assignment, the owner has voluntarily terminated the previous provider agreement, the CCN of the hospital is terminated, and the owner is not responsible for Medicare liabilities (known or unknown), as well as eligibility for Medicare pa yment. Under these ci rcumstances, where the new owner has made a conscious decision to term inate the previous provider agreement, we believe it is appropriate not to recognize the meaningful use designati on obtained under that provider agreement and CCN. We ha ve consistently reminded new owners of hospitals that they cannot obtain the benefits of a decision not to accept assignment of the provider agreement without accepting the burde ns of the decision as well. Unlike the case of a CAH that becomes an inpatient PPS hospital, the assignment of a ne w CCN follows from a voluntary decision of the new owner not to retain the prev ious provider agreement and CCN. We believe a similar result should apply in other cases where acquisitions and/or combinations of hospitals lead to the discont inuation of a CCN under which meaningful use had 474 been demonstrated. For example, in some cases there is a combination of two or more certified hospitals under one agreement and one CCN. If the combined hospital has multiple locations, one location becomes the \"main location,\" and all other locations b ecome remote and/or provider based. The hospital is considered \" one hospital\" by Medicare and must be truly integrated at all levels, including its system fo r maintaining medical records. Where the new owner rejects the assignment of the provider agreement for one or more of the facilities that are being combined into the integrated hospital, known and unknown Medicare liabilities of those facilities do not transfer to th e new owner. Under these circumstances, for the same reasons discussed in the previous case, it is appropriate not to recogni ze the meaningful use designation that was obtained under the provid er agreement(s) and CCN(s) that have not been retained under the integrated hospital. Even where the new owners retain the acqui red hospital's Medicare provider agreement, the acquired hospital's agreement is subsumed (although not terminated) into the single provider agreement of the combined hospital, and the acquired hospital's CCN is retired (again, not terminated). The new owners are responsible for all known and unknown Medi care liabilities of previous owners of the hospital, and there is no break in Medicare payments, as is the case where assignment of the prior provider agreement is rej ected. However, as note d previously, in these cases, if the combined hospital has multiple loca tions, one location becomes the \"main location,\" and all other locations become remote and/or pr ovider based. The hospital is considered \"one hospital\" by Medicare and must be truly integrated at all levels). In these cases it is most appropriate to recognize the prior meaningful us e status of the surviving CCN of the main location for purposes of determini ng whether the payment penalty ap plies to the newly integrated hospital. In that way, the meaningful use determ ination will be based on the prior status of the 475 major portion of the newly integrated hospital. Otherwise, the meaningful use designation of a relatively minor remote and/or provider-based hospita l may become the basis for the designation of a much larger combined and integrated hospi tal. Therefore, we are finalizing our proposed policy, in cases of various owne rship changes, acquisitions, and combinations of hospitals, to employ the meaningful use status of the surv iving CCN to determine whether the payment adjustment applies. Finally, we proposed an additi onal exception in this final rule for extreme circumstances that make it impossible for a hospital to dem onstrate meaningful use requirements through no fault of its own during the reporting period. Su ch circumstances might include: a hospital closed; a natural disaster in which an EHR system is dest royed; EHR vendor going out of business; and similar circumstances. Because exceptions on extreme, uncontrollable circumstances must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, we believe that it is appropriate to require hospitals to qualify for the ex ception through an application process. Comment : Commenters stated universal suppo rt for this exception. However many commenters requested various circ umstances be added to the list of example circumstances. This list is very similar, but not entirely identical to that for EPs. These examples dealt primarily with concerns related to vendor s of CEHRT. Specifically, comm enters were concerned about vendors of CEHRT not maintaini ng their certification status, ab ility to meet implementation schedules, and ability to find a vendor of CEHRT willing to wo rk with them. In addition, commenters suggested that the pr ovider facing severe financial di stress, such as bankruptcy or restructuring of debt should be included as an example. Response : We used the same evaluation criteria we used for EPs and came to the same conclusion to add two examples to the list th at was proposed: (1) a hospital whose CEHRT 476 (complete or modular) loses its certification either through revoca tion or because the vendor did not upgrade their CEHRT to the la test requirements; and (2) a hos pital suffering severe financial distress resulting in a bankruptcy or restructuring of debt. We will require applications to be submitted no later than April 1 of the year before the payment adjustment year in order to provide suffi cient time for a determination to be made and for the hospital to be notified about whether an exception has been grante d prior to the payment adjustment year. This timeline for submission a nd consideration of hardship applications also allows for sufficient time to adjust our payment systems so that payment adjustments are not applied to hospitals who have re ceived an exception for a specific payment adjustment year. As discussed earlier, in relation to EPs, in order for a hospital to apply for this exception, extreme circumstances would need to exist for the pe riod in which the hospital would otherwise demonstrate meaningful use (that is, the EHR reporting period). We have modified our regulation to be clear that the circumstances mu st exist during the EHR reporting period (that is, 2 years prior to the payment adjustment year or , for hospitals that have never attested to meaningful use before, in the year immediatel y prior to the paymen t adjustment year). Comment : Commenters suggested the following additional exceptions: Hospitals who make a good faith effort to purchase CEHRT, but could not find a vendor willing to work with them. Hospitals that determine they must switc h EHR vendors to achieve meaningful use. Hospitals unable to meet meaningful use requirements because of failures on the part of EHR vendors. Response : For the first suggested exception, we do not believe that hosp itals that attempt to purchase CEHRT but cannot find a vendor would warrant an exception. The mere failure of 477 an attempt to purchase CEHRT does not demonstrat e that the hospital faces hardship significant enough to prevent it from becoming a meaningful EHR user. We also believe it would be problematic to define the parameters for determ ining that no vendor was willing to work with a hospital. Moreover, we already have provided for an exception for hospitals that face extreme circumstances beyond their control. Under this exception, eligible hospitals could attempt to show that their situation is extr eme and out of the ordinary and that failure to obtain CEHRT was truly beyond their control. We are skeptical that such showings could be made when all the hospital has done is to make an attempt to pur chase CEHRT. However, this exception provides hospitals with the opportunity to demonstrate that their failure of attempts to obtain CEHRT was due to circumstances beyond their control. The next two exceptions may fall under the ex ception for extreme circumstances beyond the hospital's control, but the hos pital would need to demonstrate that it meets this extreme exception. Any determination would be highly dependent on individu al circumstances and evaluation of whether it is truly necessary to switch vendors, whet her the switching vendors would prevent the hospital from reaching meaningful use, and whether the \"failures\" of the EHR vendor are both outside the norm of EHR implemen tation and beyond the control of the hospital. Table 16 summarizes the timeline for hospita ls to avoid the applicable payment adjustment by demonstrating meaningful use or qualifying for an exception from the application of the adjustment. 478 TABLE 16: TIMELINE FOR ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS TO AVOID PAYMENT ADJUSTMENT Hospital Payment Adjustment Year (Fiscal Year) Demonstrate MU during EHR Reporting Period 2 Years Prior to Year of Payment Adjustment OR For An Eligible Hospital Demonstrating Meaningful Use for the First Time in the Year Prior to the Payment Adjustment Year Use a Continuous 90-Day Reporting Period Beginning No Later Than: OR Apply For An Exception No Later Than: 2015 FY 2013 (with submission no later than November 30, 2013 ) April 2, 2014 (with submission no later than July 1, 2014) April 1, 2014 2016 FY 2014 (with submission no later than November 30, 2014) April 2, 2015 (with submission no later than July 1, 2015) April 1, 2015 2017 FY 2015 (with submission no later than November 30, 2015) April 2, 2016 (with submission no later than July 1, 2016) April 1, 2016 2018 FY 2016 (with submission no later than November 30, 2016) April 2, 2017 (with submission no later than July 1, 2017) April 1, 2017 2019 FY 2017 (with submission no later than November 30, 2017) April 2, 2018 (with submission no later than July 1, 2014) April 1, 2018 Notes: (FY refers to the Fede ral fiscal year: October 1 to September 30.

Application of Market Basket Adjustment in FY 2015 and Subsequent FYs to a State 479 Operating Under a Payment Waiver Provi ded by Section 1814( b)(3) of the Act As discussed previously, the statute requires payment adjustments for eligible hospitals in states where hospitals are paid under section 1814( b)(3) of the Act. The statute also requires such adjustments to be designed to result in an aggregate reduction in paym ents equivalent to the aggregate reduction that would have occurred if payments had been reduced under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Act. We proposed that an aggregate reduction in payments would mean the same dollar amount in reduced Medicare payments that that would have occurred if payments had been reduced to each eligible hosp ital in the state in a manner comparable to the reduction under \u00a7412.64(d)(3). To implement this provision, we proposed a new \u00a7412.64(d)(5) that includes this statutory requirement and that required states operating under a payment waiver under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act to provide to the Secretary, no later than January 1, 2013, a report on the method that it proposes to employ in order to make the requisite payment adjustment. We did not receive any comments on this propo sal; and therefore, we are finalizing these provisions as proposed. 4. Reduction of Reasonable Cost Reimbursement in FY 2015 and Subsequent Years for CAHs that are not Mean ingful EHR Users Section 4102(b)(2) of the HI TECH Act amends section 1814(l) of the Act to include an adjustment to a CAH's Medicare reimbursement fo r inpatient services if the CAH has not met the meaningful EHR user definition for an EHR reporti ng period. The adjustment will be made for a cost reporting period that begins in FY 2015, FY 2016, FY 2017, and each subsequent FY thereafter. Specifically, sections 1814(l)(4)(A) and (B) of the Act now provide that, if a CAH has not demonstrated meaningful use of CEHRT for an applicable repor ting period, then for a 480 cost reporting period that begins in FY 2015, its reimbursement will be reduced from 101 percent of its reasonable costs to 100.66 percent. For a cost reporting period beginning in FY 2016, its reimbursement will be reduced to 100.33 percent of its reasonable costs. For a cost reporting period beginning in FY 2017 and each subsequent FY, its reimbursement will be reduced to 100 percent of reasonable costs. However, as provided for eligible hospita ls, a CAH may, on a case-by-case basis, be granted an exception from this adjustment if CM S or its Medicare contractor determines, on an annual basis, that a significant hardship exists, such as in the case of a CAH in a rural area without sufficient Intern et access. However, in no case may a CAH be granted an exception under this provision for more than 5 years. a. Applicable Reduction of Reasonable Cost Payment Reduction in FY 2015 and Subsequent Years for CAHs that are not Meaningful EHR Users In the Stage1 final rule (75 FR 44564), we finalized the regulations regarding the CAH adjustment at \u00a7495.106(e) and \u00a7413.70(a)(6). b. EHR Reporting Period for Determining Wh ether a CAH is Subject to the Applicable Reduction of Reasonable Cost Payment in FY 2015 and Subsequent Years For CAHs we proposed an EHR reporting pe riod that is aligned with the payment adjustment year. For example, if a CAH is not a meaningful EHR user in FY 2015, then its Medicare reimbursement will be reduced to 100.6 6 percent for its cost reporting period that begins in FY 2015. This differs from what was proposed for eligible hospitals: an EHR reporting period prior to the payment adjustment y ear. We stated in the proposed rule that we believed the Medicare cost repo rt process would allow us to make the CAH reduction for the cost reporting period that begins in the payment adjustment y ear, with minimal disruptions to the 481 CAH's cash flow and minimal administrative bur den on the Medicare cont ractors as discussed later. CAHs are required to file an annual Medica re cost report that is typically for a consecutive 12-month period. The co st report reflects the inpatient statistical and financial data that forms the basis of the CAH's Medicare reim bursement. Interim Medicare payments may be made to the CAH during the cost reporting period based on the previous year's data. Cost reports are filed with the CAH's Medicare contractor af ter the close of the cost reporting period and the data on the cost report are subj ect to reconciliation and a settle ment process prior to a final Medicare payment being made. We proposed to amend the definition of the EHR reporting period that will apply for purposes of payment adjustments under \u00a7495.4. For CAHs this will be the full Federal fiscal year that is the same as the payment adjustment year (unless a CAH is in its first year of demonstrating meaningful use, in which case a continuous 90- day reporting period within the payment adjustment year will apply). The ad justment would then apply based upon the cost reporting period that begins in the payment adjust ment year (that is, FY 2015 and thereafter). Thus, if a CAH is not a meaningful user for FY 2015, and thereafter, then the adjustment would be applied to the CAH's reasonable costs incurred in a cost reporting period that begins in that affected FY as described in \u00a7413.70(a)(6)(i). We proposed to require CAHs to submit their attestations on meaningful use by November 30 th of the following FY. For example, if a CAH is attesting that it was a meaningful EHR user for FY 2015, the attestation must be submitted no later than November 30, 2015. Such an attestation (or lack thereof) will then a ffect interim payments to the CAH made after December 1st of the applicable FY. If the cost reporting period ends prior to December 1st of the 482 applicable FY then any applicable payment ad justment will be made through the cost report settlement process. All comments received on this provision were in support. We thank commenters for their support and finalize as proposed for the reasons outlined in the proposed rule. c. Exception to the Applicati on of Reasonable Cost Payment Reductions to CAHs in FY 2015 and Subsequent FYs As discussed previously, C AHs may receive exceptions from the payment adjustments for significant hardship. While our current regulations, in \u00a7413.70(a )(6)(ii) and (iii ) contain this hardship provision we proposed revising these re gulations to align them with the exceptions being proposed for EPs and subsection (d) hospitals . As with EPs and s ubsection (d) hospitals we proposed that CAHs could apply for an excepti on on the basis of lack of sufficient Internet connectivity. Applications will be required to demonstrate insuffi cient Internet connectivity to comply with the meaningful use objectives requir ing internet connectivit y (that is, summary of care documents, electronic prescribing, making health information av ailable online, and submission of public health information) and insu rmountable barriers to ob taining such internet connectivity. As CAHs will have an EHR reporti ng period aligned with the payment adjustment year, we proposed that the insufficient Internet connectivity will need to be demonstrated for each applicable payment adjustment year. For example, as proposed, to avoid a payment adjustment for cost reporting pe riods that begin during FY 2015, th e hardship would need to be demonstrated for FY 2015. For each year subs equent to FY 2015, the basis for an exception would continue to be for the hardship in the FY in which the affected cost reporting period begins. As stated in \u00a7413.70(a)(6)(iii), any ex ception granted may not exceed 5 years. After 5 years, the exception will expire and the approp riate adjustment will apply if the CAH has not 483 become a meaningful EHR user for th e appropriate EHR reporting period. Comment : Commenters have suggested that it is inappropriate to base the Internet connectivity exception on the same year that a CAH is expected to demonstrate meaningful use. They assert that it is impracti cal for a CAH to achieve sufficien t internet connectivity and meet meaningful use all in 1 year. A few comment ers recommended a 2-year prospective exception for Internet connectivity as used fo r the EPs and inpatient PPS hospitals. Response : We agree with commenters that esta blished sufficient Internet connectivity and meaningful use in the same year is not f easible. However, since the payment adjustment year is aligned with the CAH's EHR period, we believe that using a 2-year lookback period similar to EPs and eligible hospitals is inappropriate for CAHs. Therefore, we will base the insufficient internet access exception on the cost reporting period that begi ns prior to or during the payment adjustment year. For FY 2015,the CAH must submit the application by November 30, 2015, but eligibility for this exception would be based on the information for any 90-day period within the cost reporting period that begins prior to or during the payment adjustment year. After consideration of the comments, we ar e revising this exception to base it on any 90-day period within the cost reporting period that begins prior to or during the payment adjustment year. As with new EPs and new eligible hospita ls, we proposed an exception for a new CAH for a limited period of time after it has begun services. We proposed to allow an exception for 1 year after they accept their first patient. Fo r example, a CAH that is established in FY 2015 would be exempt from the penalty through its cost reporting period ending at least 1 year after the CAH accepts its first patient. If the CAH is established March 15, 2015 and its first cost 484 reporting period is less than 12 months (for ex ample, from March 15 through June 30, 2015), the exception would exist for both the short cost re porting period and the following 12-month cost reporting period lasting from July 1, 2015 th rough June 30, 2016. However, the new CAH would be required to submit its attestation that it was a mean ingful EHR user for FY 2016 no later than November 30, 2016, in order to avoid be ing subject to the payment adjustment for the cost reporting period th at begins in FY 2016 (in the previous example from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017). We stated in the proposed rule that in pr oposing such an exception for newly established CAHs, it is important to ensure that the exception is not available to CAHs that have already been in operation in one form or another, perh aps under a different ownership or merely in a different location, and thus have in fact had an opportunity to demonstr ate meaningful use of EHR technology. Therefore, we proposed that fo r the purposes of qualifying for this exception, a new CAH means a CAH that has operated (under previous or present ow nership) for less than 1 year. We stated in the proposed rule that in some cases an eligible hospital may convert to a CAH. An eligible hospital is a subsection (d) hosp ital that is a meaningful user and is paid under the inpatient hospital prospective payment systems as described in subpart A of Part 412 of the regulations. In these cases, el igible hospitals were able to qualify for purposes of the EHR hospital incentive payments by establishing meani ngful use, and (as discussed previously) are also subject to a payment adjustment provision in FY 2015 and subsequent years if they fail to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology during an app licable reporting period. Therefore, we proposed not to tr eat a CAH that has converted from an eligible hospital as a newly established CAH for the purposes of this exception. 485 On the other hand, we stated in the proposed rule that other types of hospitals such as long-term care hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and inpatient rehabilita tion facilities are not subsection (d) hospitals. These other types of hosp itals do not meet the definition of an \"eligible hospital\" for purposes of the Medicare EHR hospita l incentive payments and the application of the proposed hospital market basket adjustment in FY 2015 and subsequent years under section 1886(n)(6)(B) of the Act. In some instances, a CAH may be converted fr om one of these types of hospitals. In that case, the CAH would not have had an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful use, and it is theref ore appropriate to treat them as newly established CAHs if they convert from one of these other types of hospita ls to a CAH for purposes of determining whether they should qualify for an exception from the a pplication of the adjustment in FY 2015 and subsequent years. Thus, we proposed to consid er a CAH that converts from one of these other types of hospitals to be a newly established C AH for the purposes of qualifying for this proposed exception from the application of the adjust ment in FY 2015 and subsequent years. In summary, we proposed for purposes of qualifying for the exception to revise \u00a7413.70(a)(6)(ii) to state that a newly established CAH means a CAH that has operated (under previous or present ownership) for less than 1 year. We also proposed to revise \u00a7413.70(a)(6)(ii) to state that the following CAHs are not newly es tablished CAHs for purposes of this exception: A CAH that builds new or replacement faciliti es at the same or another location even if coincidental with a change of ownership, a ch ange in management, or a lease arrangement. A CAH that closes and subsequently reopens. A CAH that has been in operation for more than 1 year but has participated in the Medicare program fo r less than 1 year. A CAH that has been converted from an eligible subs ection (d) hospital. 486 Comment : Identical to the concerns raised for subsection (d) hospitals , several comments stated that the new CAH exception for at least 1 full year cost reporting period be triggered not by when the hospital accepts its first patient, but ra ther when it accepts its first Medicare-covered patient. Response : We agree with the commenters and revi se the exception for new CAHs to be for at least 1 full year cost repo rting period after they accept their first Medicar e-covered patient. This change renders our third cr iteria (a CAH that has been in operation for more than 2 years but has participated in the Medicare program fo r less than 2 years) for not considering a CAH new moot as the exception is now based on the admission of the first Medicare-covered patient, which we believe is sufficiently analogous to starting participati on in the Medicare program to allow us to remove this criteria. After consideration of comments, we are revi sing this exception to base it on the point when the CAH accepts their first Medicare patient. Finally, we proposed an additi onal exception in this final rule for extreme circumstances that make it impossible for a CAH to demonstrat e meaningful use requirements through no fault of its own during the reporting period. Such circumstances might include: a CAH is closed; a natural disaster in which an EHR system is destroyed; EHR vendor goi ng out of business; and similar circumstances. Because exceptions on ex treme, uncontrollable circumstances must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, we believe that it is appropriate to re quire CAHs to qualify for the exception through an application process. Comment : Commenters supported this exceptio n in principle. However, many commenters requested various circ umstances be added to the list of example circumstances. This list is nearly entirely identical to that for EPs and subsection (d) hospitals as described 487 earlier. Response : We used the same evaluation criteria we used for EPs and came to the same conclusion to add two examples. First, a C AH whose CEHRT (complete or modular) loses its certification either through revocation or because the vendor did not upgrade their CEHRT to the latest requirements; and second, a CAH sufferi ng severe financial distress resulting in a bankruptcy or restru cturing of debt As described previously, we are finaliz ing the policy to al ign a CAH's payment adjustment year with the applicable EH R reporting period. A CAH must submit their meaningful use attestation for a specific EHR reporting period no later than 60 days after the close of the EHR reporting peri od (no later than November 30th of the year) otherwise the payment penalty could be applied to the CAH's cost reporting period that be gins in that payment adjustment year. We proposed to require a CAH to submit an application for an exception, as described previously, to its Medicare contractor by the same November 30th date that the meaningful use attestation is due . Therefore, we proposed that a CAH will be subject to the payment adjustment if it has not submitted its meaningful use attestation (or its attestation has been denied) and has not submitted an a pplication for an exception by November 30 th of the subsequent EHR reporting period. If a CAH's re quest for an exception is not granted by the Medicare contractor then we proposed that the pa yment adjustment will be applied. We stated in the proposed rule that if a CAH anticipates submitting an exception application we recommend that the CAH communicate with its Medicare co ntractor to determine the necessary supporting documentation to submit by the November 30th due date. After consideration of public comments, we are finalizing these application deadlines exception as proposed. 488 Table 18, summarizes the timeline for CAHs to avoid the applicable payment adjustment by demonstrating meaningful use or qualifying fo r an exception from the application of the adjustment. Comment : Commenters provided the same suggestions for additional exceptions for CAHs that they did for eligible hospitals. Response : As we stated in our response to similar comments submitted for eligible hospitals these additional exceptions could have been suggested as examples for the exception for extreme circumstances. We encourage hospita ls in these situations to utilize the extreme circumstances exception. We believe these excep tions are too subjective to be finalized as new exceptions as suggested by commenters.

Administrative Review Process of Certai n Electronic Health Record Incentive Program Determinations In the Stage 2 proposed rule we proposed an administrative appeal s process would apply to both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of meaningful use. We also posted guidance on the CMS website, http://www.cms.gov/qualitymeasures/05_ehrincen tiveprogramappeals.asp, in the interim between the publication of this proposed rule and the publication of the final rule. We sought public comments both on the guidance and the proposed rule. We proposed to limit permissible appeals to the following three types of appeals: Eligibility Appeals Meaningful Use Appeals Incentive Payment Appeals We also propos ed certain filing and other deadlines for such administrative appeals. We refer read ers to our proposed rule at (77 FR 13779 through 13780) for a full explanation of these proposals. We received several comments on our appeals proposals, which are discussed in this section of the preamble. However, after review of the public comments and the appeals filed as of the writing of this final rule, we believe the administrative review process is primarily procedural and does not need to be specified in regulation. The appeals process we proposed 490 essentially constituted an agency reconsideration of certain types of determinations regarding eligibility for the program, mean ingful use, or incentive payment amounts. We believe such an informal reconsideration process may be included in procedural guidance, rather than in our regulations. Therefore, our administrative appe als process will be included on our website at www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms . We recognize that there is a procedural a ppeals process currently in effect, and in all cases, we will require that requests for appeals, all filings, and all s upporting documentation and data be submitted through a mechanism and in a manner specified by us. We expect all providers to exhaust this administ rative review process prior to s eeking review in Federal Court. As we stated in the proposed rule, we also note that the HITECH Act prohibits both administrative and judicial review of the standa rds and method used to determine eligibility and payment (including those governing meaningf ul use) (see 42 CFR 413.70(a)(7), 495.106(f), 495.110, 495.212). Our limited appeal process would not provide administrative review of these areas; but rather would involve cases of individual applicability ; that is, where a provider is challenging not the standards and methods them selves, but whether the provider met the regulatory standards and methods prom ulgated by CMS in its rules. While we are not finalizing regulations on app eals, we respond to comments we received on our proposals. Comment : Several commenters requested CMS make more explicit information available to providers on the doc umentation that should be availabl e in the event of an audit. Response : In the event of an audit, at a mi nimum, providers should have available electronic or paper documentation that supports providers' completion of the Attestation Module responses, including the specific information that supports each measure. In addition, providers 491 should have documentation to support the subm ission of CQMs, incl uding the specific information that supports each measure. Providers should also maintain documentation to support their incentive payment calculations, fo r example data to support amounts included on their cost report, which are used in the calculation. As indica ted in the Stage 1 final rule, providers should keep documentation for at least 6 years following the date of attestation. Comment : A commenter noted that states may need to change their audit procedures or State Medicaid Health Information Technol ogy (HIT) Plans (SMHPs) regarding audit and appeals by CMS for demonstrat ing meaningful use. Response : We proposed that states would have an option to have CMS audit and conduct appeals of eligible hospitals' meaningful use. We finalize that pr oposal in our Medicaid regulations at \u00a7495.332. We agree that SMHPs re garding audit and appeals may need revising. We are working closely with stat es to align principles regardi ng both audit and appeals process for both the Medicare and Medica id EHR Incentive Programs. We intend to give states both technical support and program information to ensure consistency in the app lication of those audit and appeals principles. Comment : A number of commenters asked for th e addition of appeal categories beyond those we proposed. Several commenters requ ested CMS implement an appeals process for penalties and hardship exemptions. One commen ter requested more comprehensive language to better define the requirements and circumstan ces under which appeals may be heard and acted upon. Another commenter requested CMS instit ute an appeals process relating to MACs' decisions regarding reasonable costs and de termining incentive payments for CAHs. Response : We appreciate the number of comment ers that requested additional appeal categories. Since the writing a nd publication of the Stage 1 final rule, we have had the 492 opportunity to review a number of appeals, and we note that many of these appeals do not necessarily fit easily into the categories we proposed. Based on the comments we received and the information we have regardi ng appeals that have already been filed, we are concerned that finalizing the categories we pr oposed for appeals could negati vely impact providers and potentially add unnecessary burden and complexity. We are also concerned that specifying these categories could limit the flexibility we might otherwise have in addressing new or unanticipated appeal categories in the future, or in adding gr eater detail regarding the scope and requirements of particular types of appeals. For example, a number of the appeals we have received are related neither to eligibility, m eaningful use, or incentive paymen ts directly, but instead address registration or attestation system changes that we are currently in the process of implementing for providers' benefit. Because of these concer ns, we decline to finalize the categories of appeals as proposed and intend to issue guidance regarding types or cate gories of appeals and accompanying requirements on our website at www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms . As stated earlier, the HITEC H Act prohibits both administra tive and judicial review of the standards and methods used to determine e ligibility and payment (including those governing meaningful use) (see 42 CFR 413.70(a)(7), 495.106(f), 495.110, 495.212). Any procedures would not allow administrative appeals of these issues. As for reasonable costs reported by CAHs, we already stated in the Stage 1 final ru le that a CAH \"may appeal the statistical and financial amounts from the Medicare cost report used to determine the CAH incentive payment,\" but that the CAH \"would utilize th e current provider appeal pro cess pursuant to section 1878 of the Act.\" (75 FR 44464) Finally, we note that there will not be appeal reconsideratio ns of hardship exception or payment adjustment determinations. As specified section at II.D.2.c. of this final rule, the 493 granting of a hardship exception will be through an application process, and we expect providers to make a full declaration of all relevant information at the time of filing of that application. We are concerned that there would not be adequate time to process hardship exception applications, render determinations, and also pr ocess appeals of those redetermin ations. Therefore, we decline to allow appeal reconsiderations of hardship exception determinati ons. We note that the HITECH Act prohibits both administrative and ju dicial review of the standards and methods used to determine payment adjustments, including hardship exceptions to those payment adjustments. Comment : A number of commenters noted conc erns regarding the timelines proposed for filing appeals and forw arding documentation. Response : We appreciate the many comments re garding the proposed timelines for appeals. However, we are not finalizing our appeal regulations in this final rule. We intend to issue guidance regarding timelines for types or categories of app eals on our website at www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms . 494 E. Medicare Advantage Or ganization Incentive Payments 1. Definitions (\u00a7495.200) We proposed to add definitions of the terms \"Adverse eligibility determination,\" \"Adverse payment determination\" and \"MA payment ad justment year.\" We also proposed to add a definition for the term \"Potentially qualifying MA-EPs and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals,\" to cross reference the existing definition at \u00a7495.202(a)(4). We proposed to clarify the application of \" hospital-based EP\" as that term is used in paragraph 5 of the definition of \"qualifyi ng MA-EP\" in \u00a7495.200, to make clear that the calculation is not based on FFS-cove red professional services, but ra ther on MA plan enrollees. Otherwise, qualifying MA-EPs who provide at least 80 percent of thei r covered professional services to MA plan enrollees of a qualifying MA organization might be considered \"hospital based\" solely on the basis of 90 percent of their FFS-covered professi onal services being provided in a hospital setting. We provided an example of a qualifying MA-EP that might bill FFS 10 times over a year for emergency room servi ces provided to variou s Medicare patients. Although the vast majority of the MA-EP's covere d services were reimbursed under his or her arrangement with a qualifying MA organiza tion, 100 percent (or 10) of the MA-EP's FFS-covered services would have been for hospi tal-based services, which would prohibit the MA organization from receiving reimbursement under the MA EHR incentive program for the MA-EP. We do not believe that we should exclude MA-EPs from the MA EHR Incentive Program due to only a few FFS claims. Therefore, we are clarifying the definition of \"qualifying MA-EP\" to state that for purposes of the MA EHR Incentive Program, a hospital-based MA-EP provides 90 percent or more of hi s or her covered professional se rvices in a hospital setting to MA plan enrollees of the qualifying MA organization. 495 We did not receive any comments on these pr ovisions and we are finalizing them as proposed with the exception of the definitions of the terms \"Adverse eligibility determination,\" and \"Adverse payment determination.\" As we e xplain later in this pr eamble discussion, we do not believe formal regulations for an informal re consideration procedural rule are necessary and therefore, we are not finalizing thes e two definitions in our regulations. 2. Identification of Qualifying MA Organi zations, MA-EPs, and MA-Affiliated Eligible Hospitals (\u00a7495.202) We proposed a technical change to \u00a7495.202( b)(1) to require th at the qualifying MA organization identify those MA-EPs and MA-affilia ted eligible hospitals that the qualifying MA organization believes would be meaningful users of CEHRT during the reporting period, when a qualifying MA organization intends to claim an incentive payment for a given qualifying MA-EP or MA-affiliated eligible hospital. We also proposed an amendment to \u00a7495.202(b)(2) to reflect current policy that qualifying MA organizations must report the CM S Certification Number (CCN) for qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals. We explained th at as the program matures, it is necessary to report this detail to effectively ad minister the program. We are a dopting this change in this final rule (\u00a7495.202(b)(2)). We proposed a new \u00a7495.202(b)(3) to establis h a reporting requirement to identify qualifying MA-EPs who have furnished more than 50 percent of their covered Medicare professional services to MA enrollees of th e qualifying MA organi zation in a designated geographic Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) during the reporting period. We also proposed to redesignate the cu rrent \u00a7495.202(b)(3) as (b)(4), and revised the introductory language in (b)(2) to refl ect this redesignation. 496 We also proposed to require MA organi zations to identify qualifying MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals within 2 months of the close of the payment year (rather than within 60 days) (previously \u00a7495.202(b)(3), now newly rede signated \u00a7495.202(b)(4)). We explained that this change would be consiste nt with the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program, but in nonleap years this w ould reduce the time for reporti ng revenue amounts to CMS for qualifying MA-EPs from 60 days to 59 days. We proposed conforming amendments to \u00a7495.204(b)(2) and \u00a7495.210(b) and (c). We also explained that because the redesignated \u00a7495.202 (b)(4) relates to both the payment phase and the payment adjustment phase of the program, we are adding the word \"qualifying\" to the text of the regulation. Theref ore, we explained, this regulation applies to both qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hosp itals (both payment and payment adjustment phases of the program) and potentially qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals (only the payment adjustment phase of the program). We proposed to redesignate the current \u00a7495.202(b)(4) as \u00a7495.202(b)(5), and to require a qualifying MA organization to identify the MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that it believes would be both \"qualifying \" and \"potentially qualifying.\" To calculate the payment adjustment, we explained that we will need to know how many qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals ar e, and are not, meaningful users. We also proposed to correct a cross-reference. We did not receive any comments on these pr ovisions and we are finalizing them as proposed. 497 3. Incentive Payments to Qualifying MA Orga nizations for Qualifying MA-EPs and Qualifying MA-Affiliated Eligible Hospitals (\u00a7495.204) a. Amount Payable to a Qualifying MA Organization for its Qualifying MA-EPs In \u00a7495.204(b), we proposed to clarify that methods relating to overhead costs may be submitted for MA-EPs regardless of whether the MA -EPs are salaried or paid in another fashion, such as on a capitated basis. As stated previously, we also proposed to require MA organizati ons, to submit revenue amounts relating to their qualifying MA-EPs within 2 months of the close of the payment year, (rather than within 60 days). b. Increase in Incentive Payment for MA-EPs Who Predominantly Furnish Services in a Geographic Health Professi onal Shortage Area (HPSA) In a new \u00a7495.204(e) (we proposed to redesignate the current paragra ph (e) as paragraph (f)), we proposed to add a pr ovision clarifying the currently ex isting policy governing whether a qualifying MA organization is enti tled to a HPSA increase for a given qualifying MA-EP. We explained that section 1848( o)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act, which is curre ntly in effect, and as applied to the MA program, provides a 10-percent increase in the maximum incentive payment available for MA-EPs that predominantly furnish cove red professional servic es during the MA EHR payment year in a geographic H PSA. We explained that consis tent with the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program, we interpreted the term \"predo minantly\" to mean more than 50 percent. For the MA EHR Incentive Program, we proposed to de termine eligibility fo r the geographic HPSA increase on whether the qualif ying MA-EP predominantly provi ded services to MA plan enrollees of the qualifying MA organization in a HPSA during the applicable MA EHR payment year. 498 Further, we explained that it is worth noting that an MA organization does not automatically receive a HPSA bonus merely b ecause its qualifying MA-EPs predominantly served a geographic HPSA. We stated that in order for the MA organization to receive the 10 percent increase, the MA-EP needs to provide at least 10 percent or mo re of Medicare Part B covered professional services to MA plan enrollees of the qualifying MA organization. In other words, to qualify for the HPSA bonus an MA-EP needs to provide more than $24,000 of Medicare Part B covered professional services to MA plan enrollees of the qualifying MA organization. The MA-EP needs to provide up to $26,400 in covered services to earn the maximum HPSA-enhanced bonus of $19,800 if the first payment year is 2011 or 2012. Thus, for MA-EPs who predominantly furnish services in a geographic HPSA, the \"incentive payment limit\" in \u00a7495.102(b) would be $19,800, instead of $18,000, if the first MA EHR payment year for the MA organization with respect to the MA-EP is 2011 or 2012. If an MA organization could show that an MA-EP predominantly served beneficiaries in a HPSA during the payment year and that that MA-EP provided, for exampl e, for the 2011 payment year, at least $26,400 in Part B professional services to MA plan enro llees of the MA organization during the payment year, we stated that the MA organization coul d receive the entire $19,800 incentive payment for that MA-EP. If the MA-EP provided less than $26,400 in Part B professional services, the potential incentive payment for that MA-EP fo r that MA organization would be less than $19,800 for the payment year. We proposed a conforming amendment in \u00a7495.202(b)(2)(ii) to require MA organizations to notify CMS whethe r the qualifying MA-EP predominantly provided covered services to MA plan enrollees in a HPSA. We added a new paragraph (5) to redesignate d paragraph (f). This new paragraph (5) clarifies that we would recoup th e EHR incentive payment if one of the following entities fails to 499 comply with an audit request to produce documents or data needed to au dit the validity of an EHR incentive payment: -- (1) a qualifying MA-E P, (2) an entity that employs a qualifying MA-EP (or in which a qualifying MA-EP had a pa rtnership interest), (3) an MA-affiliated eligible hospital, or (4) any other party contracting with the qualifying MA organization. We explained that we already have the authority to do this under the current \u00a7495.204(e)(4), (to be redesignated as (f)(4)); however, we proposed to amend the regulations to specifically address what would happen in the case of a failure to pr oduce documents or data related to an audit request. We added a new paragraph (g) to \u00a7495.204 to clarify the current policy that in the unlikely event we paid a qualifying MA organiza tion for a qualifying MA-EP, and it was later determined that the MA-EP-- (1) was entitle d to a full incentive pa yment under the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program; or (2) had receiv ed payment under the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, we would recover the funds paid to the qualifying MA organization for such an MA-EP from the MA organization. (We stated th at the former case would be in the unlikely event an MA-EP appeared to have earned an EHR incentive of less than the full amount under FFS, and then later was determined to have earned the full amount under FFS. In accordance with duplicate payment avoidance provisions in section 1853(l)(3 )(B) of the Act and implementing regulations at \u00a7495.208, we would recover the MA EHR in centive payment since a full FFS EHR payment was due.) If the organi zation still had an MA contract, we would recoup the amount from the MA organization's monthly payment under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act. If the organization no longer had an MA contract, we would recoup any amounts through other means, such as formal collection. We stated that since dupl icate and overpayments are prohibited by statute (secti ons 1853(l)(3)(B), 1853(m)(3)(B), and 1903(t)(2) of the Act), we 500 believe that this policy must apply to all year s of the program, beginning with payment year 2011. Thus, we would recover overpaid MA EHR incentive payments for all MA EHR payment years, including payment year 2011. We also clarified that, in accordance with stat utory requirements, if it is determined that an MA organization received an incentive paym ent for an MA-affiliated eligible hospital that also received a payment under the Medicare F FS EHR Incentive program or that otherwise should not have received such payment, we w ould similarly recover the funds paid to the qualifying MA organization for such MA-affiliate d eligible hospital from either the MA organization's monthly payment under section 18 53(a)(1)(A) of the Act, from the MA-affiliated eligible hospital's CMS payment through the typical process for r ecouping Medicare funds from a \"subsection (d)\" hospital, or through other mean s such as a collection process, as necessary. As with EPs, as the statute prohibits us from making duplicate and overp ayments, we explained that this policy does not consti tute a new rule and must apply to all years of the program, beginning with payment year 2011. We did not receive any comments on thes e provisions and are finalizing them as proposed. 4. Avoiding Duplicate Payments We stated that qualifying MA-EPs are eligible for the Medicare FFS EHR incentive payment if they meet certain requirements under that program. However, we also stated that an EHR incentive payment is only allowed from one pr ogram. We believe that the requirement that MA organizations notify MA-EPs that the MA or ganization intended to cl aim them for the MA EHR Incentive Program would minimize misunderst andings among MA-EPs (particularly if they expected to receive an incen tive payment under the Medicare FFS Incentive Program). We 501 stated that it was important for MA-EPs to unde rstand certain aspects of the program such as when a qualifying MA organization claimed an MA-EP under the MA EHR Incentive Program and the MA-EP was not entitled to a full FFS EHR Incentive payment, the MA organization claim would prevent a partial payment under th e Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program from being paid directly to the MA-EP. We proposed to require each qualifying MA or ganization to attest that it notified the MA-EPs it intends to claim. We proposed to requ ire that this attestati on be submitted along with the MA organization's meaningful use attestation for the MA EH R payment year for which the MA organization is seeking payment. Therefore, we proposed to revise \u00a7495.208 by adding-- (1) a new paragraph (a) that requires a qualifying MA organization to notify MA-EPs when the MA organization intends to claim them for the MA EHR Incentive Program prio r to making its attesta tion of meaningful use to CMS; (2) a new paragraph (b) that requires a qualifying MA organiza tion to notify MA-EPs when it is claiming them, that the MA-EPs may still receive an incentive payment under the Medicare FFS or Medicaid EHR Incentive Program , if certain requirements are met; and (3) a new paragraph (c) that requires a qualifying MA organization to attest to CMS that these notification requirements have been satisfied by the MA organization. We also proposed to redesignate the current paragra phs (a) through (c) of \u00a7495.208 as (d ) through (f), respectively. As discussed previously, in \u00a7495.210, we propos ed to change the requirement that MA organizations attest to meaningful use within 60 days after the close of the MA EHR payment year for both MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, to a requirement to do so within 2 months in order provide c onsistency between the Medica re FFS and MA EHR Incentive Programs. 502 Comment : A commenter requested that CMS confirm that MA or ganization reporting to CMS under HEDIS, HOS, and CAHPS will conti nue to apply for purpos es of the MA EHR Incentive Payment Program during Stage 2. The commenter questioned if MA organizations, for both qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, will be perm itted to continue to submit HEDIS, HOS, and CAHPS data in lieu of CQMs during Stage 2. Response : We are confirming that during Stage 2 and subse quent stages of MA EHR Program implementation, we will continue to require qualifying MA organizations to successfully report HEDIS, HOS, and CAHPS m easures in lieu of CQMs for purposes of meaningful use reporting for qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affili ated eligible hospitals. After review of the public comments receiv ed, we are finalizing these provisions as proposed. 5. Payment Adjustments Effective for 2015 and Subsequent MA Payment Adjustment Years (\u00a7495.211). In the proposed rule we explained th at beginning in 2015, the law provides for adjustments to monthly MA payments under sect ions 1853(l)(4) and 1853(m)(4) of the Act if a qualifying MA organization's potentially qualifying MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals (or both) are not meaningful users of certified EHR technology. We proposed to add a definition of \"MA Payment Adjustment Year\" to the definitions in \u00a7495.200. The definition was needed in part because the payment adjustment phase of the MA EHR program continued indefinitely - beyond the last year for which MA EHR incentive payments could be made to qualifying MA organizations. Additionally, since we proposed to operationalize MA EHR payment adjustments in a different manner than under the FFS Medi care program, we belie ved a definition was warranted. 503 We proposed that an MA organization would have to had at least ini tiated participation in the incentive payment phase of the program from 2011 through 2014 for MA-EPs or through 2015 for MA-affiliated eligible hosp itals, to have its Part C payment under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act adjusted during the payment adjustment phase of the program, and would have to continue to qualify for participa tion in the program as a \"qualify ing MA organization\" as defined for purposes of this program. The imposition of a payment adjustment is also conditioned on the qualifying MA organization having potentially qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals for the respective payment adjustment years. We took this approach because we believed that it would be impossible to verify that a given MA organization is, in fact, a qualifying MA organization with potentially qu alifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, unless the MA organization had first de monstrated that it met these requirements through receipt of MA EHR incentiv e payments for at least one of the MA EHR payment years as defined for purposes of this program. We noted that although MA EHR payment years for both MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals could theoretically continue through 2016, the last first MA EHR payment year for which an MA organization could receive an EHR incentive payment is 2014 for MA-EPs, and 2015 for MA-affiliated hospitals. Furthermore, we believe that payment ad justments under section 1853 of the Act would have limited applicability in the MA EHR Incentive Program because the HITECH Act limited the type of organization that w ould qualify as a \"qualifying MA or ganization\" for purposes of the MA EHR Incentive Program in both phases of th e program (the phase of the program during which we make incentive payments, and the phase of the program when we adjust payments under sections 1853(l)(4) a nd 1853(m)(4) of the Act). We stat ed that section 1853(l)(5) of the Act limits which MA organizations may par ticipate by defining the term \"qualifying MA 504 organization.\" We explained that a \"qualifying MA organization\" must be organized as a health maintenance organization (HMO), as defined in section 2791(b)(3) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(l)(5)). The PHS Act further defines an HMO as a \"federally qualified HMO, an organization recognized under st ate law as an HMO, or a similar organization regulated under state law for solvency in the sa me manner and to the same extent as such an HMO.\" (See 42 U.S.C. 300gg-91). We explained that an MA organization participating in Medicare Part C might not be a federally qua lified HMO, nor an orga nization recognized under state law as an HMO, nor a similar organization regulated under state law for solvency in the same manner and to the same extent as such an HMO. We noted that or ganizations that do not meet the PHS definition of \"HMO\" may not receive an incentive payment, nor would they be eligible to have their Part C payment adjust ed for having potentially qualifying MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that do not succes sfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Secondly, section 1853(l)(2) of the Act requires that MA-EPs be as described in that paragraph. We stated that the vast majority of MA organizations do not employ their physicians; nor do they use physicians who work for, or who ar e partners of, an entity that contracts nearly exclusively with the MA organi zation (as set out in the defini tion of a \"Qualifying MA-EP\" in \u00a7495.200). Thirdly, section 1853(m)(2) of the Act requir es that a qualifying MA organization have common corporate governance with a hospital in or der for it to be considered an MA-affiliated eligible hospital, and we did not expect many qualifying MA organizations to meet this test. We explained that the curre nt \u00a7495.202(b)(4) (which we pr oposed to redesignate as \u00a7495.202(b)(5)) requires all qualifying MA organi zations that have potentially qualifying 505 MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users to initially report that fact to us beginning in June of MA plan year 2015. We proposed that this reporting requirement would include only qualifying MA organizations that participated in and received MA EHR incentive payments. Further, we discussed that there may be MA organizations that participated in the incentive payment phase of the program, but th en ceased being qualifying MA organizations, or that no longer have any qualifying MA-EPs or MA -affiliated eligible hospitals. We provided an example of a qualifying MA organization that contracts with a specific entity to deliver physicians' services during the payment phase of the EHR Incentive Program, but then the entity changes, or the MA organization loses its contr act with the entity. We explained that such changes could cause the MA organization's MA EPs to no longer meet the 80/80/20 rule due to loss of the contract, or the entity might begin contracting with additi onal MA organizations. (See \u00a7495.200, for the definition of \"Qualifying MA-EP.\") Theref ore, we explained, the MA organization would not necessarily have its m onthly payment adjusted because it might no longer meet the basic requirements under which MA EHR incentive payments were made to it. Therefore, we proposed to adjust paymen ts, beginning for payment adjustment year 2015, only for qualifying MA organizations that received MA EHR payments and that had potentially qualifying MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that were not meaningful EHR users. We proposed to rely on the existi ng self-reporting requirement in redesignated \u00a7495.202(b)(5) and subsequent audits to ensure compliance. Comment : A commenter recommended that CMS apply MA payment adjustments to qualifying MA organizations only for the catego ry of MA provider (that is, MA-EP versus MA-affiliated hospital) for which it claimed and received MA EHR incentive payments. For 506 example, if a qualifying MA organization claime d incentive payments during the payment phase of the program only for MA-EPs and not for any MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, then the MA organization should only be required to report on qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs during the adjustment phase of the program, and should not be subject to payment adjustments for MA-affiliated hospitals. Response : We agree with the commenter that we will apply payment adjustments only to qualifying MA organizations for the category (or categories) of MA provider (either MA-EP, MA-affiliated eligible hospital, or both) for which it claimed and received MA EHR incentive payments. To the same extent that qualifying MA organizations have identified themselves and their qualifying MA-EPs and/or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals during the payment phase of the MA EHR Incentive Program, we expect them to continue to identify themselves and their MA-EPs and MA-affiliated hospitals during the adjustment phase of the program. We are taking this approach because we believe it would be impossible to verify that a given qualifying MA organization has potentially qualifying MA-EPs or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, unless it had first identified those providers to us. We ha ve modified \u00a7495.211(c) to clarify that MA EHR payment adjustments with respect to MA-affilia ted hospitals will only apply to qualifying MA organizations that previously received in centive payments under the MA EHR Incentive Program for MA-affiliated hospitals, and simila rly, that MA EHR paym ent adjustments with respect to MA-EPs will only apply to qualifying MA organizations that previously received incentive payments under the MA EHR Incentive Program for MA-EPs. We proposed to collect payment adjust ments made under sections 1853(l)(4) and 1853(m)(4) of the Act after meaningful use attesta tions have been made. Final attestations of meaningful use occur after the end of an EHR reporting peri od, which for MA-EPs would run 507 concurrent with the payment adjustment year. In the case of potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, attestations of meaningful use would occur by the end of November after the EHR reporting period. As noted previously, we proposed to am end \u00a7495.202(b) to indicate that in addition to initial identification of potential ly qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users (a s required by redesignate d \u00a7495.202(b)(5)), qualifying MA organizations would also need to finally identify such MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals within 2 months of the close of the applicable EHR reporting period. Final identification by qualifying MA organizations of potentially qualifying MA-EPs and/or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meani ngful users would then result in application of a payment adjustment by CMS. On the other ha nd, final identification of all qualifying MA-EPs and/or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals as mean ingful users would obviate an adjustment. We stated that, through audit, we would verify th e accuracy of an applicable MA organization's assertions or nonreporting. We proposed to adjust one or more of the qualifying MA organization's monthly MA payments made under section 1853 (a)(1)(A) of the Act after th e qualifying MA organization attested to the percent of hospita ls and professionals th at either were, or were not, meaningful users of certified EHR technology. We stated that, to the exte nt a formerly qualifying MA organization did not report under \u00a7495.202(b)(4) or (5), we would verify, upon audit, the accuracy of the applicable MA organization's nondisclosure of such qualifying and potentially qualifying users. Under our proposed approach, the adjustme nt would be calculated based on Part C payment data made under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Ac t for the payment adjustment year. We stated that since an MA-affiliated eligible hospital must attest to meaningful use by November 508 30th, we could use the Part C payment information in effect at the time of the attestation to calculate the payment adjustment for a specific potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospital with respect to a speci fic MA organization. Although we expected (and preferred) to make an adjustment to a single MA monthly pa yment totaling the adjustment for the year, we requested comment on whether more than one mont hly payment should be adjusted. We stated that one possible approach would be to make this decision on a case-by-case basis depending upon a given qualifying MA organiza tion's situation (for example, payment adjustment amount versus MA organization monthly payment). For payment adjustments based on pote ntially qualifying MA-EPs that are not meaningful users of certified EHR technology, we also proposed to calculate the adjustment based on the Part C payment made under sectio n 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act for the payment adjustment year. Because attestations of meaningful use for qualifying MA-EPs occur in February of the calendar year following the EHR reporting year, we noted that we could calculate the payment adjustment based on the pr ior MA payment year's payment, and that we could apply that adjustment to one or more of the prospective Part C payments. While we preferred to make an adjustment to one MA prospective payment for the full amount of the payment adjustment when possible, we so licited comment on whether we should make adjustments over several months or in a single month (for the en tire adjustment amount), when possible. We received no comments on this prop osal and therefore we ar e adopting the policy of collecting payment adjustments as quickly as possible in a single month, when possible. Thus, adjustments for MA payment adjustment year 2015 would be based on MA payment data under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Ac t. However, while the payment adjustment for the 2015 payment adjustment year would be collect ed as soon as possible, we stated that this 509 might not be until CY 2016 through an adjustment to the MA organization's MA capitation payment or payments under secti on 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act. We stated that proposed \u00a7495.211(c) made clear that the potentially qua lifying MA-EP and MA-affiliated eligible hospital payment adjustme nts would be calculated separately, and that each adjustment was applied to the qualifying MA organization's monthly payment under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act. As discussed previo usly, we are modifying \u00a7495.211(c) to clarify that MA EHR payment adjustments for MA-affiliate d hospitals only apply to qualifying MA organizations that previously received in centive payments under the MA EHR Incentive Program for MA-affiliated hospitals, and that payment adjustments for MA-EPs only apply to qualifying MA organizations that previously received incentiv e payments under the MA EHR Incentive Program for MA-EPs. Proposed paragraphs (a) through (c) woul d apply to adjustments based on both potentially qualifying and qualifying MA-EPs and MA -affiliated eligible hospitals that were not meaningful EHR users. Proposed paragraph (d) would apply only to adjustments based on potentially qualifying and qualifyi ng MA-EPs that were not mean ingful users of certified EHR technology. We also stated that paragraph (d) makes it clear that if a potentially qualifying MA-EP was not a meaningful user of CEHRT in payment adjustment year 2015 (and subsequent payment adjustment years), the qualifying MA or ganization's monthly Part C payment would be adjusted accordingly. During the payment phase of the MA EHR Incentive Program qualifying MA organizations attest to meaningful use for each qualifying MA-EP and MA-affiliated eligible hospital they claimed. We also stated that duri ng the payment adjustment phase of the program, we would need to know the percentage of bot h qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs 510 and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that were no t meaningful users of certified EHR technology. This percentage could be derived by taking the total number of the qualifying MA organization's qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs, or MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, and identifying the portion of those MA-EPs or MA-a ffiliated hospitals that were not meaningful EHR users. We would use this percentage to make the adjustment pr oportional to the percent that were not meaningful users for a given ad justment year and qualifying MA organization. Moreover, in determining the proporti on of potentially qua lifying MA-EPs and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospita ls (those that were not meaningful users), we would exclude EPs and hospitals that were ne ither qualifying nor pot entially qualifying in accordance with the definition of \"qualifying\" and \"potentially qualifying MA-EPs\" and \"MA-affiliated eligible hospita ls\" an MA-EP th at was a hospital-based EP would not be a qualifying or potentially qualifying MA-EP since such an EP did not meet item (5) of the definition of qualifying MA-EP in \u00a7495.200 and thus would not be used in our computation of the proportion of MA-EPs for purpos es of applying the payment adjustment. We proposed the following formula to apply the pa yment adjustments proposed in \u00a7495.211(d)(2) to MA-EPs: [the total number of potentially qualifying MA-EPs ]/[(the total number of potentially qualifying MA-EPs) + (the total number of qualifying MA-EPs) ]. Similarly, the formula we proposed for pur poses of applying payment adjustments in \u00a7495.211(e)(2)(iii) with re spect to MA-affiliated ]/[(the total number of potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals) + (the total number of qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals) ]. 511 Keeping in mind that redesignated \u00a7 495.202(b)(4) and (5) required qualifying MA organizations to identify potentially qualifying MA-EPs and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals and to provide other inform ation beginning for plan year 2015, we solicited comment on the question of whether, in the payment adjustment phase of this program, qualifying MA organizations with potentially qualifying MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals should-- (1) still be requi red to attest to the meaningful use objectives and measures; or (2) instead be required only to report the percen t of MA-EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users of certified EHR technology. We suggested that commenters take into account that MA-affiliated eligible hospitals w ould still be required to perform a reporting function on behalf of their MA-a ffiliated organization in the Na tional Level Repository (NLR), and that they were generally bound to \"subsectio n (d)\" hospital reporting requirements of the NLR. Thus, we were primarily interested in comments related to MA-EPs. We explained that while we wished to mi nimize burden, we were also concerned with our ability to audit the information reporte d to ensure compliance with MA program requirements. Having received no comments on th is provision, we therefore adopt a final requirement to use only percentage-based reporti ng and, require MA organizations to retain and produce data and records necessary to substant iate their submissions, including evidence of meaningful use by those MA-EPs and MA-a ffiliated eligible hospitals so reported. We proposed that payment adjustments for MA-EPs would be calculated by multiplying: (1) the percent established under \u00a7495.211(d)(4) (which, in accordance with the statute, increases the adjustment amount up until 2017 and potentially beyond); with (2) the Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion; and (3) by the percent of the qualifying MA organization's qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs that were not meaningful users. We explained that 512 section 1853(l)(4)(B)(i) of the Act requires MA payments to be reduced using the \"percentage points\" reduction of section 1848(a )(7)(A)(ii) of the Act. As s ection 1848(a)(7)(A)( ii) of the Act is \"subject to clause (iii),\" a nd as clause (iii) of that same provision requires payment adjustments to increase when the proportion of EPs who are meaningful EHR us ers is less than 75 percent, we proposed to apply a similar po licy for the MA program. Specifi cally, we proposed that if the proportion of MA-EPs of a qualifying MA organizat ion did not meet the 75 percent threshold (as determined in proposed \u00a7495.211(d)(2)) in 2018 and s ubsequent years, the percentage reduction could increase to 4 percent in 2018, and 5 percen t in 2019 and subsequent years. We did not propose a possible 2 percent re duction for 2015 (consistent with the Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program when an EP is subject to an adjustment in 2014 under the e-prescribing program), because MA organizations are not in dependently subject to e-prescribing payment adjustments. We proposed that the Medicare Physician E xpenditure Proportion for a year would be the Secretary's estimate of expenditu res under Parts A and B not attri butable to Part C that are attributable to expenditures fo r physician services. While we proposed a uniform portion for all MA organizations, we also proposed to adjust the proportion on a more individual basis to account for the fact that qualifyi ng MA organizations may contract with a large number of EPs that are neither qualifying nor potentially qualifying. We explaine d that this individualized policy was based on the statutory la nguage in section 1853(l)(1) of th e Act, which states that the provisions of section 1848(a)(7) of the Act (that is, the payment adjustments) apply \"with respect to\" the EPs \"described in paragra ph (2)\" of section 1853(l) of the Act. As section 1853(l)(2) of the Act creates several additional requirements for MA-EPs (that is, that they be employed by the qualifying MA organization, that they meet the 80/80/20 requirements, and so on), we proposed 513 adjusting the Physician Expenditure Proportion to recognize that many EPs may not qualify as MA-EPs, regardless of meaningful use. Thus, we proposed to adjust each MA organization's Physician Expenditure Proportion to recognize that not all of the EPs woul d meet the technical (nonmeaningful use) requirements to be potenti ally qualifying or qualifying MA-EPs. Without our proposed adjustment, a small sample size of MA-EPs could magnify the reduction amount during the payment adjustment phase of the program, because the actions of a limited set of qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs (and whether they meaningfully used certified EHR technology) would determine whether all of an MA organization's physician expenditure proportion was reduced. We provided an example of our proposed MA payment adjustment for adjustment year 2015 as follows: Assume the hypothetical Medicare Physic ian Expenditure Proportion, adjusted as described previously, is 10 percent for 2015; The qualifying MA organization's percent of qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs that are not meaningful users is 15 percent for 2015; and The monthly payment in 2015 for the given qualifying MA organization is $10,000,000. The proposed formula would read as follows: 0.01 (the payment adjustment for 20 15) X 0.1 (the hypothetical Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion) X 0.15 (the percentage of qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-EPs that are not meaningf ul EHR users) X $10,000,000 (monthly Part C payment) X 12 (number of months in th e MA payment year) = $18,000 for the entire year, or $1,500 a month. We proposed that th is adjustment would then be collected 514 against one or more of the qualifying MA organization's payments under section 1853(a)(1)(A) of the Act. In proposed \u00a7495.211(e), we set out a form ula for payment adjustments based on potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users of certified EHR technology. We proposed an adjustment equa l to the product of the following: Monthly Part C payment for the payment adjustment year; The percentage point reduction that appl ies to FFS hospitals as a result of section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Act; The Medicare hospital expenditure proporti on, adjusted in the same manner as the Physician Expenditure Proportion to recognize that not all hospitals are necessarily qualifying or potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals; and The percentage of qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals of a given qualifying MA organization that ar e not meaningful users of certified EHR technology. We proposed that the percentage point reducti on of the first bullet (t hat is, the reduction that applies as a result of sect ion 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) of the Ac t) would be based on the point reduction that results when three- fourths of the otherwise applicab le percentage increase for the fiscal year was reduced by 33 1/3 percent for FY 2015, 66 2/3 percent for FY 2016, and 100 percent for FY 2017 and subseque nt fiscal years. We stated this had the resu lt of decreasing the otherwise applicable market basket update by one-fourth (for 2015), one-half (for 2016), and three-fourths (for 2017 and subsequent payment adjustment years). 515 We stated that the Medicare Hospital Expenditure Proportion for a year was the Secretary's estimate of expenditure s under Medicare Parts A and B th at were not attributable to Part C, that were attributable to expenditure s for inpatient hospital services. As mentioned previously, we proposed that this proportion re flects only the MA-affilia ted eligible hospitals that were either qualifying or potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals. We also proposed to use the market basket percentage increase that would otherwise apply to \"subsection (d)\" hospitals for an MA payment adjustment year. We provided the following hypothetical example. The market ba sket percentage incr ease for FY 2015 was hypothetically 4 percent. Three-quarters of one-t hird of 4 percent would be 1 percent. The hypothetical Medicare Hospital Expe nditure proportion for the year was 15 percent, and one of two of the relevant MA-affiliated eligible hosp itals was not a meaningful EHR user for the applicable period (FY 2015). The monthly pa yment to the MA organization in 2015 was $10,000,000 a month. The calculation would be as follows: 0.01 (the market basket percentage point reduction) X 0.15 (the Medicare Hospital Expenditure Proportion) X 0.5 (perce nt of the qualifying MA organization's qualifying and potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are not meaningful users) X $10,000,000 (m onthly Part C payment) X 12 (number of months in the MA payment year) = $90,000 for the year, or $7,500 a month. The payment adjustment would be applied on either a monthl y basis, or in one ad justment. As stated previously, we requested comment on this aspect of the final rule. Comment : A commenter stated that the formul a for computing the Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion percent in \u00a7495.211(d)(3)(ii) was not cl ear on whether physicians who 516 saw no Medicare patient at all would be exclude d from the expenditure proportion calculation (for example, most pediatricians), and whether a distinction would be made between services provided by MA-EPs and potential MA-EPs of the organization, and other physicians and the services they provide. The co mmenter explained that under the model of reimbursement for physician services it uses, the abili ty to track Part A and Part B costs to indi vidual physicians was limited. The commenter proposed an alternate method for computing the Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion based on what it called a \"uniform distribution model as a proxy for the adjustment to the MPEP percent.\" Response : We believe it is unnecessary to sp ecifically exclude physicians, such as pediatricians, who see no Medicare patients fr om the Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion calculation. Expenditures that are provided by EPs that are ne ither qualifying nor potentially qualifying MA-EPs are already adjusted out. This would be true in two ways for physicians, such as pediatricians, who see no Medicare patien ts. First, these physicia ns would not meet item (2) of the definition of a \" qualifying MA-EP\" in \u00a7495.200, since th ese physicians do not provide \"at least 80 percent\" of their Medicare-covered professional services to enrollees of the qualifying MA organization. Sinc e they provide no Medicare-cove red professional services to enrollees of the qualifying MA organization, they do not meet the \"80 percent\" requirement. Second, the Physician Expenditure Proportion is based only on Medica re expenditures for physician services (that is, the proportion of expe nditures under Parts A and B not attributable to Part C that are attributable to expenditures for physician's services). Physician expenditures for non-Medicare services (like most services of a pe diatrician) do not count in the calculation. Finally, we do not believe an alternative me thod of computing the Medicare Physician Expenditure Proportion is necessary and therefore are not consid ering the alternate approach 517 proposed by this commenter in this final rule. It should be noted that tracking Part B costs to individual MA-EPs (physicians) is a critical part of determin ing the incentive payment due a qualifying MA organization (see 42 CFR 495.204(ff)). To the extent methodologies for estimating the portion of MA-EP comp ensation that is attributable to Part B professional services are used during the payment phase of the MA EHR Incentive Program, we believe these methodologies can also be successfully used during the adjustment phase of the Program. Comment : A commenter questioned if section 3401 of the Affordable Care Act market basket update adjustment due to changes in economy-wide productivity for FY 2012 and each subsequent fiscal year would be included, or if any other adjustment would be included in the market basket update rate used in the penalty adjustment formula. Response : Section 1853(m)(4)(B)(i) of the Act directs us to use the \"number of the percentage point reduction effected under sec tion 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix)(I) fo r the period.\" That reduction is based off of a starting point of the applicable percenta ge increase otherwise applicable under clause (i), wh ile mandating that this be \"deter mined without regard to clause (viii), (xi) or (xii)\" of section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. T hus, the starting point for determining the percentage points by which the update is re duced is the applicable percentage increase in clause (i) of section 1886(b)(3)(B) of Act, before it has been further reduced for productivity (under clause (xi) for other statut ory reductions (in clause (xii)), or for failure to report on certain measures (under clause (viii)). Currently, the appli cable percentage increase in clause (i), before the other reductions have been made, is the market basket percentage increase for hospitals in all areas. Thus, such a market basket increase will be our starting point, a nd the percentage points by which that increase is reduced solely due to the application of EHR Program adjustments will be the point reduction we use in the MA formula. 518 Comment : A commenter proposed an alternat e method for computing the Medicare Hospital Expenditure Proportion based on what they believe is \"consistent with fee-for-service hospital penalties.\" Response : We believe our proposed method is consistent with the method the Medicare fee-for-service program will use to implement EH R adjustments for \"subsection (d)\" hospitals. Comment : One commenter expressed concern that CMS had proposed that payment adjustments would be based on an earlier payment period. Response : We believe the commenter is confus ed, as we did not propose a prior EHR reporting period for the MA program. We received no other comments on this section of the proposed rule. After consideration of the public comments received, we are finalizing these provisions as proposed with the one modification noted to \u00a7495.211(c). 6. Reconsideration Proce ss for MA Organizations We proposed a reconsideration process in new section, \u00a7495.213. We did not receive any comments on the proposed process. However, for the reasons stated in secti on II.D.5 of this final rule, we do not believe formal regulations for an informal reconsideration procedural rule are necessary and therefore we are not includi ng this new section in this final rule. As noted in the proposed rule and as required by statute, our administrative reconsideration process would not permit administrative review of the standards and methods used to determine eligibility and payment (see sections 1853(l)(8) and (m)(6) of the Act, and \u00a7495.212 of the regulations). However, it would a llow a reconsideration of the application of such standards and methods, in certain circumstances. 519 F. Revisions and Clarifications to the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Unless otherwise specified, the changes discusse d in this section of the rule will take effect upon publication of this final rule. 1. Net Average Allowable Costs In this final rule, we are formalizing th rough rulemaking the guida nce that was shared with state Medicaid Directors in a letter on April 8, 2011 (available at: http://www.cms.gov/smdl/downloads/SMD11002.pdf ). These technical changes are required to implement section 205(e) of the Medicare and Me dicaid Extenders Act of 2010 (Extenders Act, Pub. L. 111-309). The Extenders Act, enact ed on December 15, 2010, amended sections 1903(t)(3)(E) and 1903(t)(6)(B) of the Act. The amended sections change the requirements for an EP to demonstrate the \"net average allowable costs,\" the contributions from other sources, and the 15 percent provider contributi on requirements to participate in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Payment Program. The Extenders Act provided that an EP has met this responsibility, as long as the incentive payment is not in excess of 85 percent of the net average allowable cost ($21,250 for first year payments). Before the Extenders Act, Medicaid EPs who wanted to participate in the EHR Incentive Payment Program were required to provide docum entation of certain costs related to acquiring and implementing certified EHR technology. The Ex tenders Act amended the relevant statute by allowing for providers to simply document and attest that they have adopted, implemented, upgraded, or meaningfully used certified EHR te chnology, while allowing us to set these average costs. As a result, rather than requiring each EP to calculate the payments received from outside sources, each will use the average costs and contribution amount we established. After 520 conducting a meta-analysis of existing data of an EP's costs to adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology, we determined that aver age contributions from outside sources should not exceed $29,000. The documentation originally required by an EP to demonstrate that he or she contributed 15 percent (for example, $3,750 for y ear 1) of the \"net average allowable costs\" is also no longer needed. The Act now provides that an EP has met this responsibility as long as the incentive payment is not in excess of 85 pe rcent of the net average allowable cost ($21,250). Given that this change is alrea dy in effect, we proposed to rem ove from the required content in the state Medicaid HIT Plan, the requirement that states describe the process in place to ensure that Medicaid EHR incentive payments are not paid at amounts higher than 85 percent of the net average allowable cost of certified EHR technology, as described in \u00a7495.332. We received no comments on our proposal to c odify this already-existing policy, and we are finalizing our propos als without modification. TABLE E1: DETERMINATION OF NET AVERAGE A LLOWABLE COSTS FOR THE FIRST PAYMENT YEAR First Year Variables1 Amounts Prior to Extenders Act Changes Currently Average Allowable Costs $54,000 Determined through a CMS meta-ana lysis, described in both the proposed rule (75 FR 1844) and the final rule (75 FR 44314). No change. Contributions from Other Sources Does not exceed $29,000 Subtracted from Average Allowable Costs to reach \"Net\" Average Allowable Cost s. An EP was required to show documentation of all contributions from certain other sources. No documentation is needed. We have determined that average contributions do not exceed $29,000. Capped Amount of \"Net\" Average Allowable Costs $25,000 Capped by statute and designated in CMS final rule. No change. Contribution from the EP $3,750 An EP was required to dem onstrate that he or she had contributed at least 15 percent of the net average allowable costs towards a certified EHR. No documentation needed. Determined to have been met by virtue of EP receiving no more than $21,250 in the first payment year. Incentive payment2 $21,250 85 percent of the Net Average Allowable Costs; determined through statute. An EP could receive less than this amount if he or she had contributions from other sources exceeding $29,000. All EPs will receive the maximum incentive payment of $21,250, as all EPs will be determined to have contributions from other sources under $29,000. 1.These same concepts (but not figures) apply to the second throu gh sixth years, integrating the fi gures from the Stage1final rul e. Ultimately, the incentive paid in the second through sixth year s is still the statutory maximum of $8,500. 2.This figure is further reduced to two-thirds for pediatricians qualifying with reduced Medicaid patient volumes. This is descr ibed at 42 CFR 495.310. 521 2. Definition of Adopt, Implement Upgrade We are adding clarifying language that mainta ins our policy that to qualify for an AIU payment, a provider must adopt, implement or upgrade to certified EHR technology that would allow that provider to qualify as a meaningful user. Our regula tion has always defined certified EHR technology by reference to the ONC defini tion at 45 CFR 170.102, and ONC's definition of certified EHR technology has cons istently required the technology to support meaningful use. While ONC is changing the definition of cer tified EHR technology, we do not believe this change would allow a provider to receive an incentive for technology that could not support meaningful use (that is for pur chasing only \"Base EHR\" technology). Nevertheless, in order to be absolutely clear in our regul ations, we are amending them to ensure that providers do not receive Medicaid incentives for adopting technology that would not allow them to demonstrate meaningful use. 3. Eligibility Requirements for Children's Hospitals We proposed to revise the definition of a children's hospital in \u00a7495.302 to also include any separately certified hospital, either freestanding or hospital within hospital that predominately treats individuals under 21 years of age; and does not ha ve a CMS certification number (CCN) because they do not serve any Medi care beneficiaries but has been provided an alternative number by CMS for purposes of enroll ment in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. We will provide future guidance on how to obtain these alternative numbers. The only comments we received on this proposa l were favorable. We are finalizing these policies as proposed. Guidance to these hospitals and the states on enumeration and determining eligibility is also forthcoming. 522 4. Medicaid Professiona ls Program Eligibility Section 1903(t) of the Act au thorizes Medicaid payments to encourage the adoption and use of certified EHR technol ogy, and places Medicaid patient volume requirements on EPs to qualify for such payments under th e Medicaid program. Patient vol ume requirements ensure that Medicaid funding is used to encourage the adopti on and use of technology specifically to benefit the care of Medicaid populations . Therefore, we proposed that at least one of the clinical locations used for the calcula tion of an EP's patient volume have CEHRT during the payment year for which the EP is attesting to adoption, implementation or upgrade or meaningful use. This will ensure that Medicaid funding goes to EP s using CEHRT to improve Medicaid patients' care. The only comments that we received on this pr oposal were in support of the proposal. For the reasons explained in the proposed rule, we are finalizing this policy as proposed. We have amended \u00a7495.304 and \u00a7495.332 accordingly. a. Calculating Patient Volume Requirements We proposed to revise \u00a7495.306 (c) to allow states the option for their providers to calculate total Medicaid encount ers or total needy individual patient encounters in any representative, continuous 90-day period in the 12 months preceding the EP or eligible hospital's attestation. This option will be in addition to the current regulatory language that bases patient volume on the prior calendar or fiscal year. We believe this adjustment will provide greater flexibility in eligible providers' patient volume calculations. Likewise, we proposed to revise \u00a7495.306(d)(1)( i)(A) to allow for th e calculation of the total Medicaid patients assigne d to the EP's panel in any re presentative, continuous 90-day period in either the preceding calendar year, as is currently permitted, or in the 12 months 523 preceding the EPs' attestation, when at least one Medicaid encounter took place with the Medicaid patient in the 24 months prior to th e beginning of the 90-day period. We also proposed to revise \u00a7495.306 (d)(1)(ii)(A) accordingly, so th at the numerator and denominator are using equivalent periods. We proposed conforming ch anges to \u00a7495.306(d)(2)(i) and (ii) for needy individual patient volume. We proposed changi ng the period during which the encounter must take place from 12 months to 24 months to account for new clinical guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Health Services Task Force that al low greater spacing between some wellness visits. Therefore, in order for a patient to be consid ered \"active\" on a provide r's panel, we proposed 24 months is more appropriate. This change is also in order to be consistent with the proposed Stage 2 meaningful use measure for patient reminders sent to \"active patients.\" The only comments we received on this propo sal were supportive. For the reasons explained in the proposed rule, we are finalizi ng this policy as proposed. We note that as explained in the proposed rule, this will be an op tion for states to implement at their discretion. States must seek prior approval from CMS via an amendment to their state Medicaid HIT Plan before implementing this change. We also proposed to expand the definition of \"encounter\" to include any service rendered on any one day to an individual enrolled in a Me dicaid program. We explained that such a definition will ensure that patients enrolled in a Medicaid program are counted, even if the Medicaid program did not pay for the service (because, for example, a third party payer paid for the item or service, or the service is not cove red under Medicaid). We also explained that the definition would include encounters for patients who are Title XIX eligible and who meet the definition of \"optional targeted low income child ren\" under section 1905(u)(2 ) of the Act. Thus, individuals in Title XXI-funded Me dicaid expansions (but not sepa rate CHIPs) could be counted 524 in providers' patient volume calculations. We stated that this approach is consistent with existing policies that provide Title XIX protections to children enroll ed in Title XXI-funded Medicaid expansions. In the proposed rule, we noted that as of 2010, 33 states have Title XXI Medicaid expansions via approved state plan amendm ents. Therefore, under our proposed policy, providers in those states would be able to include encounters w ith individuals in such expansions in their patient volume calculation for purposes of this program. In 2010, over 2.1 million children were covered in Medica id expansion programs. We stated that our proposed change would likely increase the number of eligible providers who qualify for the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, particularly those serving childr en because it allows states to create a larger base of Medicaid patients to be counted towa rd the patient volume re quirements than existed under the Stage 1 rule. Comment : Some commenters were concerne d about verifying patient volume requirements for patients seen for a service where Medicaid did not pay for all or part of the service. Commenters asked CMS to clarify the prep ayment audit expectations of states with this broader definition. Response : This final rule does not change states' obligations to complete due diligence to verify all eligibility criteria, including patie nt volume. Existing s ubregulatory guidance is available to states to assist in developing audit processes. We en courage states to take advantage of those materials, guidance, a nd technical assistance resources th at we have made available to support their auditing activities. Comment : Commenters, while supportive of th ese changes, inquired whether these changes would be retroactive and affect payments already disbursed. They asked, for example, 525 whether EPs who attested to Medicare for CY 20 11 would be able to refund Medicare incentive payments and qualify for the Medicaid payment; or whether pediatricians who received the incentive for a patient volume of 20 percent w ould be able to receiv e a replacement payment associated with the 30 percent patient volume. Response : These changes are not retroactive. Patient volume requirements for 2011 and 2012 are not affected by these changes. Eligibilit y for the program is determined at the time of attestation and prior to payment. States should implement this new definition of an encounter no later than 6 months after this rule is published and only for providers attesting for the 2013 program year and subsequent program years. In no event will this definiti on apply to attestations for the 2012 program year. Comment : Commenters also inquired whether these new eligibility changes meant that an EP or eligible hospital denied an incentive payment because of failure to satisfy patient volume requirements could reapply in the same program year. Response : As explained in our response to th e previous comment, these changes would not be retroactive. Existing rules permit an EP or eligible hospital to reapply if they fail to meet the requirements for an incentive payment. If a provider fails to meet the requirements in 2013 before their state has implemented this change, they may then reapply after the change is made to their state's systems. Additionally, an EP or eligib le hospital denied eligibility in a previous year is always permitted to reapply for a subsequent year (subject to rules for EPs switching programs as explained in \u00a7495.10). For the reasons explained in the proposed ru le, and because this change will help more Medicaid providers qualify for the program, we are finalizing this policy as proposed. The expanded definition of encounter will include individuals enrolled in Medicaid who had a 526 billable service on any one day during the 90-day patient volume timeframe. In our proposed rule, we also clarified that we understand that multiple providers may submit an encounter for the same individual. Fo r example, it may be common for a PA or NP to provide care to a patient, then a physician to also see, or invoice fo r services to that patient. We explained that it is acceptable in these and sim ilar circumstances to count the same encounter for multiple providers for purposes of calculating each provider's patient volume when the encounters take place within th e scope of practice. We did not receive any comments on this clarification and retain it for the final rule. b. Practices Predominantly Similar to our proposed revisions for patient volume, we proposed to revise the definition of \"practices predominantly\" at \u00a7495.302 in orde r to provide more flexibility for eligible professionals and states. A stat e could choose to allow EPs to us e either: (1) the most recent calendar year; or (2) the most recen t 12 months prior to attestation. Also, as with the previously noted patient volume changes, th ese \"practices predominantly\" ch anges are not retroactive. Patient volume requirements for 2011 and 2012 are not affected by these changes. States should implement this new definition of an encounter no later than 6 months afte r this rule is published and only for providers attesting to meeting pr ogram requirements for the 2013 program year and subsequent program years. In no event will th is definition apply to attestations for the 2012 program year. Comment : Some commenters -- commenting on the patient volume changes in \u00a7495.306, the \"practice predominantly\" changes in \u00a7495.302, and the revised definition of encounter -- expressed concerns about the system challenges associated with such changes. They requested that CMS consider the burden on state systems to implement these changes. 527 Response : We recognize that syst em changes must be considered when enacting or revising policies. However, we note that much of what we have proposed would be optional for states, while some would be re quired. We believe our final rule strikes a balance between optional and required policies for states, and pr oviding 6 months to make systems changes balances implementation timelines with the ove rall goal to promote EHR adoption through the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program. We note that states receive 90 pe rcent Federal matching funds for administrative co sts associated with th e EHR Incentive Program. Comment : Although we did not make any propos als on the subject, some commenters requested a more prescriptive defi nition of pediatrician be provid ed to the states that includes pediatric ophthalmologists. Response : We did not make any proposals on the de finition of pediatrician. This final rule does not change the previous fl exibility that states had to define pediatrician. In some states, pediatric ophthalmologists are elig ible for the program, but that is entirely dependent on how the state has chosen to define pediatrician. This suggestion is also outsi de the scope of this rulemaking. After consideration of th e public comments received, we are finalizing the revised definition of \"practices predominantly\" at \u00a7495.302 as proposed; this revised definition is applicable to providers attesting to meeting program requirements for the 2013 program year and subsequent program years. 5. Medicaid Hospital Incentive Payment Calculation a. Discharge Related Amount In order to ensure that Medicaid regu lations are consistent with Medicare, we proposed that the Medicaid calculation should be consistent with the Medicare calculation found 528 in \u00a7495.104(c)(2). Our current regulations at \u00a7495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) requi re the use of the \"12-month period selected by the state, but ending in the Federal fiscal year before the hospital's fiscal year that serves as the first payment year.\" We also published a tip sheet with additional guidance on the Medicaid hospita l incentive payment calculati on, which can be found at: (https://www.cms.gov/MLNProducts/downloads/M edicaid_Hosp_Incentive_Payments_Tip_She ets.pdf ). However, some hospitals may not have a full 12 months of data ending with the Federal fiscal year immediately preceding the first payment year, or they may have a slightly older 12-month period that could be used. Theref ore, we have revised our regulations at \u00a7495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) to allow states to use, for the purpose of cal culating the discharge related amount, and other determinations (such as inpatient bed days) , the most recent continuous 12-month period for which data are available prior to the payment year. If such 12-month period is a cost report, it should be one, single 12-mont h cost reporting period (a nd not a consolidation of two separate cost reporting periods). If it is an alternative source different from the cost report, we will rely on the state to ensure that the source is an appropriate source, and that the period is a continuous 12 months, and that the st ate is using the most recent data that are available. States should implement these change s only for hospitals that begin participation in the program starting in federal fis cal year 2013 or subsequent federal fiscal years. Hospitals that began participation before federal fiscal year 2013 must use discharge data from the hospital fiscal year that ends during the federal fiscal year prior to the hospital fiscal year that serves as the first payment year. Comment : Commenters were concerned that hospitals may not have a full 12 months of data available ending with the Federal fiscal y ear immediately preceding the first payment year, thus restricting hospitals pa rticipation in the program. 529 Response : We appreciate the commenters concer n; however, the change in regulatory language does not require hospitals to use data immediately preceding the first payment year, but rather the most recent 12 consecutive months of data available to the hospital prior to the payment year. The intent of this regulatory chan ge was to encourage timely participation in the program. For the base year, the former policy requi red hospitals to initiate participation using a 12-month period ending in the Federal fiscal year before the hospital's fiscal year that serves as the first payment year. In recognition of this challenge, we are changing the regulation at \u00a7495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) to allow hospitals to use, for purposes of determining the base year for the Medicaid incentive payment calcu lation, the most recent conti nuous 12-month period for which data are available prior to the payment year. On ly those hospitals that begin participation in program year 2013 and beyond will be affected by this change. Hospitals that began participation in the program before 2013 will not have to adjust previous calculations. Comment : A commenter suggested that \"the most recent data that are available\" is ambiguous. Hospital cost report da ta are subject to significant a udit and adjustments subsequent to their submission to the state, so the defini tion of \"available\" ha s a large impact on the reliability of the data used to calculate the incentive payment amount. The commenter noted that the state and CMS have a strong interest in ensuri ng that the data used to calculate the hospital incentive payment is accurate, defensible, and fi nal, and the use of data that are not properly audited would create a significant potential for is suing incentive payments that would later need to be adjusted. The commenter suggested that CMS clarify \"the most recent data that are available\" means the most recent data that, in the judgment of the state, are properly audited and finalized. Response : We appreciate the commenters concer n; however, we do not agree that the 530 data needs to be audited and finalized in order to be used for the incentive payment calculation. It is our expectation that the hospital incentive payment is calc ulated using the most accurate data available at the time of cal culation and it is the responsibility of the state to make the determination of which source is most accurate. We do not restrict data sources, as we believe the states are best positioned to balance the accuracy and timelin ess of the data available. Medicare pays hospitals using pr eliminary, filed, cost report da ta and reconciles payment when the data is audited and finalized. Similarly, we a llow states to adjust calculations and reconcile payments when audited and finalized data are available. State polic y changes or proposals regarding reconciliation of hospita l incentive payments must be refl ected in the state' Medicaid Health Information Technology Plan (SMHP) a nd must be reviewed and approved by CMS. b. Acute Care Inpatient Bed Da ys and Discharges for the Medi caid Share and Discharge-Related Amount In order to ensure that the regulations accu rately reflect our current policy, we proposed to amend the hospital payment regulations at \u00a749 5.310(g)(1)(i)(B) and (g)(2) to recognize that only acute-care discharges and bed- days are included in our calcul ations. We currently require that only discharges from the acute care part of the hospital may be counted in both the discharge-related amount and the Medicaid share. For example, in response to a frequently asked question ( https://questions.cms.gov , FAQ #2991), we explained that nursery days and nursery discharges (for newborns) could not be counted in both the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs. We stated: \"[N]ursery days and discharges are no t included in inpatient bed-day or discharge counts in calculating hospita l incentives. . . because they are not considered acute inpatient services based on the level of care provided during a normal nursery stay.\" Such regulatory amendments do not represent a change in policy but rather a clarification 531 of existing policy. The Medicaid share will count only those days that will count as inpatient-bed days for Medicare purposes under section 1886(n)(2)(D ) of the Act. (See 75 FR 44498). In addition, in determining the overall EHR amount, section 1903(t)(5)(B) of the Act requires the use of applicable amounts spec ified in section 1886(n) (2)(A) of the Act. Comment : A commenter expressed concern with the perceived removal of newborn nursery days from the hospital calculation. Th e commenter stated that this would create a disadvantage for some hospitals. Response : We wish to be clear our policy on nursery days is not a new policy or a proposed change. The change in regulatory langua ge on the use of acute inpatient bed days is to ensure that our regulation text clearly reflects our ex isting policy. The requi rement to exclude non-acute inpatient bed days from the incentive payment calculation is consistent with both the Medicare and Medicaid regulations under Stage 1, as stated in our frequently asked questions (available at https://questions.cms.gov , FAQ# 2991). In that FAQ, we explain that the Medicaid payment to hospitals is based largely on the met hod that applies to Medicare incentive payments. Because such nursery discharges and bed days would not be included in the Medicare calculation, and because the Medicaid statute incor porates Medicare concepts, they also would not be counted in the Medicaid formula. We are simply adding additional language to clarify that all bed days and discharges used in the calc ulation are strictly limite d to the acute-inpatient portion of the hospital. All hospitals will contin ue to exclude nonacute bed days and discharges from the hospital incentive calculation. Comment : A commenter suggested that CMS clarif y and inform states and providers that neonatal intensive care days are considered acu te, and should be included in the Medicaid hospital incentive payment calculation. 532 Response : We appreciate the commenter's s uggestion and recognize that neonatal intensive care days are considered acute inpatient servic es that should be in cluded in the hospital incentive calculation. c. Hospitals Switching States There may be a situation where a hospital ch anges participation in one state Medicaid EHR incentive program to participation in another st ate. We are clarifying that in no case will a hospital receive more than the aggregate incentive amount calcula ted by the state from which the hospital initiated partic ipation in the program. Section 495.3 10(e) requires a hospital to choose only one state per payment year from which to receive an incentive payment. Additionally, \u00a7495.310(f)(2) states that in no case can total incentives received by a hospital exceed the aggregate EHR incentive amount, as calculated in \u00a7495.310(g). In this scenario, both states will be required to work together to determine the remaining payments due to the hospital based on the aggregate incen tive amount and incentive amounts already paid. The hospital will then assume the second state's payment cycle, less the money paid from the first state. St ates should consult with CMS before addressing this specific scenario. We did not receive any commen ts and we are finalizing these provisions as proposed for the reasons provided in the proposed rule. 6. Hospital Demonstrations of Mean ingful Use - Auditing and Appeals We proposed revisions to \u00a7495.312 under which st ates would have the option for CMS to conduct audits and handle any subsequent appeals of whether eligible hos pitals are meaningful EHR users, on the state's behalf. (We note th at the preamble text (at 77 FR 13788) did not reflect the proposed regulations.) We also pr oposed revisions to the SMHP requirements in 533 \u00a7495.332 by adding a new paragraph (g) that would al low the state, at the state's option, to include a signed agreement if the state has opted for CMS to conduct such audits and appeals. Under these proposals, the state electing the option would be requi red to (1) designate CMS to conduct all audits and appeals of eligible hospitals' meaningful use attest ations; (2) be bound by the audit and appeal findings; (3) perform any necessary recoup ments arising from the audits; and (4) be liable for any FFP granted the state to pay eligible hospitals that, upon audit (and any subsequent appeal) are determined not to have been meaningful EHR users. Finally, we proposed to revise our regulati ons at \u00a7495.370 to make clear that results of any adverse CMS audits (for states that have made the election) would be subject to the CMS administrative appeals process and not the state appeals process. Most hospitals are eligible for both Medica re and Medicaid incentive payments, submit attestations on meaningful use to us under the Medicare attest ation system, and, if successful, under the authority of sec tion 1903(t)(8) of the Act, are deemed to have met the meaningful use requirements for Medicaid. Thus, we believe th e revisions that were included in our proposed regulation text would provide states with the option to alleviate th eir burden to develop an audit process for hospitals and then perform audits on hospitals' meaningful use attestations. Because the regulation text made the CMS audits and ap peals a state option, no stat e would be required to delegate the respons ibility to CMS. As discussed in the proposed rule preamble, ma ny states indicated an interest in having CMS audit all hospitals' meaningful use attestations, and a majority of states have two or fewer Medicaid-only hospitals applying for incentive payments. Therefore, a state option for CMS to conduct audits and appeals will leverage the resources already devoted to auditing the vast majority of hospitals that are eligible for both incentive programs while retaining state flexibility 534 to perform their own meaningful use audits and a ppeals for the Medicaid-only hospitals in states that choose to do so. (In cases where a state has made the election, meaningful use attestation data collected by states for the Medicaid-only eligible hospitals woul d be shared with our auditors to enable this process). As discussed in the proposed rule, we note th at this policy does not extend to Medicaid eligible professionals, given the anticipated larg e number of Medicaid eligible professionals demonstrating meaningful use solely under the Medi caid program. In addition, states that opt for CMS to conduct audits and appeals will remain responsible for auditing all other aspects of eligibility for both EPs and elig ible hospitals for incentive payments, including, but not limited to-- (1) adopt, implement or upgrade; (2) pati ent volume; (3) average stay length; and (4) calculation of payment amounts. States will al so remain responsible for auditing EPs for compliance with meaningful use of certified EHR technology. We did not receive any comments on either the preamble or the regulation text, and we are finalizing the proposed regulations for th e reasons discussed previously. 7. State Flexibility for Stage 2 of Meaningful Use We proposed to offer states flexibility with th e public health measur es in Stage 2, similar to that of Stage 1, subject to the same conditions and standards as the St age 1 flexibility policy. This applies to the public health measures as well as the measure to generate lists of specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reducti on of disparities, research or outreach. In addition, we proposed that whethe r moved to the core or left in the menu, states could also specify the means of transmission of the data or otherwise change the public health measure, as long as it does not require EH R functionality above and beyond that which is included in the ONC EHR certification criteria as fina lized for Stage 2 of meaningful use. 535 We did not receive any comments on this policy. Although \u00a7495.316(d)(2) already contains provisions for state flexibility, there are new public health measure for Stage 2 of meaningful use and some of the de scriptions are changing slightly fo r Stage 2. Therefore, in this final rule, we have amended \u00a7 495.316(d)(2) to ensu re that the objectives for which states will have flexibility are adequately represen ted for both Stage 1 and Stage 2. 8. State Medicaid Health Information Technol ogy Plan (SMHP) and Implementation Advance Planning Document (IAPD) a. Frequency of Health Information Tec hnology (HIT) Implementation Advanced Planning Document (IAPD) Updates We proposed to revise \u00a7495.342 regarding the frequency of HIT IAPD updates. Rather than requiring each state to submit an annual HIT IAPD within 60 days from the HIT IAPD approved anniversary date, we propo sed to require that a state's annual IAPD (also known as an IAPD Update (IAPD-U)) be submitted a minimum of 12 months from the date of the last CMS approved HIT IAPD. For example, if the initial HIT IAPD or previous IAPD-U was approved by CMS effective July 25, 2011, th e state must submit their next HIT IAPD-U on or before July 25, 2012. Therefore, annual IAPD updates ar e required only if the state has not submitted an IAPD-U in the past 12 months, rather than on a fixed annual basis as currently reflected in \u00a7495.342. We did not propose to change the require ments of the circumstances of \"as needed\" IAPD updates as defined by \u00a7495.340. Comment : Comments received on the change to the annual HIT IAPD submission deadline requirements were supportive of the ch ange and the idea of re ducing the administrative burden on states. A commenter requested that th e phrase, \"minimum of 12 months\" be changed to \"maximum of 12 months.\" 536 Response : We believe that a better solution w ould be to remove the word \"minimum\" from the text so it reads, \"Each state is re quired to submit the HIT IAPD Updates 12 months from the date of the last CMS approved HIT IAPD and must contain the following.\" This more accurately describes the intent to clarify the timeline in which the state must submit the annual HIT IAPD. Therefore, \u00a7 495.342 is revised accordingly. b. Requirements of States Tr ansitioning from HIT Planning Advanced Planning Documents (P-APDs) to HIT IAPDs We proposed the following process for states that have an approved HIT P-APD and are ready to submit a HIT IAPD for review and approval. We do not allow states to have more than one HIT Advance Planning Document (APD) open at a time. If planning activities from the HIT P-APD have been completed, in their HIT IAPD th e state should explain in a narrative format that all planning activities have been complete d and the planning advanced planning document can be closed out. If there are HIT planning activities that the state determines will continue during the implementation period, thes e planning activities must be in cluded as line items within the HIT IAPD budget. We did not receive any comments on this discussion of the pro cess states should use. We will use the previously-described process for st ates transitioning from a HIT P-APD to a HIT IAPD. 537 III. Waiver of Delayed Effective Date We ordinarily provide a 60-day delay in the e ffective date of the provisions of a major rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(d), which requires a 30-day delayed effectiv e date, and the Congressional Re view Act (5 U.S.C. 801(a)(3), which requires a 60-day delayed effective date fo r major rules. However, we can waive the delay in effective date if the Secretary finds, for good cause, that such delay is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and in corporates a statement of the finding and the reasons in the rule issued under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) and 5 U.S.C. 808(2). The Secretary finds that good cause exists to make certain regulatory provisions effective upon publication in the Federal Register . Our revisions to \u00a7495.6(f) and (g) change certa in criteria for meaningful use beginning with FY 2013. Some eligible hospitals and C AHs will begin their EHR reporting period using the criteria under \u00a7495.6(f) and (g) beginning Octobe r 1, 2012. All of thes e changes are optional and are meant to provide greater flexibility in meeting these criteria. Because these revisions relieve a restriction on eligible hos pitals and CAHs, a waiver of the delayed effective date is in order. It is both unnecessary to delay the effectiv e date, and in the public's best interest to waive the delay in effective date for these changes. Furthermore, ensuring that these provisions are effective beginning with FY 2013 would mitigate any disadvantage experienced by eligible hospitals and CAHs beginning thei r EHR reporting periods at the beginning of the fiscal year, because it would allow them to use these revised criteria at the beginning of such period. Our revisions to \u00a7495.6(f) include elimin ating the reporting of clinical quality measures as a separate objective of meaningful use and instead including this reporting requirement as part of the definition of \"meaningful EHR user\" under \u00a7495.4. Accordingly, the delayed effective date must 538 also be waived with regard to the defini tion of \"meaningful EHR user\" under \u00a7495.4 and the revisions to \u00a7495.8. To allow thes e provisions to take effect w ith the beginning of FY 2013, it is impracticable to delay the effective date, whic h would occur after the beginning of the fiscal year. We have also made a technical correction to \u00a7495.102(c) so that it correctly reflects the policy we adopted in the Stage 1 final rule fo r EPs who predominantly furnish services in a geographic HPSA. This change is technical in nature and merely codifies our existing policy. Retaining current regulatory language would allo w an error to persist. Therefore, it is unnecessary, impracticable, and contra ry to the public interest to de lay the effective date of this codification. We are also waiving the delay in effective da te for all of the changes we are making to subpart D of part 495. Some of these changes ei ther codify or more clearly specify already existing policy (deletions of \u00a7495.310(a)(1)(ii), \u00a7495.310(a)(2)(ii), and \u00a7495.332(d)(9) to reflect the existing policy on net average allowable cost under the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010; changes to \u00a7495.310(g) to clarify th at the rules are for \"acute-care inpatient discharges\" and \"acute care inpatient bed- days\"; changes to \u00a7495.310 to clarify policy on hospitals switching states). Therefore, it is unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest to delay the effective date of thes e provisions as they are already in effect as CMS policies. Others of these changes merely provide stat es or eligible providers with additional flexibility to adopt policies that will be of benefit to the stat es or providers, thus relieving a restriction (\u00a7495.302 change in definition for ch ildren's hospital and practices predominantly; \u00a7495.304 regarding allowing EPs and e ligible hospitals to include individuals enrolled in a 539 Medicaid program in 2013; changes to \u00a7495.306 rega rding additional flexibility for determining patient volume in 2013; changes to \u00a7 495.312 and \u00a7495.332(c) and (g) and \u00a7495.370 regarding additional options for states in conducting audits and appeals of eligible hospitals' meaningful use; and changes to \u00a7495.342 adding flexibil ity on submission of the HIT IAPD). These changes will be in the public interest of states or eligible providers or both, because they provide additional flexibility allowing states to relieve their burdens, or allowing additional providers to qualify for Medicaid incentiv es under the program. It is importa nt that these changes be in place as soon as possible, and especi ally as of October 1, 2012 for e ligible hospitals beginning their fiscal years. Therefore, a waiv er in the delay in the effectiv e date is both impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and the Secretary finds good cause not to delay the effective date of these provisions. The final change to subpart D (in \u00a7495.304( f) and \u00a7495.332(b)(6)) applies to EPs, who will not begin payment year 2013 until the beginning of the calendar year in any case. However, in the interest of ensuring that states have a reasonable opportun ity to amend their SMHPs and to ensure consistency in effective da te for the entire subpart it is in the public intere st to waive the delay in effective date for these changes as well. Again, the effect on EPs would not take place until January of 2013 in any case - well after a 60-day delay has occurred. For all these reasons, we believe that a 60- day delay in the effective date of the previously discussed provisions would be unnece ssary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest. Therefore, we find good cause for waivi ng the 60-day delay in the effective date for these provisions and making the provisions effective upon publication. 540 IV. Collection of Information Requirements Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, we are required to provi de 30-day notice in the Federal Register and solicit public comment before a co llection of information requirement is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval. In order to fairly evaluate whether an information collection should be approved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we solicit comment on the following issues: The need for the information collection and its usefulness in carrying out the proper functions of our agency. The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. Recommendations to minimize the inform ation collection burden on the affected public, including automate d collection techniques. The following is a discussion of the requireme nts we believe are subject to the PRA and collection of information requirements (ICRs) as a resu lt of this final rule. This analysis finalizes our projections which were proposed in the March 7, 2012 Federal Register (77 FR 13790 through 13800) in which we proposed a revision to the existing PRA package approved under OMB control number 0938-1158. The projected number s of EPs, eligible hospitals, CAHs, MA organizations, MA EPs, and MA-affiliated hospitals are based on the numbers used in the impact analysis assumptions as well as estimated federal costs and savings in sec tion V. of this final rule. The actual burden will remain constant for all of Stage 2 as EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will only need to attest that they have successfully demonstrated meaningful use one time per year. The only variable from year to year in Stage 2 will be the number of respondents, as 541 noted in the impact analysis assumptions. For th e purposes of this analysis, we are focusing only on 2014, the first year in which a provider may participate in Stage 2 of the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. We do not believe the bur den for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs participating in Stage 1 prior to 2014 will be different from the agency information collection activities (75 FR 65354) based on this final rule. Beginning in 2012, Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs have the option to electron ically report their clinical quality measures through the respective electronic repo rting pilots. The burden for the EP pilot is discussed in the CY 2012 Medicare PFS final rule with co mment period (76 FR 73450 through 73451). For eligible hospitals and CAHs, the burden is di scussed in the CY 2012 OPPS final rule with comment period (76 FR 74489 through 74492). A. ICR Regarding Demonstration of Meaningful Use Criteria (\u00a7495.6 and \u00a7495.8) In \u00a7495.6 of the proposed rule, we proposed that to successfully demonstrate meaningful use of CEHRT for Stage 2, an EP, eligible hos pital or CAH (collectively referred to as \"provider\" in this section) must attest, through a secure mechanism in a specified manner, to the following during the EHR reporting period: (1) the provider used CEHRT and specified the technology was used; and (2) the provider sati sfied each of the applicable objectives and associated measures in \u00a7495.6. In \u00a7495.8, we proposed that a provider must also successfully report the clinical quality measures selected by CMS to CMS or the states, as applicable. We assumed that the CEHRT adopted by the provid er would capture many of the objectives and associated measures and generate automated numerator and denominator information where required, or generate automated summary reports. We also e xpect that the provider would enable the functionality required to complete the objectives and associated measures that require the provider to attest that they have done so. 542 We proposed that EPs would be required to report on a total of 17 core objectives and associated measures, 3 of 5 menu set objectives and associated measures, and 12 ambulatory clinical quality measur es. We estimated the total average annual co st burden for all 198,912 nonhospital-based EPs who may attest in 2014 to be $186,098,885 (198,912 EPs x 10 hours 24 minutes x $89.96 (mean hourly rate for physic ians based on May 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS data)). We proposed that eligible hospitals and CAHs would be required to report on a total of 16 core objec tives and associated measures, 2 of the 4 menu set objectives and associated measures, and 24 clinical quality measures. We estimated the total annual cost burden for all eligible ho spitals and CAHs to attest to EH R technology, meaningful use core set and menu set criteria, and elec tronically submit the clinical quality measures would be $2,375,564 (4,993 eligible hospitals and C AHs \u00d7 $62.23 (12 hours 14 minutes \u00d7 $62.23 (mean hourly rate for lawyers based on May 2010 BLS) data)). Comment : A commenter suggested CMS account for website responsiveness when estimating the burden for providers as they enter attestation data. The co mmenter noted that the website would take several minutes after ente ring data until the next page would become available. Response : We cannot forecast technical difficulti es with our websites, but strive to maintain a high level of responsiveness. Comment : Some commenters suggested CMS undere stimated the amount of time it takes providers to attest that they ha ve successfully demonstrated mean ingful use. They noted that providers see attestation as more than just repor ting their data at the e nd of the reporting period, rather, a process that is con tinuously monitored throughout that time. Others noted that the operational burden that providers encounter on a per-patient basis will increase significantly in 543 Stage 2. Response : We appreciate the public comments on th is burden analysis. However, this analysis specifically reflects th e amount of time we estimate provi ders will take to prepare and report their meaningful use data through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs Registration and Attestation System. We cannot account for individual providers' workflows or training needs to participate in these programs. After consideration of th e public comments received, we are finalizing these burden estimates as proposed but have updated them to reflect policy changes implemented through this final rule. In this final there, there are 13 core objectiv es and up to 3 menu set objectives that will require an EP to enter numerators and denominat ors during attestation. Eligible hospitals and CAHs will have to attest they have met 10 core objectives and 3 menu set objectives that require numerators and denominators. For objectives and associated measures requiring a numerator and denominator, we limit our estimates to actions taken in the presence of CEHRT. We do not anticipate a provider will maintain two recor dkeeping systems when CEHRT is present. Therefore, we assume that all patient records that will be counted in the denominator will be kept using certified EHR technology. We expect it will ta ke an individual provid er or their designee approximately 10 minutes to attest to each meani ngful use objective and associated measure that requires a numerator and denominator to be generated, as well as each CQM for providers attesting in their first ye ar of the program. Additionally, providers will be required to re port they have completed objectives and associated measures that requir e a \"yes\" or \"no\" response during attestation. For EPs, there are 3 core objectives and up to 3 menu set objectives that will require a \"y es\" or \"no\" response 544 during attestation. For eligible hospitals and C AHs, there are 5 core objectives and that will require a \"yes\" or \"no\" response during attestation and no such menu set objectives. We expect that it will take a provider or th eir designee 1 minute to attest to each objective that requires a \"yes\" or \"no\" response. Providers will also be required to attest that they are protec ting electronic health information. We estimate completion of the analysis required to successfully meet the associated measure for this objective will take approximately 6 hours, which is identical to our estimate for the Stage 1 requirement. This burden estimat e assumes that covered entities are already conducting and reviewing these risk analyses under current HIPAA regulations. Therefore, we have not accounted for the additional burden asso ciated with the conduct or review of such analyses. Table 20 lists those objectives and associated measures for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs. We estimate the core set of objectives and associated measures will take an EP 8 hours and 13 minutes to complete, and will take an e ligible hospital or CAH 7 hours and 45 minutes to complete. For EPs, we estimate the comple tion of 3 menu set objectives and associated measures will take between 3 minutes and 30 minutes to complete, depending on the combination of objectives they choose to attest to. We estimate the selection, preparation, and electronic submission of the 9 am bulatory clinical quality meas ures will take EPs 1 hour and 30 minutes. We estimate it will take eligible hos pitals and CAHs 30 minutes to attest to the 3 menu set objectives they choose. For eligible hospitals and CAHs, we estimate the selection, preparation, and electronic submi ssion of 16 required clinical quali ty measures will take 2 hours and 40 minutes. 545 TABLE 20: BURDEN ESTIMATES Eligible Professionals Eligible Ho spitals and CAHs Stage 2 Measures Burden Estimate per Respondent (EPs) Burden Estimate per Respondent (Hospitals) CORE SET Use computerized provider order entry (CPOE) for medication, laboratory and radiology orders directly entered by any licensed healthcare professional who can enter orders into the medical record per state, local and professional guidelines.

We estimate that it will take no longer than 8 hours and 13 minutes to attest that during the EH R reporting period, they used the CEHRT, specify the EHR technology used, and satisfy ea ch of the applicable core objectives and associated measures. We estimate it will take an EP 30 minutes if they choose to submit the most burdensome objectives and associated measures from the menu set. If an EP chooses to attest to the least burdensome me nu set objectives and associated measures, we estimate this will take approximately 3 minutes. We also estimate that it will take an EP an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes to select, prepare, a nd electronically submit the ambulat ory clinical quality measures. The total burden hours for an EP to attest to the most burdensome criteria previously specified is 10 hours and 13 minutes. The total burden hours for an EP to attest to the least burdensome criteria previously specified is 9 hours and 46 minutes. We estimate that there could be approximately 537,600 nonhospital-based Medicare and Medicaid EPs in 2014. We anticipate approximately 37 percent (198,912) of these EPs may attest to the information previously specified (after registration a nd completion of Stage 1) in CY 2014 to receive an incentive payment. We estimate the burden for the approximately 13,000 MA EPs in the MAO burden section. We estimate the total burden associated with these requirements for an EP is 10 hours and 13 minutes (8 hours 13 minut es + 30 minutes + 1 hour 30 minutes). The total estimated annual cost burden for all EPs to attest to EH R technology, meaningful us e core set and most burdensome menu set criteria, and electronically submit the ambulator y clinical quality measures is $182,877,942(198,912 EPs x 10 hours 13 minutes x $89.96 (mean hourly rate for physicians based on May 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics (B LS) data)). We estimate the total burden associated with these requirements for an EP is 9 hours and 46 minutes (8 hours 13 minutes + 556 3 minutes + 1 hour 30 minutes). The total estima ted cost burden for all EPs to attest to EHR technology, meaningful use core set and least bur densome menu set criteria, and electronically submit the ambulatory clinical quality measures is $174,825,587 (198,912 EPs x 9 hours 46 minutes x $89.96 (mean hourly rate for phys icians based on May 2010 BLS data)). Similarly, eligible hospitals and CAHs will attest that they have met the core meaningful use objectives and associated measures, and will electronically submit the clinical quality measures. We estimate that it will take no longe r than 7 hours and 45 minutes to attest that during the EHR reporting period, they used the CEHRT, specify the EHR technology used, and satisfied each of the applicable core objectives an d associated measures. We estimate it will take an eligible hospital or CAH 30 minutes to c hoose and submit the objectives and associated measures from the menu set. We also estimate th at it will take an eligible hospital or CAH an additional 2 hours and 40 minutes to select, prepar e, and electronically subm it the clinical quality measures. Therefore, the total burden hours for an eligible hospital or CAH to attest to the aforementioned criteria is 10 hours, 55 minutes. We estimate that there are about 4,993 eligible hospitals and CAHs (3,573 acute care hospi tals, 1,325 CAHs, 84 children's hospitals, and 11 cancer hospitals) that may attest to the aforemen tioned criteria (after re gistration and completion of Stage 1) in FY 2014 to receive an incenti ve payment. We estimate the burden for the 30 MA-affiliated hospitals in section III.B. of th is final rule. We estimate the total burden associated with these requirements for an elig ible hospital or CAH is 10 hours and 55 minutes (7 hours 45 minutes + 30 minutes + 2 hours 40 minutes). The total estimated annual cost burden for all eligible hospitals and C AHs to attest to EHR technology, meaningful use core set and menu set criteria, and electronically submit the clinical quality measures is $2,069,061 (4,993 eligible hospitals and CAHs x $62.23 (11 hours 4 minutes x $62.23 (mean hourly rate for 557 lawyers based on May 2010 BLS) data)). B. ICRs Regarding Qualif ying MA Organizations (\u00a7495.210) We estimate that the burden will be signifi cantly less for qualifying MA organizations attesting to the meaningful use of their MA EPs in Stage 2, b ecause-- (1) qualifying MA organizations do not have to repo rt the ambulatory clinical qual ity measures for their qualifying MA EPs; and (2) qualifying MA EPs use the EH R technology in place at a given location or system, so if CEHRT is in place and the qualifyi ng MA organization requires its qualifying MA EPs to use the technology, qualifying MA organizations will be able to determine at a faster rate than individual FFS EPs, that its qualifying MA EP s meaningfully used CEHRT. In other words, qualifying MA organizations can ma ke the determination en masse if the CEHRT is required to be used at its facilities, wher eas under FFS, each EP likely must make the determination on an individual basis. We estimate that, on average, it will take an individual 45 minutes to collect information necessary to determine if a give n qualifying MA EP has met the meaningful use objectives and measures, and 15 minutes for an i ndividual to make the attestation for each MA EP. Furthermore, the individuals performing the assessment and attesting will not likely be eligible professionals, bu t non-clinical staff. We believe that the individual gathering the information could be equivalent to a GS 9, st ep 1, with an hourly rate of approximately $25.00/hour, and the person attesting (and who ma y bind the qualifying MA organization based on the attestation) could be equivalent to a GS 15, step 1, or approximately $59.00/hour. Therefore, for the approximately 13,000 potentially qualifying MA EPs, we believe it will cost the participating qualif ying MA organizations approxima tely $435,500 annually to make the attestations ([9,750 hours $25.00]+[3,250 hours x $59.00]). Furthermore, MA-affiliated eligible hospitals wi ll be able to complete the attestations 558 slightly faster than eligible hospitals because MA-affiliated eligible hospitals do not have to report the hospital clinical quality measures. While it is estimated that it will take an eligible hospital or CAH approximately between 16 hours, 24 minutes and 16 hours, 33 minutes to attest to the applicable meaningful use objectives and associated measures, 8 of those hours are attributed to reporting clinical quality measures, which MA organi zations do not have to report. Therefore, we estimate that it will take between 8 hours, 24 minutes and 8 hours, 33 minutes (which on average is 8 hours 29 minutes) for an MA organization's MA-affiliated eligible hospitals to make the attestations. We believe that the individual gathering the information could be equivalent to a GS 9, step 1, with an hour ly rate of approximately $25.00/hour, and the person attesting (and who may bind the qualifying MA organization based on the attestation) could be equivalent to a GS 15, step 1, or approximate ly $59.00/hour. We believe that the person gathering the information could dedicate 7 of th e estimated hours to ga thering the information, and the individual certifying could take 1 hour and 29 minutes of the estimated time. Therefore, for the approximately 30 potentially qualifying MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, we believe it will cost the participating qua lifying MA organizations in th e aggregate approximately $7,870 annually to successfully attest ([ 210 hrs x $25.00]+[44 hrs x $59.00]). We did not receive any comm ents and we are finalizing these estimates as proposed. C. ICRs Regarding State Medicaid Agency and Medicaid EP and Hospital Activities (\u00a7495.332 through \u00a7495.344) The burden associated with this section is th e time and effort associated with completing the single provider election repository and each state's process for the administration of the Medicaid incentive payments, incl uding tracking of attestations a nd oversight; the submission of the state Medicaid HIT Plan and the additi onal planning and implementation documents; 559 enrollment or reenrollment of providers, and co llection and submission of the data for providers to demonstrate that they have adopted, implemented, or upgrad ed CEHRT or that they are meaningful users of such technol ogy. We believe the burden asso ciated with these requirements has already been accounted for in our discussion of the burde n for \u00a7495.316 in the Stage 1 final rule. However, we proposed to revise 42 CFR 495 regarding the frequency of HIT IAPD updates. Rather than requiring each state to subm it an annual HIT IAPD w ithin 60 days from the HIT IAPD approved anniversary date, we proposed to require that a state's annual IAPD or IAPD Update (IAPD-U) be submitted at a minimum of 12 months from the date of the last CMS approval. We are finalizing our proposed re vision to 42 CFR 495; therefore, annual IAPD updates are only required if a state has not subm itted an IAPD-U in the past 12 months, which will create less of a burden on the states. We expect that it will take a state 70 hours to update an annual IAPD. We believe that the requirement fo r states to agree to have CMS conduct audits and appeals for hospitals for meaningful use will reduce state burden, as they will not conduct their own audits. Also, the alternatives for cal culating patient volume will alleviate state burden as patient volume will be more easily calculated. We did not receive any comm ents and we are finalizing these estimates as proposed. 560 TABLE 21: ESTIMATED ANNUAL REPORTIN G AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS Reg Section OMB Control No. Number of Respondents Number of ResponsesBurden per Response (hours) Total Annual Burden (hours) Hourly Labor Cost of Reporting ($) Total Cost ($) \u00a7495.6 - EHR Technology Used, Core Set Objectives/Measures 198,912 13,000 0.75 9,750 $25.00 $243,750.00 \u00a7495.210 - Attesting on behalf 13,000 13,000 0.25 3,250 $59.00 $191,750.00 \u00a7495.210 - Total cost of attestation for Stage 2 (MA EPs) ???-New 13,000 13,000 1.00 13,000 n/a $435,500.00 \u00a7495.210 - 7.00 Attesting on behalf 30 30 1.48 44 $59.00 $2,619.60 \u00a7495.210 - Total cost of attestation for Stage 2 (MA-affiliated hospitals) ???-New 30 30 8.48 254 n/a $7,869.60 561 Reg Section OMB Control No. Number of Respondents Number of ResponsesBurden per Response (hours) Total Annual Burden (hours) Hourly Labor Cost of Reporting ($) Total Cost ($) \u00a7495.342 - 1.

Regulatory Impact Analysis A. Statement of Need This final rule will implement the provisions of the ARRA that provide incentive payments to EPs, eligible hosp itals, and CAHs participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs that adopt and meaningfully use CEHRT. The final rule specifies applicable criteria for earning incentives and avoiding payment adjustments. B. Overall Impact We have examined the impacts of this rule as required by Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review (Septemb er 30, 1993), Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review (January 18, 2011), the Regul atory Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96-354), section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Mar ch 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999) and the Congr essional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive imp acts, and equity). A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules with economically si gnificant effects ($100 million or more in any 1 year). This final rule is anticipated to ha ve an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, making it an economically significant ru le under the Executive Order and a major rule under the Congressional Review Act. Accordin gly, we have prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis that to the best of our ability presen ts the costs and benefits of the final rule. 564 As noted in section I. of this final rule, th is final rule is one of two coordinated rules related to the adoption a nd meaningful use of CEHRT. The other is ONC's final rule, titled \"Health Information Technology: Standards, Im plementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Permanent Certification Program for Health Informa tion Technology\" published elsewhere in this Federal Register . This analysis focuses on the impact associated with Stage 1 meaningful use participation in 2014, Stage 2 requi rements for meaningful use, th e changes in quality measures that will take effect beginning in 2014, and othe r changes in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs. A number of factors will a ffect the adoption of EHR sy stems and demonstration of meaningful use. Many of these f actors are addressed in this analys is and in the provisions of the final rule titled \"Health Information Technology: Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Elect ronic Health Record Technology , 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Permanent Certification Program for Health In formation Technology\" pu blished elsewhere in this Federal Register . Readers should unders tand that these forecasts are also subject to substantial uncertainty since demonstration of meaningful use will depend not only on the standards and requirements for FYs 2014 and 2015 for eligible hospitals and CYs 2014 and 2015 for EPs, but on future rulemakings issued by the HHS. The Act provides Medicare and Medicaid incen tive payments for the meaningful use of CEHRT. Additionally, the Medicaid program also provides incentives for the adoption, implementation, and upgrade of CEHRT. Paym ent adjustments are incorporated into the Medicare program for providers unable to dem onstrate meaningful use. The absolute and relative strength of these is unclear. For example, a provide r with relatively small Medicare 565 billings will be less disadvantaged by payment adjustments than one with relatively large Medicare billings. Another uncertainty arises be cause there are likely to be \"bandwagon\" effects as the number of providers using EHRs rises, thereby inducing more participation in the incentives program, as well as greater adoption by entities (for example, clinical laboratories) that are not eligible for incentives or subject to payment adjustments, but do business with EHR adopters. It is impossible to predict exactly if and when such effects may take hold. One legislative uncertainty arises because unde r current law, physicians are scheduled for payment reductions under the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula for determining Medicare payments. The current override of SGR payment reductions prevents any further reductions of Medicare physician payments throughout th e rest of 2012. Any payment reductions implemented in CY 2013 and subsequent calendar years could cause major changes in physician behavior, enrollee care, and other Medicare provider payments, but the specific nature of these changes is exceptionally uncertain. Under a current law scenario, the EHR incentives or payment adjustments will exert only a minor influence on physician behavior relative to any large payment reductions. However, the Congres s has legislatively avoided physician payment reductions for each year since 2002. All of these factors taken together make it diffi cult to predict with precision the timing or rates of adoption and ultimately meaningful use. Further, new data regarding rates of adoption or costs of implementation is just starting to emerge. Because of this continued uncertainty, these estimates for adoption rates should be used with caution. Our estimate of meaningful use demonstration assumes that by 2019 nearly 100 percen t of hospitals and nearly 70 percent of EPs will be meaningful users. This estimate is based on the substantial economic incentives created by the combined direct and indirect factors affecting providers. 566 Data from the EHR Incentive Program to date has shown that about 12 percent of EPs and 8 percent of hospitals rece ived incentive payments in 2011, th e first year. This may be because providers have taken a \"wait and see approach\" in the first year of implementation or that they have had problems receiving certified sy stems. Two thousand eleven was the first year of the program and saw initially slow, but rapi dly accelerating, growth in qualification for and payment of meaningful use incen tives. Given that this is very early data, and given the differences between Stage 1 and Stage 2 require ments, this data only indicates preliminary penetration rates. Overall, we expect spending under the EHR incentive program for transfer payments to Medicare and Medicaid provi ders between 2014 and 2019 to be $15.4 billion (these estimates include payment adjustments for Medicare provid ers who do not achieve meaningful use in 2015 and subsequent years in the amount of $2.1 billion). We have also estimated \"per entity\" costs for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs for impl ementation/maintenance and reporting requirement costs, not all costs. We believe also that a dopting entities will achieve dollar savings at least equal to their total costs, and th at there will be additional benefits to society. We believe that implementation costs are significant for each pa rticipating entity because providers must purchase CEHRT to qualify as meaningful users of EHRs. However, we believe that providers who have already purchased CEHRT and partic ipated in Stage 1 of meaningful use will experience significantly lower costs for participation in the program. We continue to believe that the short-term costs to demonstrate meaningful use of CEHRT are outweighed by the long-term benefits, including practice efficiencies and im provements in medical outcomes. Although both cost and benefit estimates are high ly uncertain, the RIA that we have prepared to the best of our ability presents the costs and be nefits of this final rule. 567 Previously, the Stage 2 proposed rule and the Stage 1 final rule impact analyses showed two plausible scenarios for program costs. In th is RIA, we are showing a scenario based on the FY 2013 Mid-Session Review of the President's budget. The estimates are based on the limited actual historical data that is now available for the EHR Incentive Programs. The new projections differ somewhat from the two scenarios presented previously. The major reasons for the differences are different assume d penetration rates based on more recent data and analysis, and revised assumptions as to the timing of payments in relation to when meaningful use is achieved based on the actual experience of the programs to date. When compared with the two illustrations from the Stage 2 proposed rule and St age 1 final rule, the penetration rates for the current estimates are generally closer to those in the high cost scenario. In general, the actual program experience, which is included in the ne w estimates, showed somewhat lower payments early in the first year, and some what higher payments towards the end of the first year than assumed in the two previously -used scenarios. The accountin g statement numbers under the 7-percent discount for the two scenarios from the previous estimates were $706 million and $2,346 million. The current accounting statemen t number under the 7-percent discount is $2,558 million. The current projections, while based on more up-to-date information, are still very uncertain and actual future outcomes are likely to differ somewhat from these projections. Comment : A commenter suggested that the imp act analysis should only address Stage 2 of the EHR Incentive Programs. Response : Although we considered the idea of only addressing Stage 2 in this impact analysis, we do not believe that such an analysis would provide a comprehensive impact of this final rule. This final rule estab lishes not only Stage 2 criteria but also changes to Stage 1 criteria and both payment adjustments and hardship exceptions that could affect provi ders at all stages of 568 meaningful use. In addition, providers in all payment years will be at differing stages of meaningful use, and any impact analysis that focused on a single stage would not accurately capture the costs and benefits that accrue from all providers who are pa rticipating in the EHR Incentive Programs during a given payment year. Therefore, we include all providers in this impact analysis. C. Anticipated Effects The objective of the remainder of this RIA is to summarize the costs and benefits of the HITECH Act incentive program for the Medicare FFS, Medicaid, and MA programs. We also provide assumptions and a narr ative addressing the potential costs to the industry for implementation of this technology. 1. Overall Effects a. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Small Entities The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) require s agencies to prepare a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis to describe and analyze the impact of the final rule on small entities unless the Secretary can certify that the regulation will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In the healthcare sector, Small Bu siness Administration (SBA) size standards define a small entity as one w ith between $7 million and $34 million in annual revenues. For the purposes of the RFA, essen tially all non-profit organi zations are considered small entities, regardless of size. Individuals and states are no t included in the definition of a small entity. Since the vast majority of Medicare providers (well over 90 percent) are small entities within the RFA's definitio ns, it is the normal practice of HHS simply to assume that all affected providers are \"small\" under the RFA. In this case, most EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs are either nonprofit or meet the SBA's size standard for small business. We also believe 569 that the effects of the incentives program on many and probably most of these affected entities will be economically significant. Accordingl y, this RIA section, in conjunction with the remainder of the preamble, constitutes the required Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. We believe that the adoption and meaningful use of EHRs will have an impact on virtually every EP and eligible hospital, as well as CAHs and some EPs and hospitals affiliated with MA organizations. While the program is voluntary, in the first 5 years it carries substantial positive incentives that will make it attractive to virtua lly all eligible entities. Furthermore, entities that do not demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology for an applicab le reporting period will be subject to significant Medicare payment reduc tions beginning with 2015. The anticipation of these Medicare payment adjustments are expected to motivate EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology. For some EPs, CAHs and eligible hospita ls the EHR technology th ey currently have could be upgraded to meet the criteria for certified EHR technology as defined for this program. These costs may be minimal, involving no more than a software upgrade. \"Home-grown\" EHR systems that might exist may also require an upgrade to meet the certification requirements. We believe many currently noncertified EHR system s will require significant changes to achieve certification and that EPs, CAHs, and eligible hos pitals will have to make process changes to achieve meaningful use. The most recent data available suggests that more providers have adopted EHR technology since the publication of the Stage 1 final rule. A 2011 survey conducted by the ONC and the AHA found that the percentage of U.S. ho spitals which had adopted EHRs doubled from 16 to 35 percent between 2009 and 2011. In November 2011, a CDC survey found the percentage of physicians who adopted basic EHRs in their practice had doubled from 17 to 570 34 percent between 2008 and 2011, with the per cent of primary care doctors using this technology nearly doubling from 20 to 39 percent. While these numbers are encouraging, they are still low relative to the overa ll population of providers. The majority of EPs still need to purchase certified EHR technology, implement this new technology, and train their staff on its use. The costs for implementation and complying with the criteria of mean ingful use could lead to higher operational expenses. However, we believe that the combination of payment incentives and long-term overall gains in efficiency will compensate for the initial expenditures. (1) Number of Small Entities In total, we estimate that there are appr oximately 624,000 healthcare organizations (EPs, practices, eligible hospitals or CAHs) that will be affected by the incentive program. These include hospitals and physi cian practices as well as doctors of medicine or osteopathy, dental surgery or dental medicine, podiatric medicine, optometry or a chiropractor. Additionally, as many as 47,000 nonphysician practitioners (such as certified nurse-midwives, etc) will be eligible to receive the Medicaid incentive payments. Of the 624,000 healthcare organizations we esti mate will be affected by the incentive program, we estimate that 94.71 percent will be EPs, 0.8 percent will be hospitals, and 4.47 percent will be MA organization physicians or hospitals. We further estimate that EPs will spend approximately $54,000 to purchase and imp lement a certified EHR and $10,000 annually for ongoing maintenance according to the Congressi onal Budget Office (CBO). In the paper, Evidence on the Costs and Bene fits of Health Information Technology, May 2008, in attempting to estimate the total cost of implementing hea lth IT systems in office-based medical practices, recognized the complicating factors of EHR type s, available features, and differences in characteristics of the practices that are adop ting them. The CBO estimated a cost range of 571 $25,000 to $45,000 per physician. For all eligible hospitals, the range is from $1 million to $100 million. Though reports vary widely, we antic ipate that the average will be $5 million to achieve meaningful use. We estimate $1 milli on for maintenance, upgrades, and training each year. (2) Conclusion As discussed later in this analysis, we be lieve that there are many positive effects of adopting EHR on health care providers, quite apar t from the incentive payments to be provided under this rule. While economi cally significant, we do not be lieve that the net effect on individual providers will be negative over time except in very rare cases. Accordingly, we believe that the object of the RFA to minimize burden on small entities is met by this rule. b. Small Rural Hospitals Section 1102(b) of the Act requires us to pr epare a RIA if a rule will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RF A. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a metropolitan statistical area and has fewer than 100 beds. This final ru le will affect the opera tions of a substantial number of small rural hospitals because they may be subject to adjusted Medicare payments in 2015 if they fail to adopt certified EHR technolog y by the applicable repor ting period. As stated previously, we have determined that this fina l rule will create a significant impact on a substantial number of small enti ties, and have prepared a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis as required by the RFA and, for small rural hospitals, section 1102(b) of the Ac t. Furthermore, any impacts that will arise from the implementation of certified EHR technology in a rural eligible hospital will be positive, with respect to the streamlining of care and the ease of sharing 572 information with other EPs to a void delays, duplication, or errors. However, we have statutory authority to make case-by-case exceptions fo r significant hardship, and proposed certain case-by-case applications that may be made when there are barriers to internet connectivity that will impact health information exchange. c. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Re form Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule whose mandates will require spending in any 1 year $100 million in 1 995 dollars, updated annually for inflation. In 2012, that threshold is approximately $139 million. UMRA does not address the total cost of a rule. Rather, it focuses on certain categories of cost, mainly those \"Federal mandate\" costs resulting from-- (1) imposing enforceable duties on St ate, local, or tribal governments, or on the private sector; or (2) increasi ng the stringency of conditions i n, or decreasing the funding of, State, local, or tribal governmen ts under entitlement programs. This final rule imposes no substantial mandate s on states. This program is voluntary for states and states offer the incentives at their op tion. The State role in the incentive program is essentially to administer the Medicaid incentive program. While this enta ils certain procedural responsibilities, these do not involve substantial State expense. In general, each State Medicaid Agency that participates in the incentive progr am will be required to invest in systems and technology to comply. States will have to id entify and educate providers, evaluate their attestations and pay the incentive. However, th e Federal government will fund 90 percent of the State's related administrative costs, pr oviding controls on the total State outlay . The investments needed to meet the mean ingful use standards and obtain incentive funding are voluntary, and hence not \"mandates\" with in the meaning of the statute. However, 573 the potential reductions in Medicare reimbur sement beginning with FY 2015 will have a negative impact on providers that fail to m eaningfully use certified EHR technology for the applicable reporting period. We note that we have no discretion as to the amount of those potential payment reductions. Private sector EPs th at voluntarily choose not to participate in the program may anticipate potential costs in the aggregate that may exceed $139 million; however, because EPs may choose for various reasons not to participate in the program, we do not have firm data for the percentage of participation with in the private sector. Th is RIA, taken together with the remainder of the preamble, constitutes the analysis required by UMRA. d. Federalism Executive Order 13132 establishes certain requirem ents that an agency must meet when it promulgates a final rule that imposes substant ial direct requirement costs on State and local governments, preempts State law, or otherwise has Federalism implications. This final rule will not have a substantial direct effect on State or local governme nts, preempt State law, or otherwise have a Federalism implication. Impor tantly, State Medicaid agencies are receiving 100 percent match from the Federal government fo r incentives paid and a 90 percent match for expenses associated with administering the program . As previously stated, we believe that State administrative costs are minimal. We note th at this final rule does add a new business requirement for states, because of the existing syst ems that will need to be modified to track and report on the new meaningful use requirements for provider attestations. We are providing 90 percent FFP to states for modifying their existing EHR Incentive Program systems. We believe the Federal share of the 90 percent match will protect the states from burdensome financial outlays and, as noted previously, states offer the Me dicaid EHR incentive program at their option. 574 2. Effects on Eligible Professiona ls, Eligible Hospitals, and CAHs a. Background and Assumptions The principal costs of this final rule are the additional expenditures that will be undertaken by eligible entities in order to obtain the Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments to adopt, implement or upgrade and/or demonstr ate meaningful use of certified EHR technology, and to avoid the Medicare payment adjustments th at will ensue if they fail to do so. The estimates for the provisions aff ecting Medicare and Medicaid EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs are somewhat uncertain for several reasons: (1) the program is voluntary although payment adjustments will be imposed on Medicare provide rs beginning in 2015 if they are unable to demonstrate meaningful use for the applicable reporting period; (2) the Stage 1 and Stage 2 criteria for the demonstration of meaningful use of CEHRT has been finali zed, but will change in Stage 3 and over time; and (3) the impact of the financial incentives and payment adjustments on the rate of adoption of certifie d EHR technology by EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs is difficult to predict based on the information we have cu rrently collected. The net costs and savings shown for this program represent a possibl e scenario and actual impacts could differ substantially. Based on input from a number of internal and external sources, including the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and CBO, we estimated the numbers of EPs and eligible hospitals, including CAHs under Medicare, Medicaid, and MA and used them throughout the analysis. About 568,900 Medicare FFS EPs in 2014 (some of whom will also be Medicaid EPs). About 14 percent of the tota l EPs are hospital-based Medicare EPs, and are not eligible for the program. This leaves approximat ely 491,000 nonhospital-based Medicare EPs in 2014. 575 About 20 percent of the nonhospital- based Medicare EPs (approximately 98,200 Medicare EPs in 2014) are also eligible for Medicaid (meet the 30 percent Medicaid patient volume criteria), but can only be paid under one program. We assume that any EP in this situation will choose to receive the Medicaid incentive paymen t, because it is larger. About 46,600 non-Medicare eligib le EPs (such as dentists, pe diatricians, and eligible nonphysicians such as certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners and physicians assistants) will be eligible to receive the Medicaid incentive payments. 4,993 eligible hospitals co mprised of the children's hospitals (Medicaid only). ++ 11 cancer hospitals (Medicaid only). All eligible hospitals, except for children' s and cancer hospitals, may qualify and apply for both Medicare and Medi caid incentive payments. 12 MA organizations (about 28,000 EPs, and 29 hospitals) will be eligible for incentive payments. b. Industry Costs and Adoption Rates In the Stage 1 final rule (75 FR 4454 5 through 44547), we estimated the impact on healthcare providers using information from the same four studies cited prev iously in this final rule. Based on these studies and current aver age costs for available certified EHR technology products, we continue to estimate for EPs that the average adopt/implement/upgrade cost is $54,000 per physician FTE, while annual maintenance costs average $10,000 per physician FTE. 576 For all eligible hospitals, the range is from $1 million to $100 million. Although reports vary widely, we anticipate that the average will be $5 million to achieve meaningful use, because providers who will like to qualify as meaningful users of EHRs will need to purchase certified EHRs. We further acknowledge \"certified EHRs\" may differ in many important respects from the EHRs currently in use and may differ in the functionalities they contain. We estimate $1 million for maintenance, upgrades, and training each year. Both of these estimates are based on average figures provided in the 2008 CBO repor t. Industry costs ar e important, in part, because EHR adoption rates will be a function of th ese industry costs and the extent to which the costs of \"certified EHRs\" are higher than the tota l value of EHR incentive payments available to EPs and eligible hospitals (as well as adjustments, in the case of the Medicare EHR incentive program) and any perceived benefits including societal benefits. Because of the uncertainties surrounding industry cost estimates, we have made various assumptions about adoption rates in the following analysis in order to estimate th e budgetary impact on the Medicare and Medicaid programs. c. Costs of EHR Adoption for EPs Since the publication of the Stage 1 final rule, there has been little data published regarding the cost of EHR adoption and implementation. A 2011 study (http://content.healthaffairs .org/content/30/3/481.abstract ) estimated costs of implementation for a five-physician practice to be $162,000, with $85,500 in maintenance expenses in the first year. These estimates are similar to estimates made in the Stage 1 final rule. In the absence of additional data regarding the cost of adop tion and implementation costs for certified EHR technology, we proposed to continue to estimate for EPs that the average adopt/implement/upgrade cost is $54,000 per physi cian FTE, while annual maintenance costs 577 average $10,000 per physician FTE, based on the co st estimate of the St age 1 final rule. Comment : Some commenters suggested that specific costs and financial gains for each provider be recorded as part of attestation to inform the ove rall impact analysis. Another commenter suggested that the analysis shoul d include costs associ ated with unintended consequences of the regulation, such as the loss of revenue to providers through the elimination of unnecessary or duplicative tests and the resist ance of the market to improving patient care under such circumstances. The commenter also suggested that the impact analysis should be stratified according to primary care and specialty providers. Response: Although we agree that a system that records the specific costs and benefits for each provider would yield a more accurate financial analysis, we believe that such a requirement would place a significa nt burden on providers and potentially limit participation in the EHR Incentive Programs. We also do not believe that there is an accurate method to calculate the loss of revenue due to the eliminati on of unnecessary or duplic ative tests or market resistance to improving patient care. The reduc tion of costs while improving patient care is one of the goals of the EHR Incentive Programs, and we do not believe that these reductions should be classified as negative impacts for the health care system as they would also lead to lower overall health care costs. Nor do we believe it is possible for us to proactively estimate such savings at this time. Because both primary- care and specialty provide rs receive the same incentive payment amounts under this program, we do not believe there is a benefit to stratifying the impact analysis in this way. d. Costs of EHR Adoption for Eligible Hospitals AHA conducts annual surveys that among other measures, track hospital spending. This data reflects the latest figures from the 2008 AHA Survey. Costs at these levels of adoption were 578 significantly higher in 20 08 than in previous years. This may better reflect the costs of implementing additional functionalities. The ra nge in yearly information technology spending among hospitals is large, from $36,000 to over $32 million based on the AHA data. EHR system costs specifically were reporte d by experts to run as high as $20 million to $100 million. HHS discussions with experts led to cost ranges for adoption that vari ed by hospital size and level of EHR system sophistication. Research to date has shown that adoption of comprehensive EHR systems is limited. In the aforementioned AHA study, 1.5 percent of these organizations had comprehensive systems, which were defined as hospital-wide clinical documentation of cases, test results, prescription and te st ordering, plus support for de cision-making that included treatment guidelines. Some 10.9 percent have a ba sic system that does not include physician and nursing notes, and can only be used in one area of the hospital. Applying a similar standard to the 2008 AHA data, results in roughly 3 to 4 per cent of hospitals having comprehensive systems and 12 to 13 percent having basic systems. A ccording to hospital CEOs, the main barrier to adoption is the cost of the systems, and the lack of capital. Hospitals ha ve been concerned that they will not be able to recoup their inve stment, and they are already operating on limited margins. Because uptake of advanced systems is low, it is difficult to get a solid average estimate for implementation and maintenance costs that can be applied across the industry. In addition, we recognize that ther e are additional industry costs associated with adoption and implementation of EHR technology that are not capt ured in our estimates that eligible entities will incur. Because the impact of those activities, such as redu ced staff productivity related to learning how to use the EHR technology, the need to add additional staff to work with HIT issues, and administrative costs re lated to reporting are unknown at this time and difficult to quantify. 579 Comment : Some commenters suggested that overall IT operating costs should be included as part of the analysis. These commen ters also suggested that estimates for costs related to staff training were too low and should include ti me and resources devoted to understanding the EHR Incentive Programs regulati ons. Other commenters suggested that costs associated with the time and res ources related to registration a nd attestation should be included as part of the analysis. Finally, some commen ters suggested that costs associated with EHR products, consultants, and traine d IT professionals have increa sed since the start of the EHR Incentive Programs and should be reflected in the analysis. Response : As noted in this impact analysis , we based cost estimates for IT on peer-reviewed studies of EHR and health IT costs. These cost estimates included maintenance and operating costs specific to EHRs and staff tr aining. There are many aspects of IT operating costs that are not directly related to the ma intenance or operation of CEHRT, and we do not believe it would be appropriate to include those costs as part of the impact analysis of this regulation. We are not aware of any new data that suggests an overall increase in the costs of CEHRT or related implementation and maintenan ce costs since the start of the EHR Incentive Programs, and in many cases we believe that the product and maintenance costs of CEHRT can be significantly lower than our estimates. Theref ore, we are continuing to use the estimates we proposed for this impact analysis. We also do no t believe it is appropriate to include additional costs related to registration and attestation, as th e cost for dedicating reso urces to these activities is addressed earlier in this fi nal rule in our discussion of in formation collection requirements. 3. Medicare Incentive Program Costs a. Medicare Eligible Professionals (EPs) We continue the method of cost estimation we used to determine the estimated costs of 580 the Medicare incentives for EPs in our Stage 1 fi nal rule (75 FR 44549). In order to determine estimated costs, we first needed to determine the EPs with Medicare claims . Then, we calculated that about 14 percent of those EPs are hospi tal based according to the definition in \u00a7495.4 (finalized in our Stage 1 fina l rule), and therefore, do not qualify for incentive payments. This percent of EPs was subtracted from the total number of EPs w ho have claims with Medicare. These numbers were tabu lated from Medicare claims data. In the Stage 1 final rule, we also estimated that about 20 percent of EPs that were not hospital based will qualify for Medicaid incentive payments and will choose that program because the payments are higher. Current pr ogram data does not provide additional evidence regarding this, so we continued to use the 20 percent estimation in the current projections. Of the remaining EPs, we estimated the percentage which will be meaningful users each calendar year. As discussed previously, our estimates for the number of EPs that will successfully demonstrate meaningful use of CEHRT are uncertain. The percentage of Medicare EPs who will satisfy the criteria for demonstrating meaningf ul use of CEHRT and will qualify for incentive payments is a key, but a highly uncertain fact or. Accordingly, the estimated number of nonhospital based Medicare EPs who will demons trate meaningful use of CEHRT over the period CYs 2014 through 2019 is as shown in Table 22. TABLE 22: MEDICARE EPs DEMONSTRATING MEANINGFUL USE OF CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY Calendar Year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 EPs who have claims with Medicare (thousands) 568.9 574.8 516.7 EPs that (thousands) 98.2 99.2 100.3 101.3 102.3 103.3 Percent of EPs who are Meaningful Users 37 46 52 57 62 67 581 Calendar Year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Meaningful Users (thousands) 147.1 184.2 206.5 229.3 252.5 276.1 Our estimates of the incentive payments and payment adjustment savings are presented in Table 23. These payments reflect the Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments and payment adjustments included in 42 CFR Pa rt 495 of our regulations. They reflect our assumptions about the proportion of EPs who will demonstrate mean ingful use of CEHRT. These assumptions were developed based on a review of the studies presented in the Stage 1 impact analysis. Specifically, our assumptions are based on lite rature estimating current rates of physician EHR adoption and rates of diffusi on of EHRs and similar technologi es. There are a number of studies that have attempted to measure the rate of adoption of electronic medical records (EMR) among physicians prior to the enactment of the HITECH Act (see, for example, Funky and Taylor (2005) The State and Pattern of Health Informa tion Technology Adoption. RAND Monograph MG-409. Santa Monica: The Corporation; Ford, E.W., Peterson, L.T., Huerta, T.R. (2009) \"Resistance is Futile: But it is Sl owing the Pace of EHR Adoption Nonetheless\" Journal of the American Informatics Asso ciation 16(3): 274-281). More recently, there is also some data available to suggest that more providers have adopted EHR technology since the start of the EHR Incenti ve Programs. The 2011 ONC-AHA survey cited earlier found that the percentage of U.S. hospitals which had adopted EHRs increased from 16 to 35 percent between 2009 and 2011. In November 2011 , the CDC survey cited earlier found the percentage of physicians who adopted basic (EHRs in their practice had doubled from 17 to 34 percent between 2008 and 2011. These survey resu lts are in line with th e estimated rate of EHR adoption presented in the Stage 1 impact an alysis, but they constitute a relatively small sample on which to base new estimates. Therefor e we maintain the estimates that were based on 582 the study with the most rigorous definition, though we note again that neither the Stage 1 nor the Stage 2 meaningful use criteria are equivalent to a fully functi onal system as defined in this study. (DesRoches, CM, Campbell, EG, Rao, SR et al (2008) \"Electronic Health Records in Ambulatory Care-A National Survey of Physicia ns\" New England Journal of Medicine 359(1): 50-60. In addition, we note that the final penetr ation rates used in the initial estimates were developed in consensus with industry experts re lying on the studies. Actual adoption trends could be different from these assumptions, give n the elements of uncer tainty we describe throughout this analysis. Estimated net costs of the Medicare EP por tion of the HITECH Act are shown in Table 23. TABLE 23: ESTIMATED COSTS (+) AND SAVINGS (-) FOR MEDICARE EPs DEMONSTRATING MEANINGFUL USE OF CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY (IN BILLIONS) Fiscal Year Incentive Payments Payment Adjustment Receipts Benefit Payments Net Total 2014 $1.9 \u2014 \u2014 $1.9 2015 2019 \u2014 -$0.2 \u2014 -$0.2 583 b. Medicare Eligible Hospitals and CAHs In brief, the estimates of hospital adop tion were developed by calculating projected incentive payments (which are driven by discha rges), comparing them to projected costs of attaining meaningful use, and then making assu mptions about how rapidly hospitals will adopt given the fraction of their co sts that were covered. Specifically, the first step in preparing estim ates of Medicare program costs for eligible hospitals was to determine the amount of Medicare incentive payments that each hospital in the country could potentially receive under the stat utory formula, based on its discharge numbers (total patients and Medicare patients). The to tal incentive payments potentially payable over a 4-year period vary significantly by hospitals' i npatient caseloads, ranging from a low of about $11,000 to a high of $12.9 million, with the median being $3.8 million. The potential Medicare incentive payments for each eligib le hospital were compared with the hospital's expected cost of purchasing and operating certifi ed EHR technology. Costs of adoption for each hospital were estimated using data from the 2009 AHA survey and IT supplement. Estimated costs varied by size of hospital and by the likely st atus of EHR adoption in that class of hospitals. Hospitals were grouped first by size (CAHs, non-CAH hospita ls under 400 beds, and hospitals with 400 or more beds) because EHR adoption costs do vary by size: namely, larger hospitals with more diverse service offerings and la rge physician staffs generally implement more customized systems than smaller hospitals that might purch ase off-the-shelf products. We then calculated the proportion of hospitals within ea ch class that were at one of three levels of EHR adoption: (1) hospitals which had already implemented rela tively advanced systems that included CPOE systems for medications; (2) hospitals which had implemented more basic systems through which lab results could be shared, but not CPOE for medications; and (3) hospitals starting from 584 a base level with neither CPOE or lab reporting. The CPOE for medication standard was chosen for this estimate because expert input indicated that the CPOE standard in the final meaningful use definition will be the hardest one for hospitals to meet. Table 24 provides these proportions. TABLE 24: HOSPITAL IT CAPA BILITIES BY HOSPITAL SIZE Levels of Adoption Any CPOE Meds Lab Results Neither Total Hospital Size Number of Hospitals Percentage Number of Hospitals Percentage Number of Hospitals Percentage Number of Hospitals Percentage then calculated the costs of moving from these stages to meaningful use for each class of hospital, assuming that even for hospita ls with CPOE systems they will incur additional costs of at least 10 percent of their IT budgets. These costs were based on cross-sectional data from the AHA survey and thus do not likely repres ent the true costs of implementing systems. This data reflects the latest fi gures from the 2009 AHA Survey. Cost s at these levels of adoption were significantly higher than in previous y ears. This may better reflect the costs of implementing additional functionalities. We have also updated the number of discharges using the most recent cost report data available. The payment incentives available to hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid program s are included in our regulations at 42 CFR part 495. We estimate that there are 12 MAOs that might be el igible to participate in the incentive program. Those plans have 29 eligible hosp itals. The costs for the MA program have been included in the overall Medicare estimates. Our estimated net costs for section 4102 of the HITECH Act are shown in Table 25: Estimated costs (+) and savings (-) for eligible hospitals adopting certified EHRs. This 585 provision is estimated to increase Medicare hos pital expenditures by a net total of $5.3 billion during FYs 2014 through 2019. TABLE 25: ESTIMATED COSTS (+) AND SAVINGS (-) FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS DEMONSTRATING MEANINGFUL USE OF CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY (IN BILLIONS) Fiscal Year Incentive Payments Payment Adjustment Receipts Benefit Payments Net Total 2014 $2.1 \u2014 (\u00b9) (\u00b9) 1 Savings of less than $50 million. Based on the comparison of Medicare incen tive payments and implementation/operating costs for each eligible hospital (described previously), we made the assumptions shown in Tables 25, related to the prevalence of CEHRT for FYs 2014 through 2018. These assumptions are consistent with the actual program data for 2011. As indicated, eligible hospitals that could cover the full cost of an EHR system through Medicare incentive paymen ts were assumed to implement them relatively rapidly, and vice versa. In other words, eligible hospitals will have an incentive to purchase and implement an EHR system if they perceive that a large portion of the costs will be covered by the incentive payments . Table 26 shows the assumptions that were used. TABLE 26: ASSUMED PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS WITH CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY, BY PERCENTAGE OF SYSTEM COST COVERED BY MEDICARE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS Incentive Payments as Percentage of EHR Technology Cost Fiscal Year 100+% 75-100% 50-75% 25-50% 0-25% 2014 1.0 0.95 0.85 0.5 0.3 586 Incentive Payments as Percentage of EHR Technology Cost Fiscal Year 100+% 75-100% 50-75% 25-50% 0-25% 2015 1.0 1.0 0.95 0.75 0.5 2016 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.9 0.75 2017 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.9 2018 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 For instance, 95 percent of eligible hosp itals whose incentive payments will cover between 75 percent and 100 percent of the cost of a certified EHR system were assumed to have a certified system in FY 2014. All such hospitals were assumed to have a certified EHR system in FY 2015 and thereafter. High rates of EHR adoption are anticipated in the years leading up to FY 2015 due to the payment adjustments that will be imposed on eligible hospitals. However, we know from industry experts that issues surr ounding the capacity of vendors a nd expert consultants to support implementation, issues of access to capital, a nd competing priorities in responding to payer demand will limit the number of hos pitals that can adopt advanced systems in the short term. Therefore, we cannot be certain of the adoption ra te for hospitals due to these factors and others previously outlined in this preamble. For large, organized facilities such as hospita ls, we believe that the revenue losses caused by these payment adjustments will be a substant ial incentive to adopt certified EHR technology, even in instances where the Medicare incentive payments will cover only a portion of the costs of purchasing, installing, populat ing, and operating the EHR system. Based on the assumptions about incentive payments as percentages of EH R technology costs in Table 26, we estimated that the great majority of eligible hospitals will qualify for at least a portion of the Medicare incentive payments that they could potentially receiv e, and only a modest number will incur payment adjustments. Nearly all eligible hospitals are projected to have implemented CEHRT by FY 587 2019. Table 27 shows our estimated percentages of the total potential incentive payments associated with eligible hospitals that could de monstrate meaningful use of EHR systems. Also shown are the estimated percentages of potential incentives that will actually be paid each year. TABLE 27: ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE INCENTIVES WHICH COULD BE PAID FOR MEANINGFUL USE OF CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH ELIGIBLE HOSPITA LS AND ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE PAYABLE IN YEAR Fiscal Year Percent Associated with Eligible Hospitals Percent Payable in Year 2014 66.1% 66.1% 2015 80.2% in FY 2014, 66.1 pe rcent of the total amount of incentive payments which could be payable in that year wi ll be for eligible hospitals w ho have demonstrated meaningful use of CEHRT and therefore w ill be paid. In FY 2015, 80.2 percent of the total amount of incentive payments which could be payable will be for hospitals who have certified EHR systems, but some of those eligible hospitals wi ll have already received 4 years of incentive payments, and therefore 72.2 percen t of all possible incentive paym ents actually paid in that year. The estimated payments to eligible hospitals were calculated based on the hospitals' qualifying status and individual incentive amounts under the statutor y formula. Similarly, the estimated payment adjustments for nonqualifying hos pitals were based on the market basket reductions and Medicare revenues. The estimated savings in Medicare e ligible hospital benefit expenditures resulting from the use of hospita l certified EHR systems are discussed under \"general considerations\" at the e nd of this section. We assumed no future growth in the total 588 number of hospitals in the U.S. because growth in acute care hospitals has been minimal in recent years. c. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) We estimate that there are 1,325 CAHs eligib le to receive EHR incentive payments. In the Stage 1 impact analysis, we estimated that th e 22 percent of CAHs with relatively advanced EHR systems will achieve meaningful use be fore 2016 given on the financial assistance available under HITECH for Regional Extension Ce nters, whose priorities include assisting CAHs in EHR adoption. We also estimated that most of the remaining CAHs that had already adopted some kind of EHR system at that time (51 percent of CAHs) will also achieve meaningful use by 2016. Current program paymen t data, as well as current data from the Regional Extension Centers, provides some more information for us to alter these estimates. Our new estimates regarding the incentives that will be paid to CAHs are incorporated into the overall Medicare and Medicaid program costs. 4. Medicaid Incentive Program Costs Under section 4201 of the HITECH Act, states can voluntarily participate in the Medicaid incentive payment program. Howeve r, as of the writing of this fi nal rule 48 states are already participating in the Medicaid incentive payment pr ogram and the remaining states have indicated they will begin participation in 2012. Therefore we anticipate that all states will be participating by 2014, as we estimated in the Stage 1 impact an alysis. The payment incentives available to EPs and hospitals under the Medicaid program s are included in our regulations at 42 CFR part 495. The Federal costs for Medicaid incentive payments to providers who can demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology were estimated si milarly to the estimates for 589 Medicare eligible hospital and EP . Table 28 shows our estimates for the net Medicaid costs for eligible hospitals and EPs. TABLE 28: ESTIMATED FEDERAL COSTS (+) AND SAVINGS (-) UNDER MEDICAID (IN BILLIONS) Incentive Payments Fiscal Year Hospitals Eligible ProfessionalsBenefit Payments Net Total 2014 0.6 0.5 (\u00b9) 1.1 2015 0.4 0.8 (\u00b9) 1.2 2016 0.5 0.8 (\u00b9) 1.2 2017 0.5 0.7 (\u00b9) 1.2 2018 0.1 0.7 (\u00b9) 0.8 2019 0.0 0.5 (\u00b9) 0.5 1 Savings of less than $50 million. a. Medicaid EPs To determine the Medicaid EP incentive payments, we first determined the number of qualifying EPs. As indicated previously, we assumed that 20 percent of the nonhospital-based Medicare EPs will meet the requirements for Medicaid incentive payments (30 percent of patient volume from Medicaid). All of these EPs we re assumed to choose the Medicaid incentive payments, as they are larger. In addition, the total number of Medicaid EPs was adjusted to include EPs who qualify for the Me dicaid incentive payments but not for the Medicare incentive payments, such as most pediatricians, dentists, certified nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants. As noted previously, th ere is much uncertainty about the rates of demonstration of meaningful use that will be achieved. Our estimates are listed in Table 29. TABLE 29: ASSUMED NUMBER OF NONHOSPITAL BASED MEDICAID EPS WHO WILL BE MEANINGFUL USERS OF CERTIFIED EHR TECHNOLOGY (ALL POPULATION FIGURES ARE IN THOUSANDS) Calendar Year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 EPs who have claims with Medicare threshold 98.2 99.2 100.3 101.3 102.3 103.3 590 Calendar Year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 B Medicaid1 only EPs 46.6 47.4 48.1 48.9 49.7 50.4 Total 144.8 146.6 148.4 150.2 152.0 153.8 ring year 71.2 86.3 95.0 79.4 44.8 34.8 Percent of EPs who 49.2% 58.8% 64.0% 68.9% 86.3 95.0 103.4 111.7 119.8 It should be noted that since the Medicaid EHR incentive payment program provides that a Medicaid EP can receive an incentive payment in their first year because he or she has demonstrated a meaningful use or because he or she has adopted, implemented, or upgraded certified EHR technology, these part icipation rates include not only meaningful users but eligible providers implementing CEHRT as well. b. Medicaid Hospitals Medicaid incentive payments to most acute-care hospitals were estimated using the same adoption assumptions and method as described previously for Medi care eligible hospitals and shown in Table 30. Because hospitals' Medi care and Medicaid patient loads differ, we separately calculated the range of percentage of total potential in centives that could be associated with qualifying hospitals, year by year, and th e corresponding actual percentages payable each year. Acute care hospitals may qualify to re ceive both the Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments. As stated previously, the estimated eligible hospital incentive payments were calculated based on the hospitals' qualifying status and individual incentive amount s payable under the statutory formula. The estimated savings in Me dicaid benefit expenditure s resulting from the use of CEHRT are discussed under \"gen eral considerations.\" Since we were using Medicare cost report data and little data existed for children's hospitals, we estimated the Medicaid incentives payable to children's hospitals as an add-on to the base estimate, using data on the number of 591 children's hospitals compared to nonchildren's hospitals. TABLE 30: ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF POTENTIAL MEDICAID INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH ELIGIBLE HOSPITA LS AND ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE PAYABLE EACH YEAR Fiscal Year Percent Associated with Eligible HospitalsPercent Payable in Year 2014 5. Benefits for all EPs and all Eligible Hospitals In this final rule we have not quantified the ove rall benefits to the indus try, nor to eligible hospitals or EPs in the Medica re, Medicaid, or MA programs. Although information on the costs and benefits of adopting systems that specifica lly meet the requirements for the EHR Incentive Programs (for example, certified EHR technology) has not yet been collected, and although some studies question the benefits of health info rmation technology, a 2011 study completed by ONC (Buntin et al. 2011 \"The Benefits of Health In formation Technology: A Review of the Recent Literature Shows Predominantly Positive Results\" Health Affairs .) found that 92 percent of 154 articles published from July 2007 up to Februa ry 2010 reached conclusions that showed the overall positive effects of health information t echnology on key aspects of care, including quality and efficiency of health care. Among the posi tive results highlighted in these articles were decreases in patient mortality, reductions in st affing needs, correlation of clinical decision support to reduced transfusion and costs, reduction in complications for patients in hospitals with more advanced health IT, and a reduction in cost s for hospitals with less advanced health IT. Another study, at one hospital emergency room in Delaware, showed the ability to download and 592 create a file with a patient' s medical history saved the ER $545 per use, mostly in reduced waiting times. A pilot study of ambulatory prac tices found a positive ROI within 16 months and annual savings thereafter (Gre iger, et al. 2007, A Pilot Study to Document the Return on Investment for Implementing an Ambulatory Electr onic Health Record at an Academic Medical Center http://www.journalacs.org/artic le/S1072-7515%2807%2900390-0/abstract - article-footnote-1 s.) A study that compared the productivity of 75 providers w ithin a large urban primary care practice over a 4 year period showed increases in productivity of 1.7 percent per month per provider after EHR adoption (DeLe on et al. 2010, \"The business end of health information technology. Can a fully integrated electronic health r ecord increase provider productivity in a large community practice?\" J Med Pract Manage ). Some vendors have estimated that EHRs could result in cost savi ngs of between $100 and $200 per patient per year. At the time of the writing of this final rule, th ere was only limited information on participation in the EHR Incentive Programs and on adoption of Certified EHR Technology. As participation and adoption increases, there will be more opport unities to capture and report on cost savings and benefits. A number of rele vant studies are required in th e HITECH Act for this specific purpose, and the results will be made public, as they are available. 6. Benefits to Society According to the recent CBO study \"Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of Health Information Technology\" ( http://www.cbo.gov//ftpdocs/91xx /doc9168/05-20-HealthIT.pdf ) when used effectively, EHRs can enable provider s to deliver health care more efficiently. For example, the study states that EHRs can redu ce the duplication of diagnostic tests, prompt providers to prescribe cost-eff ective generic medications, remind patients about preventive care reduce unnecessary office visits and assist in mana ging complex care. This is consistent with the 593 findings in the ONC study cited previously. Furt her, the CBO report claims that there is a potential to gain both internal and external savings from widespread adoption of health IT, noting that internal savings will likely be in the reductions in the cost of providing care, and that external savings could accrue to th e health insurance plan or even the patient, such as the ability to exchange information more efficiently. Ho wever, it is important to note that the CBO identifies the highest gains accruing to large provider systems and groups and claims that office-based physicians may not rea lize similar benefits from purch asing health IT products. At this time, there is limited data regarding the e fficacy of health IT for smaller practices and groups, and the CBO report notes that this is a potential area of resear ch and analysis that remains unexamined. The benefits resulting specifi cally from this final rule are even harder to quantify because they represent, in many cases , adding functionality to existing systems and reaping the network externalitie s created by larger numbers of providers participating in information exchange. Since the CBO study, there has been additiona l research that has emerged documenting the association of EHRs with improved outcomes among diabetics (Hunt, JS et al. (2009) \"The impact of a physician-directed health informa tion technology system on diabetes outcomes in primary care: a pre- and post-im plementation study\" Informatics in Primary Care 17(3):165-74; Pollard, C al. (2009) \"Electroni c patient registries improve diab etes care and clinical outcomes in rural community health centers\" Journal of Rural Health 25(1):77-84) and trauma patients (Deckelbaum, D. et al. (2009) \"Electronic medical records and mortality in trauma patients \"The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care 67(3): 634-636), enha nced efficiencies in ambulatory care settings (Chen, C et al. (2009) \"The Kaiser Permanente Electronic Health Record: Transforming and Streamlining Modali ties Of Care.\"Health Affairs 28(2):323-333), 594 and improved outcomes and lower costs in hospita ls (Amarasingham, R. et al. (2009) \"Clinical information technologies and inpatient outcomes: a multiple hospital study\" Archives of Internal Medicine 169(2):108-14). However, data relatin g specifically to the EHR Incentive Programs is limited at this time. 7. General Considerations The estimates for the HITECH Act provision s were based on the economic assumptions underlying the President's 2013 Budget. Under th e statute, Medicare incentive payments for CEHRT are excluded from the determination of MA capitation benchmarks. As noted previously, there is considerable uncertainty about the rate at wh ich eligible hospitals, CAHs and EPs are adopting EHRs and other HIT. Nonethel ess, we believe that the Medicare incentive payments and the prospect of significant paymen t adjustments for not demonstrating meaningful use will result in the great majority of hospitals implementing CEHRT in the early years of the Medicare EHR incentive program. We expect th at a steadily growing proportion of practices will implement CEHRT over the next 10 years, even in the absence of the Medicare incentives. Actual future Medicare and Medi caid costs for eligible hospital and EP incentives will depend in part on the standards developed and applied for assessing meaningful use of certified EHR technology. We are administering the requirements in such a way as to encourage adoption of CEHRT and facilitate qualifica tion for incentive payments, and e xpect to adopt progressively demanding standards at each stage year. Cert ified EHR technology has th e potential to help reduce medical costs through efficiency improvement s, such as prompter treatments, avoidance of duplicate or otherwise unnecessary services, and reduced administrative costs (once systems are in place), with most of these savings being realized by the providers rather than by Medicare or Medicaid. To the extent that this technology will have a net positive e ffect on efficiency, then 595 more rapid adoption of such EHR systems will achieve these efficiencies sooner than will otherwise occur, without the EHR incentives. As noted, the possible efficiency savings from the adoption of EHR is expected to be realized by the providers rather than the payers. We expect a negligible impact on benefit payments to hospi tals and EPs from Medicare and Medicaid as a result of the implementation of EHR technology. In the process of preparing the estimates for th is rule, we consulted with and/or relied on internal CMS sources, as well as the following sources: Congressional Budget Office (staff and publications). American Medical Associati on (staff and unpublished data). American Hospital Association. Actuarial Res earch Corporation. CMS Statistics 2011. RAND Health studies on: ++ \"The State and Pattern of Health Information Technology Adoption\"(Fonkych & Taylor, 2005); ++ \"Extrapolating Evidence of Health Information Technology Savings and Costs\"(Girosi, Meili, & Scoville, 2005); and ++ \"The Diffusion and Value of Health care Information Technology\"(Bower, 2005). Kaiser Permanente (staff and publications). Miscellaneous other sources (Health Affairs, American Enterprise Institute, ONC survey, Journal of Medical Practice Manageme nt, news articles and perspectives). As noted at the beginning of this analysis, it is difficult to predict the actual impacts of the HITECH Act with much certainty. We be lieve the assumptions and methods described 596 herein are reasonable for estimating the financia l impact of the provisions on the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but acknowledge the wide range of possible outcomes. 8. Summary The total cost to the Me dicare and Medicaid programs between 2014 and 2019 is estimated to be $15.4 billion in transfers. We do not estimate total costs to the provider industry, but rather provide a possible per EP and per eligible hospital outlay for implementation and maintenance.

(FISCAL YEAR) - (IN BILLIONS) Medicare Eligible Medicaid Eligible Fiscal Year Hospitals Professionals Hospitals Professionals Total 2014 Explanation of Benefits and Savings Calculations In our analysis, we assume that benefits to the program will accrue in the form of savings to Medicare, through the Me dicare payment adjustments. Exp ected qualitative benefits, such as improved quality of care, better health outcomes, a nd the like, are unable to be quantified at this time. D. Accounting Statement Whenever a rule is considered a significan t rule under Executive Order 12866, we are required to develop an accounting statement indi cating the classificati on of the expenditures associated with the provisions of this final ru le. Monetary annualized benefits and nonbudgetary costs are presented as discounted flows using 3 percent and 7 percent factors. Additional 597 expenditures that will be undertak en by eligible entities in orde r to obtain the Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments to adopt and de monstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology, and to avoid the Medicare payment adjust ments that will ensue if they fail to do so are noted by a placeholder in the accounting statement. We are not able to explicitly define the universe of those additional costs, nor specify wh at the high or low range might be to implement EHR technology in this final rule. Expected qualitative benefits include improve d quality of care, better health outcomes, reduced errors and the like. Private industry cost s will include the impact of EHR activities such as temporary reduced staff productivity related to learning how to use the EHR, the need for additional staff to work with HIT issues, and administrative costs related to reporting.

We believe there are many positive effects of a dopting EHR on health care providers, quite apart from the incentive payments to be provided under th is rule. We believe th ere are benefits that can be obtained by eligible hospitals and EPs, including: reductions in medical recordkeeping costs, reductions in repeat tests, decreases in length of stay, and reduced errors. When used effectively, EHRs can enable providers to deliver health care more efficiently. For example, EHRs can reduce the duplication of diagnostic tests, prompt provide rs to prescribe cost-effective generic medications, remind patients about preven tive care, reduce unnecessary office visits, and assist in managing complex care. We also believ e that internal savings will likely come through the reductions in the cost of providing care. While economically significant, we do not believe that the net effect on individual providers will be negativ e over time except in very rare cases. Accordingly, we believe that the RFA objectiv e to minimize burden on small entities is met by this final rule. In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 599 List of Subjects 42 CFR Part 412 Administrative practice and procedure, Health facilitie s, Medicare, Puerto Rico, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 42 CFR Part 413 Health facilities, Kidney di seases, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 42 CFR Part 495 Administrative practice and pro cedure, Electronic health record s, Health facilities, Health professions, Health maintenance organizations (H MO), Medicaid, Medicare, Penalties, Privacy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 600 For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services amends 42 CFR chapter IV as set forth below: PART 412\u2014PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS FOR INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES 1.

(4) Exceptions . The Secretary may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt an EP from the application of the payment adju stment under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirement for being a meaningful EHR user would result in a significant hardship for the EP.
