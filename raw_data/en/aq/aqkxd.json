This study aimed to evaluate the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in China and give suggestions for vaccination strategies and immunization programs accordingly. Methods: In March 2020, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted online among Chinese adults. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, the impact of COVID-19, attitudes, acceptance and attribute preferences of vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors of vaccination acceptance. Results: Of the 2058 participants surveyed, 1879 (91.3%) stated that they would accept COVID-19 vaccination after the vaccine becomes available, among whom 980 (52.2%) wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while others (47.8%) would delay the vaccination until the vaccine's safety was confirmed. Participants preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) to emergency vaccination (9.0%) or either of them (41.6%). Logistic regression showed that being male, being married, perceiving a high risk of infection, being vaccinated against influenza in the past season, believing in the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination or valuing doctor's recommendations could increase the probability of accepting COVID-19 vaccination as soon as possible, while having confirmed or suspected cases in local areas, valuing vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making could hinder participants from immediate vaccination. Conclusion: During the pandemic period, a strong demand for and high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination has been shown among the Chinese population, while concerns about vaccine safety may hinder the promotion of vaccine uptake. To expand vaccination coverage, immunization programs should be designed to remove barriers in terms of vaccine price and vaccination convenience, and health education and communication from authoritative sources are important ways to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-08-27", "cleaned_text": "Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination during the COVID-19 Pandemic in China [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030482](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030482) [Vaccination and Public Health: Optimizing Vaccine Uptake through the Application of Social and Behavioral Science Theory, Principles, immunization is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions to prevent infectious diseases, vaccines against COVID-19 are considered to be of great importance to prevent and control COVID-19 [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00482), [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00482)]. Countries worldwide are trying to accelerate the research and development of COVID-19 vaccines, and it has been reported that there have been more than 160 candidate vaccines to date, with around 20 candidates in clinical evaluation [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00482), [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00482)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00482), [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00482), [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482)]. Reports on the acceptance and uptake of pandemic vaccines, such as for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, have shown unsatisfying results, as the willingness to receive the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine among the general public ranged from 17% to 67% across studies from Australia, America, Greece, the UK and [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00482), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00482), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00482), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00482), [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00482), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00482), [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00482), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00482)]. Previous studies on vaccine acceptance and theories of health behavior, such as the health belief model or protection motivation theory, have identified many factors that influence the acceptance or uptake of a pandemic vaccine, including the risk perception of the disease, perception of vaccine safety and efficacy, general vaccination attitude, past vaccination history, recommendations from doctors, price, vaccination convenience and socio-demographic 10% of the population received a vaccination at the end of the domestic H1N1 outbreak in France compared to the vaccination intention of 17% or 27.4% [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00482), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00482), [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00482)]. Even in high-risk populations such as healthcare workers, only 25% received the pandemic H1N1 vaccination when it was provided for free in Beijing, China [ [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00482)]. The hesitancy or delay regarding vaccination was the primary reason for this discrepancy, even among those who had intended to get a vaccination [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00482), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00482), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00482)]. Recent articles have found that some impact factors on vaccination acceptance helped to explain vaccination hesitancy or vaccination delay behavior, and the cultural, social or political differences across countries should also be considered in the vaccination decision-making process [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00482), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00482), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00482)]. For novel vaccines against new emerging pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, public concern about vaccine safety was frequently identified as a serious barrier to vaccine acceptance [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00482), [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00482), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00482), [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00482), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00482), [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00482)], while attitudes and regarding vaccination\u2014especially influenza vaccination history\u2014were the major predictors of [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00482), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00482), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00482), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00482), [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00482)]. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown higher severity in terms of transmissibility and mortality compared with past pandemics of influenza, countries around the world\u2014including China\u2014are facing great pressure to control the current pandemic and prevent a possible recurrence of damaging waves or epidemics in the future. In this case, understanding the influencing factors of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and identifying common barriers and facilitators for vaccination decisions are important aspects in the design of effective strategies to improve the vaccine coverage rate among the general population [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00482), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00482), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00482), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00482), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00482)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design, Population and Sampling 2.2. the questionnaire included (1) socio-demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, marital status, education, employment status, family income and health status; (2) perceived perception of risk for the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents' work/study, income and daily life; (4) vaccination history, such as seasonal influenza vaccination in the past season; (5) acceptance, attitude, vaccination preferences for future COVID-19 vaccination and the importance of identified impact factors on the respondents' vaccination decision-making, such as vaccine price, convenience and doctor's recommendations. All questions were closed-ended, with tick boxes provided for responses. Most questions were treated as categorical variables, and self-reported questions were assessed on a five-point Likert scale, such as health status, perceived risk of infection and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents. 2.3. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Study Sample Characteristics [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00482-f001)shows the provincial distribution of respondents, and [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00482-t001)presents the basic characteristics, risk perception, impact of COVID-19 and vaccination history of respondents. In general, respondents were located in all 31 provincial administrative regions of Mainland China ( [Appendix A](#app2-vaccines-08-00482) [Table A1](#vaccines-08-00482-t0A1)). Half of them (50.2%) were between 31 and 50 years old, and 7.3% (n = 150) were more than 51 years old. In addition, 54.2% were female, 67.3% were married and 80.2% were employed. Regarding education background, 38.2% had a high school and below level of education and 55.4% had an associate or bachelor's degree. In terms of location, 58.1% were located in Eastern China and 79.6% lived in urban areas. In total, 74.2% thought that their health status was good or very good. The majority of respondents (51.2%) had a total family income in 2019 ranging from CNY 50,000 to CNY 150,000 (USD 7246 to 21,739). 3.2. Acceptance, Preferences and Impact Factors of the Future COVID-19 Vaccine [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00482-t002)presents the acceptance of the future COVID-19 vaccine and its impact factors among all respondents, as well as vaccination preferences in the vaccine accept group. Of the total 2058 respondents, 1842 (89.5%) thought that vaccination would be an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19, and 1879 (91.3%) would accept vaccination if the COVID-19 vaccine were successfully developed and approved for listing in the future. In terms of the importance of some factors in vaccination decision-making, the majority considered that their doctor's recommendation (80.6%) or vaccine convenience (75.7%) was an important factor affecting their vaccination intention. Over half of the respondents (59.9%) thought that the vaccine price was important. Among the 1879 respondents in the vaccine accept group, 52.2% wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible when it becomes available, while others (47.8%) would delay vaccination until they could confirm the vaccine's safety. Most respondents preferred to receive vaccinations with routine immunization schedules in advance of the epidemic (49.4%) rather than an emergency vaccination (9.0%) or accepting both immunization schedules (41.6%). In total, 64.2% showed no preference for domestic or imported vaccines, while 32.5% would prefer a domestic vaccine. 3.3. Influencing Factors of Vaccination Acceptance [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00482). Socio-demographic characteristics, risk perception, impact of COVID-19, vaccination history, attitude towards COVID-19 and impact factors in decision-making were included in the regression, with the vaccine delay group as the reference group (See [Table 3](#vaccines-08-00482-t003)). Besides, [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-08-00482)presents the results of regression, including significant factors at the 10% level of chi-squared which was estimated to have a roughly 37.3% H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccination rate [ [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00482)]. This reflects the difference in public perception about the two pandemics in terms of the disease severity, infection risk, vaccine importance or attitude, as well as some macro-level factors such as social or cultural factors across countries [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00482)]. As reported in this study, the pandemic has had a profound impact on the work, income or daily life of Chinese residents. To address these challenges, China has taken drastic measures and public health interventions to control the transmission of COVID-19 since the outbreak of the disease, and these actions have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19 [ [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00482), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00482), [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00482)]. Therefore, although 74.7% of respondents reported having confirmed or suspected cases in the county in which they lived, only a small portion (12.2%) perceived a high or very high risk of the disease. In comparison, we found that Chinese residents held strong beliefs about the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, as 89.5% thought that vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control COVID-19, even though the vaccine is still under development. This positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and the large perceived pandemic impact may explain the high acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among Chinese adults, as they perceive strong benefits from vaccination compared with the risk according to the health belief model [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00482), [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00482), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00482), [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00482), [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00482), [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00482)]. Moreover, our survey collected respondents' preferences for immunization schedules and vaccine production and found that they either preferred a routine immunization schedule (49.4%) or accepted both schedules (41.6%) and accepted both domestic and imported vaccines (64.2%). All these findings represented a good start in the process of achieving the coverage rate required to ensure herd immunity among the Chinese population, and the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccine development and listing for application for the public is therefore urged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic at this stage of Australian people stated that they would wait to see if there were any adverse events before agreeing to get vaccinated, while their acceptance rate was as high as 67% [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00482)]. Two reasons may explain the vaccine delay observed in this study: firstly, the vaccine against COVID-19 was still under development during the survey period, and there was no information about vaccine safety for reference; secondly, concerns about using new vaccines during a pandemic were reported to differ from those of established products in a non-crisis situation, as the uncertainties about new vaccines, new emerging infectious diseases and concerns about the pharmaceuticals would lower the vaccine confidence of the public [ [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00482)]. However, the hesitancy that our study reported may be reduced later, when a vaccine becomes available, as a quantitative study in Dutch reported that, once the safety of newly-introduced vaccines becomes comparable to that of vaccines which are already on the market, the importance of this factor on vaccination decision-making becomes less than other attributes such as vaccine effectiveness or cost [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00482)]. This also requires an increased focus on vaccine safety in the research and development of new vaccines and better performance in terms of many other vaccine attributes such as price and convenience to increase vaccine uptake, especially for those who accept vaccination but with hesitation. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00482), [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00482), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00482), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00482), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00482), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00482), [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00482)]. Furthermore, we found that those who valued doctor's recommendations tended to get vaccinated immediately, while those who valued vaccination convenience or vaccine price in decision-making tended to choose delayed vaccination. Inconsistent results were shown in previous studies from the UK, France or Australia concerning the impact of socio-demographic characteristics on the acceptance of a pandemic vaccine [ [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00482), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00482), [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00482), [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00482)], and we found that, among the Chinese population, male or married respondents were more likely to accept immediate vaccination against the pandemic, while respondents' education or income may not influence their intention. Our findings are useful for designing effective vaccination strategies and immunization programs for those with vaccine hesitancy. Firstly, the vaccine price should be affordable for the public, and it is promising that China has stated that it aims to make its COVID-19 vaccine a global public good when it is ready for application [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00482), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00482), [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00482)]. Secondly, measures should be taken to increase vaccine convenience and accessibility in terms of vaccine manufacture, distribution, supply, immunization service, etc. [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00482), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00482)]. Last but not least, monitoring information about vaccine safety should be made public on a regular basis after the application of the vaccine, and timely health education and communication conducted by authoritative sources such as healthcare professionals will be critical to alleviate public concerns about vaccine safety [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00482)]. In response to future possible pandemics, health departments and other sectors should consider regular vaccination and education programs for established vaccines for non-pandemic infectious diseases such as influenza to improve overall vaccine confidence and the compliance of the public [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00482), [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00482), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00482)]. 5.
