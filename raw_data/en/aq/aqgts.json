This is the theory that there is one unifying energetic force that makes biological life functional. Other cultures have a different word for this same vital force, for example, Chinese medicine uses the word \"chi\" while Ayurvedic medicine uses the word \"prana\". A curative Homeopathic medicine given at an optimal dose, which has been individually selected for a patient is prescribed with the intention of supporting the self-healing capacity of this person's vital force. Rather than symptomatically opposing this self-healing capacity, a Homeopathic medicine holistically encourages the full resolution of a patient's health issues with sympathy and assists in achieving a thorough cure of the acute or chronic challenge. This is achieved by utilising the therapeutic vital force in nature's bounty of medicines - chosen from plants, minerals and other natural sources. Each of the 8,000 plus Homeopathic medicines has a known therapeutic profile derived from prior ethical testing on humans, so selecting a suitable medicine is a process of matching the patient profile derived from case taking, to the most similar one of the known medicine profiles. Homeopathic medicines are uniquely potentised according to a pharmacopoeia standard to make their vital force even more therapeutically available for healing. In follow-up patient reviews, assessment is made that the Direction of Cure has occurred, where the most important issues get better first, and even old unresolved problems get sorted in reverse chronological order. It's amazing to see a patient's medical history finally get sorted. No wonder that the World Health Organisation recognises Homeopathy as the second most widely used system of medicine in the world.
