So today i want to ask you a question. If you could listen to someone describing you to another person. What is it that you want them to say? What would be the thing that you would feel really good knowing that's what people were saying about you? Think about that for a second. How about this: \"What I like about her is here energy. I just love her energy.\" If someone were say that about you, you could be pretty happy about that. Now maybe a lot of other things that describe your qualities, but in some way having abundant energy is really a critical factor. It makes all the difference in the world. That's where chiropractic comes in, the purpose of chiropractic is to remove interference from the nervous system. So without trying to do things to you, Chiropractic is about removing interference from those communication path ways in your body. When you do that then you have all the energy you can possibly get available to you. We want to talk about later about. How you can access higher levels of energy but just think about that. Would it be nice if you had energy in abundance? That's what we can do for you here at Irvine Spine and Sport. "}
