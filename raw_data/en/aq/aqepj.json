The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is addressing this problem by advancing the development of a robust pancreatic cancer research community and providing it with the tools needed to share resources and discoveries. Since the start of the organization's research grants program in 2003, we have awarded more than $10 million through 66 research grants to outstanding scientists nationwide. These grants are having a tangible and significant impact in growing the pancreatic cancer research community. Grantees have utilized the funds they have received to make progress in understanding the basic biology of the disease, developing better diagnostic tools, and improving treatment options. Just as important, our grantees are staying in the field, as the story on page 1 illustrates. Nearly 70 percent of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network grant recipients have received subsequent funding to continue studying pancreatic cancer. The results speak for themselves: For every dollar the organization has invested in the grants program, grantees have received an average of more than eight dollars in additional research funding. Furthermore, our efforts to increase federal dollars available for pancreatic cancer researchers are contributing to this evolving research community. The majority of subsequent dollars that our grantees go on to secure\u201464 percent \u2014came from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), illustrating the critical role the federal government plays in advancing pancreatic cancer research. The continuation and growth of this funding is instrumental in making real progress in fighting the disease and realizing our Vision of Progress to Double the Pancreatic Cancer Survival Rate by 2020 . This situation also emphasizes why it is essential that the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (S. 362/H.R. 733) passes. As you will see in the article on page 4, we are pulling out all the stops to secure co-sponsorship of the bill by half of the U.S. Senate and half of the House of Representatives by November 2011. Time is running short, so I hope I can count on your support in helping us realize this important goal. Find out now what actions you can take to encourage your members of Congress to support the bill and ensure its passage. In addition, thank you for your continued generous support of our comprehensive efforts. They are working and a robust pancreatic cancer research community is taking shape.

This review means only the most promising science is selected for funding. Scientific understanding of pancreatic cancer has historically been hindered by limited private and federal funding and a sparse and fragmented research community. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network solves this problem by advancing the development of a robust pancreatic cancer research community and providing it with the tools to share resources and discoveries. In early 2011, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network rigorously evaluated its research grants program, focusing on investigators who received grants between 2003 and 2009. The evaluation results are extremely encouraging: the organization's grant recipients are staying in the field of pancreatic cancer, receiving impressive funding to support subsequent research, and publishing their findings in reputable biomedical journals. As a result, a comprehensive pancreatic cancer research community is forming. LEVERAGING OUR INVESTMENT Grant recipients have successfully leveraged the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's research investment, allowing them to expand their scientific investigations and advance in pursuing medical breakthroughs for pancreatic cancer. From 2003-'09, the organization invested $4.8 million in research funding, made possible by private donations and volunteer fundraising. Grant recipients leveraged this investment into $41.7 million in additional pancreatic cancer research funding. In other words, for every dollar that the organization spends, grantees received an average of $8.61 in additional research. Nearly 70 percent of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network grant recipients have received subsequent funding to continue studying pancreatic cancer. DISSEMINATING SCIENTIFIC RESULTS To date, the grant recipients have published 219 scientific articles pertaining to pancreatic cancer, thus distributing their scientific findings to the research community and allowing other scientists to build upon their results. Ninety- two percent have published at least one pancreatic cancer related article, and the 219 articles have been cited by other scientists nearly 3,500 times. BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH COMMUNITY In addition to research funds, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network offers grant recipients considerable career development opportunities. The aim of these mentorship and professional activities is to create collaborations among scientists, build future scientific leaders, and strengthen the pancreatic cancer research community. Whether providing funding for early-career scientists (Career Development Awards, Fellowships, and Pathway to Leadership Grants), or supporting novel research ideas (Innovative Grants), the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network strives to build a robust research community and provide the resources necessary to produce medical breakthroughs, and reach the goal of doubling the survival rate of pancreatic cancer by 2020. Quite simply, the organization speeds better treatments and cures for pancreatic cancer through more researchers, more research, and more collaboration. Note: Researchers receiving grants between 2003 and 2009 were evaluated for subsequent funding, and the publication results include grant recipients from 2003-'08. Grants awarded more recently have not yet been evaluated, as significant time is necessary to assess scientific progress.PROMISING RESULTS GENERATED THROUGH STRATEGIC RESEARCH INVESTMENTS Increases in annual research funding since the grants program's inception in 2003Get Ready for National Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. Go to pancan.org to learn how.2 October 2011 OUTREACHDr. Olive received the Tempur-Pedic Retailers\u00ae - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Career Development Award in 2011. A \"second generation\" Career Development Award recipient, Dr. Olive completed his postdoctoral training in the laboratory of David Tuveson, MD, PhD, recipient of a 2003 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Career Development Award and current Chair of the organization's Scientific Advisory Board. It is a testament to the success of our research grants program that Dr. Tuveson, whom we funded early in his career, has since become a leader in the field. Dr. Tuveson's mentorship of Dr. Olive has played a pivotal role in Dr. Olive's dedication to studying pancreatic cancer, and independently earning research funding from our organization. Dr. Olive completed his undergraduate studies at Bucknell University and pursued his PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His postdoctoral work with Dr. Tuveson took place at the Universities of Pennsylvania and Cambridge. Dr. Olive is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Pathology at Columbia University. During his doctoral studies at MIT, Dr. Olive worked in the laboratory of a renowned expert in mouse models of human disease, Tyler Jacks, PhD. Planning to remain in the field and incorporate more direct clinical applicability to his work, Dr. Olive contacted Dr. Tuveson. Dr. Tuveson's 2003 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network grant supported his laboratory's efforts to create the first genetically engineered pancreatic cancer mouse model, which closely mimics the progression of human disease. As a proof of principle, studies conducted in the genetic mouse model by Dr. Olive, while working with Dr. Tuveson, have now led to highly promising human clinical trials. Now that Dr. Olive has established his own laboratory at Columbia University, he strives to create a balance between basic science, clinical work, and translational research that bridges the two. His project funded by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network focuses on a critical question: How does exposure to extremely low oxygen conditions impact pancreatic cancer cells? Other cancer types are known to create networks of blood vessels to ensure proper vasculature, or blood supply, to the tumor. However, due in part to experiments conducted by Drs. Olive and Tuveson in the genetic mouse model, it is now known that pancreatic tumors have poor vasculature. Among the factors contributing to the low oxygen levels is the dense tissue (microenvironment) surrounding pancreatic tumors, which impedes the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, while also protecting against therapeutic interventions. Dr. Olive's work on deciphering the relationship between the tumor cells' response to low-oxygen conditions and the microenvironment could elucidate important clinical targets to treat pancreatic cancer. Dr. Olive dreams of expanding his \"mouse hospital\" so that he can study mice genetically engineered to develop pancreatic cancer and gain valuable insight into treatment of human patients. His type of experimental design is extremely resource-intensive, and therefore quite challenging for a young investigator to undertake. According to Dr. Olive, funding from the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and institutional support from Columbia University make this type of work possible. Dr. Olive believes the current state of the field of pancreatic cancer represents \"an extraordinarily exciting time\" regarding research into the disease. He is also optimistic about the future: \"I am determined to remain in the field until we are done with this disease.\" MEET A GRANTEE KENNETH OLIVE, PHD: TRANSLATING BASIC BIOLOGY INTO CLINICAL BENEFIT \"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, yet is underfunded and lacks the same extent of public awareness that other forms of cancer have. This is something that we at Tempur-Pedic hope to help change.\" \u2014 Rick Anderson, President, Tempur-Pedic \u00ae, North America Kenneth Olive, PhD Rick AndersonOctober 2011 OUTREACH 3The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will award more than $3.1 million to research through its 2012 grants program, representing the largest annual total distributed by the organization to date. Since the grants program's inception in 2003, 66 grants have been dispersed totalling more than $10 million. In early 2011, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network underwent a rigorous evaluation of its grants program. Findings showed that recipients were able to leverage their Pancreatic Cancer Action Network grants into significant subsequent funding towards their study of the disease and have been very successful at publishing and disseminating their results. Please see page 1 for more details. In addition to providing funding for research projects, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network also strives to mold future leaders of the field. Three of the research grant mechanisms are designed to support scientists early in their career: Fellowship, Career Development, and Pathway to Leadership awards. Mentor relationships are created between early career researchers and more senior scientists. Grant recipients are given multiple opportunities to interact with members of the organization's Scientific and Medical Advisory Boards, gaining invaluable advice and potential future collaborations. The deadline for these early career award applications is October 31 by noon ET. The final grant mechanism is the Innovative Grant, supporting projects that are novel, ask original questions, or utilize unconventional experimental approaches. Independent investigators at any stage of their career are welcome to apply for Innovative Grants. This mechanism also invites cancer researchers focused on other tumor types to apply their expertise to pancreatic cancer, further strengthening and expanding the pancreatic cancer research community. The deadline for Letters of Intent for the Innovative Grant has passed. The 2012 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network grants will once again be administered in partnership with the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). The AACR's involvement ensures unbiased funding of the most meritorious research projects via a rigorous peer-review system. Grant applications must be submitted online through proposalCENTRAL (https://proposalcentral.altum.com). The grant terms start July 1, 2012. Scientists seeking additional information may visit www.pancan.org/grants or contact Rhonda Aizenberg, PhD at raizenberg@pancan.org.

Go to pancan.org to learn how.4 October 2011 OUTREACHThe Pancreatic Cancer Action Network has been relentlessly working to garner support for the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (S. 362/H.R. 733), the first-ever substantive legislation that will lead to the creation of a federal strategic plan for pancreatic cancer research. Thanks to the work of our volunteers, the bill has already achieved significant bi-partisan support, but we are now at a critical juncture for moving the bill forward and getting it passed. OUR GOAL: Secure Half of Congress as Co-Sponsors by November As Congresswoman Anna Eshoo notes in her article on the next page, we can get this bill passed, but it is going to take every one of our supporters to help us reach the finish line. Our goal is to secure the support of half of the U.S. Senate and half of the House of Representatives by November 2011. You can help by participating in the Co-Sponsorship Countdown, our fall campaign to secure the support of individual members of Congress who are especially important to passing the bill. THREE IS THE MAGIC NUMBER: Two Senators Plus One Representative For a bill to become a law, it must pass both the Senate and the House. That is why it is critical that you visit our Advocacy Action Center at www.pancan.org/takeaction and complete the Action Alerts directed to both your senators and your representative. Several alerts are listed on the page because they target different congressional groups. For example, there is an alert focusing on states represented by senators who sit on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP). If you live in one of those states, please complete that alert. If not, please forward it to someone you know who does live in one of those states and complete one of the other alerts. There are other great ways to make your voice heard as well. Consider visiting your Member's district office to ask for support or sending a letter to the editor of your local newspaper calling on your senator or representative to co-sponsor the bill. You'll be most effective if you coordinate these activities with your local affiliate, which you can find by visiting www.pancan.org/volunteer. If you don't live near an affiliate or have other questions about advocacy, contact us at advocacy@pancan.org or 202-742-6699. TRACK YOUR PROGRESS We've set an ambitious goal, but it is achievable with your participation. You can check on your state's progress at www.knowitfightitendit.org/action. The states on the map turn increasingly purple as more co-sponsors from the state delegation are secured. Together we can Paint the Country Purple and pass the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act!JOIN THE CO-SPONSORSHIP COUNTDOWN RECOGNIZING OUR HEROES IN CONGRESS *September 30, 2011At press time*, the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (S. 362/H.R. 733) had received the impressive support of 34 senators and 169 representatives. Our goal is to secure 50 percent of the members in each legislative body as co-sponsors of the bill. We thank the current co-sponsors for their outstanding leadership on this issue and for their continued commitment to fighting pancreatic cancer. Go to these links to see the most up-to-date lists of the members of Congress who have agreed to support the bill: www.pancan.org/senate www.pancan.org/houseOctober 2011 OUTREACH 5U.S. Representative Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA) serves as a tireless champion for the pancreatic cancer community. Here, she shares her thoughts about what steps need to be taken to ensure passage of the landmark, bipartisan Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (H.R. 733/S. 362). As the chief sponsor of the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act in the House of Representatives, I'm proud to lead the effort for increased awareness, funding and research for a disease that affects tens of thousands of families across our country. I'm in awe of, and always inspired by, your efforts and advocacy for this critical legislation. Due to these efforts, my legislation currently enjoys the bipartisan support of nearly 170 House members. This sort of unity doesn't happen often these days in Washington, but we're not over the finish line yet. As you know, the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act will establish a national Pancreatic Cancer Initiative to provide a greater focus on this disease and require the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to develop a strategic research plan to fight it. Ultimately, the bill will give the NCI the necessary tools it needs to diagnose and treat this disease earlier, and perhaps one day, prevent it. With the midway point of the 112th Congress approaching, we only have a year left to move the bill through the legislative process and get it to the President's desk for his signature. While no magic number of co-sponsors will guarantee passage, our goal should be to secure 218 House co-sponsors and 50 Senate co-sponsors to demonstrate the necessary support for the legislation to pass. Members of Congress need to hear from their constituents about the issues they care about the most. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's amazing community advocates serve as a vital component in this process. Asking your representative or senator to co-sponsor the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (H.R. 733 in the House, and S. 362 in the Senate) will help us to build the necessary co-sponsors and critical support for the legislation. I first became involved with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network when my friend and mentor, former United Nations Ambassador Dick Sklar, struggled so bravely in his own fight against this horrible disease. He asked me to do everything I could to ensure that the generation after him didn't have to face the same insurmountable odds he did. I made a promise to him then to carry on the fight and I'm committed to pushing this legislation across the finish line. REP. ESHOO: WORKING TO ENSURE PASSAGE OF A GAME-CHANGING BILL ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL ADVOCACY DAY Approximately 500 advocates representing all 50 states helped turn Capitol Hill purple on June 13 and 14, 2011, through their participation in the fifth annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day in Washington, D.C. Thanks to these efforts, dozens of new co-sponsors have been secured for the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (S. 362/H.R. 733). Advocates also helped educate members of Congress about the need for increased resources for pancreatic cancer research. \"Each year, Advocacy Day grows larger, and the volume of all of our voices gets louder on Capitol Hill,\" said Julie Fleshman, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network President and CEO. \"We are extremely grateful for this tremendous support. The momentum we have now generated within Congress would not be possible without our incredible volunteers.\" Mark your calendar and plan to attend next year's Advocacy Day on June 25 and 26, 2012. Registration opens in Winter 2012. Supporters gather on the steps of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., at Advocacy Day 2011.Rep.

They play an important role in the development of new treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer clinical trials are necessary to determine whether new treatments are beneficial to people living with the disease. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network recommends that all patients consider clinical trials when exploring treatment options. Jordan Berlin, MD, serves as Associate Professor and Clinical Director of GI Oncology and Phase I Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. He also is the chair of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Medical Advisory Board. Recently, he shared his thoughts on the importance of clinical trials participation. Q: Why are clinical trials important in pancreatic cancer? A: Clinical trials are more important in pancreatic cancer than in any other cancer because we have not yet particularly succeeded in improving patient survival. Without clinical trials, we will not develop new drugs and new treatments that will hopefully increase survival and the cure rate of this disease. Q: What are the potential benefits and risks of clinical trials? A: The benefits and risks come from the same issue: the outcome of the trial is unknown. Patients could possibly benefit more from the new (experimental) treatment than the current standard treatment. There is also the risk that the new treatment may be less effective than the standard treatment. However, most of the time, when a clinical trial is not successful, it does not mean that the new treatment is worse than the standard treatment. It simply means that the new treatment is not better than the standard treatment. Another benefit of participating in a clinical trial is receiving top-notch supportive care. Q: Who should consider participating in a clinical trial? A: Most pancreatic cancer researchers believe that all patients who have the option and are eligible should consider a clinical trial. Because pancreatic cancer treatments are not as effective as we would like, many consider clinical trials as a standard of care option for patients with pancreatic cancer. Patients should consider clinical trials each step of the way, if possible. Patients should investigate their clinical trial options from the very beginning, because it starts them on a path of learning about clinical trials and the potential for participating in multiple clinical trials. Q: What are the different phases of trials? A: Clinical trials have three main phases: Phase I, II and III. Phase I is the first chance in the research process either to combine new drugs together or to give a patient a brand new drug. The goal of the trial is to learn about the side effects of the drug and how the body uses it, and to determine the highest dose that can be given safely. The dose established in a Phase I trial is used as the proper dose in a Phase II trial. A Phase II trial enrolls a group of patients with the same disease. This phase is the first disease-specific trial using the new treatment. The goal is to find out how effective the new drug is compared to what we have seen in the past from other trials or with other drugs. Some Phase II trials are randomized, which means that patients are randomly assigned by a computer to one treatment or another. If a new drug or combination of drugs show promise in a Phase II trial, we compare them to the standard of care in a Phase III trial. The goal in a Phase III trial is to find out if the new drug or combination of drugs is better than or equivalent to the standard of care, and if the benefits of the new treatment will make us change the way we treat patients. All Phase III trials are randomized. Q: What is the importance or significance of Phase III trials? A: Phase III trials are the best way to find a new standard for treatment. Once a Phase III study is completed, the groups of patients can be directly compared to one another to evaluate outcomes. (In other words, researchers can see if one group did better than the other group.) If the patients on the new treatment did better, a new standard of care may be Jordan Berlin, MD UPCOMING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES Learn about pancreatic cancer from experts in the field by attending one of our upcoming educational programs.

Therefore, this type of trial may result in drugs gaining approval by the FDA and changing the way doctors treat patients. Promising treatments may emerge in other phases, but those trials are not definitive enough to change standards of care or the way we treat patients. Q: What are the benefits for patients who participate in Phase III trials? A: Hope. Hope that something in the new trial may give the patient a better treatment option. And, if not them, that the treatment or the results of that trial will help other patients in the future. Another benefit is the chance to participate in new research and potentially receive a new drug. Not every patient will get the new drug but every patient will at least get the standard of care. However, it is unlikely that patients will be able to access that new drug in any other way except participation in the trial. By the time a drug gets to a Phase III trial, it has the most evidence of both safety and efficacy. Q: Why should patients consider enrolling in a Phase III trial? A: The reason to choose a Phase III trial, or any trial, should be based on what the patient has learned about the trial. The benefit of participating in a Phase III trial as compared to a Phase II trial would be that more is known about the treatment. So, the safety is a little more assured and a stronger potential exists that the new treatment will be better than the standard treatment. However, some patients prefer not to be randomly assigned and they choose a Phase II trial. The bottom line is that all trials are needed; we need patients to enroll in every phase in order to make progress. The specific criteria for each trial need to be reviewed by the physician who is recommending the trial so a patient knows what may be an option.

I am a 71-year-old retired chemist living at the shore near Atlantic City. Before July 2010, I was the envy of my peers. I was able to ride my bike, walk many miles on the Boardwalk and play doubles tennis several times a week. However, during the first week in August, I began to feel poorly with loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort and general lethargy. After visiting my gastroenterologist and undergoing a series of diagnostic tests, including an X-ray, ultrasound, CT and MRI scans, I was diagnosed with gall stones and pancreatitis. At no time during this period was cancer ever suggested as a cause of my symptoms, nor was cancer detected in any of the tests. Finally, in late September, after getting control of my newly found diabetes with insulin and convincing a surgeon and anesthesiologist that I could withstand surgery, I underwent laparoscopic removal of my gall bladder. During the follow-up visit with the surgeon a week later, he informed my wife and me that he had seen suspicious \"implants\" during my surgery on my peritoneum and fatty tissue, and that he had removed samples for biopsy. These samples tested positive for adenocarcinoma, which probably originated in my pancreas. Wow, what a shock that was! A PET/CT scan detected a tumor on the head of my pancreas, as well as metastases on my liver, peritoneum, omentum (fatty tissue) and bowel surfaces. Also, a CA19-9 blood marker test showed a high value of almost 8,000. In other words, I had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which the surgeon and oncologist deemed inoperable. I was told that my only option for treatment was chemotherapy. On October 9, I began my chemotherapy regimen. Fortunately, I had minimum side effects. My primary complaint was fatigue, which eased after a few days. My chemotherapy continued for the next nine months until June of 2011. I also had two complications which required hospitalization; a small intestine blockage in early November, and cellulitis in both legs in March. Nevertheless, with each passing month I felt better, regained my appetite and, most importantly, experienced dramatic decreases in my CA19-9 numbers. Now for the best news: PET/CT scans run in April and June 2011 showed no evidence of my cancer on any of the sites seen previously. I was declared to be in remission and the chemotherapy was stopped. In addition, my diabetes is now under control and I no longer take insulin. Today, I feel great and am walking, riding my bike and playing tennis again. My wife, family and friends, who have provided great support to me, are ecstatic about these results. I have volunteered to be part of the Survivor and Caregiver Network for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and enjoy sharing my success story with other survivors and caregivers. I am realistic about my future, knowing that pancreatic cancer may come back. However, I am determined to enjoy each day and do everything I can to remain positive!A STORY OF HOPE AND INSPIRATION By Brian R. Bootel, Ventnor City, New Jersey Brian R.

The five emeritus members of the SAB are Teri Brentnall, MD; Ralph Hruban, MD; Elizabeth Jaffee, MD; Margaret Mandelson, PhD and Selwyn Vickers, MD. \"On behalf of the entire organization, I wish to thank each of these departing board members for all of their valued contributions and expert guidance in helping to shape the highly regarded research program of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network,\" said Julie Fleshman, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network President and CEO. In the wake of the departure of the emeritus members, seven new members joined the SAB in July 2011. Several of the new board members are previous or current recipients of research grants from the organization, illustrating the fact that the grants fund the best and brightest scientists poised to become the future leaders of the field. The SAB is a volunteer advisory body comprising leading cancer researchers from institutions across the United States. The board provides advice, scientific expertise and leadership to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in regard to the research and scientific program goals and initiatives of the organization. The new members join David Tuveson, MD, PhD; Petersen, PhD; Margaret Tempero, MD and Geoffrey Wahl, PhD on the SAB.

PANCREATIC CANCER SPECIAL CONFERENCE SET FOR JUNE 2012 The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Pancreatic Cancer Special Conference will take place from June 18 to 21, 2012 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will proudly serve as the lead sponsor of the event and work with the AACR to offer an inaugural special conference completely focused on pancreatic cancer. Scientists and physician/scientists at various stages of their careers will have the opportunity to interact with experts in the field, fostering information-sharing, collaboration, and increased attention regarding the disease. To learn more, go to www.pancan.org/AACRconference 10 October 2011 OUTREACHOn August 14, 2011, when pancreatic cancer survivor Dennis Cronin took his first step at PurpleStride Pittsburgh, he was accompanied by a team comprising30 family members, friends and 10 co-workers from his company, insurer Highmark Inc., and its subsidiary companies, HM Insurance Group (HM) and United Concordia. Dennis first became aware of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network through the Patient and Liaison Services (PALS) program. In part because of his enthusiastic support of the organization, his co-workers formed the fund-raising team that walked in PurpleStride Pittsburgh. They made great strides in the fight against pancreatic cancer. Companies are served well by stepping into the world of charitable giving. Such support just makes good business sense. According to the 2010 Edelman goodpurpose study, 86 percent of consumers surveyed believe that business needs to place at least equal weight on societal interests as it does on business interests. The companies within the Highmark organization have a long history of charitable giving, and every year at the HM Insurance Group/United Concordia annual producer conference, money is raised for a designated charity through donations and a silent auction. In 2011, the conference's planning committee selected the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network because, according to Dennis, \"they cared about the battle.\" Initially, the effort generated $17,000, but HM and United Concordia each matched what was raised for a total donation of more than $54,000, an impressive amount given Highmark shared no prior history with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. Theresa Dukovich, Pittsburgh Affiliate Coordinator, was invited to a special check presentation where she formally thanked Dan Lebish, Chairman and CEO of HM Insurance Group and United Concordia; Mike Sullivan, President and COO of HM Insurance Group; and Chip Merkel, President and COO of United Concordia, for their generous support. \"Charitable giving is an important part of our companies' role in the communities where we live and work,\" Dan said. \"We are pleased to support the efforts of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network to help those battling the disease. This cause hits particularly close to home and we are glad to raise funds for an organization that has done so much for our colleague and friend, Dennis.\" PITTSBURGH'S HIGHMARK LEADS THE WAY IN CAUSE-RELATED CORPORATE GIVING The Highmark team presents their check. With 55 offices on four continents and more than 4,100 employees, Lockton, Inc., the world's largest privately owned, independent insurance brokerage firm, enjoys a significant global presence. However, on April 23, 2011, the focus turned local when the Kansas City Agency Associates joined together for PurpleStride Kansas City. The camaraderie was due to John \"Jack\" Lockton III, the company's founder who passed away from pancreatic cancer at age 61 in 2004, one year after receiving the national Woodrow Wilson Center Award for Corporate Citizenship. Jack's inspiring legacy of philanthropy lives on at his company; all Lockton offices are involved in philanthropic causes around the world, so it was fitting that the founder's memory was honored in such a manner in his hometown. As a Presenting Sponsor of PurpleStride Kansas City, the company had already committed to supporting the fight against pancreatic cancer. But the Associates went one step - or many strides - further, with 70 team members raising more $21,000 for the cause, bringing the total donation to more than $26,000. Their efforts earned the Lockton team the Top Fundraising Team Award for the event. The team also included a member receiving the event's highest individual fundraiser award. \"We embraced this organization and regardless of the amount of time we had to plan and fundraise for the event, it was going to be a success,\" said Sara Harper, Community Relations Specialist. \"But the true heroes of the event were the pancreatic cancer survivors who bravely stood on stage that day with tears in their eyes and said 'thank you' to all the supporters. It was an amazing day for all!\" To learn more about becoming a PurpleStride sponsor, contact Mary Jo Kennedy, Director of Community Outreach, at mjkennedy@pancan.org.

To set up a Legacy Fund, please contact Donor Relations at 877-272-6226. \"I established the James Jay Katz Legacy Fund in honor of my son, who died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 49. I felt the need to support efforts to find a cure in his memory so that other families do not have to experience such a terrible loss. By supporting the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, I feel I am being as proactive as possible in finding a cure for pancreatic cancer.\" \u2014Natalie Katz A DEVOTED SURGEON HELPS OTHERS DURING HIS OWN BATTLE WITH PANCREATIC CANCER When Kenneth Lee, MD, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on March 19, 2009, he and his wife, Amy, were understandably shocked by the news. Married for 21 years, the Lees shared an idyllic life together until that time. After meeting in high school, the couple completed their educations and settled near their hometown in Ohio. The close- knit family, which eventually grew to include their children Nora, Madeline and Patrick, loved spending time together playing games, exploring the outdoors, skiing and hiking. Since the couple worked as health care professionals at the nearby Cleveland Clinic, they felt somewhat prepared to face Ken's diagnosis. \"Ken was a general surgeon, so he was well aware of what lay ahead,\" Amy said. \"He had operated on many cancer patients during his career, so he was strengthened by the wisdom they shared with him during their own battles with the disease.\" Still, the family needed to know more about pancreatic cancer. A co-worker soon introduced them to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. \"We saw that it was more than a resource for education; we were impressed by the emphasis the organization placed on research,\" Amy said. \"We came to learn it was the best place for furthering the fight against the disease, so we began supporting it.\" The entire family ran in PurpleStride Cleveland 2009 just three months after Ken's diagnosis. They have participated in it every year since. \"The event was held in a park just a few minutes from our home where Ken and I ran cross country in high school, so it felt right to be there,\" Amy said. Their support of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network continued throughout Ken's 22-month journey with the disease. During treatment, Ken underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy in order to prepare for possible surgery. Following this, Ken and his surgeon agreed that surgery was a viable option. The position of his tumor would require a complicated surgery to extract it, as well as two thirds of his pancreas, his stomach and his spleen. The surgery was deemed technically successful, but Ken faced many challenges in its aftermath. Although the cancer eventually returned, Ken lived with the hope for a better future with pancreatic cancer detection and treatment, continuing to support the efforts of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. He completed his journey with the disease on January 4, 2011, at age 45. \"Once Ken passed, my brother and sister-in-law set up a Keep the Memory Alive page in his memory,\" Amy said. \"Many of our friends and colleagues made donations through it. They also made contributions through PurpleStride.\" To date, more than $64,000 in gifts have been made to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in Ken's memory, illustrating how beloved he was to those who knew him. Ken served as the guest speaker at the 2010 PurpleStride Cleveland six months before his death. There, he shared his hopes about pancreatic cancer research. \"I believe advancements in biotechnology will find novel ways to attack this problem in the near future. We need to spread awareness of just how dangerous this disease is and try to spare people in the future from facing this beast,\" he said. \"Progress has been made in pancreatic cancer research. I believe breakthroughs are possible within less than a decade if enough resources can be directed toward this. \"Amazing advances have been made in treating breast cancer and HIV because of the huge resources directed toward those problems. For the sake of future pancreatic cancer patients, I ask for your support of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network,\" Ken said.

We are honored to join them in the fight to end pancreatic cancer.\" Hockey Fights Cancer is a component of the NHL's \"Biggest Assist Happens off the Ice\" campaign, the League's long- standing tradition of addressing important social issues in North America and worldwide. Hockey Fights Cancer is a joint initiative by the NHL and the NHLPA to raise funding and awareness for hockey's most important fight.
