Plants include many substances that could be of a value in the whitening of the skin and working as anti-aging agents. A wide range of articles related to natural skin whitening and anti-aging agents have been reviewed. Many plant-derived and natural molecules have shown to affect melanin synthesis by different mechanisms, examples include Arbutin, Ramulus mori extract, Licorice extract, Glabridin, Liquiritin, Kojic acid, Methyl gentisate, Aloesin, Azelaic acid, Vitamin C, Thioctic acid, Soya bean extracts, Niacinamide,  and -hydroxy acids, Lactic acid, Chamomile extract, and Ellagic acid. Some of the widely used natural anti-aging products as natural antioxidants, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and coenzyme Q can counteract the effects of reactive oxygen species in skin cells and have anti-aging properties on the skin. It was concluded that many natural products including antioxidants can prevent UV-induced skin damage and have whitening and anti-aging effects. It is very important to develop and stabilize appropriate methods for the evaluation of the whitening and anti-aging capacity of natural products and their exact mechanism of action to ensure real efficacy based on evidence-based studies. The attention should be oriented on the formulations and the development of an appropriate vehicle to ensure suitable absorption of these natural products in addition to evaluating the suitable concentration of these molecules required having the desired effects without causing harmful side effects.", "sitename": "http://www.eurekaselect.com", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Natural molecules are becoming more accepted choices as cosmetic agents, many products in the market today claim to include natural components.
