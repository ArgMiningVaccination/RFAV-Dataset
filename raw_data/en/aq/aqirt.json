With this in mind, we have: - Worked with healthcare providers to ensure they understand the concerns that LGBT people may have - Conducted a survey to find out your views and concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines - Held an online Q&A event with Dr Michael Brady and Dr Luke Wookey on the 12 March, hosted by Reeta Loi Our survey showed lots of support and enthusiasm for the vaccination. However, we are aware that some LGBT people may have concerns and we want to address those so that you can receive the vaccination confidently and safely. Here's the main questions identified in our survey: Will the vaccination interact with my hormone replacement treatment (HRT)? If you are trans and are on HRT, there is no scientific reason to suggest that the vaccination could interact in any way with your HRT medication. There is also no reason to suggest it could impact on your hormone levels. Will the vaccination interact with my HIV medication such as ART? There is no scientific reason to suggest that the vaccination could interact in any way with your HIV medication. If you are living with HIV, it's encouraged that you get a COVID-19 vaccination. There is no evidence that the vaccine will interact with ART, PrEP or PEP. For clinical guidance relating to HIV medication and the COVID-19 vaccination, go to [page 16 of the government's Green Book](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/955548/Greenbook_chapter_14a_v6.pdf): [Click here for up to date information and advice about HIV and COVID-19 from British HIV Association (BHIVA)](https://www.bhiva.org/SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-advice-for-adults-living-with-HIV-plain-english-version-update) Will the vaccination interact with my PrEP or PEP medication? There is no scientific reason to suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines could interact in any way with PrEP. It's encouraged that you have a vaccination when it is offered to you, and continue to take PrEP in the same way that you normally do, and PEP if you need it. If you have any further questions about the vaccination, please contact your GP who should be able to answer these. If you do not have a GP, and would like support to find an LGBT-inclusive GP, please contact our Pride in Practice team at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) If you want to speak to someone about how you're feeling about COVID-19, including the vaccines, you can call our helpline on 0345 3 30 30 30 from 9am-9am on weekdays and 10am-6pm on weekends.
