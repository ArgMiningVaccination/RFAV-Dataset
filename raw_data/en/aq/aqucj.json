Plus and minus grades with the exception of grades of A+ earned at another institution will be recorded on the Lake Forest College transc ript, but are not counted in the Lake Forest GPA. If you are a recipient of an associate of arts (AA) or associate of science (AS) degree in an applicable liberal -arts field from an accredited community college, you may be granted full junior standing (16 Lake Forest College credits). All coursework completed in the AA or AS degree must be applicable towards a Lake Forest degree and have received a grade of C - or better to be transferable. An official transcript from the issuing institution must be given to the Registrar's Office before any academic work done elsewhere may be accepted for Lake Forest College credit. The Registrar evaluates transcripts and awards transfer course credit; students may appeal decisions to the Academic Appeals Board. How Credits Transfer The Office of the Registrar makes the official evaluation of transfer credit upon acceptance to the College and receipt of a student's enrollment deposit. Once the Regist rar has determined how many transfer courses can be counted toward the Lake Forest College degree, you will be assigned class standing as follows: at least 15 Lake Forest credits equates to junior standing, at least 7 Lake Forest credits to sophomore stand ing, and fewer than 7 credits to first year standing. Lake Forest College weighs its own courses at four (4) semester hours. Normally, each 15 semester hours of transferrable credit will be considered equivalent to 4 course credits at Lake Forest, with eac h 3 semester credit hour course transferring as 0.8 Lake Forest course credits. International Credits Students seeking to transfer in credits from colleges or universities outside the United States will be required to provide any and all course description s, syllabi, or other supplementary materials about the courses for review and evaluation by the Registrar's office. Students may be required to have an evaluation done by WES or ECE. Students will work with faculty advisors and department chairs to determi ne how transfer courses meet major and minor requirements. Transferring Credits 19 Reverse Transfer Credit Policy Current Lake Forest College students who have transfer credit from a community college but have not earned an associate degree may be eligible for reverse transfer. Students can transfer their Lake Forest College coursework back to their community college for review of the college's associate degree requirements. Students must meet the following requirements to be eligible: Have completed a minimum of 15 semester hours at the community college. Have completed a minimum of 11.25 Lake Forest College credits (45 semester hours) of eligible coursework at Lake Forest College. How the process works: Lake Forest College will inform you if you meet the eligibility criteria for reverse transfer. Fill out the Reverse Transfer Form and submit it to the registrar's office. This form will be sent, along with your transcript, free of charge for the purposes of rev erse transfer. Your community college will evaluate your Lake Forest College courses to determine if they will complete your remaining associate degree requirements. If you meet the requirements for an associate degree, your community college will inform y ou and send Lake Forest College an updated transcript. Reverse Transfer Form How Your Credits Fulfill Our Requirements The Office of the Registrar determines which transferred credits apply to the Forester Fundamental Curriculum at the time of your official transcript evaluation. Individual department chairpersons determine if transferred courses meet major require ments. Below is a brief summary of the FFC requirements. Many courses are designed to fulfill more than one requirement. View the requirements in more detail . Effective January 1, 2020 Transfer students from Illinois community colleges who have completed their Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree, with no grade on the transcript less t han a C -, will automatically fulfill the Distribution Requirement in each of the 5 areas listed. 1. First Year Studies The Forester Fundamental Curriculum begins with the College's First -Year Studies Program. This also includes a writing requirement 2. Dis tribution Requirement Students must complete one course in each of five areas: Creative and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, and Social Sciences. 3. Cultural Diversity Requirement Students must complete one course in each of two areas: US Domestic Pluralism and Global Pluralism. 4. Skills Requirement Students must complete at least one course in each of three areas: Writing Intensive, Speaking Intensive, and Technology Intensive. 5. Experiential Learning Requirement The goal of this requirement is to ensure that students integrate their traditional classroom learning with experientially -based work. By connecting theory and practice, students develop new skills and extend their knowledge and training to unfamiliar task s and situations beyond the classroom environment. The Experiential Learning requirement is fulfilled in two parts: the completion of an appropriate experience or activity and the production of a written reflection. 20 6. Senior Studies Requirement A senior s tudies course, also known as a senior \"capstone,\" is a culminating experience in the student's major. The course emphasizes writing and speaking and encourages integration of the methods and content explored in the major. Senior theses, research projects, and creative projects may also be used to fulfill the senior studies requirement. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Scores Advanced Placement Students who have successfully completed Advanced Placement courses and the appropriate examinat ions provided by the College Entrance Examination Board may apply for college credit for this work. Scores of 4 or 5 on the examinations may entitle students to at least one course credit; scores of 1, 2 or, in most cases, 3, are not granted credit. A score of 4 or better on both the microeconomics and macroeconomics exams is required for one course credit in economics. Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and Inte rnational Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department. Advanced Placement Credit Table International Baccalaureate Students who have successfully completed International Baccalaureate courses and taken the higher -level examinations provided by the IB Program may apply for college credit for this work. Grades of 4, 5, 6, or 7 on the examinations entitle students to at least one course credit; grades of 1, 2, and 3 are not granted credit. Each department determines the specific amount of credit to be awarded. Credit will not be granted for both Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate program examinations in the same department. International Baccalaureate Credit Table Scores From This Year If the College's registrar has not yet received your AP or IB test and you wish to take a course in that discipline, you should register for the lower -level course in the department in qu estion. For example, if you took the AP Test in Psychology, you should register for Psychology 110. Once we receive your score and determine that it satisfies our criteria, we will notify you so that you may change your schedule and enroll in the higher -level course - after consulting with your advisor, of course. Credit By Examination Students may apply to pass a regular course by special examination without prior enrollment. Consent of the instructor and approval of the Dean of the Faculty are required. Where appropriate, the instructor may set requirements in addition to the examination itself. For credit to be awarded, a grade of D - or better must be earned on the examination, but the student's transcript will show only a P (Pass). Special examinations are not allowed for courses that are usually part of pre -college curricula (for example, elementary languages or elementary mathematics) and are not normally allowed in courses previously audited or in which a student was enrolled. Students will be charged for course credits they earn by examination. 21 Tuition, room and board, and other student account charges are due each semester, for all students; including those who have received permission to return late according to the schedule below : Fall Semester Statements Due: August 15 Spring Semester Statements Due: January 15 All tuition and fees are due in full according to the due dates above unless enrolled in a Student Accounts Office monthly payment plan .

Here you can learn more about the Student Accounts refund policies for overpayments, withdrawals, and reduction in charges. Refund of Over -Payments Sometimes a student overpays on his/her account, usually through the receipt of loan funds needed fo r living expenses or books. In accordance with federal regulations, if the refund is created entirely by federal funds (title iv funds), then the school will process the refund within the time limits of federal law. Otherwise, refunds will be processed aft er the add/drop date. Refund Policy Refunds are issued in the name of the student and mailed to the home address in most cases.

Deposits are refunded only if admission is denied or a class is closed or cancelled. Paymerang Refunds are disbursed by Paymerang, the College's accounts payable service, using an electronic check or direct deposit (ACH). Students receive an ACH enrollment email from notifications@paymerang.com early in the semester.

This amount is often referred to as the \"expected family contribution\" (EFC) and is determined by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This EFC is not a literal figure , so it does not reflect the amount you will actually need to pay. If your family believes it needs help in paying college costs, you should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or \"FAFSA.\" The \"EFC\" (estimated family contribution) determined by the FAFSA is not a literal figure and does not reflect the amount you/your family will actually need to pay. Cost of School - Family Contribution = F inancial Need Need -based financial aid is available in three categories, described below. Other details are found by clicking the link. Grants - \"Free money\" that does not have to be repaid Loans - Money borrowed by the student or parent, repaid over several years Work -Study - Money earned by working part -time during the year, usually on campus Financial Aid 33 Recipients of financial aid are responsible for reading and understanding these policies, including the requirements connected with scholarships, grants, loans and work -study. Acceptance of your aid signifies that you have read and understood the obligations and responsibilities as described on this Guide. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid if you have any questions. 1. You do no t need to sign and return your Award Letter. We assume you are accepting all funds. As noted above, accepting the aid is an indication that you accept the terms and conditions under which the aid is offered. If you are accepting some but not all of the fun ds offered, please draw a line through each source you do not want, place your initial to the right, and return one copy to the Office of Financial Aid. 2. If you asked us to consider any \"special circumstances\" (ex: income change, healthcare costs, education al expenses, etc.) or if you made an appeal for additional financial aid, and if you received additional need -based grant funds as a result, you will be expected to use all federal student loans offered. If you do not, we reserve the right to reduce the gr ants back to the amount you would have normally received without the appeal. 3. You must report all financial aid awards received from sources outside of the College. The ability to secure such assistance is always advantageous, even though it may affect exis ting financial aid (including but not limited to work -study, student loans, Lake Forest College Grant, Founders Grant). The new total of all grant and scholarship funds will at least equal the amount of grant assistance provided by the College alone. 4. Conti nued eligibility for financial aid is dependent on maintaining \" Satisfactory Academic Progress\" or SAP. At the end of every semester you must achieve and maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of a least 2.00 and must complete at least 67% of all classes attempted. If you do not meet SAP standards you will be placed on \"financial aid warning\" for one semester, but will continue to receive financial aid. If you do not meet these standards after the semester of warning status, you will be placed on \"financial aid suspension\" and will not be eligible to receive financial aid until you meet SAP standar ds. If extenuating circumstances have kept you from making satisfactory progress, you may appeal your \"Financial Aid Suspension.\" The appeal must include an academic plan (approved by the advisor) on how you plan to meet this standard within a reasonable time -frame. If you appeal and are granted an extension of the aid, you will be placed on Financial Aid Probation, on a semester -by- semester basis. 5. Financial aid awards at the College are made for a one -year period. If you continue to show financial need, make Satisfactory Academic Progress , and complete the renewal applications by the annual deadline, you can expect your financial aid to continue at a similar level each year. Scholarship recipients must meet the individual renewal requirements. 6. To receive the FORESTER FLAGSHIP GRANT each year, you must remain eligible for the Federal Pell Grant and Illinois MA P Grant, and continue to live on campus. 7. Unless noted otherwise, the financial aid you have been offered assumes enrollment as a full -time student. If you plan to be enrolled less than full -time, notify us immediately, as your aid will prorated. 8. The maximu m timeframe to receive your financial aid is, for an undergraduate program measured in credit hours, a period no longer than 150 percent of the published length of the program. That means, for most students enrolled in a full -time, four -year degree program eight semesters long), 12 semesters is the maximum length of time to receive federal aid. Scholarships and Grants provided by the College will normally continue for the length of time required to complete your first bachelor's degree, up to six years of full-time study. Policies 34 9. If you withdraw from the College during the semester, you are subject to the College's ref und policy and federal guidelines. If you received federal funds and withdraw before completing 60% of the term, federal guidelines require that we review your eligibility for those funds. We must apply a federally - mandated formula called \" Return of Title IV Aid \" to determine how much of the federal funding you are allowed to retain. The Business Office will als o determine the resulting charges for which you will be billed. 10. There are a number of endowed and annual scholarship funds the College administers for which you may be eligible. If selected, the scholarship will replace part of your need -based grant aid pr ovided by the College. Scholars are usually selected and notified early in the fall semester. 11. You may have charges other than tuition, fees, room and board billed to you from the College or charges from a previous school year. If so, we assume you give the College permission to credit your Title IV assistance toward theses charges, if necessary. You may rescind your permission at any time. 12. You must submit all required application materials and supporting documents to the Office of Financial Aid before all f inancial aid will appear on your billing statement. Examples include Loan Master Promissory Notes, Entrance Counseling, tax returns and verification worksheet (if requested), etc. Failure to submit requested information may result in the loss of funding fr om one or more programs. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid to find out if you have completed all the steps necessary to secure funding for you. Enrolled students are able to view their status on my.lakeforest.edu . 35 A grant is usually awarded based on \"financial need\" and does not need to be repaid. Grants come from several sources including the College, some states, and the federal government. Grants listed below ar e the most common programs available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. To apply for a grant, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year. Follow the appropriate link for information for students from Canada and other foreign countries. Lake Forest College Grant This grant, provided directly from the Colle ge, is available only to full -time students. Most students who qualify for financial aid can expect a substantial amount of their need to be met by a Lake Forest College Grant. While most eligible students receive grants ranging from $2,500 - $10,000 for a year, grants of varying amounts are made based on your individual circumstances, application and eligibility. Lake Forest Founders Grant This grant is awarded to students who show \"financial need\" as determined by the College.

Other State Grant Programs There are currently just a a few states - Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont for example - that offer funds which can be us ed at an out -of-state college/university. If you are a resident of one of these states, and meet the requirements (set by each state) the funds may be used here at Lake Forest. Since the grants are awarded by the states themselves, contact the higher educa tion agency in your home state to learn more. See the section \" State/Location Specific \" within our Outside Scholarships page . Outside Sources of Funding Your ability to secure outside funding is always advantageous. For that reason you are encouraged to apply for national, state, and local grant that you may be eligible to receive. Fu nds are awarded at various levels by businesses, churches, civic organizations, and foundations. Visit our outside scholarships webpage page for examples of funding available. If you do receive assistance from another source, we may be required to reduce other funds you have been offered. Grants and Scholarships from the College usually require full -time enrollment, while federal and state grants may also be used for part -time enrollment. They do not need to be repaid, and will appear on your billing statement 37 without further action after confirming your enrollment. College Grants (and m ost federal and state grants) may be used in the fall and spring semesters, and may be used for many off-campus programs. An annual application is required. Eligibility continues until graduation requirements have been completed, to a maximum of six years. We make a considerable effort to keep your grant aid at a similar level from one year to the next. There are, however, many factors which determine eligibility for need -based aid, including: the number of people in your household, the number of household members in college, taxable and untaxed income, and any \"special circumstances\" you ask us to consider. Changes in any of these categories from one year to the next may affect the grant aid you receive in subsequent years. Related Links Federal Pell Grant Illinois Grant Programs MAP Grant Rights & Respon's 2022 -2023 Pennsy lvania Grant Vermont Grant 38 Educational loans are available from a variety of sources, allowing students and/or parents to borrow funds that can pay some or all college costs. Loans must be repaid, with interest, usually after graduation. They will appear on your billing statement after your enrollment is confirmed, and you have completed the necessary promissory note and entrance interview. First -time borrowers will be notified of the application process early in the summer, and do not need to complete anything until that time. Loan Types Student Loans Stafford Loans Private Loans Parent Loans PLUS Loans While the \"best\" loans are federal loans based on financial need, and require the annual comp letion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) there are programs for virtually every family, regardless of income. Many loans do not require repayment while the student is enrolled. Interest Rates, 2021 -2022 Academic Year 3.73% Undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans 5.28% Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate students 6.28% Parent PLUS loans for parent and graduate students These rates are in effect for all Direct Loans with a first disbursement on or after July 1, 2021 and before July 1, 2022, and remain fixed for the life of the loan. Interest Rates, 2022 -2023 Academic Year Rates are set annually, based on the last auction of the 10-year Treasury Note in May. We normally post the new rates on this page in late M ay, or early June. 4.99% Undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans 6.54% Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate students 7.54% Parent PLUS loans for parent and graduate students Interest Rates, general information Rates are set annually, based on the last auction of the 10 -year Treasury Note in May. We normally post the new rates on this page in late May, or early June. Rates are calculated using a base 10 -year Treasury Note Index plus an add -on amount for each loan program \u2014 2.05% for Direct Sub sidized and Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, 3.60% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate and professional students, and 4.60% for parent and graduate PLUS. Loans 39 Under the current interest rate structure, all Direct Loans except Direct Consol idation Loans will be \"variable - fixed,\" meaning students would receive a new rate with each new loan, but then that rate would be fixed for the life of the loan. There are also interest rate caps at 8.25% for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students, 9.50% for Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate and professional students; and 10.50% for parent and graduate PLUS. Borrow Wisely Wise management of your loan will establish a strong credit history. Borrow only the funds you need. You are not required to borrow the full amount shown on your Award Letter. See How Much to Borr ow? If you decide to limit borrowing, consider that - in most cases - the most appealing loan is the subsidized Stafford, followed by the unsubsidized Stafford, followed by the Federal PLUS, followed by a private (non -federal) loan. If you need to borrow t o cover special costs, complete the Loan Supplement and return it to the Office of Financial Aid. If you have to borrow an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, PLUS Loan or private (non -federal) loan, try to make at least interes t payment while you are enrolled. What's even better? Begin repaying principal and interest. Keep copies of all loan documents in a single, well -marked folder. This will make them easy to find when questions arise. To help insure all payments are made on time, consider setting up an automatic debit from your checking or savings account. 40 \"Work -Study\" is simply an opportunity to have a part -time job while going to school. Jobs are in administrative offices, academic departments, the library, th e sports center, campus security, and other campus locations. Federal Work -Study This need -based program is funded by the government and the College, and is awarded to eligible U.S. citizens and permanent residents. We offer work -study funds to students wh o live on campus and qualify for the Federal Pell Grant. Lake Forest College Work -Study This program is primarily need -based and is funded by the College. It is awarded to international students who qualify and hold proper visa status, and (on a limited ba sis) to students who do not qualify for federal work -study funds. How much can be earned? Students who are eligible under either program are normally offered up to $2,500 for the year though the amount is not guaranteed. This equates to approximately 14 ho urs per week, which is the maximum number of weekly hours a student may work. Once a student earns the amount offered, the College reserves the right to end that student's employment for the year. Students who have not been offered funds from either program are generally not permitted to work on campus. If all eligible students have been placed in jobs and positions remain open, it is possible for others to be offered employment. Students are paid by \"direct deposit\" or check every two weeks, unless d ifferent arrangements have been made with the Office of Business Affairs. How do I find an on -campus position? A current listing of on -campus jobs is posted on Handshake , the College's career platform. Students with Work - Study included on their financial aid award letter have priority for all on -campus positions. Search for Lake Forest College as the employer and apply to those you are interested in. Note that, as a general rule, students are limited to two on -campus positions unless granted authorization from the Business Office. Students must complete employment forms i n the Office of Business Affairs before beginning work. Students are expected to treat their position like any other job. Once a work schedule has been established, students are expected to show up at the agreed -upon times. Students who are unable to work at an assigned time are expected to inform his/her supervisor in advance. Repeated absences and other inappropriate conduct are not acceptable and are grounds for termination. Opportunities for off -campus employment Job opportunities exist in the community , although they are not considered \"work -study\" positions. Lake Forest College students have access to part -time jobs through QuadJobs , a free marketplace that connects local families and small businesse s with Lake Forest College students seeking part -time employment. Students can find internships in Handsha ke, Lake Forest's online career portal and job board.

At the end of every semester you must achieve and maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of a least 2.00 and must complete at least 67% of all classes attempted. If you do not meet SAP standards you will be placed on \"financial aid warning\" for one semester, but will continue to receive financial aid. If you do not meet these sta ndards after the semester of warning status, you will be placed on \"financial aid suspension\" and will not be eligible to receive financial aid until you meet SAP standards. If extenuating circumstances have kept you from making satisfactory progress, you may appeal your \"Financial Aid Suspension.\" The appeal must include an academic plan (approved by the advisor) on how you plan to meet this standard within a reasonable time -frame. If you appeal and are granted an extension of the aid, you will be placed on Financial Aid Probation, on a semester -by-semester basis. The appeal form is available from the Office of Financial Aid. More, detailed information about this policy can be found here . If you have been notified of \"financial aid suspension\" complete the Financial Aid SAP Appeal Form . Satisfactory Academic Progress 46 Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree In order to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree, students are expected to complete 32 cred its, fulfill the general education requirements, attain at least a 2.00 overall Lake Forest College grade point average (without rounding up), and complete the requirements of a major. Credit is earned, recorded, and tallied by courses rather than by semester hours. Normally, a student is expected to fulfill graduation requirements within four year s. All students, including transfer students, must fulfill these requirements. While students are encouraged to work closely with their academic advisors and to heed the advice of the Registrar's Office to make sufficient progress to complete degree requir ements, students are ultimately responsible for keeping abreast of their degree requirements. Undergraduate Curriculum 47 A comprehensive advising and guidance program at the College recognizes the need for supportive counseling in all matters related to a college education. Thus, advising takes place in a variety of settings, with more or less formality depending on the circumstances, and at all stages of progress throughout a college career. New students are assigned a faculty advisor at the outset who assists with overall program planning, course selection, registration, career choices, and any academic difficulties or personal problems as they may arise. First -year students are taught by their advisor in a First -Year Studies seminar during the fall term. These first-year advisors serve in an advisory capacity for the entire first year. During the sophomore year, students may retain their first -year advisor or choose another faculty advisor. Students must select a major field of study by the end of the sophomore year, and, accordingly, choose an advisor from the faculty members in the relevant department or interdisciplinary major. Faculty advisors in the major assist students in drawing up a program of courses in their major field and other academic areas, and provide necessary guidance throughout students' undergraduate careers. Academic Advising 48 All students must successfully complete the Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC) for graduation. The FFC is intended to ensure that students will recei ve breadth, as well as depth, in their education while continuing to allow them considerable latitude in designing their individual programs of study. The FFC also includes requirements for cultural diversity, specific skills (writing, speaking, technology ), and experiential learning. The requirements are designed to ensure that all students achieve specific college -wide learning goals . The FFC consists of six main requirements: 1. First Year Studies (including the Writing Requirement) 2. Distribution Requirement 3. Cultural Diversity Requirement 4. Skills Requirement 5. Experiential Learning Requirement 6. Senior Studies Requirement Many courses are designed to fulfill more than one requirement. 1. First Year Studies The Forester Fundamental Curriculum begins with t he College's First -Year Studies Program, which was established to create a special, intellectually engaging atmosphere of close interaction between first -year students and their professors. First -Year Studies instructors also serve as the academic advisors for the students in their First -Year Studies (FIYS) course. These courses have as their principal aim the development of basic skills in writing, critical reading, analysis, and oral communication. The FIYS course is required of all students entering the College with fewer than four credits and does not meet any additional FFC requirement. First -Year Writing Requirement The College supports the transition to the College's writing intensive curriculum through First Year Studies. Students write frequently i n FIYS courses and are provided with substantial feedback on their writing to help them progress. While most students will make sufficient progress as writers in their First Year Studies courses to satisfy the First -Year Writing requirement, students who n eed additional instruction and explicit guidance in writing processes and skills will be required to take College Writing 100 to prepare them to meet the expectations of the writing curriculum at the College. Recommendations for College Writing 100 are mad e by the Director of Writing Programs, in collaboration with FIYS professors. 2. Distribution Requirement Students must complete one course in each of the five areas listed below. Each course must come from a different department or interdisciplinary area (i.e. the requirement must be fulfilled with five courses with five different course prefixes). Courses satisfying this requirement will be tagged with the designation listed below in the course catalog and class schedule. Distribution Requirement Course Tag Creative and Performing Arts CP Learning Goals Humanities H Forester Fundamental Curriculum 49 Natural Sciences NS Quantitative Reasoning QR Social Sciences SS 3. Cultural Diversity Requirement Students must complete one course in each of the two areas listed below. Courses satisfying this requirement will be tagged with the designation listed below in the course catalog and class schedule. Cultural Diversity Requirement Course Tag US Domestic Pluralism DP Learning Goals Global Perspectives GP 4. Skills Requirement Students must complete at least one course in each of the three component areas. Courses satisfying this requirement will be tagged with the designation listed below in the course catalog and class schedule. Skills Requirement Course Tag Writing -Intensive W Learning Goals Speaking -Intensive S Technology -Intensive T 5. Experiential Learning Requirement The goal of this requirement is to ensure that students integrate their traditional classroom learning with experientially -based work. By connecting theory and practice, students develop new skills and extend their knowledge and training to unfamiliar tasks an d situations beyond the classroom environment. The Experiential Learning requirement is fulfilled in two parts: the completion of an appropriate experience or activity and the production of a written reflection. Experiential Learning Activities (EL) The following activities can be used to satisfy the experiential learning requirement. Each activity links to frequently asked questions. 1. Pre-Approved, Credit -Based Options (minimum of 1 credit) a. Course with an EL tag b. Career Advancement Center (CAC) internship program for academic c redit (1.0 credit or more) c. Global Engagement Office (GEO) appro ved off -campus study d. Senior thesis e. Independent research/creative project f. For-credit summer research g. Fractional experiential credits that sum to 1.0 credit i. Sample fractional projects: for -credit independent research/creative project, for -credit -credit peer mentoring, for -credit tutoring, 4 -week Summer Richter, fractional for -credit internship ii. When the fractional credits sum to 1.0 credit, students work with an academic advisor to review the FFC-EL Fractional Credit Completion Guide and submit the FFC-EL Fractional Credit Comple tion Form . 50 2. Non -Credit Options that Require Approval (from the FFCIS: Forester Fundamental Curriculum Implementation Subcommittee) a. Non -credit experiential project (common) i. Sample non -credit relevant on -campus employment; organization, publicity, senior recital performance. ii. Students work with a faculty project supervisor to propose a non -credit project and attain pre-approval from FFCIS before embarking o n the experience ( see FFC -EL Non -Credit Application Guide and FFC-EL Non -Credit A pplication Form ). iii. At the conclusion of the project, students work with a faculty member to review the FFC- EL Non -Credit Completion Guide and submit the FFC-EL Non -Credit Completion Form ). b. Retroactive experiential project (rare) i. Sample retroactive (already -completed) projects: non -credit internship; off -campus study (not GEO -approved); independent research/creative project completed before transferrin g to Lake Forest College; career -related summer employment. ii. Students work with an academic advisor to propose a project for an already -completed experience. Together, they review the FFC-EL Retroactive Application Guide and submit the FFC-EL Retroactive Applicatio n Form . Written Reflection Students must submit a written reflection (500 -word minimum) that adheres to the following guidelines: 1. Summarize the project and evaluate how it applied skills that you gained in the classroom. 2. Explain how the project added new skills to your competencies. 3. Articulate how you will describe to a prospective employer, graduate school, or other audience the ways in which this experience contributed to and enhanced your education. Generally, the reflection is submitted to and approved by the supervisor of the experience (e.g., instructor for the EL course, CAC internship supervisor, GEO director, faculty supervisor, academic advisor etc.). These are stored electronically and will be used in future assessment of the FFC Experiential Lea rning requirement. 6. Senior Studies Requirement A senior studies course, also known as a senior \"capstone,\" is a culminating experience in the student's major. The course emphasizes writing and speaking and encourages integration of the methods and conte nt explored in the major. Students must fulfill this requirement, for which courses are specially designated within their major department. Senior theses, research projects, and creative projects may also be used to fulfill the senior studies requirement i f so designated in the major requirements or with permission of the department chairperson. Students who have more than one major must satisfy the senior studies requirement in each of their majors. 51 Frequently asked questions re garding the Experiential Learning requirement of the Forester Fundamental Curriculum (FFC -EL requirement) The sections below are labeled and correspond to individual sections of the FFC-EL requirement . 1a.

Students must complete at least one course in each of the three component areas: Writing -Intensive Courses (W) Upon successful completion of the writing -intensive requirement, students sh ould be able to: Articulate a written argument clearly and support it coherently. Speaking -Intensive Courses (S) Upon successful completion of the speaking -intensive requirement, students should be able to: Compose and deliver effective oral presentations. Technology -Intensive Courses (T) Upon successful completion of the technology -intensive requirement, students should be able to: Use some form of digital technology to solve a problem. Skills Requirement: Learning Goals 57 We believe that all Lake Forest College graduates should be able to: Demonstrate understanding of a broad range of 21st century approaches to knowledge production by engaging with key concepts, theories, and methods across the breadth of the liberal arts: Creative and Performing Arts, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, and Social Sciences. Demonstrate a deep understanding of at least one academic field, including its methods of inquiry, technological tools, and traditions o f scholarship, through the completion of a major program of study that culminates in a capstone experience integrating content and methods within that field. Locate, synthesize, and evaluate multiple and possibly divergent sources of information, thereby demonstrating the ability to think critically. Communicate clearly and persuasively when writing and speaking. Appreciate differences in social and cultural experience both within the United States and globally. Apply knowledge and skills in a purposefu l and reflective way to experiences outside the classroom. College -Wide Le arning Goals 58 In order to prepare students to think and act as responsible global citizens in the 21st century and in accordance with the College mission stateme nt (\"we embrace cultural diversity\" and prepare students \"to become responsible citizens of the global community\"), students are required to complete two courses focused on aspects of cultural diversity: one course that addresses issues of domestic plurali sm in the United States and one course that explores global perspectives. US Domestic Pluralism (DP) Upon successful completion of the US Domestic Pluralism requirement, students should be able to: Explain how one or more categories of diversity (race, ethnicity, national origin, social class, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity) enhance as well as complicate the U.S. experience, and Demonstrate an awareness of how issu es of power, position, and privilege impact the history and experiences of groups and individuals in the U.S. Global Perspectives (GP) Upon successful completion of the Global Perspectives requirement, students should be able to: Demonstrate an understa nding of one or more aspects of the social, political, cultural, economic, or historical context of at least one region of the world outside the United States. Cultural Diversity Requirement: Learning Goals 59 As a liberal arts institution, the College believes that the depth of specialization that is achieved within a major should be balanced by exposure to a range of knowledge and methods of inquiry, such as that found across the liberal arts. Students will satisfy the distribution requirement by completing one course in each of the five areas listed below. In order to encourage exposure to breadth of content, students must take courses from five different departments or interdisciplinary areas (i.e. the requirement must be fulfilled with five courses with five different course prefixes). Creative and Performing Arts (CP) Upon successful completion of the creative and performing arts requirement, students should be able to: Engage imaginatively with an artistic medium, and Express creative ideas by producing original work or by reinterpreting artistic work made by others. Humanities (H) Upon successful completion of the humanities requirement, students should be able to: Demonstrate an understanding of artistic, historical, intellectual, literary, or religi ous traditions, and Find evidence (textual, artistic, or otherwise), develop arguments from that evidence, and evaluate arguments made by others. Natural Sciences (NS) Upon successful completion of the natural sciences requirement, students should be able to: Explain the principles of scientific experimentation or observation, and Analyze and interpret evidence acquired through experimentation or observation. Quantita tive Reasoning (QR) Upon successful completion of the quantitative reasoning requirement, students should be able to: Employ basic notions of arithmetic and coordinate geometry, and Frame and solve problems using quantitative principles. Social Sciences (SS) Upon successful completion of the social sciences requirement, students should be able to: Identify factors affecting human behavior manifested in either individual actions or social systems, and Use evidence to explain the structur es and processes of social systems or human behavior. Distribution Requirement: Learning Goals 60 Major and Minor Programs The College maintains major and minor fields of concentration in both traditional academic departments and interdisciplinary programs. Departmental majors and minors permit depth of study in particular disciplines, while interdisciplinary programs encourage students to dra w connections among distinct bodies of knowledge and areas of inquiry. A major represents significant course work leading to substantial knowledge and competence in a given field; a minor entails less course work and is designed to produce basic knowledge and competence in a given field. Students may declare up to two majors and one minor or up to one major and two minors. Students declaring a major and a minor must complete course requirements in both major and minor fields. Upon successful completion of a minor, the student will have it recorded on his or her transcript. The Major Students may choose a major from among the many departmental fields or from a number of formal interdisciplinary majors designed by the College and supervised by faculty committees. In all cases, students are expected to declare a major by the end of the sophomore year and to make significant progress toward the completion of that major during the junior year. Every major will also include the culminating senior studies re quirement, ordinarily a senior seminar or a senior thesis. Students declaring a double major must complete course requirements in both major fields. It is possible for some courses to be counted toward both majors. However, the second major must consist of at least five separate courses, ones that do not double count, and at least three of these five must be at the 300 or 400 level. Majors may be pursued in the following interdisciplinary programs (noted with an asterisk) and departments. African American S tudies * American Studies * Area Studies * Art Asian Studies * Biochemistry and Molecular Biology * Biology Business Chemistry Communication Computer Science Data Science* Economics Education English Environmental Studies Finance French History International Relations Latin American and Latinx Studies * Mathematics Programs 61 Music Music Education Neuroscience * Philosophy Physics Politics Psychology Religion Self-Designed Major * Sociology and Anthropology Spanish Theater The Minor Students may declare a minor any time before they graduate but are not required to declare a minor for graduation. The minor must consist of at least six courses, including four courses that do not double count in the student's major or other minor. Minors are offered in the following departments and interdisciplinary programs (noted with an asterisk). African American Studies * American Studies * Area Studies * Art Asian Studies * Biology Business Chemistry Chinese Cinema Studies * Classical Stud ies * Communication Computer Science Data Science* Digital Media Design* Economics Education Educational Studies * English Entrepreneurship and Innovation * Environmental Studies Finance French Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies * Histor y International Relations * Islamic World Studies * Journalism * Latin American Studies * Legal Studies * Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies * Museum Studies * Music Music Education 62 Neuroscience * Philosophy Physics Politics Print and Digital Publishing * Public Policy * Psychology Religion Social Justice * Sociology and Anthropology Spanish Theater Urban Studies * Interdisciplinary Studies The College encourages interdisciplinary approaches to knowledge and supports majors and minors that seek to draw connections among traditional academic disciplines. Many of our majors and minors, listed above, cross disciplines. Self-Designed Major Program Some of our strongest students find that no one traditional major fully meets what they want to study. A student interested in psychoneuroimmunology could major in psychology and biology but still might find his needs aren't entirely met with those two departments alone. Working with a faculty advisor, students accepted into the Self -Designed Major program can develop their own major, culminating in a thesis or creative project. This major is compatible with the pursuit of a second major as well. The Self -Designed Major emphasizes self -determination for its students. The responsibility fo r initiative lies with students, beginning with presentation of their case for admission to the program. Second -semester sophomores or first -semester juniors are invited to apply and submit a detailed presentation of their proposal. The Self - Designed Major program takes place during the junior and senior years. Admission is determined by the Self - Designed Major Program Committee. 63 Independent Study Independent study, under the guidance and supervision of faculty members, offers challeng ing opportunities for investigating areas beyond the limits of regular courses. A student may engage in independent study for credit, given the availability and approval of a faculty member knowledgeable in the chosen subject matter. A total of seven indep endent study credits, including internships, may count toward graduation. Students are expected to arrange each independent study program before the end of the previous semester. A written proposal signed by the relevant faculty member must be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty for review. Proposal forms are available from the Students tab on my.lakeforest.edu. Independent Studies do not have established meeting dates/times. The learning objectives and academic requirements for these courses are determine d by the faculty member and the student, with the expectation that the total work completed shall approximate that expected for a regular semester course, except for partial credit tutorials, creative projects, and research projects (see \" Definition of a Lake Forest Credit \"). Students may enroll in half credit independent studies (given the availab ility and approval of a suitable instructor) on the understanding that the independent study will include half of the expected workload of a full credit tutorial, i.e. half of the typical 160 total hours over 14 weeks, plus suitable work completed as a fin al exam, paper, project, or performance. Students can complete the independent study over the course of the entire semester or over a shorter period, as approved by the instructor. Students may register for a half credit independent study during the add/d rop period using the same process as for a full credit independent study, subject to the approval of the instructor and department chair. If a student wishes to register for a half credit independent study after the end of the add/drop period, the instruc tor must seek approval on behalf of the student from the Dean of Faculty. Independent studies for other levels of partial credit must be approved by the Dean of Faculty. Instructors must seek this approval on behalf of the student. The following are the f our basic types of independent study: tutorial, creative project, research project, and senior thesis. Tutorial A tutorial is a course on a special topic not covered in a regularly offered course. Students meet regularly, usually individually, with their faculty supervisor to discuss the readings and are normally assigned a number of short papers. Recent tutorials have dealt with such topics as advanced Japanese, New Testament Greek, advanced Chinese, mysticism, European industrial revolution, recent bioet hical issues, and song writing. Students may take one tutorial a year beginning with the second semester of the first year, for a total of four tutorial credits. Creative Project A creative project is an independent course of work, under faculty supervision, in a creative medium such as painting, fiction, sculpture, poetry, photography, or music. Creative project credits are limited in the same way as tutorials (see above tutorial policy); senior projects in studio art may be approved for a maximu m of two course credits. Research Project A research project is more specialized and usually more advanced than a tutorial, requiring greater independence and originality on the part of the student. Students conduct scholarly research with a view to produc ing substantial work in the form of a term paper or report. Among recent projects undertaken were studies involving ethical issues on intellectual property, weblogs and their implications concerning cultural values and global business, the U.S. Social Secu rity system, and metastable hydrogen atom collisions. Juniors Special Course Work 64 and seniors are eligible to undertake research projects. A maximum of four research project course credits is allowed toward graduation, no more than two in a semester and no more than three in a year. Practicum Project A practicum project consists of a series of structured experiences that allow students to apply knowledge from their previous coursework in an applied setting on campus, under the supervision of a teaching faculty member. A practi cum project is distinct from the practicum courses that already exist in the College Catalog 200; EDUC common practicum projects might involve credit -based work as a peer teacher/mentor/tutor, laboratory technician, research assistant, publication editor, or program director. A practicum project requires a syllabus that details the duties, expectations, learning objectives, and grading criteria of the project. Students do not earn money for completing a p racticum project. Students may take a practicum project for 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1 credit, which require 40, 80, 120, or 160 total hours of work, respectively. A maximum of 2 practicum project credits is allowed toward graduation. With respect to the FFC, practicum project credits carry the EL tag (Experiential Learning) and will satisfy the FFC -EL requirement when the number of accumulated EL credits reaches 1 credit. Senior Thesis A senior thesis is original scholarly research undertaken in the student's senior year, usually over two terms. The research culminates in a formal written dissertation and oral examination that is evaluated by a faculty committee. Outstanding theses are awarded distinction at graduation. Senior theses may be undertaken for one or two course credits; normally two course credits will not be awarded in the same semester. 65 Accelerated Programs and Affiliations Accounting Engineering International Studies Law DePaul University School of Nursing Rush University College of Nursing Rosalind Franklin University College of Pharmacy Rosalind Frank lin University Doctor of Physical Therapy Rosalind Franklin University Doctor of Podiatric Medicine Rosalind Franklin University Physician Assistant Program Rosalind Franklin University Biomedical Sciences Program Rosalind F ranklin University Clinical Counseling Program Rosalind Franklin University Doctor of Allopathic Medicine Midwestern University Doctor of Optometry Midweste rn University Doctor of Dental Medicine Philosophy Communication Accelerated Programs 66 Mason School of Business's Master of Accounting Program Lake Forest College students studying accounting h ave the opportunity to take a fast track into the College of William and Mary's Mason School of Business. In addition to discounted summer programs after junior and senior year, the application fee has been waived and our students are eligible for special scholarships. The Mason School of Business at the College of William and Mary seeks to recruit and admit candidates to their Master of Accounting (MAcc) program who exhibit high achievement in academics and a strong desire to develop as ethical business le aders. Ideal candidates demonstrate potential to succeed in professional services careers and show a strong work ethic, drive, maturity, integrity and self -awareness. In a unique partnership, Lake Forest invites its exceptional students to apply for admiss ion (application fee waived) to Mason's one -year MAcc program without providing GMAT scores if they have a GPA of 3.25 or higher. In addition to those admission benefits, the College of William and Mary offers three students $10,000 scholarships plus the o pportunity to receive additional financial aid. If a Lake Forest student is accepted into the program, then s/he may choose to participate in the MAcc summer intensive classes (the MAcc \"boot camp\") as a way to fulfill MAcc prerequisites, either during the summer after her/his junior year or during the summer after her/his senior year. These boot camp classes carry costs additional to the tuition and fees associated with the MAcc program. Specifically, the MAcc program requires seven prerequisite classes, s ix of which are offered as 3 -credit hour classes during their summer boot camp (all but Statistics, which students must take as part of their undergraduate curriculum. It is agreed that all seven of these courses can be satisfied with specific Lake Forest College classes if the student receives a B - or better in that class: BUSN 130 Applied Statistics satisfies Statistics BUSN 230 Introduction to Accounting satisfies Principles of Accounting BUSN 330 Managerial Accounting satisfies Intermediate Cost Account ing BUSN 331 Intermediate Accounting satisfies Intermediate Financial Accounting I BUSN 332 Auditing satisfies Audit & Internal controls BUSN 335 Intermediate Accounting II satisfies Intermediate Financial Accounting II BUSN 430 Federal Tax Accounting sat isfies Introduction to US Federal Income Tax While BUSN 333: Cost Accounting is not a prerequisite to attend William and Mary, students are highly recommended to take that course as well. Students are required to complete any remaining prerequisites durin g the Mason's summer boot camp program immediately prior to starting the program. Accounting 67 Dual Degree Engineering Program Lake Forest cooperates with the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis , in a program designed for students who plan to become p rofessional engineers but who also desire a rigorous liberal arts education. With an enhanced background in the social sciences and humanities, the prospective engineer is better prepared to assume the responsibilities of leadership in contemporary society . The program requires each participating student to complete at least 24 course credits (at least 20 taken at Lake Forest College) before going on to the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Washington University for the final years of study. Adm ission to the program is at the discretion of Washington University. Students finishing this program will receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lake Forest and a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from Washington University. The Lake Forest Colleg e degree will be a B.A. with no major specified, unless all requirements for the major (including the senior studies requirement) have been met. There are two possible engineering programs: a 3-2 program , which typically requires three years at Lake Forest followed by two years at Washington University and results in B.A. and B.S. degrees; or a 3-3 program , which entails an extra year at Washington University, but culminates in a B.A., B.S., plus a Maste r's of Science degree in engineering. The exact selection, combination, and sequence of courses to be taken at Lake Forest College, both in the natural sciences and in the social sciences and humanities, depends on the type of engineering to be pursued at Washington University. While at the College the student must register as a major in mathematics, computer science, or one of the natural sciences. The chairperson of the major department must certify that the student has completed at least three -fourths o f the major requirements at the College. A GPA of 3.25/4.0 or better, both overall and in science and mathematics courses is required for admission to the Dual Degree Program. Applicants with lower GPAs are considered on a case -by-case basis. For further details regarding requirements, options, and course work at Washington University, students should consult with the program advisor at Lake Forest College. Early consultation with the program advisor is vital in order to formulate and undertake the most a ppropriate course schedule. The required core of courses includes the following: Math 110, 111, 210, and 214 (Calculus I & II, Multivariable Calculus, and Differential Equations); Chemistry 115 (Chemistry I); Physics 120, 121 (General Physics I & II); and Computer Science 112 (Computer Science I).

International Relations 70 Lake Forest College offers joint programs with several reputable law schools that are designed especially for students who want a bachelor's degree and a law degree in six years instead of the usual seven. We call them the \"3 + 3 BA/JD programs.\" Maurice A. Deane School of Law - Hofstra University The Maurice A. Deane School of Law at Hofstra University (Hofstra) and Lake Forest College have established an accelerated admiss ions program that allows eligible students to complete a Lake Forest College bachelor's degree and a Hofstra law degree in a shorter time period than usual. This arrangement permits a limited number of exceptionally well -qualified students to enter the law school after completing their junior year of undergraduate study at Lake Forest College. Students participating in this accelerated admission program receive a bachelor's degree from Lake Forest College following successful completion of the first year of law school and the law degree (J.D.) from Hofstra after successful completion of the required law school curriculum. Juniors at Lake Forest College applying for admission to this accelerated admission program must take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) . Hofstra evaluates carefully the quality of the student's academic record, faculty recommendations, and the applicant's LSAT score. Successful applicants for accelerated admission usually have an undergraduate cumulative grade point average and LSAT score at or above the median of college graduates accepted into the regular J.D. program. Those medians have been a 3.21 GPA and a 156 LSAT, however applicants should review current Hofstra data related thereto. When an applicant's GPA/LSAT profile is at an acc eptable level, other qualifications are considered, including extracurricular activities, involvement in cultural or civic affairs, and work experience. Hofstra welcomes applications to this accelerated admission program from qualified students belonging t o groups under - represented in the legal profession. Before entering Hofstra (in other words, by the end of the junior year), accelerated -admission students must complete all requirements of their academic major and earn at least 24 Lake Forest College cour se credits (96 Hofstra semester credit hours) toward the bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of two full semesters of law school, a maximum of 32 semester credit hours (8 more Lake Forest College credits) will be applied as elective credit toward the undergraduate degree. Students applying for accelerated admission should complete the application process by April 15 of their junior year. Students should contact their pre -law advisor early in the fall semester of sophomore year to discuss the admis sions process. At the time of application, students should have completed at least 16 course credits (64 semester credit hours) toward the bachelor's degree. IIT Chicago - Kent College of Law Chicago -Kent College of Law and Lake Forest College have established an accelerated admissions program that allows eligible students to complete a Lake Forest bachelor's degree and a Chicago -Kent law degree in a total of six years, rather than the usual seven. Under this arrangement, the Chicago -Kent College of Law permits a limited number of exceptionally well - qualified students to enter the Chicago -Kent College of Law after completing their junior year of undergraduate study at Lake Forest College. Students par ticipating in this accelerated degree program receive the bachelor's degree from Lake Forest College following successful completion of the first year of law school and the law degree (J.D.) from Chicago -Kent College of Law after successful completion of t he required law school curriculum. Before entering the Chicago -Kent College of Law (in other words, by the end of the junior year), accelerated degree students must complete all requirements of their academic major and earn at least 24 courses toward the b achelor's degree.

Interested students should contact the chair of the department. Three -Year BA Program: Completing the Philosophy Major The Philosophy major consists of at least nine courses. Traditional four -year students often decide on a Philosophy major in their second or even third year, so it is typical to complete the major in three years. The structure of the major allows this, and an explicit three year plan would encourage a more sequential program, begin ning with the history core, which is meant as a foundation for upper -level study. A three -year BA program would typically proceed as follows: Prior to Matriculation 2-4 AP or college credits, at least one of which must be in English Literature, comparative Literature, or History. First Year: Three courses: Phil 290 (Ancient Greek Philosophy) and Phil 291 (Descartes to Kant) Phil 156 (Logic and Styles of Arguments) or an elective Second Year: 3 courses: Phil 292 (Hegel to Nietzsche) Phil 305 (Comparative Philosophy) or Phil 325 (Major Ethical Theories) Phil 156 (Logic and Styles of Arguments) or an elective Third Year: 3 courses: Phil 305 (Comparative Philosophy) or Phil 325 (Major Ethical Theories) Elective Senior Studies course The history sequence ( 290, 291, and 292) provides a good introduction to the Western intellectual tradition. After the first two courses, students would be well -prepared for 300 -level course work. The logic course (156) should be taken as early as possible; it is beneficial wel l beyond philosophy. Phil 156 provides analytic training helpful with any research efforts. It is also strongly urged for students preparing for the LSAT. (A comparable course may be available as a summer option at other schools.) Beyond the core courses , students may develop a particular focus in some aspect of philosophy, such as political philosophy, metaphysics, values issues, or Asian thought, which can then provide a foundation for the senior project. Students who would like to focus more exclusivel y on a particular aspect of philosophy may (in consultation with their advisor) propose to substitute a different course for one of the core requirements. Proposals will be reviewed by the department Chair. Despite the compressed schedule, it is possible to spend a semester studying off -campus, in the second year. The Department does accept appropriate transfer credit toward the Philosophy major; this must be approved beforehand. Programs without a Philosophy component are also possible. Many majors, fo r example, consider our Program in Greece, which provides an understanding of the civilization that began Western Philosophy. Philosophy 78 Students interested in graduate school in Philosophy should take the traditional core plus a number of advanced courses that will provide background in the traditions and approaches they seek to study. (A traditional four - year program would allow a more reflective pace through the required and recommended courses.) For students interested in Continental philosophy, Phil 320 or some independent work in 20th century Continental approaches is essential. For students interested in analytic programs (the majority of graduate programs in the United States), coverage of 20th century analytic philosophy, e.g. through Phil 294, is needed. Further, some advanced work in logic (instead of or in addition to Phil 156) would be appropriate. Co-Curricular Involvement Philosophy began in dialogue, and we continue to emphasize that, in class discussions, in written assignments, and in co -curricular activities. We encourage Philosophy majors to participate in the life of the Department outside the classroom. There are a number of opportunities available: A symposium is offered for new majors, to meet faculty and other Philosophy students, to share i nterests, to answer questions, and to have a good time. The Philosophy Club (linked to our Chapter of Phi Sigma Tau, the National Honor Society in Philosophy) sponsors a number of informal discussions as well as visiting speakers. Students and faculty are encouraged to share their current work, in informal presentations. A symposium concerning life after Lake Forest is offered for majors. 79 Three -Year Program in Communication The accelerated degree in communication is available only to students entering Lake Forest College with at least two AP Credits (with test scores of 4 or 5), or the equivalent of 2 Lake Forest College credits. To complete the major in three years, students must fulfill the regular graduation requirements -completing 32 credits, and completing all General Educational Curriculum requirements -and the requirements for the Communication major. What follows is a suggested plan for study that applies to those students who matriculate with 2 Lake Forest College equivalent cr edits. Before Matriculation 2 AP credits (with test scores of 4 or 5), or the equivalent of two Lake Forest College credits. First Year Nine Courses, including: First -year Studies Communication 110: Introduction to Communication (in the first semester) Com munication 255: Communication Criticism (in the second semester) 2 other 200 -level courses from rhetoric or media studies Appropriate courses may count toward General Education Curriculum (GEC) Honors Fellows will be able to take their ninth credit in th eir spring semester for no additional fee; others pursuing this option will normally be required to pay a course overload fee. First Summer Two Courses: 2 course credits, in either or both summer sessions, at the summer course tuition. Appropriate courses may count toward GEC. Second Year Nine Courses, including: One 200 -level course from rhetoric or media studies Communication 256: Communication Research Methods One more 300 -level Communication course that counts toward the Communication major Students who have attained Dean's List status will be able to take this ninth credit in their spring semester for no additional fee; others pursuing this option will normally be required to pay a course overload fee Communication 80 Second Summer Communication 390: Internship (for 2 course credits) Third Year Nine Courses, including: One 300 -level Communication course that counts toward the Communication major One Senior Seminar in Communication Students who wish to take part in the Lake Forest College In The Loop program are encourag ed to do so prior to their 6th semester. Students who maintained Dean's List status will be able to take the ninth credit in their spring semester for no additional fee; others pursuing this option will normally be required to pay a course overload f ee. With the exception of internships, courses taken Credit -D-Fail may not count toward the major. The minimum grade for each class to count toward the major is \"C\". 81 Richter Scholar Summer Research Program The Richter Scholar Summer Research Program provides students with the opportunity to conduct independent, individual research with Lake Forest College faculty with the goals of enhancing the intellectual lives of our students and encouraging them to consider careers in research and teaching. Academically excellent students with an interest in research are invited to apply for the Richter Scholar Summer Research program early in the spring of their first year. During the summer following their first year, they work one-on-one with a faculty member, conducting independent research in one of a wide variety of fields. As the Richter Scholars live and work together and participate in a weekly colloquium, they become a community of peers, providing encouragement and support for one anothe r's research endeavors. The result is a group of scholars motivated to continue their intellectual achievement in the future. To be eligible to receive an invitation to apply for the Richter Program, First -Year students must have completed at least three one-credit courses at Lake Forest College during the previous fall semester, including successful completion of a FIYS course, and achieved a minimum 3.3 GPA. The GPA is calculated with all grades received at the College, even those \"under\" a P grade on th e transcript. Program Options Lake Forest College is pleased to offer two distinct versions of the Richter Scholar Program (RSCH 181 or RSCH 182). The two programs deliberately differ in length and scope to provide the most flexibility to our faculty and students so that we attract our most talented faculty scholars to serve as mentors and our most intellectually motivated First -Year students to apply and be selected for this program. During both options, students do not pay tuition, and residence and dining halls are available at no cost. More details about specific dates and application steps can be found on my.lakeforest.edu . RSCH 181: Independent Research Experience I (20 -25 students) This option allows selected students to engage in a 3.5 -week research project, beginning immediately after the College's commencement and coinciding with the first summer se ssion. For RSCH 181 (Independent Research Experience I), faculty will offer a targeted research experience that will be focused and intense, with special emphasis on short -term outcomes. This is ideal for projects that are \"ready to go,\" where students can begin researching on day one. Faculty mentoring in this short -term research experience will rely on frequent and direct contact with students. This experience may include off -campus visits to libraries and museums, fieldwork, archival research, content an alysis, and any other activity that can be realistically worked into a 3.5 -week period. Students will not necessarily end this research program with a finished product, but they will engage in a rich, substantive experience and will make substantial progre ss. Some projects may accommodate multiple students resulting in a research community that may resemble a \"mini\" course - but one that focuses on the research experience. The RSCH 181 students will also participate in the weekly colloquium, engage in some social activities with the full Richter group, and present their research findings at a common forum at the end of the term. Students will receive 0.5 course credit (RSCH181), evaluated on a Pass -Fail basis, at the successful completion of the research period. This credit will count towards overall graduation credits but will not satisfy any major requirements. Although this cou rse carries the FFC Experiential Learning (FFC -EL) tag, this course alone does not fulfill the FFC -EL requirement because it is only 0.5 credits. This credit can be combined with other fractional FFC-EL credits and will satisfy the FFC -EL requirement when the student accumulates 1.0 FFC -EL credits. See the FFC-EL (see 1g) guideli nes for more details. This independent research project will involve 75 hours of student work across the 3.5 week interval. The recommendation for the distribution of these contact hours is as follows: a minimum 15 hours of direct faculty Student Research 82 contact/supervi sion, 55 hours of independent research work, and five hours of group coordination by the Summer Program faculty advisor. RSCH 182: Independent Research Experience II (10 -15 students) This option allows selected students to engage in an 8 -week research pr oject where the research project start date is one week after the beginning of the first summer session. For RSCH 182 (Independent Research Experience II), long -term projects will start more slowly and develop over time. The longer research period is esse ntial to the nature of the work conducted in these sustained research experiences. Accordingly, these projects will also require more independent work than in RSCH 181. The RSCH 182 students will also participate in the weekly colloquium, engage in some s ocial activities with the full Richter group, and present their research findings at a common forum at the end of the term. Students will receive 1.0 course credit (RSCH 182), evaluated on a Pass -Fail basis, at the successful completion of the research pe riod. This 1.0 credit will count towards overall graduation credits and will fully satisfy the FFC Experiential Learning requirement (once the written reflection is submitted to the advisor), but it will not satisfy any major requirements. This session in volves 150 hours of work for credit, and 170 hours of work for pay, for a total of 320 hours of student work. The 150 hours devoted to one -course credit comprise a minimum of 25 hours of direct faculty contact/supervision, 100 hours of independent research work, and 25 hours of group coordination by the Summer Program faculty advisor. The student is compensated by a stipend for the remaining 170 hours, composed of independent research and direct faculty contact/supervision. 83 Internships taken for credit at Lake Forest College are experiential learning opportunities integrated into the academic program. Although the specific nature of internship experiences will vary, internships are intended to clarify the relationship between traditional liber al arts study and the workplace. Program Guidelines (Approved by the Faculty, April 11, 1984; amended May 8, 1992, March 3, 1993, April 4, 2001, June 25, 2004, September 14, 2007, and March 2, 2022) These guidelines are intended as minimum criteria that al low individuals significant latitude. Within these guidelines, departments may establish requirements that are appropriate for the discipline of the specific internship. Any internship agreement that transfers or assigns liability exposure to the College must first be reviewed with the Career Advancement Center and the Business Office. General Policies Internships must apply or expand skills or knowledge learned at Lake Forest College. The bulk of the internship work is to be at the site of the internship, where the intern is gaining experience with organizations, industry and people, and where the intern is under the supervision of one person. o Since the modern workplace has evolved to increasingly include remote or hybrid environments, such internships ma y be approved on a case -by-case basis. The internship must demonstrate a clear plan for supervision and mentorship, and supervisors must ensure that the intern has been provided the technology necessary to successfully complete the internship. Opportunitie s for paid on -campus internships may be approved on a case -by-case basis. For approval to be granted, a proposal must be submitted to the Career Advancement Center by an on -campus Internship Supervisor and be approved by the supervisor's respective VP or D ean. At least 25% of the internship must include a special intern project. Internships are open to juniors or seniors. In special circumstances, to be determined by the Career Advancement Center, sophomores may be allowed to receive credit for internships . To prevent any potential conflicts of interest, students must disclose any familial relationships with employees of the organization where they wish to intern. No student may intern for a company owned or managed, fully or in part, by a family member. The on -site supervisor may not be a member of the intern's family or anyone working under the supervision of a family member. Continuation of part -time or summer jobs may not serve as internships without an appeal to the Career Advancement Center. A student will not normally receive more than three internship credits toward the total number of credits necessary for graduation (not including foreign internship credit). A minimum of one (1) credit and a maximum of two (2) credits will be awarded for each internship. Any student seeking more than two internship credits must show that not more than two credits will be for internship experiences that are similar in terms of skills or knowledge learned or applied. Students in the Lake Forest College In the Loop program can earn up to four internship credits, with the fourth credit being taken during the In The Loop Program. Internships 84 Lake Forest College students currently have the ability to complete up to 3.0 credits through the Academic Internship Program, with a maxim um of 2.0 credits via 100% remote and/or paid on -campus internships. For each credit, approximately 150 hours of on -the-job experience will be required. The Academic Internship Course will be graded Pass -Fail. Retroactive Academic Internship Course credit is not permitted. Both aspects of the Academic Internship Course, completion of internship hours, the experiential component, and the Academic Internship Course requirements, must be completed concurrently. Internship proposals must be approved by the student's Academic Advisor and the Career Advancement Center. 100% commission -based internships will not be approved for academic credit. Requirements For an Academic (for -credit) Internship, a student will be required to do the following: Read these Academic Internship Program Guidelines and complete the Academic Internship Interest Form following the Internship Specialist's advising session and befo re registration. Meet with their Internship Specialist during the semester prior to the internship. Complete the Academic Internship Application once the internship is secured and at least one week prior to the add/drop date for classes. Materials from the on -site supervisor must also be submitted to the Internship Specialist and the Career Advancement Center one week prior to the add/drop date for classes. Students must successfully complete the Academic Internship Course alongside the internship experience in order to pass the course. Typical assignments include, but are not limited to: learning plan, weekly reflections/discussions, mid -term/fina l evaluation, verified hour logs, and final portfolio. Assignments should include details such as a description of duties performed, relevance of the student's previous academic training to the internship, and the role their internship plays in the student 's career plan. Assignments must be completed by the stated deadlines and submitted to the Career Advancement Center. Students who fail to timely submit required assignments risk failing the Academic Internship Course. On-Site Supervisor Responsibilities The on -site supervisor will be one person designated to serve as the student's primary supervisor. The on -site supervisor must understand that interns are earning academic credit and consequently must perform duties that apply or expand skills or knowledge learned at Lake Forest College. The on -site supervisor must submit to the Internship Specialist a letter or other approved documentation that offers the student an internship and includes a written job description. Letters must be on company letterhead and must be signed by the on -site supervisor. The on -site supervisor must meet regularly with the intern to evaluate the intern's progress and to assess the appropriateness of the intern's duties, reporting this information to the Internship Specialist in the mid-term evaluation. At the end of the internship, the on -site supervisor must submit to the Internship Specialist a final evaluation of the student's performance. The evaluation must include a description of the duties performed by the intern as well as the intern's level of performance and progress during the internship. 85 Career Advancement Center Responsibilities The Career Advancement Center will oversee both the student's participation in their internship and the completion of required academi c coursework. The Career Advancement Center must maintain regular contact with the intern and the intern's on -site supervisor. The Career Advancement Center will maintain a record of all participants in the program. Evaluations At the end of each semester, all students who have completed Academic Internships will be required to evaluate their experience. Students will be sent an online evaluation by the Career Advancement Center prior to the last day of classes. Student responses regarding their Internship Specialist will be anonymous. Internship Specialists may only see the evaluations after the grades have been submitted. Only the Career Advancement Center and the Dean of Faculty Office will have access to the identity of the evaluator. The evaluations wil l be kept in the office of the Career Advancement Center. Notice to students who are not United States Citizens If a qualified non -citizen wishes to pursue an internship, that student must receive employment authorization from the U.S. Citizenship and Immi gration Service (USCIS). A qualified non -immigrant applying for permission to accept or continue employment must meet with Erin Hoffman (F -1 Visas) or Allie Olson (J -1 Visas) who will file the appropriate forms with the USCIS.

Before you submit your GEO Application: STEP 1: Connect with the Global Engagement Office (GEO) With 250+ programs (and even more f or summer!), it is easy to be overwhelmed by all the opportunities. Meeting with the Director of the Global Engagement Office can help you begin exploring all of the program options. You can discuss which programs may be the best fit for you - academically, financially, and personally. Schedule an appointment with Allie Olson, the Director of the Global Engagement Office, using Calendly or send an email to [ aolson@lakeforest.edu ]. STEP 2: Meet with your advisor(s) Your advisor(s) can help you figure out when is the best time to study abroad (in terms of your academic plan) and if there are any particular course(s) you will need to take abroad/ off-campus . Part of Lake Forest College's internal study abroad application (called the GEO application) process is to discuss your study abroad plans with your academic advisor(s). If you do not connect with your advisor(s) before you submit your GEO Appl ication, you will be asked to discuss your plans to study off -campus with them before GEO can process your GEO application. STEP 3: Review and understand the financial impact of study abroad Financial aid may apply to Lake Forest College -approved off -campu s programs. Please review our Off-Campus Study and Financial Aid page, as well as the Study Abroad Financials page . Contact the Global Engagement Office for cost estimates for programs you are interested in explo ring. The cost of studying off campus can be very similar to the cost of living on campus. For some programs, the program abroad is more affordable than living on campus. For other programs, the program abroad is more expensive STEP 4: Complete the GEO Ap plication The GEO Application is Lake Forest College's internal study abroad application. Students need to submit the appropriate GEO application and have their GEO approved before they can begin a program -specific application. GEO Applications and deadli nes are located on GEO's main Study Abroad and Domestic Study Away page. Deadlines for GEO Applications: December 1 - Fall programs April 1 - Spring programs March 1 - Summer programs GEO applications will not be fully processed until after the appropriate deadline. (Example: Fall GEO Applications will not be fully processed until after the December 1st deadl ine for fall applications.) Steps to Apply 88 Also, our internal deadlines are around 5 -6 months before you would have to submit your program -specific application. Summer applications are the exception and can also be completed in tandem with your program's specific applica tion. (Example: If you were interested in studying abroad for the Fall 2023 semester , you would have to submit your GEO Application by December 1, 2022 ) After your GEO Application is approved: STEP 5: Complete the GEO Program Confirmation Form \"GEO Decision Emails\" are sent to all applicants after their GEO application is fully processed. This email will detail if they are approved to study abroad and if so, which programs listed on your GEO application you are approved to apply to. If you are approv ed to study abroad: Once you decide which specific program listed in your \"GEO Decision Email' that you want to apply for, you complete the GEO Program Confirmation Form. The form will be supplied within your \"GEO Decision Email\". Your confirmation form informs the Global Engagement Office which specific program you are applying for, as the Global Engagement Office can then send the appropriate nominations to programs (if applicable). Also, some Donor Study Abroad Scholarships are only for certain locatio ns and your confirmation form lets the office know if you are eligible for certain scholarships. STEP 6: Apply to your specific program After you complete your GEO Program Confirmation Form, you can begin your program's specific application. Please be awar e that our partners have different application deadlines and requirements. Students applying for ISEP Exchange programs: The ISEP application is unique and you can list up to 10 different exchange sites on ONE application. Review ISEP's Chance of Placement page before submitting your ISEP application, STEP 7: Complete the LFC Course Pre -Approval Form & Off -Campus Waiver After you are accepted into your program, you ca n complete the LFC Course Pre -Approval Form (supplied within your GEO Decision Email). On this form, you will list courses you plan to take while on the program. It is not a registration form, and you may have to use past semester courses to complete the f orm. The purpose of this form is for you to have a plan on what courses you are going to take abroad and what those courses will transfer back to Lake Forest College as. The Registrar's Office uses this form to know if the courses will count towards your major(s), minor(s), and/or Forester Fundamental Curriculum requirements. You can get updated course approvals once you are abroad, but you are still required to submit this form as a preliminary plan for the appropriate deadline. Also, all students studyin g off -campus (abroad or domestic) are required to submit Lake Forest College's Off - Campus Waiver . You are sent this waiver in your GEO Decision Email. If you need a new copy of either form, contact the Global Engagement Office. STEP 8: Attend your Pre -Depa rture Orientation There is a mandatory Pre-Departure Orientation for all LFC students participating in a GEO program. It is held the semester before you are studying abroad, and summer students participate in the Pre -Departure Orientation with Fall and Aca demic Year students. If you are unable to make the scheduled orientation, you are required to schedule a make -up orientation with GEO. 89 Pre-Departure Orientation goes over everything from academics abroad to updating to a new culture to health & safety abr oad. STEP 9: Participate in your program! Have a fantastic experience on your program and know that the Global Engagement Office is still here to support you while you are abroad/off -campus! 90 Participating in an off -campus program (wheth er to study, intern, research or volunteer) can be a life -changing experience! At Lake Forest College, we understand that our students have individual learning goals, which is why we have such a robust set of approved off -campus programs! With such a varie ty of opportunities, it is easy to become overwhelmed. See the tips on our ' Selecting a Program Guide ' to help explore what programs may be a good fit for you and your goals. Types of Programs Lake Forest College's approved semester off -campus programs fall into two categories: Exchange and Direct - Enroll . Here is a quick overview of the similarities and differences between the two program types: Similarities: Financial aid can apply, credits transfer back to Lake Forest College, and students pay their Lake Forest College tuition Differences: Exchange programs include housing and meals benenfits, where Direct -Enroll programs may include housing but many do not include meals. Students who participate in an exchange program are eligible for a $750 airfare reimbursement award. PLEASE NOTE : There are certain capacity limit s for some Direct programs, and some Exchange programs are more competitive than others. GEO recommends that you find at least 3 - 5 programs you are interested in. Students are able to participate in two GEO semester programs, but one of the two semesters has to be on an Exchange program. Please explore the below information for a more in -depth exploration into the differences between Exchange and Direct -Enroll. Exchange Programs There is a bilateral exchange of students between internati onal institutions within the ISEP (International Student Exchange Program) network. For example, an LFC student would pay for a spot at LFC and a student at the University of Essex would pay for a spot at Essex, and then the students \"trade places\" while r eceiving equivalent benefits they paid for at their home institution. Financial Difference The cost is similar to if one were to study & live on -campus at Lake Forest College. Please review our Financials page for more in -depth financial information. Chance of Placement Semester Programs Exchange Programs 91 Due to the bilateral exchange of students all across the ISEP network, some exchange progr ams are more competitive than other exchange programs. While exploring exchange programs on ISEP's website, please pay special attention to 'Chance of Placement'. Many popular locations such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia are more compet itive and usually have a 'Chance of Placement' of 'Most Competitive' or 'Very Limited'. But do not be discouraged! At least a few Lake Forest College students are placed on competitive exchange programs every year. When a student completes their ISEP appli cation, they can rank up to 10 programs on the application. ISEP recommends students add at least one program with a 'Good' (or better) chance of placement to their program ranking. Direct -Enroll Programs There is no bilateral exchange and st udents directly enroll in an international institution or study abroad program. Financial Difference Some Direct -Enroll programs are comparable to the cost of studying & living on LFC's campus. A few programs are more affordable, some are more expensive - it all depends on the specific program. Please review our Financials page for more in -depth financial information. Chance of Placement As long as a student is approved by GEO and meets the program's specific eligibility requirements and deadlines, the chance of placement is excellent (although never guaranteed).

Oxford Study Abroad Program - Direct Study abroad with the Oxford Study Abroad Programme ! The Oxford Study Abroad Programm e (OSAP) places students of academic distinction at affiliated colleges of Oxford University. With privileges at four of the top -ranked colleges at Oxford - New College, Christ Church, Magdalen College and Trinity College, OSAP students and faculty have acc ess to their libraries, clubs, societies, dining halls, and chapels as well as over six million volumes of books in libraries throughout the University of Oxford. Please note: Oxford has a different academic system than LFC. Oxford uses a tutorial model, in which students take a primary and a secondary tutorial. Students normally take between 14 -18 tutorials between 2 subjects. Students normally study a primary course for 9 tutorials and a secondary for 5 tutorials. Since all education at Oxford is highly individual (the exact courses are worked out jointly by the OSAP academic advisor, the student, and the tutor) there is no Oxford Course Catalog in an American sense. The teaching style is most often one tutor and one student, who work together to set up a meeting schedule that fits both needs. Learning is often based on one on one discussion, and the tutor may assign a large paper each week to be discussed at the next meeting. Tutorials are most similar to upper -level electives at a US institution. St udents are expected to have a background in the topic discussed. The OSAP academic advisers have found by experience that most OSAP students tend to select from five or six subjects, primarily history, English, politics (including political thought and i nternational relations), economics, 94 and philosophy. A few students will study psychology, physics, chemistry, math, law, geography, sociology, art history, etc. (Practical science courses, i.e., those requiring laboratory facilities, are usually available given sufficient notice, but this is not guaranteed). Students can apply as Associate Member status , or as Visiting Member status (for an additional cost).

Financial Information For all programs, students pay their Lake Forest College tuition plus a program fee. The program fee for the In The Loop program includes orientation, housing, a U-Pass for CTA travel, networking opportunities, internship supervision, and a meal stipend. Here is an estimated budget for the Spring 2022 program: Budget Item Amount Lake Forest College Tuition $25,050 Program Fee $6,300 Program Deposit (non -refundable) $500 Total Expected Billed by Lake Forest College $31,850 Tuition rates and program fees are subject to change each year, but this information was up -to-date as of August 2021. Keep in mind that you may spend more or less in certain areas like personal expenses, travel, meals, or airfare, depending on exchange rates and your own spending habit s. Classroom or lab fees are not included in this estimate. Loop students must live at The Flats, and the program cannot accommodate commuter students. Therefore, while the program costs are structured to be comparable to those for on -campus students, on-campus commuters will pay additional costs for Loop room and board. Do check your student account on my.lakeforest for your aid awards, as most of this will go with you.

Students who participate in an Exchange program will be billed the following to their Lake Forest College Student Account: Lake Forest Tuition Lake Forest College room space (standard room rate) Lake Forest College meal plan Lake Forest College miscellaneous fees (Activity, Health & Wellness, & Rec Center) $100 Study Abroad Administrative Fee Fees charged to Lake Forest College by ISEP: o ISEP deposit o ISEP international health insurance Please Note: (from ISEP's Exchange information webpage ) As a participant on an exchange program, you pay a fee to your home institution based on the cost of regular tuition, fees, housing and meals, thus creating a \"space\" and set of benefits for an incoming student. Each incoming student makes a similar arrangement at his or her home institution, creatin g a \"space\" and a set of benefits for you at your host institution. Abroad, you receive the same set of ISEP benefits covered by the fees that the outgoing student paid to their home (your host) university, when he or she swapped spots. Due to differences in cost of living across the global exchange membership with ISEP programs, housing and meal benefits are always equivalent, but rarely, if ever equal. Students on exchange always receive housing for the full dates of the program, including 19 -21 meals per week. Housing types and benefits at home versus host university are not equal in terms of the monetary amount due to variability in scales of economy, government subsidies, location, cost of living, etc. Direct -Enroll Programs Students who participate in a Direct -Enroll program will be billed the following to their Lake Forest College Student Account: Lake Forest College Tuition Fees that are billed to the College by the student's program. This could include, but is not limited to: o Housing o Meals o Excursio ns o International Health Insurance Study Abroad Administrative fee of $1,500 o This fee is lowered to $1,000 for programs that do not include a meal plan/full meal stipend Direct -Enroll programs have their own tuition fee; however, Lake Forest College covers the program's tuition on behalf of the student . Students are charged Lake Forest College tuition which is subject to the College's financial aid. Due to the high variety of Direct -Enroll programs, the cost of a Direct -Enroll program can vary by $1,000 to $7,500 (billable cost outside of Lake Forest tuition). Some Direct -Enroll programs are more affordable than Financials 110 staying on -campus, and some Direct -Enroll programs are more expensive. Contact the Global Engagement Office will any questions. Out-of-Pocket Costs Not all costs of an off -campus program are billable by Lake Forest College and students will have to pay directly out of pocket. Out-of-pocket expenses can include, but are not limited to: Program application fee & deposit o Lake Forest College does not charge an application fee or a deposit fee for our internal off - campus application (called the GEO application); however, almost every program itself charges for both an application and a deposit fee. o Many programs' deposit fee is billed to the College and billed directly to the student's Lake Forest College Student Account. Airfare o Students who participate in an Exchange program are eligible for a flight reimbursement award of up to $750. o If a student is participating in a program from our program partner , Webster University, they may also be eligible for a travel award of $1000 to cover the cost of a flight.

To be eligible to participate in a GEO program: Have good academic, disciplinary, and financial standing with the College o A student that will be under probation during any portion of their off -campus program is not eligible to study off -campus. o A student may have a financial hold when they complete th eir GEO application, but they have to resolve the hold before they are eligible to participate in their program. Maintain a minimum of a 2.7 GPA o Lower GPA accepted on a case -by-case basis o Any grade under a 'Pass/Fail' grade will be calculated for the stu dent's GEO application. Have at least 2nd -semester sophomore status (at the time the student participates in the program) o In rare cases, 1st -semester sophomore status is eligible - but not without GEO approval. o For transfer students, students have to be on campus at least one semester before their intended off-campus program. Meet all College deadlines for applications and pre -departure requirements Demonstrate the maturity, independence, and readiness to participate in a program, as shown by approvals fr om the academic advisor(s) and the Dean's office in Student Affairs. Please note: Students may not participate in a GEO program in their first semester back after a Leave of Absence, Judicial Suspension, or Medical Withdrawal, without an appeal. If the stu dent is withdrawing from the College to participate in a non -approved off -campus program, they will have to have one semester back on Lake Forest College's campus before they are eligible to participate in a College -approved off -campus program (similar to the Transfer student policy above). Being deemed eligible by the College does not guarantee a student will be accepted by a host program or university. Appeal Process Students denied participation on academic or conduct grounds may petition the Academic Ap peals Board to consider their case. The Academic Appeals Board is unable to consider cases of students denied by non -Lake Forest program hosts. You must copy the Director of the Global Engagement Office on all emailed appeals. Your academic advisor must a lso send the AAB a written statement of support. Approval by the Academic Appeals Board (AAB) is required if: You do not meet eligibility and program requirements by the time of participation. (NOTE: Each program may have eligibility requirements beyond th e required by campus. The AAB cannot overrule requirements by a third party.) You have selected a summer program not LFC's approved summer program list. This will also require GEO Approval. GEO Policies 114 o Approval for a semester program not on the approved list require s an appeal to the Curricular Policies Committee. You will be participating in an off -campus program (excluding the College's In the Loop program) during your final semester. You intend to participate in more than 2 semester -length GEO programs. You intend to complete more than three total terms off -campus (2 semesters on GEO programs, plus 2 semesters in the Loop). Location Eligibility Programs are reviewed for safety reasons due to their locations and/or government warnings. LFC uses the Department of State's Travel Advisories to help assess a location's safety. Should a certain location have a Travel Advisory Level 3 or 4, the President of the College will r eview the program to determine if a student will be allowed to participate. Contact the Global Engagement Office for more information on safety concerns. Ineligibility to Participate in GEO Programs Students may be declared ineligible in the GEO application process to participate in a study abroad program based on the recommendations of their academic advisor or the Dean of Students Office, as well as if the student fails to meet certain GEO deadlines, fails to attend the required Pre -Departure Or ientation, or fails to submit required off -campus documents. Students should note that all approvals to participate in a GEO program are conditional on the basis that a student must remain in good academic, judicial, and financial standing . Should a stude nt go on academic or disciplinary probation at any time before or during their off -campus program, or if the Dean of Students Office believes that the student should no longer participate, any approval will be rescinded. A student cannot participate in a G EO program if they have a financial hold on their LFC student account Students declared ineligible to participate in a GEO program will be removed from the roster. Students will be responsible to their program host(s) for any withdrawal fees, and may lose non-refundable deposits, airfare costs, or other cancellation costs. The College will not refund or reimburse students for these or other costs. If the College paid tuition or other charges to the program on the student's behalf, those charges will be p laced on the student's Lake Forest College student account and will become the responsibility of the student to pay. Participation in a program without approval from the Global Engagement Office, or while ineligible to study off - campus, will mean that any credits earned on the program will not transfer to Lake Forest College, and financial aid will not be applicable to the program. Program Participation Limits on GEO Terms Students may participate in a total of two GEO -approved semester -long programs and they need to keep the following information in mind: The Lake Forest In the Loop Program is not included in this limitation. One of the two non -Loop semesters MUST be an Exchange program. Non -Approved Programs Students that wish to participate in a progra m that is not on our approved list must appeal to the Global Engagement Office. These appeals will only be reviewed if allowed by the overall College budget, and the budget of the Global Engagement Office. To file an appeal, the student must currently be in good judicial standing and meet the current eligibility requirements set by Lake Forest College. 115 The appeal must show that the outside program is fundamentally different than those offered in the current portfolio and must outline: Strong academic justi fication for choosing an outside program Academic rigor and quality of the program Appropriateness of the student's plan to their overall academic plan/major Strength of student's preparation at Lake Forest College Level of cultural immersion or integratio n in the host country, and, where applicable, linguistic immersion Further approval from the College's Curricular Policy Committee may be required, depending on the program. If added, the student would pay their normal Lake Forest tuition + a program fee, and financial aid would be transferable to the new program. If denied, the student would have to withdraw from the College to participate in the program. *Semester a t Sea is a non -approved program and students cannot file an appeal for this program. Behavior on GEO Programs Students are held to the Lake Forest Student Code of Conduct, as well as any conduct codes of their host program while participating in their GEO program. Students that break the code of conduct on their program will face a conduct hearing, either while abroad or upon their return to Lake Forest. Academic Workload Students must remain full -time students while participating in an off -semester program , which is the equivalent of being enrolled in 3.0 to 4.5 Lake Forest credits. Falling below 3 credits will mean that the student is not eligible to receive aid. Taking more than 4.5 credits will result in additional overload fees. Students should note that they may be taking more or fewer courses than they do on Lake Forest's main campus. This can mean as few as 2 \"tutorials\" at Oxford, or as many as 10+ short courses in Japan. See the Registrar's Office to determine the equivalent number of credits fo r your programs of interest. Pre-Departure Orientation All Lake Forest College students participating in a GEO program must participate in the mandatory pre - departure orientations. Failure to participate in orientations makes a student ineligible to partic ipate in the GEO program. Course Approvals All students must get their courses approved before departing on a GEO program with the College's course approval form. These must be turned, at the latest, into GEO before the last day of the term prior to the t erm abroad. If a student officially enrolls in courses after the College's course form is due and there are time conflicts/the student cannot register in their pre -approved courses, updated approvals can be due over email. A student's academic advisor must approve all courses so that they can ensure that a student will stay on track to graduate on time. Advisors may approve courses to count for graduation or general education credit. A department or program chair must sign off on all courses that are to cou nt for a major or minor. Requesting Accommodations Students approved by GEO who are requesting accommodations must be registered with Disability Services on Lake Forest's campus. Depending on the location, accommodations abroad may not be able to be fulfil led. Please see GEO and Disability Services before submitting an application to explore programs that may be the best fit. 116 Program Cancellation Students should work with their specific program provider, if not Lake Forest faculty -led, to determine the canc ellation policy to understand what happens if a program is cancelled before a program begins or during a program. Students may want to work with an insurance provider to help with travel costs, and Lake Forest will assist students in obtaining credit, whe n possible. Program Withdrawal If a student withdraws from a program and the College has already paid non -refundable fees on behalf of the student, the student will be billed by the College for the non -refundable fees. F-1 Students F-1 international studen ts can study \"abroad\" on an ISEP exchange program in their home country. Credit and Transcripts Students must complete all requirements from GEO, including pre -departure course approvals and returnee surveys, in order to have their off -campus grades appear on their Lake Forest College transcript. Program Credit Students will earn Lake Forest credit for Lake Forest College -approved semester programs. Since Lake Forest College has a unique credit system, it is extremely rare for a course abroad to have the exact credit equivalent as 1.0 Lake Forest credit; however, students can still take the equivalent of 3.0 to 4.5 Lake Forest credits. For most programs, students take 5 to 6 courses to receive the equivalent of 4.0 Lake Forest credits. Course titles and gr ades will appear on the student's Lake Forest College transcript and be considered Lake Forest credit. However, the grades will not count toward the GPA except for Dean's List and honors calculations . Students may not opt to take these courses as Pass/Fa il through the College, but may elect to do so if allowed by their host program. Not all host programs allow Pass/Fail, and students should confirm with their departmental advisor at Lake Forest to determine whether their department will accept Pass/Fail courses toward the major or minor. Participants in any other programs, including summer programs, will earn transfer credit for courses completed with grades of C - or better. All programs must be approved by the College before transfer credit can be earned ; certain programs may have been pre -approved for transfer credit and students can consult with the Global Engagement Office for details. Course titles and grades earned for transfer credit will appear on the College transcript, but those grades will not be calculated in the GPA except for honors calculations . Transfer credit is not eligible to count for Dean's List. Grading Policy Different programs/host institutions may have different grading policies than those at Lake Forest College, and Lake Forest C ollege is not able to change your abroad grade. Students cannot choose to withdraw from a course after the grade has been received, nor ask the Registrar to not post one of the courses. The College cannot change student grades received on outside programs to Pass/Fail. Program Transcripts Some programs send a student's transcript a few weeks after the program is complete, and some send the transcript months after the program. Please contact GEO with questions about a program's transcript timeline. There ar e a few programs where the student has to complete a specific form or procedure before the program will send GEO the transcript. Costs and Financial Aid Lake Forest College uses a 'Home Tuition' model for GEO programs, which means that students are charge d their LFC tuition for all LFC -approved semester programs. 117 A student receiving financial aid (scholarship, grant, loan) at Lake Forest may be able to use that aid for an approved semester program. Please see the Financial Aid Office to determine your an ticipated out -of-pocket costs. Please see our Off-Campus Study and Financial Aid page for further guidance , as well as the Study Abroad Financials page . THERE IS NO LAKE FOREST FINANCIAL AID FOR ANY SUMMER PROGR AM. Students pay the program organization/host institution directly for summer programs. Some partner programs or national competitions may provide financial assistance for summer programs. Contact the Global Engagement Office for assistance. Students may carry financial aid to a total of two LFC -approved semester programs (not including Lake Forest College in the Loop). If a student participates in two semesters, one of those semesters MUST be an Exchange. Students who earn credit from an approved GEO pr ogram and whose financial aid has been applied to that program may not drop \u2014in whole or in part \u2014any such credit without also fully reimbursing the College for all aid transferred to that program. Students intending to participate in a semester program that is not an LFC -approved semester program will not be able to transfer their aid. If a student becomes ineligible to participate in an off -campus program, they will pay the College back for any fees that the College paid on their behalf. 118 Definition of a Lake Forest Credit Lake Forest credit is earned, recorded, and tallied by courses rather than by semester credit hours. For the purposes of definition and transfer of credit, a Lake Forest course is valued at four semester credit hours or six quarter credits. A Lake Forest s emester lasts 15 weeks (14 weeks of classes plus a 5 -day final exam period). The Lake Forest calendar also includes three four -week summer sessions. Regardless of the term, each regular Lake Forest course delivered in person (1.0 Lake Forest credit) includ es at a minimum the equivalent of forty -two 50 minute instructional hours per term. Remote and hybrid courses require regular and substantive interaction with the professor during the term to maintain the same rigor, quality, and integrity as fully in-pers on courses. Students are expected to devote a minimum of three hours of out -of-class work for each hour in class. Courses that include additional class meeting times, laboratories, or discussion sessions may require proportionately less out -of-class work. Semester -length Lake Forest courses carrying 1.0 course credits should require students to devote a minimum of 12 hours of total work per week (in -class time plus out -of-class work). Full-credit courses taught during shorter periods of time (e.g., during s ummer session) should require an equivalent amount of work as a semester -length course. Courses offered for fractional course credit (e.g., 0.5 or 0.25 course credits) should require an appropriate proportion of the total workload of a full credit semester - length course. Internships : For each credit, approximately 150 hours of on -the-job experience is required. Students are also required to complete a substantial paper, a project, or a study on issues related to the internship as well as a reflective paper on the internship. The number of hours of on -the-job experience may be proportionately reduced if the internship involves significantly more written or creative work, as required by the Internship Supervisor. Practica : a minimum of 40 hours of work is requ ired for 0.25 Lake Forest credit. Independent Studies do not have established meeting dates/times. The learning objectives and academic requirements for these courses are determined by the faculty member and the student, with the expectation that the total work completed will approximate that required for a regular Lake Forest course receiving 1.0 Lake Forest credits (as defined above). Course Load A normal course load for a degree -seeking student is four course credits per semester (the equivalent of 16 semester credits), but a student may choose to take any load between three (the equivalent of 12 semester credits) and four and one -half course credits (the equivalent of 18 semester credits) to be granted full -time status. Students also may be non -degree -seeking students or attend the College part -time, with commensurate charges. Courses in education that are required for certification but not credited toward a degree, private music lessons or music ensembles may be added to the normal course load. Consult w ith the Registrar for complete information regarding credit for these courses. For the purposes of federal financial aid, full -time status is defined as 3 or more Lake Forest credits (the equivalent of 12 or more semester credits); three quarter time is de fined as between 2.1 and 2.99 Lake Forest credits; half -time is 2.0 Lake Forest credits and less than half -time status is fewer than 2.0 Lake Forest credits. See \"Financial Aid \" for further information about federal and state grants An overload is any course load in excess of 4.5 credits in a given semester. With the permission of the advisor, a student may re gister for an overload if the total is not greater than five course credits in any semester. (See \"Tuition and Fees \" for course overload fee.) A student has full -time status if he or she is registered for at least three course credits (the equivalent of 12 semester hours) per semester. Students must register for a full course load for the entire year, unless t hey are seniors needing less than a full course load to graduate on time. Academic Polici es 119 Credit Distribution Exceptions to the following rules may be granted only by the Academic Appeals Board. Of the 32 credits required for graduation, the following rules apply: At least 8 but no more than 15 must be taken in the student's major field. More than the minimum of 8 may be required. A student may not take more than 15 credits, including internships, in any single discipline (as listed in the College Catalog under the hea ding Major and Minor Programs) . No more than 16 transfer credits (60 semester hours) may be counted toward Lake Forest College degree requirements. Twelve of the last 16 credits, and 4 of the last 5 credits, earned before degree completion must be Lake Fo rest College credits. A student may petition the Academic Appeals Board for an exception to either of these rules. Students interested in studying off campus in their last semester should consult with the Director of Off -Campus Programs. Academic Standing and Progress Students are considered in good academic standing if they are not currently on academic suspe nsion or dismissal . Students with fewer than seven completed Lake Forest credits are classified as first -year students. Those with at least seven Lake Forest credits are classified as sophomores, those with at least 15 Lake Forest credits as juniors, and t hose with at least 24 Lake Forest credits as seniors. Normally, a full -time student who takes four credits each term is expected to fulfill graduation requirements within four years. While students are encouraged to work closely with their academic advisor s and to heed the advice of the registrar's Office to make sufficient progress to complete degree requirements, students are ultimately responsible for keeping abreast of their degree requirements. Registration in Courses Enrolled students are allowed to p re-register each spring for the next academic year. Students who have pre - registered by the end of spring term will be given first priority in courses for the coming year. First -year students have an opportunity to register for fall semester during the sum mer preceding their entrance to the College. The spring registration plans are formally completed during designated registration periods in the fall. Prior to the spring semester, additional days are scheduled for confirming or changing registration plans for that semester. Course Changes and Withdrawals During a designated registration period, a student must make any changes in registration using the online registration system provided on my.lakeforest and have those changes approved by an advisor (also on my.lakeforest). If this procedure is not followed when a student wishes to drop one course in favor of another, a grade of F will be recorded for the course in which the student is officially registered, and the student will not receive credit for the oth er course. Because the full -time course load is defined as 3 to 4.5 course credits per semester, a full -time student is permitted to reduce his or her registration to fewer than 3 course credits during a semester -in-progress only with prior written approva l of his or her faculty advisor and the Dean of Students. Within the first two weeks of the semester, a course withdrawal is regarded simply as a permissible change of registration. Only the courses in which the student remains registered will appear on th e transcript. In a regular semester course (15 -weeks), the last day for approved withdrawal from a course, including authorized Medical Withdrawals, will be the last day of classes. Withdrawal results in a W grade. A student may not withdraw from a course after the last day of classes (that is, during the reading or examination periods). 120 If a student ceases to attend class and fails to withdraw officially from that course (including physical education) in which the student is officially registered, the stud ent will receive a failing grade for that course. (See \"Withdrawal and Readmission \" for more information) Reduction of load to fewer than 3 courses Full-time students will not normally be permitted to reduce their course load to fewer than three course credits in any semester. A reduction in course load may affect their eligibility for financial aid and their participation in organized sports. The Director of Residence Life has the right to suspend on -campus housing when students reduce their course load to part -time. Exceptions An exception to the usual policies concerning course withdrawals may occur when a student has been brought before the Academic Honesty Judicial Board. The student is permitted to withdraw, through the last day of class, from a course in which a charge of violating the academic honesty policy has occurred. But if the Board determines tha t a violation has occurred in that course, any penalty imposed will take precedence over the course withdrawal. When a student is penalized with failure of the project, assignment, or paper, the faculty member will record the zero in determining a final co urse grade. A student withdrawing from a course with a passing course grade (as determined by the faculty member) will earn a W, while a student withdrawing from a course with a failing course grade will earn an F, regardless of when in the semester the wi thdrawal may have taken place. When a student is penalized with failure of the course, the recorded grade will be F, rather than WF, regardless of when in the semester the withdrawal may have taken place. Refunds for withdrawal from courses Any combinati on of courses ranging from 3 to 4.5 credits is regarded as a full load and regular full -time tuition applies. There are no refunds for course load changes within this range of credits. Students registering for fewer than 3 credits per term with the permiss ion of the Dean of Students will be charged at a per -course rate. (See \"Refunds \" under \" Tuition and Fees \" for more information.) Attendance Classroom activities are an integral and important part of the learning experience. Therefore, it is expected that students will attend class meetings. Each member of the faculty has the prerogative of establishing specific attendance policies that in his or her opinion are best suited to the course. Faculty members are requir ed to publicize such policies to the class in writing at the beginning of the course. Students who miss class meetings because of participation in a \"College -approved event\" - so designated by the Dean of the Faculty - are officially excused but will be ex pected to make up any work missed and will be allowed to do so in a manner approved by the faculty member whose class was missed. If, in the judgment of the instructor, making up the work missed is not feasible, the student may not be penalized for the abs ence from the class. In cases when students miss a class for any reason other than to participate in an event previously designated by the Dean of the Faculty as \"College -approved,\" only the individual professor may \"excuse\" the absence. If a professor has deemed a student absence is \"excusable,\" the Dean of Students' office will document the absence for the professor if necessary. In cases in which the absence is related to a disability, the student is responsible for documenting the disability with the As sistant Dean of Faculty for Learning Support and requesting a reasonable accommodation (See: Services for Students with Disabilities). Auditing of Courses Students who wish to acquaint themselves with a subject without receiving credit may audit a course w ith the permission of the instructor. Auditors are not subject to the requirements of the course, but they are expected to 121 participate seriously. There is no audit fee for full -time students; part -time students are charged a minimum amount per course. Exam ination for course credit is not permitted in an audited course. Final Examinations By faculty regulation, no test may be given prior to its originally designated time. Only the Dean of the Faculty may grant exception to this rule and only at the request o f the faculty member. A term paper may be assigned in lieu of a final examination in a course, but in such cases students are entitled to have until the end of the scheduled examination time for a course to submit their term papers. If not returned immedia tely to students, examination papers, particularly final examination papers and term papers, are to be kept by faculty members for at least one term before being destroyed, so as to be available for review by students. Papers from the spring term are to be kept through the fall term. 122 LEAVES, WITHDRAWALS, AND RETURNING TO THE COLLEGE Leaves of Absence A personal or medical leave of absence is granted to a student who needs to take a temporary hiatus from their academic career but intends to return to Lake Forest College as soon as is possible. Students requesting a personal or medical leave must be in good standing with the College (i.e. without an academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal). Academic or disciplinary suspens ion or dismissal takes precedence over a Leave of Absence in determining a student's status and official reason for leaving the College. Any departure from the institution may cause the student's class year to change, which may affect registration, room se lection, or other processes. Personal Leave A Personal Leave is a non -academic, one -semester departure from the College. Without exception, a Personal Leave must be requested by the student, in writing, and approved by the Dean of Students Office prior to the first day of class for the semester in which a student is requesting a leave. Only one Personal Leave may be granted to a student in a 12 -month period (180 days per federal regulations); on occasion, exceptions for international students with military service obligations can be requested. Students who are currently on Medical Leave, Suspension, Dismissal, or who are Withdrawn from the College cannot be awarded a Personal Leave for the following semester. A student who is granted a Personal Leave is affo rded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations: The student remains enrolled at the College and thus may not take courses at other colleges/universities while on a Personal Leave. The student remains in an \"in -school status\" for federal student loan repayment purposes. That is, repayment of a federal student loan would be in deferment. The Lake Forest College financial aid package would continue when the student returns, without re - evaluation. The student should participate in the College's course registration processes to ensure a schedule is established for the following semester. The student will reserve their place in any College courses for which they are registered in the following semester, provided they have completed t he necessary pre -requirements for the course(es). The student retains their academic advisor, unless the advisor is unavailable for reasons outside of the College's control. The student retains their Lake Forest College email and must comply with the Accep table Use of Information Technology Resources Policy. If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). The student can register for summer courses at the College. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reserved. The student can participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The hiatus from t he College is not listed on the student's transcript unless the student requests the relevant notation from the Office of the Registrar. The student does not need to make a new deposit to return to the College. Withdrawal and Readmission 123 To request a Personal Leave, the student must email the Dean of Students Office with the reason for the request. The Dean of Students (or designee) may schedule a meeting or phone call to clarify the request before approval. Students requesting a Personal Leave should also: 1. Check with the Financial A id Office to protect future eligibility of scholarships, grants, and/or student loans. 2. Clear Business Office account to ensure a smooth return to campus. 3. Return any College keys to Residence Life staff or Facilities Management, as applicable. 4. Resident stud ents must submit a housing cancellation form and - in advance of the upcoming semester residence hall opening - be officially checked out of the residence hall by a member of the Residence Life staff. No storage is available on campus. 5. International studen ts must discuss any proposed leave of absence with the Office of Intercultural Relations prior to the start of the leave. If a Personal Leave is approved, the student will receive email notification from the Dean of Students Office. The student's parents/g uardians, academic advisor, and other relevant campus departments will also be notified. If the student does not return for the semester immediately following an approved Personal Leave, the student must either a) request and receive approval for a Medical Leave for the subsequent semester (see \"Medical Leave\" below) or b) the student will automatically be Withdrawn from the College, with the withdrawal date specified as the last day the student attended classes. See below for the characteristics of a Withd rawal and the relevant readmission processes. Medical Leave A student may request a Medical Leave prior to - or during - a semester. The last date for a Medical Leave to be requested during an active semester is the last day of classes (before reading day( s) and the final exam period). A Medical Leave is allowed only where the Dean of Students' designee (typically the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness) judges that serious illness has inhibited the student's ability to continue enrollment in their classes and requires the student to leave the College for proper treatment. Students who are currently on Suspension, Dismissal, or who are Withdrawn from the College cannot be awarded a Medical Leave for the following semester. The Medi cal Leave is granted by the College when the student intends for the departure to be temporary, with a return to Lake Forest College as soon as is possible (see the process for returning below). However, the federal government classifies a Medical Leave as analogous to a Withdrawal from the College, which means that certain privileges and expectations differ from the Personal Leave outlined above. In contrast to a Personal Leave, a Medical Leave can extend beyond one semester for any duration. A student who is granted a Medical Leave is afforded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations: The student is considered unenrolled from the College. The student must begin repayment of federal student loans immediately. The Lake Forest College financial aid package would continue without re -evaluation, but the student must file a FAFSA per the deadline to maintain federal financial aid (if applicable). The student may apply federal financial aid funds toward courses at other colleges/universities. The student may take courses at other colleges/universities while on Medical Leave, and (with approval) transfer them back in to Lake Forest College. The student cannot hold their place in any College courses for which they are regis tered in future semesters. The student retains their academic advisor, unless the advisor is unavailable for reasons outside of the College's control. The student retains their Lake Forest College email and must comply with the Acceptable Use of Informatio n Technology Resources Policy. 124 If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). The student is eligible to register for summer courses at the College, if the process of requesting to return has been completed and approved in advance. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reserved. The student cannot participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The student cannot participate in the course registration process for the following semester. The hiatus from the College is not listed on the student's transcript unless the student requests the relevant notation from the Office of the Registrar. The student will receive a \"W\" notation on the transcript for any courses in progress at the time of the Medical Leave. The student does not need to make a new deposit to return to the College. To request a M edical Leave, the student should submit a written request to the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness. The letter should explain the reason for Medical Leave, the anticipated treatment that the student will seek while away, and th e student's desired date of return, if known at the time of request. Then, the student must meet with the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness for an individualized assessment of the student's request for a Medical Leave. In some instances, the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness will exercise their right to request documentation from a licensed medical provider detailing the reasons for the Medical Leave; all medical documentation is confidential and is kept in a secure file in the Health and Wellness Center. Students requesting a Medical Leave should also: 1. Check with the Financial Aid Office to protect future eligibility of scholarships, grants, and/or student loans. 2. Clear Business Office account. Colleg e refund policies apply for departures during the semester and the refund schedule is published online. Resident students will be charged on a pro -rated basis for any room and board usage. 3. Return all College keys to Residence Life staff or Facilities Manag ement, as applicable. 4. Resident students must submit a housing cancellation form and be officially checked out of the residence hall by a member of the Residence Life staff within 48 hours of their leave being processed. No storage is available on campus. 5. International students must discuss any proposed leave of absence with the Office of Intercultural Relations prior to the start of the leave. If a Medical Leave is approved, the student will receive email notification from the Dean of Students Office. The student's parents/guardians, academic advisor, and other relevant campus departments will also be notified. Students who wish to return to the College after a Medical Leave when they are well enough to resume their studies must make a request to return via e-mail to the Dean of Students Office at least four weeks prior to the semester in which the student would like to return. The request to return includes two components: 1. The student should ask their off -campus, licensed, medical provider to provide documentation in support of the student's return to the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness. This medical documentation should answer the following qu estions: o Is the student able to return to campus and independently manage their condition? o Is the student able to live independently in a residence hall environment? o What recommendations does the medical provider offer with respect to issues such as cours e load, residence hall assignment, and continued treatment, in order to support the student's successful return to his or her academic program? 2. The student should meet in person or via telephone with the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health an d Wellness in order for the College to conduct an individualized assessment of the student's 125 readiness to return to degree -seeking student status. In some instances, the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Health and Wellness may request additional documentation from a medical professional beyond what has been submitted, and/or ask the student to sign a release to allow communication with the outside provider, in order to make a more informed decision Withdrawals A Withdrawal or an Administrative Wit hdrawal signifies an official departure from the College. Any student who wishes to return to the college must apply for readmission (see below). In a situation where a student is withdrawing/withdrawn from the College, and is then subject to College actio n such as an academic or disciplinary suspension or dismissal, the suspension or dismissal will take priority over the withdrawal when the College notates a student's status and official reason for leaving the College. Withdrawal A student may choose to Withdraw from the College prior to - or during - a semester. A Withdrawal applies to a student who intends to leave the College due to, for instance, transferring to another college/university or a pause in their academic career. A student who is granted a Withdrawal is afforded the following privileges and must comply with the following expectations The student is considered unenrolled from the College. The student must reapply to return to the College. Repayment of Federal Student Loans will begin immedia tely. The student may apply federal financial aid funds toward courses at other colleges/universities. The student may take courses at other colleges/universities while Withdrawn, and (with approval) transfer them back in, but only if readmitted to the Col lege. The student cannot hold their place in any College courses for which they are registered in future semesters. The student relinquishes their academic advisor. The student relinquishes their Lake Forest College email. If the student is enrolled in the College's student insurance plan, the student relinquishes their insurance plan (unless they are departing before the spring semester and had already paid in full for the academic year). If the student wishes to register for summer courses at the College, the student can apply for summer courses in a separate 'special -student' category or the student must apply for - and be approved for - regular readmission in advance of the summer term. Any room assignments (if applicable) will be cancelled and not reser ved. The student cannot participate in the room selection process for the following semester. The student cannot participate in the course registration process for the following semester. The student will receive a \"W\" for all courses they are passing at t he time of the Withdrawal. Students who are failing a course at the time of Withdrawal from the College may receive a grade of \"WF\" in that course (per faculty designation). To request a Withdrawal, a student must: 1. Meet with the Dean of Students Office to discuss their reasons for departure. 2. Complete the Exit Survey online. 3. Complete and submit the Withdrawal Form and submit the Exit Survey. The official date of withdrawal is usually the last date that the student has attended classes. College refund polici es apply for departures during the semester and the refund schedule is published online. Resident students will be charged on a pro -rated basis for any room and board usage. Students approved for a Withdrawal who live on campus must move out and check out of their residence hall within 48 hours. 126 Failure to follow the Withdrawal procedures will result in the student's transcript reflecting the grades earned in enrolled courses (including Fs for failures). Readmission Students who wish to return to the Colleg e after a Withdrawal must seek readmission by formally reapplying. Students who seek readmission after two or more consecutive semesters away must comply with the Catalog requirements in effect for the academic term under which they are readmitted. Student s who return after fewer than two full semesters have the option of conforming to the Catalog requirements under which they originally matriculated to the College. Applications are expected to be submitted a minimum of four weeks prior to the start of the semester in which the student is applying to return. The reapplication consists of: 1. an application through Slate, the Admission software, indicating the semester for which they hope to return 2. responses to the following questions in the Slate application: o The reasons and circumstances for the student's departure from Lake Forest College. o A description of the student's activities since leaving the College, focusing on employment and college -level academic work. o A plan for future study a the College, including what changes have occurred since the withdrawal that have prepared the student to resume their undergraduate program of study. 3. an official transcript of any undergraduate academic work completed during the Withdrawal, sent to the Office of Admissions. Students who are reapplying must pay all accounts in full. Once accepted for readmission, the student must also submit another $200 deposit, and may apply for financial aid, as appropriate. Administrative Withdrawal In rare instances, a stu dent may be Administratively Withdrawn from the College by the Dean of Students if the student is not fulfilling their academic obligations (e.g., not attending classes or completing academic work) and they have ignored institutional efforts toward resolut ion. A student who is Administratively Withdrawn by the Dean of Students for this reason will receive a WA on the transcript for that semester's courses. WA indicates that the student was involuntarily withdrawn from the College due to abandonment of acade mic responsibilities. Before an Administrative Withdrawal is assigned, the Dean of Students or designee will encourage the student to apply for a voluntary Withdrawal from the College. In the case of Administrative Withdrawal, typical withdrawal policies w ill apply (see above). Other Departures from the College Program Leaves A student may enroll during the fall or spring semester for one course at another institution while remaining registered for three courses at Lake Forest for that term. If approved by the student's advisor, the program must be checked with the registrar to assure transferability of the work. If the work is satisfactorily completed with a grade of C - or better in each course, and the credits are transferred to Lake Forest College, the st udent will be reimbursed for the per -course cost of the tuition at the other institution up to the per -course cost of tuition at Lake Forest College for the same period. Dual Degree Partnerships A student may gain admission to a dual -degree partnership whe re the student departs Lake Forest College before graduating to enroll at a partner institution in order to earn an advanced degree. The student and their academic advisor must coordinate with the Registrar's Office to pursue and establish this partnership . Academic Suspensions and Dismissals See the section on academic probation, suspension, and d ismissal for more information about College -initiated separations from the College for academic reasons. In cases of suspension for academic reasons, students are 127 not eligible for readmission for at least six calendar months. A student may be readmitted on ly once; a second suspension for academic reasons is known officially as an Academic Dismissal and becomes a permanent separation from the College for academic reasons. Academic probation, suspension, dismissal, and readmission are noted on the student's o fficial academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. Conduct Suspensions and Dismissals See the Student Handbook for more information about College -initiated separations from the College for conduct (disciplinary) reasons, including but not limited to violations of residential policies and the Academic Honesty Policy. In cases of suspension for these or other disciplinary reasons, eligibility for readmission is stated at the time of suspension. A conduct dismissal is a permanent separ ation from the College. Conduct suspension and dismissal are noted on the student's official academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. 128 Students shall be evaluated by their instructors solely on the ba sis of their academic performance, not on their opinions or conduct in matters unrelated to academic standards. Grades The College employs an A, B, C, D, F grading system. Faculty may append a plus or minus to all grades A through D, with the exception tha t there is no grade of A+. The grade of A is awarded for work of outstanding quality. The grade of B indicates good work, C satisfactory work, D marginal work, and F failure. A department may require a minimum grade in courses prerequisite to more advanced work. Pass -Fail Option Students may choose the option of receiving a notation of P (Pass) to indicate a grade of D - or better in any course they take. Under this option, grades of F and W are recorded on the transcript as usual. Application for this option, or for changing back to regular letter grades, must be made before the last day of the 11th week of classes in a 15 -week course or the deadline for withdrawing from classes with a n automatic W for other types of courses. Approval of the student's advisor is required. No more than four credits with grades of P based on this policy may appear on a student's transcript at any one time. This excludes credit -bearing activities that are by default graded on a Pass -Fail basis, such as internships and some practica. Students may choose to change a grade of P on their transcript back to a regular letter grade at any time before the final degree audit for graduation by submitting the appropr iate form; under no circumstances may letter grades be subsequently changed to P grades. Grade Point Averages The grade point average (GPA) attained for each semester of a student's work, as well as the student's cumulative grade point average, is recorded on the student's official academic record at the end of each semester. It is weighted according to course credit. Grade point averages are computed on the following basis: D..........1.00 D- ........0.67 F ..........0.00 Grades of P, I, X, MW, W, and RS will not be included. The Lake Forest GPA includes grades earned in Lake Forest College courses and for all Lake Forest off -campus programs led by Lake Fore st faculty. Incompletes Instructors are authorized to give incomplete grades and may record a grade of I (Incomplete) for a student who is prevented by illness or other reason beyond the control of the student from completing the requirements of a course. The student must complete the appropriate assignments and deliver them to the instructor no later than Grades and Academic Records 129 two weeks after the close of the residence halls for both the fall and spring semesters, respectively. Instructors are required to submit the revised gra de to the Registrar within three business days after the expiration of the incomplete. Extensions of the deadlines are possible only with special permission from the Associate Dean of Faculty for Student Success. If the Registrar does not receive a revised grade by the appropriate deadline, a grade of F will be recorded in place of the I. This policy applies only to undergraduate work. Grades of X A grade of X may be assigned at the initiative of an instructor when a student who has been doing at least pass ing work in a course unexpectedly fails a final assignment. With the instructor's authorization, the student has the same amount of time to redo the assignment, or its equivalent, as is available for an incomplete, but in no case may the final revised grad e be higher than a D+. Grades of PR A grade of PR (Progress) is used at the end of the first term of a two -term senior thesis or other independent study project if the student is making satisfactory progress. A final letter grade for both semesters will be entered when the project is completed at the end of the next term. Satisfactory progress is defined as a minimum of a C - grade for the work thus far completed. Accordingly, if a student receives a final grade of D or F in the thesis or other project, the PR grade as replaced cannot be lower than a C -. This policy applies only to undergraduate work. Grades of RS The RS grade, introduced in the fall of 1997, indicates that the requirements have been satisfied in a course without credit. Student Teaching Cred it (SCR) The student teaching clinical experience is graded on a basis of SCR (Student Teaching Credit) to indicate a grade of B - or better needed for passing the student teaching course. Under this system, grades of F and W are recorded on the transcript as usual. This grade is only available to students accepted into the teacher certification program and enrolled in elementary or secondary student teaching. Repeated Courses Any course taken at Lake Forest College, except a First -Year Studies course, in wh ich a student received a grade of C - or lower may be repeated once with replacement of the earlier grade, as long as the repeated course has the same course number as the course whose grade it replaces, and is not repeatable for credit under its catalog description (as are certain topics courses, etc.). This replacement is for the purposes of calculating GPA only: all grades received appear on the Lake Forest College transcript. A student may only take one First -Year Studies course during her or his time at Lake Forest College. A course may be repeated with replacement of the earlier grade only once. After that, the grades in any further repetition of the course will stand and be counted into the student's GPA along with the grade for the second time he or she took the course. Over the course of his or her Lake Forest College career, a student may repeat no more than two courses for replacement of a grade. Should a student repeat more than two courses over her or his time at the College, the grades earned fo r the first two of these repeated courses will replace the grades of the previously taken courses of the same number; the grades for any courses beyond that will be included in the student's GPA like any other course. Auditing Courses Students who wish to acquaint themselves with a subject without receiving credit may audit a course with the permission of the instructor. Auditors are not subject to the requirements of the course, but they are expected to participate seriously. There is no audit fee for full -time students; part -time students are charged a minimum amount per course. Examination for course credit is not permitted in an audited course. Semester Grades and Academic Early Alerts Final grades are posted on My.Lakeforest . Academic Early Alerts for all students, in courses where the student's performance is at that point a cause for concern, will be submitted on My.Lakeforest by the first day of the fifth week of both Fall and Spring semesters. After this deadline, student s and their advisors will get emails prompting them to check the Academic Early Alert Information box on their My.Lakeforest pages. 130 Students who receive more than one AEA will be required to meet with an academic support specialist to work through a plan t o address all related academic problems. 131 The Dean's List recognizes students who have achieved distinguished academic records. It is compiled at the end of each academic year. Only Lake Forest College course credits are counted. To be selecte d for this honor, a student must have received during the year at least six graded course credits, and must have received no more than two credits with the Pass -Fail option, and must have attained a GPA during the year of at least 3.60 (without rounding up ). Repeated courses will be considered in this calculation as long as they have been repeated during the academic year for which the student earned Dean's list status, and follow the policy regarding repetition of courses. See \"Repeated Courses\" under \" Grades and Academic Records .\" In order to reward outstanding academic performance and to provide adequate challenge to the brightest students, those who gain Dean's List distinction are permitted to take a fifth course without additional charge during one semester of the academic year following that distinction. This policy does not apply to applied music lessons, courses offered through off campus programs, and Summer Session courses.

Graduation with Honors Graduation with Honors at Lake Forest College may be achieved in two categories: the grade point average (GPA) and the s tudent's major field. General Honors General honors at graduation consist of summa cum laude for GPAs from 3.9 to 4.0, magna cum laude for GPAs from 3.7 up to 3.9, and cum laude for GPAs from 3.4 up to 3.7. In order to achieve honors in one of these catego ries, a student must have an academic record that satisfies all of the following requirements: At least 14 Lake Forest College courses taken with the full range of the letter grades (A, B, C, D, F, but not CR or P). A Lake Forest GPA equal to or greater th an the minimum listed above for the pertinent category. A total GPA, including Lake Forest College courses, Affiliated Off Campus Study courses and transfer courses, that also equals or exceeds the above minimum for the given category. GPAs are not rounde d up; for example, a 3.898 is not in the summa cum laude category. The calculation of a GPA includes plus and minus grades. Repeated courses will be considered in this calculation as long as they follow the policies regarding repetition of courses and have been completed prior to graduation from the College (see \"Repeated Courses\"). Grades of all transfer courses acceptable by Lake Forest College for transfer credit will be used in GPA computations. For courses that have been repeated, a maximum of two tran sfer credit grades can be forgiven. Such forgiveness applies only to courses taken prior to the student's matriculation at Lake Forest College. Forgiveness of transfer credit grades counts toward the maximum of two total forgiven grades before graduation ( i.e. students can have two transfer credit grades forgiven after repeating, two LFC credit grades forgiven after repeating, or one from each category). The transfer GPA is combined with the Lake Forest GPA as a weighted average. Transfer grades from colleg es or universities with different grading systems are dealt with case by case by the Dean of the Faculty in consultation with the Registrar; where necessary, they will be brought to the Academic Appeals Board. Honors in the Major Honors at graduation in the student's major are based on a clear demonstration of superior mastery of the subject and on the ability to successfully complete a senior thesis. To receive honors in the major, a student must have attained a 3.5 GPA in all cou rses taken in the major at Lake Forest College, including the final semester. A minimum of six courses must have been taken in the major at the College. A student must be evaluated as having successfully completed a senior thesis. In exceptional circumstan ces when a senior thesis seems inappropriate, a well -documented senior research project or imaginative creative project brought to fruition in Graduation and Commencement 134 the senior year may be substituted for the senior thesis. The request for such a substitution must be initiated b y the project director and requires the unanimous approval of the members of the department(s) involved. As with other theses, the final project will be reviewed by a thesis examining committee consisting of three faculty, at least one from outside the dep artment. Please note that completing a senior seminar will not result in honors in the major. Distinction in Senior Thesis If a student's senior thesis is judged by an examining committee to be an outstanding and original piece of research, Distinction in Senior Thesis is awarded at graduation regardless of whether the student is graduating with honors in his or her major field of study. In exceptional circumstances, a well -documented senior research project or imaginative creative project may substitute fo r the senior thesis provided members of the departments involved give their unanimous approval. As with other theses, the final project will be reviewed by a thesis examining committee consisting of three faculty, at least one from outside the department.

It is presented at the Senior Honors Convocation and is awarded to a senior who is judged by the faculty of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology as the outstanding student majoring in this field. 144 The academic record of every student is reviewed by the Academic Appea ls Board of the faculty, the Dean of the Faculty, and the Dean of Students at the end of each term. As a result of such reviews, students may be placed on academic probation by the Dean of Students or the Academic Appeals Board as a warning that they are i n danger of academic suspension. Students are placed on academic probation whenever their cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. Students on academic probation are assigned to work with Academic Support Specialists to improve their academic performance. No studen t on academic probation may be enrolled as less than a full -time student, unless special permission has been given by the Dean of Students. Students on academic probation may continue to participate in co -curricular programs, such as athletics, theater, cl ubs, and organizations upon review and approval by the Associate Dean for Student Success. First -time first year students who have achieved less than a 1.00 GPA in their first semester at the College will have their academic record reviewed by the Dean of Faculty (or representative), in consultation with others, including; the Dean of Students, Academic Advisor, Academic Support Specialists, etc. After the review is complete, a decision may be made to not suspend the student, but to instead place the studen t on academic probation. Students who are assigned this status are required to meet with the Associate Dean of Faculty for Student Success before the start of their second semester to create a plan which will outline a set of expectations designed to keep the student accountable and create a blueprint for improved academic success. Students who have completed their second semester and beyond are suspended when their GPA in any term is less than 1.0, even if they have not previously been on academic probatio n. In addition, students on academic probation are suspended when their GPA for any probationary term is less than 2.0. No student may remain on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters without being suspended. All students who are suspen ded have the right to appeal. Appeals are considered on a case -by-case basis. Students with a pending appeal of a suspension after spring semester who are taking a course in the first Summer Session term will be permitted to complete the course and, if app licable, remain in student housing regardless of the outcome of the appeal. A student who is suspended for academic reasons is not eligible to apply for readmission for at least six months. A student may be readmitted only once; a second suspension for aca demic reasons is known officially as an Academic Dismissal and becomes a permanent separation from the College for academic reasons. Suspension or dismissal from the College may also be mandated under conditions set forth under the conduct process. Probati on, academic suspension or dismissal, and readmission are noted on the student's official academic record and appear on transcripts sent outside the College. Parents or guardians are notified when a dependent student is placed on probation, suspension, or dismissal. Only in unusual circumstances can exceptions to the rules concerning probation, suspension, and dismissal be considered by the Academic Appeals Board. Academic Appeals Board The Academic Appeals Board is a part of the College's governance system. It considers and acts on cases of academic probation, suspension, or dismissal; on cases in which students appeal the interpretation of faculty rules by a dean; and on cases in which faculty rules are unclear. The Board and the Dean of Students meet at the end of each semester to review the academic records of all students and to take such action as is necessary in cases involving academic probation, suspension, and dismissal. Academic Probation, Suspension, and Dismissal 145 Throughout the academic year, the Board considers appeals involving the academic policies of the College and their interpretation. In extraordinary cases, the Board grants exceptions to faculty rules, but only by a unanimous vote of all three vot ing members of the Board. Students who wish to appeal an academic decision by a dean or who believe that they deserve an exemption from an academic policy may present a written appeal to the Board. The appeal must clearly describe the decision being appeal ed or the policy from which the student wishes to be exempted and must state the substantive reasons for the appeal. Each appeal must also have attached a detailed statement from the advisor regarding the appeal. Additional information may be appended to t he written appeal if desired. Each appeal must be signed and include the student's mailing address. Appeals may be submitted to the Dean of Students or the chairperson of the Board by email. To request credit for off -campus study, a student must see the Di rector of Off -Campus Programs. Protection Against Improper Academic Evaluation Students are responsible for maintaining standards of academic performance established by their professors, but they will have protection against prejudiced or capricious academ ic evaluation. Students will be informed at the beginning of the course of the evaluative criteria to be used for that course. When a student believes his or her grade in a course has been prejudiced or capricious and has been unable to resolve the matter through interaction with the faculty member involved, the student may call the matter to the attention of the departmental chairperson. Students must contact the chairperson within two calendar weeks following the beginning of classes in the term followin g the alleged injustice. After the student has submitted a letter specifying the details of the alleged injustice, the chairperson will appoint a committee of the instructor's colleagues to meet with the student and the instructor and hear evidence concern ing the alleged injustice. Whenever possible, the committee will consist of three members of the instructor's department. When the department is too small to permit this procedure, the committee may be composed of two colleagues instead of three. When the departmental chairperson is the instructor accused of the alleged injustice, the student may contact the faculty member of highest rank within the department other than the chairperson, who will appoint a review committee. Any student requesting a review i s responsible for presenting for review all tests, papers, etc., that enter into a grade and that have been returned to the student. All tests, papers, etc., that enter into a grade and have not been returned to students will be kept on file by instructors for at least one semester following the end of a course. After hearing all available evidence in a particular case, the members of the review committee meet with the instructor (the student not being present) and state their opinions concerning the matter . If there is unanimous agreement among the committee members that a grade should be changed, the instructor is obligated to change the grade accordingly. In the absence of such unanimous agreement, the grade decision rests solely with the instructor. (Thi s policy was approved by the faculty on April 4, 1967, with editorial revisions in July 1977 and June 1993.) 146 Lake Forest College is committed to the highest standards of academic honesty. These standards reflect the core values of our in stitution and, thus, are reflected in our mission statement. The standards include integrity, respect, conscientiousness, self -discipline, and civility. Such standards are central to the process of intellectual inquiry, the development of individual charac ter, and the maintenance of a civilized community. The integrity of academic life depends on cooperation among students, faculty, and administrators. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to: Procuring in an unauthorized manner the questions or answers of any examination or employing unauthorized aids while taking an examination. Representing any work product as one's own that was done in whole or in part by another person or in collaboration with another person without attribution o r proper citation. This includes incorporating the work of other students or of unpublished items. Engaging in any form of conduct or action that violates the letter or spirit of academic honesty, including but not limited to: copying, closely paraphrasing , or using another work without explicit acknowledgement of author and source. Submitting the same paper for credit in more than one course without the written consent of all instructors involved. Falsifying data, citations, or other information for academ ic work of any sort. Misrepresenting work done, including submitting a report on a performance or exhibit one did not attend, or lab one did not conduct. Aiding another scholar in the violation of the Academic Honesty Policy. Responsibilities of Students Every student is to uphold the ideals of academic honesty and integrity. Other responsibilities of students include: Students are expected to know Lake Forest College's Academic Honesty Policy. Ignorance of the policy shall not be considered an excuse or a mitigating factor in Academic Honesty Judicial Board proceedings. Students are expected to know what constitutes plagiarism. A handout explaining plagiarism is available at the Writing Center, the Learning and Teaching Center, and the reference desk of the library. Students should consult faculty or staff members when they are unsure whether their actions would constitute a violation of Academic Honesty Policy. In addition to the standards regarding academic honesty given in the Student Handbook, students a re to heed all expectations regarding academic honesty as stated by their course instructors. Students who are found responsible of academic dishonesty are expected to comply with all sanctions, including participating in individual educational components, such as meeting with the Ethics Center or Writing Center. Students who have previously been found to violate the academic honesty policy, but have not yet complied with any imposed Ethics Center or Writing Center educational components, may not use non - compliance as an excuse in future violations. Student members of the Academic Honesty Judicial Board shall maintain the confidentiality of students accused of violating Academic Honesty Policies. Academic Honesty 147 Responsibilities of Faculty Every faculty member is to uphold the ideals of academic honesty and integrity. Other responsibilities of faculty include: Every faculty member is to be acquainted with Lake Forest College's Academic Honesty Policy as outlined in the Faculty Handbook. Faculty is to maintain the confidentia lity of students accused of violating Academic Honesty Policy, consistent with College policy and applicable governmental regulations. Faculty and staff are to exercise caution in the preparation, duplication, and security of examinations. No test may be g iven prior to its originally designated time. However, faculty may arrange for students with documented disabilities to begin an exam early if the student a) qualifies for extended time on exams and uses proctoring services, and b) has provided the faculty member with an accommodation letter that includes test accommodations as approved accommodations, and c) has a subsequent class or exam that would begin during the usual extended time. In such cases, students may be required to remain with the proctor unt il the beginning of the scheduled exam for the class. As an alternative, the faculty member may choose to offer an exam at a later time. The Dean of the Faculty may grant other exceptions to this rule at the request of the faculty member Faculty is to take reasonable steps consistent with the physical conditions of the classroom to reduce the possibility of cheating on examinations. Classroom tests are to be proctored with diligence. Faculty who would like to make a formal charge of a violation of academic honesty should consult with the current Academic Honesty Judicial Board (AHJB) Chair. Academic Honesty Judicial Board Composition: The Academic Honesty Judicial Board (AHJB) is composed of a Chair and an available pool of 6 -8 faculty members and at least 8 students. The Chair is a faculty member selected cooperatively by the Dean of the Faculty and the Dean of Students. The pool of faculty members is appointed by the Faculty Personnel and Policies Committee; the faculty members should represent diverse div isions. The pool of student members are selected through the Dean of Students' office each fall semester and are also called to serve on the general Conduct Board. The Dean of Students' designee solicits nominations from students, faculty and staff. Next, nominations are vetted by the Dean of Students' office, and nominees must not have violated the College's Academic Honesty Policy nor been found responsible for any student conduct policy violations. The Dean of Students may make exceptions in special case s. The Dean of Students' designee will make final selections of the student pool and provide training. The Dean of Students and the Dean of the Faculty will designate a \"summer chair\" and a \"summer board\" to cover cases arising late in the spring, over the summer, or during the first days of classes before the Board has been established. The summer board may or may not be composed of faculty and students who serve on the regular board. Procedures A faculty member may bring a charge of academic dishonesty a gainst a student if, in his or her judgment, the student has violated the norms of academic honesty and integrity. The faculty member shall inform the student of the allegation in writing along with a recommended sanction. Faculty are encouraged to consult with the current AHJB Chair regarding appropriate sanctions. The faculty member must allow an accused student up to five business days to consider the allegation and submit a statement admitting or denying the allegation and agreeing or disagreeing with t he recommended sanction. The faculty member will forward all relevant information and correspondence to the AHJB Chair, who will formally record the case. If the faculty member is unable to contact the student despite making a good faith effort to do so, h e or she should submit a formal charge and any other appropriate documentation to the AHJB Chair. In this case, the Chair informs the student of the formal charge, allows them five business days to respond, and instructs the student how to proceed. 148 If an a ccused student admits to violating the Academic Honesty Policy and agrees with the faculty member's recommended sanction: The faculty member and student submit their respective statements to the AHJB Chair. For a first offense, the AHJB simply records the violation and sanction, notifying all appropriate parties (see \"sanctions\" below). For second and subsequent offenses, the AHJB meets to determine sanction(s). The faculty member and student are invited to address the AHJB before sanctioning, but are not r equired to do so. If an accused student denies violating the Academic Honesty Policy or disagrees with the faculty member's recommended sanction, the AHJB hears the case according to the following the procedure: The faculty member and student each submit a statement and evidence to the AHJB Chair. The Chair sets a date for the hearing, normally within one week of receiving the student's statement, and notifies the student by email and by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. The hearing date may b e postponed at the discretion of the Chair. Cases arising between semesters, during final exam week, or during Summer Session will be heard as soon as the Chair can reasonably convene a Board. The Chair, upon consultation with the faculty member and the st udent, may summon a reasonable number of relevant witnesses to the hearing. Any party may consult with the Chair at any time. The student has the right to be assisted at the hearing by an advisor drawn from within the campus community. The hearing consists of the Chair (who does not vote) and of a jury of 1 faculty member and 2 student members from the AHJB. This jury of 3 must be present for hearing to proceed. A finding of responsibility requires 2 votes out of the 3 voting members. In the event that the AHJB members agree on the finding of responsibility but are divided on the issue of an appropriate sanction, the AHJB first votes on the most severe of the contemplated sanctions, proceeding through lesser sanctions until a sanction receives at least 2 vot es. Evidence must pertain to the charge as determined by the Chair. The Chair notifies the student and faculty member of the AHJB's decisions by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. The process outlined above is intended to provide accused stude nts an opportunity to respond to allegations of academic dishonesty, thereby enabling the AHJB to make an informed decision about responsibility and impose appropriate sanctions. However, if a student fails to respond within five days to the attempt to sol icit a plea or schedule a hearing, the AHJB Chair will note that the student has failed to respond and will schedule a hearing. The AHJB Chair will inform the student (by College e -mail) of the date, time, and place of the hearing at least 48 hours prior t o the scheduled hearing. If the student does not enter a plea prior to the hearing, a plea of \"not responsible\" will be entered on the student's behalf. If a student fails to attend a scheduled hearing, the Chair may proceed with the hearing without the st udent and a decision will be rendered based upon available information. Sanctions For first offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignment. The AHJB may choose to impose sanctions other than the expected minimum. The maximum sanction is failure of the course. The sanction should also include one or more educational components, such as informational sessions with library or Ethics Center staff, or repetition of the assignment for no credit. For se cond offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignment, along with an educational component. Additionally, second offenses lead the AHJB to consider suspension from the College for the following full semester(s) (i.e. fall or spring). If the AHJB recommends suspension from the College, this recommendation is submitted to the President by the Chair along with a 149 recommendation regarding whether the College should accept courses taken at another institu tion while the student serves his or her suspension. The President then notifies the student and AHJB Chair of his or her decision by email. For third offenses, the expected minimum sanction is zero points awarded for the project, examination, or assignmen t. Additionally, AHJB votes on whether to recommend dismissal from the College, effective the following semester. The Chair informs the President of the AHJB's recommendation. The President then notifies the student and AHJB Chair of his or her decision by registered campus mail or registered U.S. mail. Suspensions and dismissals are noted on a student's transcript. Those students who are found responsible for a violation - and are assigned an educational component - will be instructed to complete the educa tional component within 30 days. For example, those that are required to see Ethics Center will be instructed to make an appointment with the Ethics Center Director within a specified number of days; after their initial meeting with the Director, they will have 30 days to complete an individualized academic honesty education program. Occasionally the Director may refer the student to the Writing Center for additional support. When 30 days are not practical, the student, AHJB chair, and educational component advisor will agree on a reasonable deadline for completion. If the student fails to communicate with the Ethics Center Director or fails to complete the program within 30 days, the case may be referred back to the AHJB Chair for further academic penalties , or the case may be referred to the Dean of Students to be charged with failure to comply with college officials through the behavioral conduct process. The student will notify both the AHJB chair and the educational component advisor via email once the e ducational component is completed. Non -Lake Forest College students who are found responsible for academic dishonesty will not be required to meet with the Ethics Center or Writing Center. The faculty member, Dean of the Faculty, Dean of Students, Chair of AHJB, and the faculty advisor are notified of any sanctions assessed for Academic Honesty Policy violations. Furthermore, the Registrar is notified of any course failures. Suspensions or dismissals from the College are recorded on students' transcripts an d in their permanent files. Withdrawals See the section titled \"Exceptions\" under \"Academic Policies\" regarding withdrawals from courses in which charges of academic dishonesty have been brought. Appeals A student may ask the Dean of the Faculty to conside r an appeal on procedural grounds only. Student Evaluations When a faculty member has brought a charge of academic dishonesty against a student, a note indicating that such a charge was made will be included with the student evaluations for that course. 150 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination and mandate the availability of accommodations to ameliorate the i mpact of the disability to afford equal access to education. Students must meet the statutory definition of disability under federal law. In order to determine whether an individual is entitled to these protections, the Health and Wellness Center and the L earning and Teaching Center require evidence verifying that the individual's condition fits the definition of \"disability.\" The ADA defines disability as: 1. a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 2. a record of having such an impairment, or 3. being regarded as having such an impairment. A condition is considered a disability if it prevents or substantially limits the ability to perform a major life activity or significantly restricts th e condition, manner, or duration in performing the major life activity as compared to the average person. The analysis of \"substantially limits\" is a comparative term to the average person in severity, impact, and duration. Generally, a condition must be s ubstantially limiting for more than several months. A condition is not a disability if it results in mild limitations. ADA evidence serves two primary purposes: 1. To establish the right to protection from discrimination. Non -discrimination is an assurance that individuals with disabilities will not be excluded or provided lesser access to programs and activities based on assumptions rooted in stereotype or perception of ability that are not based in fact. Non - discriminati on also provides freedom from harassment based on perceptions of disability. Evidence needed for protection from discrimination based on disability without a request for accommodation can be quite brief. A diagnostic statement from an appropriate professio nal or a past history or recognition as a person with a disability could suffice as the basis for protection from discrimination. 2. To determine the accommodations to which the individual may be entitled. Reasonable accommodations include modifications to po licy, procedure, or practice and/or the provision of auxiliary aids and services that are designed to provide equal access to programs and services for qualified individuals with disabilities. Accommodations are reasonable when they do not fundamentally al ter the nature of a program or service and do not represent an undue financial or administrative burden. To request appropriate accommodations, a student should contact the Assistant Dean of Faculty for Learning Support. More information can be found on th e Services for Students with Disabilities website. Grievance Procedure Lake Forest College does not discriminate on the basis of a disability against any otherwise qualified person by denying him or her participation in, or the benefits of, any College pro gram or activity. Section 504 requires the adoption of a grievance procedure to deal with allegations of discrimination on the basis of a disability. If a member of the student body feels there is reason to believe that discrimination because Services for Students with Disabilities 151 of disability has occurred under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance should be handled in the following manner: Individuals with a grievance should notify the President's Office of their grievances, in writing. It is recommended to do so within s even days of the alleged incident. Failing resolution, individuals should follow appropriate grievance procedures established for sex discrimination. 152 African American Studies American Studies Area Studies Art and Art History Asian Studies Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biology Chemistry Cinema Studies Classical Studies College Studies Communication Data Science Digital Media Design Economics, Business, and Finance Education English Entrepreneurship and Innovation Environmental Studies Ethics Center First-Year Studies Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies History Islamic World Studies Journalism Latin American and Latinx Studies Legal Studies Mathematics and Computer Science Medieval and Renaissance Studies Modern Languages and Literatures Museum Studies Music Music Education Neuroscience Philosophy Physics Politics and International Relations Print and Digital Publishing Undergraduate Departments and Programs 153 Public Policy Psychology Religion Self-Designed Major Social Justice Studies Sociology and Anthropology Theater Urban Studies 154 Faculty Daw -Nay Evans Associate Professor of Philosophy Chair of African American Studies Courtney Joseph Assistant Professor of History and African American Studies RL Watson Assistant Professor of English Major and Minor in African American Studies The Major and Minor in African American Studies were redesigned in 2021.

Topics include major events, persons, and issues spanning the period from the African heritage to contemporary times. Students survey t he evolution of African American expressive culture in music, literature, film, art, and dance. The course includes lectures, discussions, and video presentations. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pl uralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) AFAM 120: BK's Finest: JAY -Z and Philosophy (Brooklyn's Finest: -Z and Philosophy.) From growing up in the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn to selling out concerts at Madison Square Garden, JAY -Z has become a global hip -hop icon. Besides being the first rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and holding the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist, JAY -Z's body of work stands as a monumental contribution to American culture. In this course, we explore the poetics and philosophy of JAY -Z's music. As we cultivate an artistic appreciation for JAY -Z's rap skills such as storytelling, wordplay, and delivery, we also treat his music as an opportunity to critically engage topics such as racism, sexism, and economic inequality. Finally, we watch several of JAY -Z's music videos as well as documentaries focused on his life and work. No prerequisites. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: PHIL 120 AFAM 200: Black Politics and Protest This course traces moments in the history of Black America's quest for freedom and survival. This course analyzes how Black political movements have operated in relation to, and in response to, segregation, (un)employment, housing, policing and incarceration, voting rights, health, education, and law. Consequently, this course examines how state repression has responded to, neutralized, and liquidated Black movements and the people that led them. While the focus is primarily on Black American politics and struggle, this course also showcases how Black political engagement has always been globally linked with struggles for liberation across Africa and the Caribbean, Latin and South America, Europe, and Asia. From slavery and abolition, the Civil War and Reconstruction, Jim Crow and Civil Rights, neoliberalism and war, to the election of Barack Obama in 2008, we examine the cultural, social, and political depth that Black people have carved in a history of American political discourse. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements.) cross listed: POLS 204 AFAM 208: Africana Women's Religious Experience.) New Description: This course explores the multidimensional religious experiences of Africana women, specifically Black women throughout the Americas, Africa, and the C aribbean, as they attempt to define and realize a sacred self across diverse periods and contexts. We give attention to the voices of Africana women in history and literature, film, performance, sacred speech and music to examine the ways religion has empo wered and disempowered Black women in their individual and collective lives. Prerequisite: One course in either GSWS or AFAM. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: RELG 200, GSWS 208 AFAM 214: James Baldwin In his powerful and moving novels and essays, James Baldwin confronted the lies America told itself about race, exposing the roots of social and political and cultural systems that superficially boasted of improving race relations but t hat instead continued to marginalize Black and brown bodies. This course offers a close reading of Baldwin's fiction and his essays, probing the ways that he provides a critique of the politics of race, sexuality, and nation in his own time and in ours. Th e course also includes readings and discussions of critical analyses of 158 Baldwin's writings. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Writing requirements.) cross listed: ENGL 214 AFAM 215: A frofuturism What is a black future? The term \"Afrofuturism\" has been used to describe the recent cultural creations of black writers and artists who vividly envision futures of and for people of African descent. Afrofuturism, which aesthetic gained momentu m in the work of science fiction authors Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, as well as in the jazz and poetry of musician SunRa, and which can be found thriving in works like Black Panther, is the subject of inquiry for this course. This survey is an int roduction to the literary works produced within the movement from its modern manifestations to its present -day expansions. In his landmark essay on the topic, Mark Dery asks, \"Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?\" The wealth of literary and artistic production of works in the aesthetic provides a diverse and emphatic \"yes.\" This course seeks to position Afrofu turism as an alternative means of (re)interpretation, back -talk, and as an avenue for imagining a future in light of (and in spite of) the experiences of the past and present. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: ENGL 215 AFAM 216: African American Literature I This course is an introduction to the writings of A frican -Americans before the Civil War. These diverse documents tell tales of faith, perseverance, rebellion, suffering, freedom, independence, cunning, and patriotism that are an integral part of the American literary canon. We read a collection of classic s together, compare and contrast the voices represented, and consider the diversity of responses to finding oneself in chains in one of the most brutal forms of chattel slavery the world has ever known. Voices studied include Douglass, Wheatley, Jacobs, Br own, Wilson, Walker, Turner, and Thurman. No prerequisites.

This course is a sister course to African - American Literature I, and covers African -American literature written after the American Civil War. In this part of the one -year survey, we examine narrative attempts by African -American authors to define blackness and the black experience on their own terms in the period before, during, and after the Harlem Renaissance. We read a collection of classics together, compare and contrast the voices represented, and consider the development of African American literary self - representation in the century following Emancipation. Voices studied include Wells, Washington, Hughes, Johnson, Baldwin, and Morrison. N o prerequisites.

Malcolm X (el -Hajj Malik el -Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so often put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle \u2014whether it be through the message of non - violence and Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self - defense and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malc olm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular in style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featured by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to delve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle in America. We look at the creative 159 activist writings of ea ch-speeches, letters, interviews, autobiographical material \u2014and complicate what at first seems a simple battle between \"violent\" and \"non -violent\" approaches to liberation.

By digging into the sources of various samples, we learn about the history of American popular music production. In addition, we put the music created by hip - hop producers into historic context. There is no such thing as music production separate from identity. Because hip-hop is the dominant musical form of our time, and because it's widely viewed as a form of black music, we study it to flesh out American musical identity .

His films challenge the stereotypes and paternalistic assumptions about African Americans that have become sacrosanct in America's popular imagination. We will explore how the aesth etic representation of race, class, and gender in Spike Lee's filmography have helped create a new genre of film called African American noir. In so doing, we will watch several of Spike Lee's films, documentary projects, and television ads. Ultimately, ou r goal will be to appreciate Lee's cinematic technique, examine his critique of white supremacy, and consider the cultural and historical events that have shaped his artistic vision.

Students will study how racial injustice continues to pervade the American criminal justice system despite the constitutiona l guarantees of equal protection and due process. How do so many players, from police officers to judges and juries, fail to protect against racial injustice? Why do courts, when confronted with allegations or proof of racially motivated police misconduct, overwhelmingly cite \"harmless error\" doctrine?

The motivating goal in this course is to show students how social structure and meaning become intertwined elements in how we experience race, class, and gender. An important element in this course will be the emphasis on the identities and positions of relatively less empowered groups in contemporary society. This will be done through a focused consideration of structural and ideological elements of contemporary culture as found in: the media industry, journalism, social constructions of reality, music, film, television, radio, and the internet.

This course offers carcerality as a framework that organizes sites and accruals of human misery and resistance across time and across multiple spatial scales. Rather than treating the \"police ,\" \"law and order,\" and \"criminal justice\" as apolitical and ahistorical institutions, this course addresses them within the concrete social contexts of their formation.

Critics and audiences have noted that we are in a golden era of black television, with an upsurge of shows over the last few years that display the multiplicity of black life in the United State s. And yet, this is not the first time this has happened. Since the 1950s, African Americans have been depicted on the small screen in both regressive and progressive ways. How have these images changed over time? How do these depictions impact the way peo ple see African Americans and how African Americans see themselves? No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to sta bility, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly - arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequali ty, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

But why? This course works to find answers to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of Black environmental culture in conversation with key moments in Black history in the United States --from slavery to sharecroppi ng, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. Interdisciplinary approaches examine sources as diverse as slave narratives, fiction, poetry, songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies. Black intellectuals, writers, visual and musical artist s, and everyday citizens not always associated with environmental thought are considered, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and the victims of Flint, Michigan's, water crisis.

All three approaches will provide us with mul tiple angles from which to consider the institution of slavery and America's supposed commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On the whole, our aim will be to wrestle with the tortured logic that is the tragic contradiction of American s lavery and American freedom.

From climate change's rising seas that threaten develop ing nations to the toxic waste dumps that threaten the health of communities of color, case studies are used to explore how local struggles help shape a global consciousness about environmental injustices.

African -American philosophy can be defined in two ways: (1) wide -ranging philosophical work done by Americans of recent black African descent and (2) philosophical work on the lived experience of Americans of recent black African descent. We will primarily read philosophers whose philosophical work emphasizes the African -Americ an experience. Thematically, the course will be guided by one overriding question: Given the historical reality of the Atlantic Slave Trade, the Three -Fifths Compromise, the anti -miscegenation laws, the Fugitive Slave Law, Lynch Law, and the Jim Crow laws, among many other inhumane practices, how does the experience of Africans in America constitute a unique combination of philosophical perspectives?

In this course, we focus on important moments of musical protest in Popular music in the United States, from the Civil War to the present day. We examine a range of issues, with a strong focus on Civil War -era abolition songs, music of the Civil Rights era, anti -War songs from the Vietnam and Iraq conflicts, and contemporary music that addresses police brutality and systemic racism.

The history of African Americans in the United States is often defined by the chattel slavery experience. However, the early years of A merican history that made people of African descent American are much more complex. By centering the actions and voices of the heterogeneous African American community, this course examines topics including the Middle Passage, domestic slavery expansion, f ree and maroon black communities, various resistance strategies, interracial coalitions, and the role of enslaved people in bringing about their own emancipation.

In 1865, the centuries -old question of where Africa n Americans would fit into the fabric of United States society was finally answered. As newly freed people and full citizens, African Americans learned that the process of citizenship would not be seamless or easy, and that the fight was just beginning.

Taught in a seminar format, the class will be both reading - and writing -intensive. Course readings and paper assign ments are designed to help students develop a comparative analytical framework and to illuminate the following lines of inquiry: What caused and what sustained the civil rights movement? What changes took place within the movement over time, particularly a t the level of leadership? What underlay the radicalization of the movement and what were the consequences? To what extent did the civil rights movement succeed and how do we measure that success today?

Spearheaded by legal scholars of color, critical race t heory encompasses a critical intervention on the pervasive realities of racial and gendered violence as it operates in a variety of historical and social contexts. This course situates an interdisciplinary understanding of how legal praxis emerges from lar ger structures of power such as racial chattel slavery, colonialism and conquest, genocide, apartheid, capitalism, and imperialism.

Besides being the first rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and holding the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist, JAY -Z's body of work stands as a monumental contribution to American culture. In this course, we explore the poetics and philosophy of JAY -Z's music. As we cultivate an artistic appreciation for JAY -Z's rap skills such as storytelling, wordplay, and delivery, we also treat his music as an opportunity to critically engage topics such as racism, sexism, a nd economic inequality.

Consequently, this course examines how state repression has responded to, neutralized, and liquidated Black movements and the people that led them. While the focus is primarily on Black American politics and struggle, this course also showcases 167 how Black political engagement has always been globally linked with struggles for liberation across Africa and the Caribbean, Latin and South America, Europe, and Asia. From slav ery and abolition, the Civil War and Reconstruction, Jim Crow and Civil Rights, neoliberalism and war, to the election of Barack Obama in 2008, we examine the cultural, social, and political depth that Black people have carved in a history of American poli tical discourse.

AFAM 230: Africa and the World This course draws on histories, philosophies, politics, and cultures that constitute how Africa (as both a geopolitical location as well as a contested terrain of both imagination and conquest) has been at the center of the Black radical imagination. Drawing on global narratives of what Africa has mea nt throughout history to various intellectual, cultural, political, and artistic producers, this course investigates how generations of African descendants, particularly in the Americas, have imagined, created, and remembered Africa as a homeland to which, in various ways, they hope to return. Amidst imperialism and war, colonialism and genocide, (im)migration and disposal, this course asks: how have Black people in the West imagined these histories and realities of mass violence as central to how Africa is thought of in the present?

We pay special attention to the normative, metaphysical, and conceptual problems and solutions that inform philosophical race theory. Some o f the key questions we answer include the following: Is race a natural kind, a social kind, or something else entirely? What does philosophy have to contribute to the study of race and racism? What is the relationship between race and racism? We draw on re adings from the history of philosophy, mainstream analytic philosophy, and recent European philosophy. Ultimately, the aim of this course is to provide students with a philosophical toolkit that will allow them to engage in civil and informed critical disc ussions about the nature and consequences of race talk and the practice of racism.

His films challenge the stereot ypes and paternalistic assumptions about African Americans that have become sacrosanct in America's popular imagination. We will explore how the aesthetic representation of race, class, and gender in Spike Lee's filmography have helped create a new genre o f film called African American noir. In so doing, we will watch several of Spike Lee's films, documentary projects, and television ads. Ultimately, our goal will be to appreciate Lee's cinematic technique, examine his critique of white supremacy, and consi der the cultural and historical events that have shaped his artistic vision.

Polls indicate that America is, by far, the most religious of industrial democracies and that our contentious political debates are, in large part, due to the religious dimensions of morally evocative issues like abortion and gay marriage, an d the firm positions of such constituencies as the Christian Right and new Religious Left. Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage and temperance drew on scholarly and legal interpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religiou s freedom and the separation of church and state.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K -12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of e ducation. No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crim e today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly - arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

Rather than attempt a survey of all the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understandings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contemporary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the t ropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' certain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's lives.

AMER 478: The 21st Century World (Dis)Order The international system of states is undergoing a power shift. Though it will remain the dominant world power for some time to come, most scho lars agree that American global preeminence is waning. Yet scholars disagree about the effect of this shift on world order. Some see an effort by the United States and its closest allies to prop - up the current American liberal world order of global economi c integration and cooperative security. Others envision either a 'post -American' world in which the United States and rising great powers re -negotiate the ground rules of a new liberal order, or a world in which the United States is one of a small number o f great powers competing for power and influence in an illiberal world. Each of these possibilities raises compelling questions about war and peace, and cooperation and discord in twenty -first century international politics. Will this power shift jeopardiz e the liberal world order? Can this world order persist in the absence of American preeminence? How might the United States and its allies extend the current American world order?

ASIA 275: Desire and Discipline: Asian Morals This course offers a focused historical narrative of the development of Asian moral thinking. It shows, at its early phase, how a particular moral philosopher's thinking (such as Mencius and Xun -zi) is largely determined by his thinking on human nature. However, in later periods, particularly after the importation of Buddhism, the debates on human nature are replaced by an intense cognitive and metaphysical interest in the human mind. Moral cultivation begins to focus less on following moral rules but more on cultivating the mind. The effect of this nature -mind shift on Asian moral thinking is both historically profound and theoretically surprising. Readings: Confucius, Mencius, Xun -zi, Lao zi, Zhuang z i, Zhang Zai, Chen Brothers, Zhu Xi and D. T. Suzuki.

This course serves biology students, as an elective, and neuroscience students, as the first course in the two -part core neuroscience sequence. The course explores basic concepts in brain, mind, and behavior from a sub -organismal perspective. Current issues are exami ned within a broad integrative framework that begins with the cellular and molecular physiology of individual neurons. This lays the groundwork for the study of how molecules control the development of neuronal pathways and networks that underlie sensory, integrative, and motor systems. In addition, the course explores the molecular genetic basis of complex brain functions including learning, memory, affect, sleep, homeostasis, and ultimately, cognition. The accompanying laboratory provides students with ha nds-on experiences in the contemporary methods and experimental approaches of cellular and integrative neurophysiology.

Please consult the program chair to determine which courses are appropriate for this credit. Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the Classical Studies Program are: 1. The Classical Studies minor student will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the major epochs of Greek and/or Roman antiquity, including the broad span of either or both of these cu ltures as distinct and unique cultural -historical entities among other ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean area and Near East, and within specific areas of student disciplinary specialization (e.g. art, history, archaeology, politics, philosophy, religion, sociology, anthropology, museum studies & etc.), and the defining characteristics of ancient Greek and/or Roman civilization in antiquity. 2. Classical Studies minors will demonstrate a familiarity with the principles and practices of archaeology; be able to understand archaeological sites and their schematic representations based on topographical site plans; and relate critical archaeological inquiry to other disciplines and courses of study fundamental to an understanding of ancient Greece or Rome , or, comparatively, other ancient cultures and civilizations. 3. The Classical Studies minor will demonstrate an understanding of the uniqueness, innovations and legacy of Graeco -Roman antiquity in relation to later civilizations (the 'western tradition' and its opponents), including subsequent Greek cultures and modern institutions, styles, principles and values dominant in the West and (where applicable) in non -Western cultures. 286 4. After participation in a study -abroad program in Greece, the Classical St udies minor will be able to demonstrate research skills, critical thinking and writing skills. He or she will be able to make cogent reflections on the experience in another culture as well as connections to her or his on -campus program of studies or other aspects of her or his academic career. Classical Studies Courses CLAS 201: Ancient Greece: Life, Thought, Arts In this course, students gain an understanding of the ancient Greek world, in which so many modern Western humanistic values and ideas found the ir earliest expression. In particular, we study the story as it is presented by the ancient Greeks themselves \u2014in their literature, written history, philosophy, art, and artifacts. As a prerequisite course for the Lake Forest College Program in Greece (duri ng which students study actual artifacts of the ancient world on site in Greece), this course is interdisciplinary by design, both in what is studied and how it is studied. We, for instance, identify and discuss the importance of various areas on the city plans of ancient Greek polei, learn about the role of women in ancient Sparta vs. their role in ancient Athens, engage in deep literary analysis of Homer's epic poems, and learn the techniques, shapes, and uses appropriate to different Greek vases from the Bronze Age to the Classical period. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) CLAS 202: Greek Civ: Bronze Ag e to Byzantium The classroom for this course is Greece itself. Students will travel to a variety of archeological sites, museums, and other important and beautiful places across Greece, including several Greek Islands, studying the history, art, and societ y of Greece from the Bronze Age (roughly 3000 -1200 BCE), through the Classical Age (480 -300 BCE) to the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire (330 -1453 CE). Study sites may include the palace of Knossos on Crete (by legend, the home of the Minotaur), Agame mnon's palace at Mycenae, the Athenian Acropolis and Agora, or the Hagios Demetrios, where the the Patron Saint of Thessaloniki was martyred. Prerequisite: CLAS 201 or consent of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) CLAS 210: Greek History This course uses ancient evidence to explore the issues that emerged in the course of early Greek history: the nature of interactions between Greeks and other ancient cultures and societies of the Mediterranean, Near East, and North Africa; political developments in Greek city -states (especially Athens and Sparta); religious movements, beli efs, and practices; advances in philosophical thought and rational inquiry; the tensions between local identities and a common Greek identity; gender and sexuality; freedom and slavery in Greek politics and society; the diffusion of Hellenistic culture thr oughout the Mediterranean world; and the expansion of Alexander the Great's empire. The course scrutinizes and reassesses modern interpretations of the ancient Greek past and its legacy. It better equips students to evaluate claims about ancient history an d what the ancient Greeks might mean for us now. Students work extensively with primary documents in translation. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives and Writing requirements. Under the ol d GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: HIST 210 CLAS 211: Roman History This course examines the history of Italy and the Mediterranean world during the thousand -plus years of Roman rule. We begin with R ome's establishment as a small city -state, as recorded in both legend and archaeological evidence. We chart Rome's political development and imperial expansion under the republic, study the career of Augustus and the revolution by which he transformed Rome into an empire, and conclude with that empire's fragmentation into the Byzantine, Latin Christian, and Islamic worlds. The topics studied will include: key political institutions and leaders; war, imperialism, and their consequences, including slavery and social unrest; the work of authors such as Cicero, Vergil, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius; the varied Roman religious scene and the rise of 287 Christianity and Islam; Roman social history, including class, marriage, and slavery.

Everybody eats, and every culture has developed cultural patterns and social norms around the production, preparation, and consumption of food and drink (foodways). This course offers an introduction to Food Studies, the cultural analysis of food and foodways. Students consider the models and methods of studying food, including the major anthropological, folkloristic, and sociological approaches. Since this course is taught in Athens as part of the Lake Forest College in Greece program, it takes Greek food and foodways as the major case study. During the course, students focus on the relationship of food to their areas of interest, such as agritourism, environmental co ncerns, politics, or religion. Prerequisites: No prerequisites. Corequisites: This course in taught in Athens. Participation in the Lake Forest College in Greece Program is required.

Using entrepreneurship frameworks, students develop a deeper awareness of self, others, and the world. Students also explore personal and career -path opportunities, and the importance of resilience, reflecti ve decision -making, and goal setting in those pursuits. This experiential course offers personal and career exploration via distinguished speakers, lectures, class discussion, and readings. No prerequisites. Not open to seniors. COLL 222: Powerful Academic Writing Powerful academic writers write like great speakers sound --they move audiences to change their opinions, their actions, their perspectives. Good writers often read their writing aloud to be sure that each sentence communicates its intent. In this course, students read their writing aloud, give meaningful critique to others, work in writing teams (as if in the workplace) and, develop writing confidence through hearing as well as seeing ideas on the page. Most importantly, students write about facts and ideas with personal meaning, passion, and purpose. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement.) COLL 150: Data Analytics using Excel In this course, students learn basic and intermediate Micr osoft Excel skills to help them analyze data and model outcomes.

(Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 212: Visual Rhetoric We are surrounded by visual communication in our daily lives, ye t the ubiquity of visual imagery makes it difficult for us to critically evaluate the images we see. In this course we will approach visual artifacts as texts, paying particular attention to their relationship to the political, social, and economic climate in which they reside. Throughout the semester we will develop a lexicon of visual terms, engage a variety of visual texts, such as monuments, advertisements, photography, typography, and architecture, and practice evaluating visual arguments. Not open to students who have already completed COMM 112 or COMM 370. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 250: Classical Rhetorical Tradition This course is an historical survey of theorizing about the role of public discourse in human affairs from ancient Greece and Rome. We consider how the functions and nature of public discourse is understood, whether its skillful use can be taught, and the r elationship between public argument and reaching social consensus about issues of truth and ethics. We will apply these ancient concepts to contemporary ideas in order to explore how concepts from different periods in time can aid us in evaluating contempo rary persuasive messages in public life.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 251 295 COMM 253: Argumentation and Advocacy This course offers an introduction to the theory and practice of argumentation. We will consider how arguments are cre ated, presented, reframed, and refuted in contexts ranging from interpersonal disagreements to public controversies. In order to recognize how different strategies of argumentation change depending on the context, we will explore the important public dimen sion of argumentation and advocacy, recognizing skill in advocacy as a fundamental element of effective democracy. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 255: Communication Criticism In this course we consider how texts work rhetorically to persuade audiences. The course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and tools for describing, analyzing, interpreting and evaluating a var iety of forms of persuasive discourse communicated through different media. Communication Criticism is designed to provide students with knowledge about the nature, function and effects of persuasive communication, as well as to develop the skills necessar y to produce analytical critiques of public discourse. Prerequisite: COMM 110 with a grade of C or better. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Speaking requirements.) COMM 256: Communication Research Methods This course presents students with a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative research methods for doing research in communication, in scholarly and professional contexts. In the course of a semester, this course covers the philosophical rationales underg irding these varied research approaches. With this established, the course gives students a hands -on sense of communication research methods, including: survey research, content analysis, experimental approaches, interviewing, discourse analysis, field res earch, and historical methods. The course will at all times involve careful attention to how the field of communication requires a heightened sense of circumspection regarding its own methods of study. Prerequisite: Comm 110 or consent of the instructor. ( Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Writing requirements.) COMM 274: Visual Chicago This course is a special adaptation of COMM 212: Visual Rhetoric to be taught in the College's \"In the Loop\" program. In this course we will approach visual artifacts as texts, paying particular attention to their relationship to the political, social, and economic climate in which they reside. Throughout the semester we will develop a lexicon of visual terms, engage a varie ty of visual texts, such as monuments, advertisements, photography, typography, and architecture, and practice evaluating visual arguments. What makes this course different from COMM 212 is that our visual texts and assignments will focus on Chicago based visual artifacts. Not open to students who have already completed COMM 112, COMM 212, or COMM 370. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humaniti es requirement.) COMM 281: Media and Society In this course, we examine the major theories and social critiques developed in response to systems of mass media and communication, including film, radio, television, and a national press. These theories and cr itiques range in concern from the democratic potential of mass media, to their role in manufacturing and mediating cultural values. Students engage with the major schools of thought that have become the foundation for contemporary mass communication and me dia research, including: early sociological approaches to communication theory, the strong and limited media effects traditions, the technology -oriented theories of the Canadian School, the Frankfurt School, British Cultural Studies, and American Cultural Studies. Students examine how definitions of mass media and communication have changed over time, and how these concepts continue to evolve alongside our interactions with modern media and communication technologies.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) 296 COMM 283: Race, Class, Gender, and the Media Race, class, and gender occupy important places in the contemporary study of the media. T his course explores the connections between race, class, and gender through the exploration of the intersections between these important components of social structure and ideology. The motivating goal in this course is to show students how social structur e and meaning become intertwined elements in how we experience race, class, and gender. An important element in this course will be the emphasis on the identities and positions of relatively less empowered groups in contemporary society. This will be done through a focused consideration of structural and ideological elements of contemporary culture as found in: the media industry, journalism, social constructions of reality, music, film, television, radio, and the internet.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 283 COMM 285: Modern Media History This course provides a bro ad overview of the history of the media of communication. This is done through use of a chronological treatment of: face -to-face communication, writing, printing, telegraphy, telephony, motion pictures, radio, television, and the internet. Though the cours e begins with a review of ancient communication media, the focus here is placed on the media in Western society from the 19th through the 21st centuries. The most important goal in this course is to consider how media of communication relate to: culture, s ocial structure, the economy, politics, and knowledge.

COMM 287: Media Systems and Institutions Behi nd our favorite movies, TV programs, websites, and songs exist powerful media institutions. Disney, Fox, Warner Brothers, Google, and Apple are just a few of the media industry giants upon which we have grown increasingly dependent for our everyday enterta inment and information needs. In this course we examine these media institutions, including their historical development, organizational structure, and methods of production and distribution. We also analyze and compare the various types of media systems t hat exist in the U.S. and worldwide, including commercial, public, and state -controlled media models. Finally, we consider the issues of globalization and digital convergence, and the ways these phenomena are changing the organization and function of moder n media industries.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) COMM 372: Rhetoric of Economics & the Market In this course we consider the relationship between rhetorical discourse and economics. Do economists merely present empirical conclusions or do they use the techniques of persuasion to create both disciplinary and public understandings of their subject? Is the free market an 'invisible hand' that works to stabilize s ociety or is it a construct of persuasive discourse? Finally we will examine the value of public deliberation regarding complex economic policies. Prerequisite: COMM 255 or permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requ irement.) COMM 373: Cultural Theory and Media Studies In this course students examine a variety of advanced communication theories now current in the field of communication studies, including reception theory, Marxist materialism, political economy, public sphere theory, ritual theory, technological approaches, and production of culture theory. A central goal of this course is to help students contextualize and critique political, social, and economic constructions of culture.

This seminar examines the City of Chicago as both the site and source of rhetoric by using rhetorical theory and skills to ex plore art, architecture, geography, emblems, music, theater, sports, holidays, politics, media, museums, controversies and important rhetorical events including William Jennings Bryan's 1896 Cross of Gold speech, FDR's 1932 nomination acceptance, and Obama 's 2008 victory speech. This course takes advantage of Lake Forest College's proximity to the City of Chicago in order to explore two key concepts in communication: the discursive construction of place and the impact of place on rhetoric. Prerequisite: Com m 255 or permission of instructor (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 376: Queer Cinema This course will focus on queer cinema --films that not only challenge prevailing sexual norms, but also seek to undermine the categories of gender and sex. Gender and sexual norms are perpetuated and challenged through notions of visibility, a key tactic in the fight for societal acceptance and civil rights. How sexuality is made visible and invisible will serve as a central focu s in our analysis of queer film and media, focusing primarily on explicit representations of GLBTQ characters.

The course compares and contrasts classical liberal and romantic theories of expression. We examine b oth philosophies as they are reflected in historical examples of debates concerning freedom of expression, with a special emphasis on freedom of the press, but also addressing issues related to censorship, propaganda, pornography, and hate speech. The cour se culminates with a consideration of how arguments about freedom of expression come to rely on the precepts of these philosophies.

The course begins with a sustained consi deration of the utopian myths associated with novelty as it relates to technology. After this, the focus moves to different ways to understand how new media (always a treacherous term) relate to: the public and political engagement, journalism, interperson al communication, popular culture, the forces of political economy, surveillance, consumption, and religion.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 384 COMM 385: The Public Sphere In this course we take up the issue of the 'public sphere' to consider its value and operation in modern society. The classic public sphere concerned public debate that took place in small coffeehouses where locals would meet to discuss the issues of the day. Now, public debate can be found strewn across the media: in entertainment, theater, music, art, schools, and of course in journalism. The course is framed by key questions such as: What counts as 'public' and 'private'? What is the role of the public? What voices are excluded in the public sphere? What are the best ways to be public? What role do journalism, photography, film, literature, and sports have in a public sphere? Prerequisite: Comm 255 or Jour 320 or by permission of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 386: Reading Popular Culture:Televi sion Focusing on how culturally we are both producers and products of our popular culture we will try to answer the question: 'are we, as a culture, using the potential of television wisely'? (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement .) cross listed: AMER 386 COMM 387: Rhetoric of Law This course will introduce students to the idea that the US legal system is rhetorical in that it shapes and is shaped by discourse. We will begin by considering what is rhetorical about the law and will then focus our attention on the rhetorical effects of legal discourse. Bearing in mind that the law is particularly performative - that is, it has the power to produce the effects that it names - we will consider the role that the actual language of the law plays in doing the work of the law. We will examine a variety of legal texts and contexts including the courtroom, the trial transcript, appellate opinion, legal textbooks and the Supreme Court opinion in order to understand how prior legal discourses affe ct the outcomes of legal questions. To do so we will learn about and apply particular critical lenses to our texts including rhetorical culture, critical legal studies, narrative and the law as literature movement, and discourse analysis. In addition to re ading trial transcripts and legal opinions, students will be expected to visit a courtroom and watch the proceedings during the course of the semester. Prerequisite: Comm 255, or consent of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humaniti es requirement.) COMM 388: Rhetoric and Public Memory Ancient rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian have made memory central to the study and teaching of rhetoric. However, recent work by contemporary scholars goes beyond examinations of me mory as mnemonic aid to consider memory, and its construction, as rhetorical activity. The primary interest in this respect is the persuasive and communicative features of memory and memory -making. This course examines the rhetoric of collective memory by focusing on how the past is constructed to serve the present. We will explore the communicative bases of public memory and its role in experiences of place and understandings of identity. We will consider how rhetoricians have addressed the issue of memory , paying close attention to how they discuss the materiality of memory, the social and cultural politics shaping the construction of memory, and the theoretical concepts and methods used to rhetorically analyze texts and sites of memory. Prerequisite: COMM 255 or permission from instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 389: Political Economy of Media This course introduces students to critical theories concerned with the political and economic authority of modern m edia industries. We discuss the potential impact of the consolidation of media ownership on the diversity and localism of media; the gatekeeping and agenda -setting functions of globalizing and corporatized 299 media; the increasingly influential role of multin ational media corporations in international policy and trade negotiations; the importance of institutional structure as it relates to the world of journalism; the struggle between public and commercial interests to define and control the infrastructure, co ntent, and interactive spaces of new media; and the possibilities and pitfalls of past and present media reform movements.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 420: Senior Seminar Focus of seminar changes frequently. Fall 2022 Seminar: Communicating Obama. Communicating Obama will focus on how Barack Obama and other people communicated who Obama was through text and image. November 4, 2008, the United States elected Barack Obama as president. This election was historic in that President Obama is the first person of color to be elected president, but every presidential election is historic in that the leader of the United St ates has the opportunity to put their mark on the nation. Political Communication scholars in 1981 introduced the concept of the \"rhetorical presidency\" which is the idea that contemporary presidents direct their persuasive powers to the people instead of Congress. In this seminar we will bring together many aspects of Communication studies as we investigate how communication constructed Obama's presidency and his legacy. The course will be divided into three parts: part one will investigate how Obama const ructed himself as presidential through speeches before he was elected, part two will examine how the official Whitehouse photographer portrayed the Obama presidency in photographs, and part three will consider how Obama's presidency will be remembered by focusing on his farewell address, official portraits, and presidential library. Spring 2023 Seminar: Journalism, Culture and Society. The course will deepen students' knowledge of journalism. The course will involve an extensive survey of contemporary app roaches to understanding journalism, with emphases on the importance of journalism to democracy, and on the intellectual foundations of journalism criticism. Students will master analytical frames for understanding and criticizing print, broadcast, and online journalism. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 283: Race, Class, Gender, and the Media Race, class, and gender occupy important places in the contemporary study of the media. This course explores the connections bet ween race, class, and gender through the exploration of the intersections between these important components of social structure and ideology. The motivating goal in this course is to show students how social structure and meaning become intertwined elemen ts in how we experience race, class, and gender. An important element in this course will be the emphasis on the identities and positions of relatively less empowered groups in contemporary society. This will be done through a focused consideration of stru ctural and ideological elements of contemporary culture as found in: the media industry, journalism, social constructions of reality, music, film, television, radio, and the internet.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: AFAM 283 COMM 285: Modern Media History This course provides a broad overview of the history of the media of communication. This is done through use of a chronological treatment of: face -to-face communication, writing, printing, telegraphy, telephony, motion pictures, radio, television, and the internet. Though the course begins with a review of ancient communication media, the focus here is placed on the media in Western society from the 19th through the 21st centuries. The most important goal in this course is to consider how media of communica tion relate to: culture, social structure, 300 the economy, politics, and knowledge.

(Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 384 COMM 281: Media and Society In this course, we examine the major theories and social critiques developed in response to systems of mass media and communication, including film, radio, televis ion, and a national press. These theories and critiques range in concern from the democratic potential of mass media, to their role in manufacturing and mediating cultural values. Students engage with the major schools of thought that have become the found ation for contemporary mass communication and media research, including: early sociological approaches to communication theory, the strong and limited media effects traditions, the technology -oriented theories of the Canadian School, the Frankfurt School, British Cultural Studies, and American Cultural Studies. Students examine how definitions of mass media and communication have changed over time, and how these concepts continue to evolve alongside our interactions with modern media and communication techn ologies. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) COMM 370: Feminism and Pop Culture This course examines the ways women and female pres enting people have been portrayed and are currently portrayed in the media: in television and movies, in popular music, on the internet, in print sources like magazines and other cultural phenomena. Additionally, we will examine how feminism has been enact ed, defined and denigrated over time in an attempt to understand the cultural tensions within this concept as depicted in popular culture and academic texts. With readings ranging from critical theory to popular non -fiction by and about women, we will spec ulate on the impact of and source for popular portrayals of women and what they might be telling us about women's roles in society. Issues of race, class, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and physical ability will be important as we critically exa mine the forms and functions of women in popular culture.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: GSWS 370 COMM 375: Rhetoric of Humor Comedy is a persuasive form of communication, and this course will provide the analytical and theoretical too ls with which to evaluate humor. Each student will select their own humorous text of choice, be it a single instance or comedic series, and write a series of papers over the term that will be combined to form a major research paper. This sustained analysis will stem from readings and discussions relating to various rhetorical theories (ranging from the classical to the contemporary) regarding the persuasive potential of comedy. Students will discuss their projects in small groups to allow for analyses of di fferent modes of humor transmission (i.e. print, television, movies), as well as various types of comedy (i.e. satire, physical, jokes).

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job pre paration - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By m oving thematically through the roles of both K -12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

For much of the world, the privileging of schooling as a site of education has had real ramifications on the possibility of maintaining cultural forms that go against the pressures of globali zation and capitalism. This course opens with a broad consideration of education before focusing on schooling as the preferred institutional form of education under early 21st century globalism.

ENGL 140: Stories of Resiliency Imaginative literature from many cultures documents challenges to the individual's personal resiliency. Whether these challenges come from antagonists, from the social norms of the com munity, or from nature itself, writers of poetry, drama, and fiction have studied the ways people have met, or failed to meet, challenges to their lives, wellbeing, and sanity. Focusing chiefly on American literature from the nineteenth and twentieth centu ry, this course will engage students in discussion of resiliency struggles as they have been framed by the imaginations of great writers.

ENGL 180: Religion, SciFi, and Fantasy (Religion, Science Fiction, Fantasy) Of th e literary genres, perhaps science fiction and fantasy best allow creative artists to imagine real and possible answers to the deep religious questions that have historically driven philosophers, theologians, and thinkers. Who are we? What do we want? Wher e did we come from? How does everything end? What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? In this class we examine science fiction and fantasy short stories, motion pictures, novels, and television programs to ask how creative artists and wider society have asked and answered these questions. We also consider how science fiction and fantasy have commented on and mirrored real -world religions. No prerequisites. Intended for first -year students and sophomores only.

Talking cats and stranded princesses. Web -footed women and enchanted forests. If you thought you left all of that excitement behind with your childhood fairy tales, think again. Many modern fiction writers have tu rned more and more to the resources of fantasy literature as a fresh way to explore serious ideas for an adult audience. Seeking both to teach and delight, modern fantasy writers re - angle old fairy tales or invent their own enchanted tales to prod contempo rary readers out of conventional ways of thinking and acting, using space and time flexibly to challenge ethical, political, and religious beliefs - indeed, our basic understanding of nature, society and self. In this course, we read the delightful and ins tructively irreverent fantasies of several important modern fiction writers. In doing so, we try to evaluate the nature of each writer's fictional innovations as well as the serious purposes each writer may have in mind for his or her fantasy. In short, we try to understand some of the many possibilities and uses of enchantment in modern fiction.

ENGL 210: Gods, Monsters, & Questing Humanity (Gods, Monsters & Questing Humanity: Ancient and Medieval Literature.) If you love stories of gods and demons, questing heroes and mythic monsters, you'll find a plethora of these fascinating figures in the great tales of ancient and medieval writers such as Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, Marie De France, Dante, Chaucer, and many more. This survey of ancient and medieval litera ture traces the origins of the Western literary tradition by exploring how writers from this delightfully distant period have imagined the gods, how they have understood themselves and their relationship to the cosmos, and how questing human beings have so ught to answer problems of meaning and value that still have resonance for us today.

ENGL 211: From Fairyland to Flying Islands (From Fairyland to Flying Islands: Renaissance to Enlightenment English Literature.) This course explores British literature from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment, an era of revolutionary new encount ers, from discovered moons to newly -charted territories. Writers imagined the freeing power of \"golden worlds\" created by their verse just as experimental literary forms brought into being some of the most esteemed works of literature in Shakespeare's Glob e and the newfangled \"novels\" of Swift and others. Yet it was also a time of profound tumult, from the stake -burning religious upheavals of the Reformation to the monarchical beheadings of the Civil War. How did the writers of the era make sense of both th e discoveries and disruptions of their own time? What happens as we move from an \"early modern\" era into one that feels more distinctly \"modern\"? Making our way through some of the most well -known pieces of the era - Macbeth, Paradise Lost, and Gulliver's Travels - we explore how early writers shaped freedom and constraint, love and cruelty, and the discoveries of new worlds and crumbling texts.

Change came more quickly, and more dramatically, to England during the long nineteenth century - the period between the French Revolution and the First World War - than in any era before or since. The growth of cities, of democracy, of women's rights, and of empire haunted the imagination, spawning images of rebel outsiders, dreams of art for 358 art's sake, and some of the best monsters - Frankenstein's creature, Count Dracula, Dr . Jekyll & Mr. Hyde - in all of literature. We follow the evolution of England's imagination in this most turbulent age. The third course in the Classics of Literature sequence.

ENGL 214: James Baldwin In his powerful and moving novels and essays, James Baldw in confronted the lies America told itself about race, exposing the roots of social and political and cultural systems that superficially boasted of improving race relations but that instead continued to marginalize Black and brown bodies. This course offe rs a close reading of Baldwin's fiction and his essays, probing the ways that he provides a critique of the politics of race, sexuality, and nation in his own time and in ours. The course also includes readings and discussions of critical analyses of Baldw in's writings. No prerequisites.

The term \"Afrofuturism\" has been used to describe the recent cultural creations of black writers and artists who vividly envision futures of and for people of African descent. Afrofuturism, which aesthetic gained momentum in the work of science fiction authors Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, as well as in the jazz and poetry of musician SunRa, and which can be found thriving in works like Black Panther, is the subject of inquiry for this course. This survey is an introduction to the literary works produced within the movement from its modern manifestations to its present -day expansions. In his landmark essay on the topic, Mark Dery asks, \"Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its histo ry, imagine possible futures?\" The wealth of literary and artistic production of works in the aesthetic provides a diverse and emphatic \"yes.\" This course seeks to position Afrofuturism as an alternative means of (re)interpretation, back -talk, and as an av enue for imagining a future in light of (and in spite of) the experiences of the past and present.

This course is a sister course to African - American Literature I, and covers African -America n literature written after the American Civil War. In this part of the one -year survey, we examine narrative attempts by African -American authors to define blackness and the black experience on their own terms in the period before, during, and after the Ha rlem Renaissance. We read a collection of classics together, compare and contrast the voices represented, and consider the development of African American literary self - representation in the century following Emancipation.

Malcolm X (el -Hajj Malik el -Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so of ten put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle \u2014whether it be through the message of non - violence and Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self - defe nse and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malcolm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular in style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featur ed by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to delve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the 359 authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle i n America. We look at the creative activist writings of each -speeches, letters, interviews, autobiographical material \u2014and complicate what at first seems a simple battle between \"violent\" and \"non -violent\" approaches to liberation.

Yet, throughout our varied stories about medicine, writers confront again and again the profound isolation and invisibility of the sick. What is it about physical pain that breaks down our language to describe it? How do medical narratives represent illness, giving structure and voice to t his night -side of life? In this course, we explore medical texts by reading radically different writers across time, including Tolstoy, Shelley, and contemporary physicians. Throughout, we examine the myriad ways artists represent illness, through novels, poetry, short stories, autobiographies, films, guidebooks, and more. We work to unpack the binaries of sickness/health, normal/diseased, patient/doctor, and even life/death, in these stories about doctors, patients, epidemics, and mortality. After learning to \"read\" narratives of disease, students \"write\" disease, creating their own disease through an archive of texts.

ENGL 222: Plagues in Literature: Now and Then Angelic hand prints splayed across plague bodies. Thrillers on futuristic, mutant viruses. Stories of plagues from past and present startle us with their imaginative variety. In fact, many readers have questioned why these narratives so often push the limits of the \"real\" in their representations. Why do writers represent plagues experimentally? Is contagion inherently dangerous to represent, even fictionally? We explore representations of epidemic diseases across a wide expanse of time, from antiquity to the 21st century, encountering along the way common tropes and stock figures of the genre: the plague -pits, enterprising tricksters, and well -poisoners, among others. Across varied stories, including Oedipus and Romeo and Juliet, we track how writers and film - makers use medical disasters to conjure the deepest spiritual crises of societies -gone -wrong, calling on the plague to search for divine meaning and patient zeroes.

While the course will pay particular attention to the outsized influence of Burroughs in contemporary aesthetics, we will freely investigate cut -ups, mash -ups, remixes, dj culture, user -generated content, conceptual literature, crowdsourcing, social media, and related 360 strategies in publishing and aesthetics that together produce a collaborative critique of Romantic d efinitions of authorship and genius. In these domains, we will cover everything from Girl Talk to \"Auto -Tune the News\" to Star Wars: Uncut to what's happening tomorrow, all through the lens of user -based textual interventions.

ENGL 226: Introduction to Virtual Reality (Introduction to Virtual Reality: Culture and Technology). In recent years, virtual reality technology has made major advances, making it possible to do things and go pla ces that were previously impossible. In this course, we'll explore - through readings, discussion, and experiential learning in the Lake Forest College Virtual Space - some of VR experiences in areas including gaming, science, art, research, education, sto rytelling, and socializing. We'll look at the way culture has thought about VR in the last few decades in novels by authors such as William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and Ernest Cline, and in film and television programs like Strange Days, eXistenZ, and Blac k Mirror. In all cases, we will focus on the way narrative storytelling is impacted by virtual culture. This class will give us a chance to think together about how space works differently in VR, how \"real\" VR experiences are and what the future of VR migh t hold. No prerequisites.

We will explore \"drone\" as an umbrella term not only for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which run from children's toys to weapons of war, but also as technological \"noise\" that increasingly confronts us in our daily lives. In this, we will look to representation of automation in literature, in texts such as Galatea 2.2 by Richard Powers. Similarly, the \"sel fie\" is not only the picture one takes on a smart phone, but also a current mode of representation that has significant literary and visual antecedents in portraiture and autobiography. Accordingly, course \"texts\" may include everything from The Picture of Dorian Gray, to a selfie stick, to industrial drone music, although the dominant lens of the course will be literary.

ENGL 244: Writing Science Fiction In this writing -intensive course, students explore the strange new worlds of science fiction and the possibilities of virtual reality. The roots of science fiction go back to 16th - and 17th -century writers like Thomas More, Margaret Cavendish, and John Milton, who confronted the onset of modernity with wildly extravagant utopian and 362 cosmological imaginations. Science fiction since that time has often anticipated the developments of ever - accelerating technological transformation, asking critical questions about the nature of the human in the increasingly alien world we hav e created while addressing key questions of race, class, gender, and ability. Students in this course read works of classic and contemporary science fiction by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. LeGuin, Octavia Butler, Kim St anley Robinson, Philip K. Dick, J.G. Ballard, Kathy Acker, and Ted Chiang, while studying the techniques of world -building, character development, and plot that enable them to write their own science -fictional works. No prerequisites.

The goal is elementary, Watson: discovering what distinguishes the genre in terms of narrative e lements such as character, tension, suspense, plot, and mood. Students are asked to file their reports primarily in the form of their own stories featuring their own detectives investigating crimes of their own choosing.

Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often - dead writers become part of our own brain -matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Virginia Woolf to Vladimir Nabokov. Moreover, we consi der the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" After learning to \"read\" the mind in literature, students will create their own aesthetic of the brain go ne \"right\" or \"wrong\", creating narratives versed in the newest neuroscientific research on the pleasures and dangers of reading the \"minds\" of another.

From Haight -Ashbury acid -testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan -soaked 1980s, and on to the jam -band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars. We'll understand the various subcultures that separate the sixties and now, and in doing so, offer answers to this key question: Why do the Dead survive?

Rowling and Roald Dahl. In reading Rowling's Harry Potter series and select Dahl novels like The Witches and Matilda, we will consider the transgressive and transformative power of children's imaginations - the serious work of mischief - in an adult world. As we engage with these fantastical texts and the criticism written about them, we will investigate themes like power and surveillance, purity and danger, abjection, and absurdity as well as formal elements like voice, plot, character, humor, and symbolism. Although we will discuss the importance of these texts for an audience of children and young adults, we will also consider their appeal for an adult rea dership. Students will be asked to produce analytical and imaginative work in response to our course texts. Potential assignments include reader response essays, book reviews, critiques or syntheses of scholarly articles, and creative exercises in characte r or plot development. No prerequisites.

ENGL 266: The American Graphic Novel (Reading the American Graphic Novel) This course will examine the theory and practice of the graphic novel in America in the twentieth and twenty -first centuries. The serial visual narrative, also known as the graphic novel or comic book, has had a formative influence on Americ an literary and popular culture. Not all comics and graphic novels are written about superheroes; the form has proven flexible enough to encompass such genres as the memoir, historical narrative, and journalism. This course will have a particular focus on the work of such writer - artists as Marjane Satrapi, Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Alison Bechdel, Scott McCloud, Joe Sacco, Harvey Pekar, Robert Crumb, Chris Ware, John Lewis, Daniel Clowes, and Lynda Barry. Students will read and discuss these graphic narra tives with an emphasis on how they make difficult or marginal content accessible to readers, and will have the opportunity to try their own hands at writing comics or a short graphic novel.

Usually placed behind romantic relationships, female friendship is now understood to be a powerful and even transformative dynamic, one that is central to female identity. Men and lovers t ake a back seat. Are BFFs taking over the usual unions of romantic or erotic love? How much are girlfriends the focus of these stories? In this course, we examine these contemporary representations of female friendship, from the four character \"types\" at t he center of Sex and the City and Girls to the erotic and dangerous \"besties\" of Emma Cline's The Girls. We will examine how these \"types\" relate to, and part ways from, their literary predecessors, from Jane Austen to the present. Throughout, we discover the many sides of this complex, and contradictory, relationship. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.

Fantastic fiction such as the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland allows readers the illusion of escape. These works carry us on journeys to la nds of myth and magic, stretching our imaginations and challenging us to reimagine the very foundations of our own world. Though fantasy embraces adventurous escapism, it is also a genre dependent on intricate world -building, rule -making, and a careful con sideration of cultural systems and political hierarchies. In this writing and reading -intensive course, students seek to view our own world through the looking glass as they construct their own long -form fantasy project. Course reading may include classic and contemporary fantasy by such authors as Angela Carter, Lewis Carroll, H. Rider Haggard, J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien, L.

Novel (Happiness, Human L ife, and the 19th Century Novel.) What constitutes human happiness? Biologists may offer their answers by asking why zebras don't get ulcers; psychologists by studying the psychological responses of lottery winners. But long before such scientific inquirie s, nineteenth -century novelists sought to solve the problem of human happiness in their own way, pursuing a very old philosophical topic through nuanced narratives and gripping descriptions of fictional human lives: Emma's as she tries to engineer the happ iness of her good friend, Pip's as he ventures into the high life of London, Dorothea's as she apes the life of an old -time saint, and Anna's as she tries to live out the romances she has absorbed from novels. In this course, we'll read some of the best no vels of the nineteenth century, justly famous because they shed so much light on the good life. We'll ask how these novelists defined a life of full flourishing (eudaemonia), what brings human beings 366 closer to or farther away from happiness, how these ques tions get embedded within nineteenth -century cultural concerns, and what the novel as a genre of imaginative literature can uniquely contribute to our understanding of the good life. Novelists will include Austen, Dickens, Eliot, and Tolstoy (who both infl uenced and was influenced by his British peers). Novels may also be paired with contemporary or classic nonfictional readings on the nature of human happiness. Prerequisite: Any 200 -level English course or permission of instructor.

In this course, students have a chance to read some of Chaucer's most famous Canterbury Tales, his riveting philosophical romance Troilus and Criseyde, and selections from the Legend of G ood Women, which is his comical riff on the medieval saints' life tradition. In each case, we explore how problems of deceit or desire drive his tales and create a narrative framework for exploring provocative social, philosophical, religious, and even cos mological questions. Attention will also be paid to those medieval writers who influenced Chaucer, including Augustine, Boethius, Jean de Meun/Guillaume de Lorris, and, above all, his bawdy Italian inspiration, Boccaccio. Prerequisite: English 210. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Writing requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.)

ENGL 347: Woolf Joyce Beckett (Modernist Masters of Consciousness: Woolf, Joyce, Beckett). The modernist novel in English reached its apex in the twentieth century with the work of Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and Samuel Beckett, each of whom explored the minute movements of human consciousness in prose of unparalleled richness, complexity, and sometimes stark beauty. Woolf's writing, in both her fiction and nonfiction prose, was particularly concerned with the inner lives of women; Joyce developed his theory of the prose epiphany and found mythic underpinni ngs for stories of ordinary Irish life; Beckett's fiction and plays pursued the very limits of language itself. In this seminar -style course, students discuss the work of these three major authors and consider its implications for feminist thought, postcol onial theory, and psychology and cognitive science.

ENGL 267: BFFs: Female Friendship in G irls (BFFs: Female Friendship in the Time of Girls.) \"Besties\" are found everywhere in contemporary anglophone fiction, television, and film. Usually placed behind romantic relationships, female friendship is now understood to be a powerful and even transf ormative dynamic, one that is central to female identity. Men and lovers take a back seat. Are BFFs taking over the usual unions of romantic or erotic love? How much are girlfriends the focus of these stories? In this course, we examine these contemporary representations of female friendship, from the four character \"types\" at the center of Sex and the City and Girls to the erotic and dangerous \"besties\" of Emma Cline's The Girls.

As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often - dead writers become part of our own brain -matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about o ur own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Virginia Woolf to Vladimir Nabokov. Moreover, we consider the close conne ction between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" After learning to \"read\" the mind in literature, students will create their own aesthetic of the brain gone \"right\" or \"wron g\", creating narratives versed in the newest neuroscientific research on the pleasures and dangers of reading the \"minds\" of another.

ENGL 231: Revenge and Justice in Literature The dismemberments, squeaking ghosts, and poisoned pharmacies of literary revenges never cease to thrill and disgust audiences with t heir bittersweet paradoxes. How can we distinguish revengers from villains if their killings are virtually identical? Why does the sober promise of an eye -for-an-eye requital of one body for another become a frenzied massacre of innocents and not -so-innoce nts? Can justice ever be restored by going outside the law, or a lost past ever be re -found in a sordid present? In this course, we consider some of the central paradoxes and themes of revenge by reading radically -different writers from the first to twenty -first centuries, including Seneca, Shakespeare, Stephen King, and Gillian Flynn. All the while, we watch classic revenge flicks to explore how directors from Tarantino to Park Chan -wook translate these narratives onto the screen.

ENGL 232: Stories from the Spectrum (Stories from the Spectrum: Neurodiversity, Health, and Medicine in Literature.) A boy with a penchant for prime numbers investigates the death of a dog. A young girl is scolded for failing to look her teacher in the eye. A man in the throes of a midlife crisis returns to his nonverbal son as he spiritually finds himself. Hidden within these narratives of neurodiverse characters, one discovers a slew of cultural assumptions about cognitive and intellectual disabilitie s. Do neurotypical writers often turn to autism reductively, as a stand -in for a theme or metaphor? What might an authentic representation of Autism Spectrum look like? This course considers the value of neurodiversity in literature while exploring many of the troubling representations of cognitive difference across time, from earlier accounts of un -speaking children to the \"rain mans\" of contemporary film. This course ultimately takes seriously the bi -directional intersections between fiction and medicine, as real -life medical practices both shape and are shaped by these stories from the spectrum.

This survey is an introduction to the literary works produced within the movement from its modern m anifestations to its present -day expansions. In his landmark essay on the topic, Mark Dery asks, \"Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its histor y, imagine possible futures?\" The wealth of literary and artistic production of works in the aesthetic provides a diverse and emphatic \"yes.\" This course seeks to position Afrofuturism as an alternative means of (re)interpretation, back -talk, and as an ave nue for imagining a future in light of (and in spite of) the experiences of the past and present.

England saw an explosion of spiritual seekers who wrote stories about contacting the dead, communicating t elepathically, levitating, reading Tarot cards, experiencing ghostly visions, and participating in occult or spiritual societies. While these writers were enormously popular in their own day, they are historically underrepresented in conventional narrative s about the canon of modern British literature. This course aims to recover some of these long -forgotten stories, as we sort through this Edwardian -era \"attic\" of dust -covered tales, seeking the gems that still puzzle, challenge, or 375 inspire. Our goal will be to understand this \"spiritual renaissance\" and its prime movers; explore the ambiguous borderland between the occult and the mystical and their relation to orthodox religion; and assess the legacy that this original \"alt lit\" has left for today's spirit ual seekers. Fiction will be drawn from writers like George MacDonald, Arthur Conan Doyle, Marie Corelli, Evelyn Underhill, and May Sinclair. Prerequisite: ENGL 210 or permission of the instructor.

Why are women, people of color, and other groups persi stently excluded from entrepreneurial resources? How might we make entrepreneurship more inclusive to drive disruptive innovation, help people reach their full potential, and propel positive economic growth? This course surveys the deeper (and often hidden ) causal factors that have contributed to and reinforced entrepreneurial exclusion. We examine disparities at the macro - and micro -level (i.e., gender, race, sexuality, geography, ability, age) through case studies, reading, hands -on activities, and studen t research projects. Students propose their own reasoned and researched solutions to address the business case for access and inclusion not as a charitable cause but as an economic imperative. The course concludes with students pitching their solutions on how to empower an underrepresented group, increase access to high -quality tools to find problems worth solving for this group and the resources to solve them, and create new channels for revenue from a previously underserved and ignored market.

Students will be asked to collect and interpret their own da ta, as well as to use simple models to explain environmental issues from a scientific perspective. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Ma thematics requirement.) cross listed: CHEM 108 ES 110: Intro to Environment and Society (Introduction to Environment and Society.) The environment is an ecological matrix in which all human societies are embedded. Solving current environmental problems t herefore requires understanding how natural processes and humans' social, political, and economic processes interact, mutually influencing one another. This course's study of environmental problems is inherently interdisciplinary, blending perspectives fro m the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Subject areas include ecology and biology as well as environmental economics, ethics, politics, history, and literature. Specific topics and content may vary with the professor(s). Intended for students with a general interest in environmental issues as well as those interested in pursuing the Environmental Studies major. No prerequisites. ES 116: Introduction to Geology This course will launch participants into the study of Earth's physical history, from t he creation of our planet to ways in which geologic processes occur all around us today. Students will learn to identify many different types of rocks, minerals, and fossils, explain the workings of plate tectonics, interpret ancient climates and environme nts by identifying a single rock, and understand how geologic processes have shaped the face of today's Earth and the life on it. Students will better understand the most important environmental and economic 388 issues facing the world today - the formation, d istribution, extraction, and effects of fossil fuels - and gain insight into water movement, access, and pollution.

Under th e old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 206, AMER 206 ES 209: Terrorism and the Environment Human injustice and the environment are deeply interlinked. Terror, war, disease, and slavery have environmental interconnect ions, and the current climate of terrorism has causes directly related to the availability and scarcity of natural resources. Both terrorists and counter -terrorist groups often deploy environmental weapons and strategies (such as dam breaching and oil fiel d ignition) and make use of communication and supply chains that rely on the intimate knowledge of local geographies. Environmentalists have also employed terror tactics, often labeled as eco -terrorism, such as tree spiking and mailing bombs, to promote an d protect environmental values. This interdisciplinary course weaves together geography, natural resource science, history, politics, and sociology to understand the connection between terrorism and the environment. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fu ndamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Writing requirements.) cross listed: IREL 296 ES 210: Environmental Ethics Examination of relationships between human beings and nature, drawing on literature, religion, and natural science as well as philosophy.

How can these be applied to the practical problems of environmental ethics? (Under the Fore ster Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: PHIL 210 ES 215: Environmental Psychology Environmental psychology is the discipline concerned with interactions and relationships between people and their environments (including built, natural, and social environments). In this course we apply psychological methods and theories to a variety of issues and behaviors, considering such topics as landscape preference, wayfinding, weather, noise, natural disasters, territoriality, crowding, and the design of residential and work environments. We also explore images of nature, wilderness, home, and place, as well as the impact of thes e images on behavior. The course is grounded in empirical work, and incorporates observations and experiences in the local environment. No prerequisite. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement. Under th e old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: PSYC 215 390 ES 218: American Geographies Lewis Carroll tells of a nation who made a map on the scale of one mile to the mile, but \"the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.\" Similarly, American \"Geographies\" are plural because all geographies are multiple: the same location can be mapped in doz ens of different ways, all of which can add to the richness of our understanding of place. \"Mapped\" denotes both physical maps and a range of mental and cultural constructs that describe place. These include urban geographies, agricultural geographies, nat ural geographies, and personal geographies as perceived by rulers, explorers, immigrants, recently freed slaves, mountain lions, and others. We compare American Geographies with other Geographies of the world (European and Chinese) to understand these Amer ican spatial experiences. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: AMER 200, AMER 480 ES 220: Evolution, Ecology, and Environment The diversity of life - the result of evolutionary and ecological processes - is a primary focus of environmental studies. In order to understand humans' effects on other species, ecosystems, and evolutionary and ecological processes and interactions, a deep knowledge of those entities and processes is critica l. This course takes an interdisciplinary, theoretical approach to the evolution and ecology of human - environmental dynamics, including species concepts and speciation, extinction, conservation of biodiversity, political ecology, evolutionary ecology, th e human dimensions of global change, demography, biogeography, human and non - human population ecology, and the status of evolutionary theory in the current political arena. Three lecture hours plus one four -hour laboratory per week. Prerequisites: ES 108 o r Chem 115 and Math 150 or BIOL 150 or ECON/BUSN/FIN 130 or MATH 351 or PSYC 221 or SOAN 310 (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences and Technology requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Sc ience & Mathematics requirement.) ES 221: History & Literature of Great Lakes (History and Literature of the Great Lakes.) The Great Lakes contain 21 percent of the world's surface fresh water. They provided a passage for exploration and still provide a passage for commerce. They are the reason Chicago exists. This course explores the history of the Great Lakes (geological, Native American, and modern) and the literature and art that arose from human interaction with these vast waters. In this interdiscip linary course we read geological and geographical descriptions, Native American literature, journals of early European explorers, poetry, short stories, and histories of social, economic, and environmental issues concerning the Great Lakes. No prerequisite s. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) cross listed: ENGL 252 ES 222: The Lake by the College (The Lake by the College: Geography, Ecology, History, and Current Environmental Issues of Lake Michigan). Lake Forest College calls itself the College by the Lake, yet most of us know very little about this vast inland sea. Geography is the study of physical places on the earth's surface and the relationships between people and those places. Th is course introduces students to the physical properties of the lake and its ecological and economic significance to Chicago, the City of Lake Forest, the Greater Chicagoland region, the United States, and the world. We explore current issues and policies about the lake's diverse and often conflicting uses as a dump site, a highway for transportation, a pristine recreational resource, and the source of our drinking water. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Na tural Sciences requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Natural Science & Mathematics requirement.) ES 224: Biodiversity Biodiversity has commonly been defined as the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems, and the interactions between them. This course explores the evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of biodiversity and the models we use to conceptualize and conserve its components. We study and attempt to explain the unequal distribution of biodiversity over space (trop ical rainforests have much greater biodiversity than 391 temperate forests) and time (many more species of beetles have evolved than species of mammals). We pay special attention to diversity in the vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, and flowering plants, and consider concepts such as the tree of life, ecological diversity indices, and definitions of genes, species, and ecosystems. The course concludes with the study of theoretical and practical approaches to conserving the biodiversity we have and restoring th e biodiversity we've lost. Prerequisite: ES 110, 203, 204, or 220, or any Biology course 120 or above. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Natural Sciences requirement.) ES 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues su ch as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a \"true\" scientific theory, the basis of observation, and empirical knowledge.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: PHIL 225 ES 229: Art and Environment (Art and Envir onment: Exploring Landscapes and Sustainability.) In this course we explore the unique relationship and history of the arts and the environment. In recent times an increasing number of creatives in fields such as sculpture, sound art, and architecture have shifted their focus towards environmental awareness. Production methods and materials that embrace sustainability, repurposing and reutilization are making their mark around the world. We learn about these efforts and use them as inspiration to create new work. Students explore ways that artists can use social practice to create awareness, study western and non -western concepts of the landscape, and discuss the everlasting desire to look at nature for inspiration. We use a variety of recycled/repurposed ma terials and electronic media to produce artwork focused on our relationship with the environment and how we can create immediate and long -term positive impact on our habitats. No prerequisites; ES110 or ES120 recommended for Environmental Studies majors. ( Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Creative & Performing Arts requirement.

In its second half, we will focus on the how environmental changes influenced human history. What was the world like when humans evolved and how did the Ice Ages determine where people migrated? Were the rise and fall of empires tied to the rise and f all of sea level? We will also examine humans as forces that shape and influence the environments they inhabit, for better or for worse. No prerequisite. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ES 263: A merican Cities This course is an introduction to the political, economic, and social forces that have shaped American cities from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the city of Chicago. We explore the growth of urban economies and new forms o f labor, migration and immigration into cities, persistent patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and displacement, and struggles over power and resources that make up urban politics. We also pay particular attention to urban geography and the relationship between cities, rural and suburban areas. Students are introduced to multiple disciplinary approaches to understanding American cities, and take field trips to relevant sites in Chicago.

ES 322: Freshwater Ecology (Freshwater Ecology of the Great Lakes Region.) This course offers a detai led exploration of the biological, physical, geographical, and economic properties of Lake Michigan and aquatic habitats connected to this system. We focus on the methods for assessing habitat condition, the factors that contribute to a habitat's health, the development of conservation plans, and the economic costs of pollution and mitigation. Prerequisite: ES 220 or BIOL 220. ES 323: African American Envirnmntl Culture (African American Environmental Culture from Slavery to Environmental Justice.) Until the environmental justice movement rose to prominence over the past few decades and invited a more critical perspective on the connection between race and the environment, popular understanding of the American environmental (and environmentalist) tradition had effectively been whitewashed. But why? This course will work to find answers to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of African American environmental culture in conversation with key moments in African American history --from slavery to sha recropping, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. With a special focus on Chicago's African American environmental culture and a field study to the city's South Side, an interdisciplinary approach will examine sources as diverse as slav e narratives, fiction, poetry, songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies, and we will consider African American intellectuals, writers, visual and musical artists, and everyday citizens not always associated with environmental thought, from W.E.B. Du Boi s and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and the victims of Flint, Michigan's, water crisis. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) cross listed: AFAM 323 ES 324: Medieval Disasters & Climate Change In the fifth century, a cooling climate and epidemics accelerated the collapse of the western Roman state; while in the fourteenth century, worsened by the onset of the \"Little Ice Age,\" the Black Death reduced populations in Eurasia by half and laid the groundwork for the changes of the early modern world. This course teaches the history of environmental transformations and human adaptation through an exploration of some of the natural disasters and climate changes that impacted Europe and the Mediterranean world c. 30 0-1500 CE. Using 394 specific case studies (including episodes like the so -called \"mystery cloud\" that troubled Levantine communities in 536 and the unusually well -documented 1348 earthquake in central Europe), the course evaluates how medieval people thought about nature, and how moments of crisis shaped individuals, communities, and larger ecosystems. Students learn to use Geographic Information System (GIS) software to analyze, track chronologically, and map spatially a specific disaster or environmental eve nt. No prerequisites.

Prerequisite: English 235 or a lower -level Environmental Studies course. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Hum anities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 332 ES 335: Environmental Justice Environmental justice movements contest environmental inequalities (disproportionate exposure to environmental ills like pollution and inadequate access to environmental goods lik e nature -based recreation) that manifest themselves along lines of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. This course employs a variety of disciplinary perspectives - including history, literature, sociology, political science, and philosophy - to examine the origins and evolution of these social movements worldwide, but especially emphasizes the environmental battles waged by African American, Latinx, and Native American communities in the United States. From climate change's rising seas that threaten develop ing nations to the toxic waste dumps that threaten the health of communities of color, case studies are used to explore how local struggles help shape a global consciousness about environmental injustices.

Political, agricultural, an d socio - economic barriers to conservations are also examined. Prerequisite: ES 220. ES 382: Politcal Ecology Infectious Disease (The Political Ecology of Infectious Diseases.) An infectious disease, COVID19, is in the process of disrupting the social, po litical, economic, ecological, and medical systems that we have relied on, and in some ways taken for granted, up to now. Infectious diseases, like all things \u2014 animals, plants, genes, rivers, petroleum, planets, and molecules \u2014 have the ability to exert i nfluence on their environments; that is, they have something like agency. In this course, we investigate what the nature of this quasi -agency is, and what the political, social, and economic consequences of accepting the agency of things might be. Our focu s is on infectious diseases: where they come from, how humans discovered them and how we combat them, and how they have affected and are affected by international economic and political systems, environmental degradation, medical technology, ideas of sover eignty, and the prosecution of war and terrorism.

Each student will choose a semester -long research project and be responsible for leading a class session based on their project as well as submitting a significant paper summarizing their research and conclusions. ES 483: Env Connections Chicago -New Orleans (Senior Seminar: The Environmental Connections between Chicago and New Orleans) This course explores the environmental issues associated with the g reater Chicago area and compares and connects them to the environmental issues associated with New Orleans and the lower Mississippi Delta. The connection between the two areas goes back to the mid -19th century decision to reroute the Chicago River and bui ld a canal system that effectively connected the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. This geographical change provided a trade route from Chicago to the Gulf, enabling Chicago to be a major distributing center for both major trade routes from the Midwest - the Mississippi and the Great Lakes. Other comparisons that the course addresses are: energy issues of coal and oil, migration routes from the Delta to Chicago, and urbanization. Prerequisite: senior standing and a major in ES or permission of instructor. There will be an optional Spring Break trip down the Mississippi to New Orleans, as well as shorter field trips around the Chicago area. ES 484: Restoring Native Wildlife (Senior Seminar: Restoring Native Wildlife: Motivations, Methods, and Mixed Outcome s) Humans have frequently tried to restore populations of native wildlife species to areas from which they have been extirpated. This course covers a variety of different restoration efforts, looking at reasons that the species disappeared, arguments for a nd against restoration, methods used, and the successes and failures of the projects. We review key factors that are likely to determine the outcome of projects. The course also discusses the dual relationship between wildlife and habitat restoration proje cts. Case studies may include urban peregrine falcon release programs, the Eastern Whooping Crane Partnership, wolf projects in Yellowstone National Park and nearby areas, two 2015 bison restoration programs in Illinois, as well as other projects. Students are expected to participate in several field trips, at least one of which includes multiple days. Prerequisites: Senior standing and a major or minor in Environmental Studies, or permisssion of instructor. ES 317: Environmental Sociology This course uti lizes the sociological perspective to explore the complex ways that human society and nature are intertwined, having significant impacts on each other. How societies are organized, how they produce and consume, and what values and norms constitute their cu lture all have varied impacts on what is often referred to as the 'natural' world. As environmental problems - such as climate change, deforestation, species loss, pollution, etc. - are constructed and emerge, the impact on societies varies greatly across social groups based on race, class, gender, and national context. This course explores how, in the face of environmental degradation, society has responded in different ways: with social movements, changes in lifestyles, and private certification programs advocating conservation and preservation; and political and economic institutions, definitions of 399 status, and entrenched social organization resisting change. Prerequisite: SOAN 110.

The Great Lakes contain 21 percent of the world's surface fresh water. They provided a passage for exploration and still provide a passage for commerce. They are the reason Chicago exists. This course explores the history of the Gr eat Lakes (geological, Native American, and modern) and the literature and art that arose from human interaction with these vast waters. In this interdisciplinary course we read geological and geographical descriptions, Native American literature, journals of early European explorers, poetry, short stories, and histories of social, economic, and environmental issues concerning the Great Lakes. No prerequisites.

Lake Forest College calls itself the College by the Lake, yet most of us know very little about this vast inland sea. Geography is the study of physical places on the earth's surface and the relationships between people and those places. This course introduces students to the physical properties of the lake and its ecological and economi c significance to Chicago, the City of Lake Forest, the Greater Chicagoland region, the United States, and the world. We explore current issues and policies about the lake's diverse and often conflicting uses as a dump site, a highway for transportation, a pristine recreational resource, and the source of our drinking water.

ES 224: Biodiversity Biodiversity has commonly been defined as the diversity of genes, species, and ecosystems, and the interactions between them. This course explores the evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of biodiversity and the models we use to conceptualize and conserve its components. We study and attempt to explain the unequal distribution of biodiversity over space (tropical rainforests have much greater biodiversity than temperate forests) and time (many more species of beetles have evolved than species of mammals). We pay special attention to diversity in the vertebrates, arthropods, molluscs, and flowering plants, and consider concepts such as the tree of life, ecological diversity indices, and definitions of genes, species, and ecosystems. The course concludes with the study of theoretical and practical approaches to conserving the biodiversity we have and restoring the biodiversity we've lost.

Until the environ mental justice movement rose to prominence over the past few decades and invited a more critical perspective on the connection between race and the environment, popular understanding of the American environmental (and environmentalist) tradition had effect ively been whitewashed. But why? This course will work to find answers to that question while unearthing the deeper roots of African American environmental culture in conversation with key moments in African American history --from slavery to sharecropping, from migration and urbanization to environmental justice. With a special focus on Chicago's African American environmental culture and a field study to the city's South Side, an interdisciplinary approach will examine sources as diverse as slave narrative s, fiction, poetry, songs, photographs, maps, and ethnographies, and we will consider African American intellectuals, writers, visual and musical artists, and everyday citizens not always associated with environmental thought, from W.E.B. Du Bois and Zora Neale Hurston to the Black Panthers and the victims of Flint, Michigan's, water crisis.

This course requires a high level of participation from all students. Not open to students who hav e completed either ETHC 250 or ETHC 252. Note: This course is offered during the summer term only. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requirements. Under the old GEC, this c ourse meets the Cultural Diversity requirement.) ETHC 261: Art of Social Change Artists have a long history as agents of social change, using \"traditional\" art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture, and a bit more recently photography, performance, and video to critique various aspects of society and to propose alternatives for the future. The consideration of social engagement as an artistic medium in and of itself has become an important current in contemporary art since at least the 1990s. This course begins with a consideration of some of the ways artists in the past approached social and political concerns. We then focus on the more recent proliferation of artists with social practices both within and outside of the gallery/museum r ealm of contemporary art. Students address various important historical, theoretical and practical texts; conduct discussions and presentations; and collaborate to design and enact original works of socially engaged art. No prerequisites. (Under the Forest er Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives requirement.

We study a variety of theoretical frameworks, including classical liberal theory, postcolonia l critiques, and local philosophies of indigenous communities. Moreover, we consider the effects of each framework on various claims to identity, whether of an individual person, a group, community, institution, place, or state. We then attempt to apply th ese frameworks to a number of real -world cases to better understand how rights are deployed and denied in practice. No prerequisites.

ETHC 330: Comparative and International Educ ETHC 330: Comparative and International Education: Education as the Practice of FreedomThis course examines both the study and practice of comparative and international education. The course is organized with a multidisciplinary perspective with anal ysis of history, theory, methods, and issues in comparative and international education. A major goal of the course is to interrogate the linkages between education and society. Recurrent themes will be examined to demonstrate how every educational system not only arises from but also shapes its particular socio -cultural context. Students will have the opportunity to deepen and expand their knowledge of educational issues within a global context.

Why are women, people of color, and other groups persistently excluded from entrepreneurial resources? How might we make entrepreneurship more inclusive to drive disruptive innovation, help people reach their full potential, and propel positive economic growth? This course surveys the deeper (and often hidden) causal factors that have contributed to and reinforced entrepreneurial exclusion. We examine disparities at the macro - and micro -level (i.e., gende r, race, sexuality, geography, ability, age) through case studies, reading, hands -on activities, and student research projects. Students propose their own reasoned and researched solutions to address the business case for access and inclusion not as a char itable cause but as an economic imperative. The course concludes with students pitching their solutions on how to empower an underrepresented group, increase access to high -quality tools to find problems worth solving for this group and the resources to so lve them, and create new channels for revenue from a previously underserved and ignored market.

The course uses documentary history, scholarly sources, and personal narratives to explore tensions between the ideals of freedom and equality and the reality of segregation and marginalization in U.S. education. Course content focuses on U.S. public education as a microcosm of equity and social justice issues nationally and internationally. Not open to first -year students.

First -Year students will be able to demonstrate competence in critical thinking, including analysis, synthesis, and judgment. 3. First -Year students will be able to demonstrate information -gathering and research skills, including the use of a variety of research tools and the resources of the library. 4. First -Year students will be able to demonstrate information literacy, to effectively and responsibly use informati on according to the Academic Honesty policy of Lake Forest College. 409 First -Year Studies Courses FIYS 102: Knowing Yourself and Others (Knowing Yourself and Others: Socialization in College.) This course investigates the construct of Social Emotional Learni ng, and how that maps on to skills needed to be successful in college. Students will take on a \"third person: perspective as researchers to observe social and emotional occurrences on campus while engaging in self -reflection to become more socially and emo tionally competent, themselves. Assignments will include summaries of research articles, observation logs, research protocol development, self -narrative construction, and a culminating assignment having the students investigating a specific element within SEL (self - awareness, social -awareness, self -management, responsible decision making, or relationship management), how it presents itself on campus, how it is presented in today's society and in popular culture, and strategies for teaching improvement in th is area. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 104: Africana Philosophy This course serves as an introduction to the philosophies of the African diaspora, which are collectively referred to as Africana philosophy. Africana philosophy comprises three distinct philosophical traditions: African philosophy, African -American philosophy, and Afro -Caribbean philosophy. We will study the major figures, schools, concepts, and debates that animate the se traditions. Although Africana philosophy is a broad category covering a multiplicity of different philosophical perspectives, all three philosophical traditions are concerned with the lived existence of Africans and African -descended peoples. We will an alyze concepts such as 'reason,' 'double consciousness,' and 'creolization,' and we will examine disputes between philosophers, including the quarrel between Anthony Appiah and Lucius Outlaw over the significance of race. Some of the key questions we will answer include: What role did colonialism play in shaping the agenda of African philosophy? What is black feminist existential philosophy? How can the Haitian Revolution be understood from the standpoint of political philosophy? (Under the Forester Fundame ntal Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 105: Music in Chicago Chicago offers its residents a musical soundscape as rich and as varied as any city in America. The city has a long history of classical music performances through organizations such as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Ravinia Festival. Jazz and the Blues evolved in Chicago and can be heard in clubs across the city. Chicago also offers a diverse collection of ethnic and worl d music festivals nearly every weekend of the year. In this course, we will explore Chicago's unique soundscape through three main areas: classical music, jazz and the blues, and world music. Our investigation will involve frequent field trips, some as a class and some in smaller groups. We will study the history of music in the city and will also cultivate active listening skills. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (su ch as off -campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. No prior musical skills are required. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 11 1: Race and Space in Chicago Schools The history of American education has been marked by inequalities along racial, ethnic, economic, linguistic, religious, and cultural lines. Since the late twentieth century, the development of suburban and urban bounda ries has come to redefine equity and social justice in schools. This course introduces students to social and institutional forces that make 'race' and 'space' tools for educational inequity. Focusing on Chicago -area schools, we will consider how the laws and collective actions of society have produced a 'poor urban' and 'affluent suburban' divide that continues to shape the educational experiences of students from various backgrounds. By learning how to read carefully and to write clearly about the issues of 'race' and 'space' in Chicago -area schools, students will develop basic strategies of research, writing and presentation. Travelling as a group accompanied by the instructor, students will visit pertinent Chicago -area schools to explore these issues in real-life educational contexts. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 410 FIYS 112: Wild Chicago (Wild Chicago: Exploring the Urban Jungle.) This course will offer students a clear understanding of the wildlife around us and how humans interact with their environment. The goal for the class is to help students think and write clearly and critically, form educated opinions and defend those opinions about a wide range of environmental issues in urban e nvironments. Based on our own observations we will also learn how to ask educated questions about the relationships between humans and the environment. By visiting with a carefully selected group of environmental professionals and regularly observing and r ecording information on the environment in which we live, we will explore how wildlife interacts with humans on an everyday basis. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 113: Music and Math In this course, students will investigate the connections between the fields of music and mathematics. Commonalities to be explored will include the musical concepts of rhythm, meter, scales, tuning, and temperament, and the mathematical concepts of geomet ric series, rational and irrational numbers, modular arithmetic, and symmetries of the square. No previous knowledge of music theory is required, only a desire to use critical and analytical skills to understand and appreciate music. (Under the Forester Fu ndamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 114: Media Art & Technology (From Now On: Media Art & Technology.) Digital media, technology and the arts have become potent forces creating changes in aesthetics, communica tion, social engagement, political movements, and economic conditions. From social media to Virtual Reality, the lines between reality and artifice blur. As these forces combine, reconfigure and create innovations, how will these changes impact our everyda y experience? What we should expect in the world of work? Mass access to design software allows everyone to be a maker capable of creating shifts in cultural and social trends. How can one thrive in a such a dynamic world? Artists have played an important role as a counterpoint to mass -media by creating work that articulates important questions and examines such changes. Through discussions, readings, exercises and projects the course examines the impact of new fields in art and technology. This course will help students to identify, learn about, and potentially create tools to navigate a technologically dense future. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 115: Climate Change Across Discipline s This course will explore the most pressing issue of our time: climate change. We will examine the physical science of global warming, but more so we will focus on the social, political, ethical, psychological and artistic aspects of global warming. We wi ll critically examine the predicted and current consequences of climate change and how it impacts groups of people differently. In addition, we will engage the following questions: What global and local political efforts have been made to address and deny the problem? What are the economic implications of climate change? What do ethics and the law say about global warming? How has modern literature and film imagined the future in a warming world? Is technology enough to get us out of this mess or will it re quire more systemic social change? As individuals and societies how do we cognitively perceive such a large problem? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 116: Meteors, Dinosaurs and Scienc e (Dinosaurs, Meteors and Scientific Argumentation.) What caused the extinction of dinosaurs? What theories have been derived from what evidence about this extinction? This course will examine how scientists go about convincing others by focusing on this t opic. In 1980, scientists from disparate disciplines advanced the theory that the impact of a meteor 66 million years ago set in motion the events that resulted in the extinction of some three -quarters of Earth's species, including dinosaurs. It was only i n the 1990's that the larger scientific community came to the consensus around that notion. And there is an ongoing research question of why did the meteor strike then in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula? In this seminar we will explore how scientists use observation al evidence and calculations to advance persuasive arguments. This includes looking at the incomplete nature of contemporaneous scientific evidence as well as considering the questions of skeptical paleontologists, 411 geologists and astronomers. (Under the Fo rester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 117: Becoming Adult in Times of Change (Becoming Adult in Times of Change: Liminal States.) You probably don't have a word for it, but the world right now is in a l iminal state. In anthropology, a liminal state is a time of being betwixt and between, when things are not the same as they were before, but they haven't yet found a new normal. Starting college is also a liminal state, because you're not really a high sch ool student anymore but not quite a college student. This course focuses on figuring out your liminal state in three ways: 1) exploring the idea of liminality, including the idea that all of college is a liminal space before adulthood; 2) challenging you ( literally) to try something new on a regular basis, while maintaining a \"beginner's mind\"; and 3) exposing you to tools you will need in your college and adult life, ranging from negotiating politics at dinner parties to exploring career options. If you've read this far and didn't get put off by the scary title or your assumptions about what this course would be, you have what it takes.

Chicagois now home to Second City and dozens of other improv clubs that both feature and tr ain aspiring comedians and actors. It also hosts Chicago SketchFest, the world's largest sketch comedy festival. In this course we will examine the early development of improv in Chicago and analyze the role of Chicago improv in humor production today. We will take class trips to comedy clubs, to attend shows and discuss this genre with practitioners and instructors. Students will learn to distinguish among different types of humor production and reception, and will consider the value of improv beyond the r ealm of entertainment (e.g., how improvisational theater games may help individuals prepare for the unexpected on the stage and in life). (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 119: Chicago Media Industries Over the last 170 years, Chicago has been home to a diverse and vibrant set of media industries. From the founding of the Chicago Tribune in 1847, to the production of iconic films like Ferris Buehler's Day Off in the 1980s, to the current boom in television production started by Dick Wolf's Chicago Fire franchise in 2012, there is no doubt that Chicago has made an indelible mark on the U.S. media landscape. In this class, we will examine the history, policies, and practices of Chicago medi a industries, including print, film, radio, and television. We will also look at the way Chicago media industries have been impacted by larger political and economic trends, such as new media's effect on the newspaper industry, and growing international co mpetition for Hollywood investment, known as \"runaway production.\" This course will include a field trip to a Chicago media company as well as famous movie locations around the city. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Y ear Studies requirement. ) FIYS 120: Religious Violence and Coexistence How do people of different religious faiths interact? How do they create professional and personal relationships \u2014 and what limits are placed on those relationships, either by law or by the individuals themselves? Conversely, what causes hostility and even violence between faiths? How do people go about \"othering\" those whose beliefs and practices are different than their own? This course investigates these eternal questions through an in -depth study of relations between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam in the ancient and medieval Mediterranean world. We begin with the earliest interactions between these religious traditions, as Christianity and Judaism diverged from common roots into sepa rate faiths in the first two centuries of the Common Era, and as Islam emerged in the seventh century. In our second unit, we study medieval Spain, where Christians, Jews, and Muslims coexisted relatively peacefully for centuries, but where that toleration crumbled in the later Middle Ages, culminating in the expulsion of Jews (1492) and Muslims (1502) from the kingdom, and in the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies r equirement. ) 412 FIYS 121: Street Art: Who Makes and Owns It? (Street Art: The Politics of Authorship and Ownership.)This course will explore the history of visual expression in public spaces in its different renderings, from graffiti vandalism to outdoor art galleries. We will focus on the aesthetic side of street art, as well as on its social and political implications in their different cultural contexts. We will discuss how street art has challenged traditional notions of art, has redefined what being an a rtist means, and has changed the way spectators see, enjoy, and consume art. Special attention will be given to questions of authorship and ownership by discussing issues of cultural property and art reproductions. Films, guest lectures, and creative proje cts will supplement class meetings and readings. This course will include an excursion to the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago, famous for its Latino street art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement . ) FIYS 122: Future of Energy: the True Story (Science of the Future of Energy: the True Story) In 1956, geologist M. King Hubbert predicted that the US oil production would begin to decline when half of the known reserves had been used. Inthe mid -1970s, there was an 'oil crisis,' when prices increased overnight and long lines formed at gasoline stations throughout the US. Indeed, Hubbert's prediction had come true, and the US became a large importer of oil. Now, in 2011, we are nearing the point at which one half of the known global reserves have been used. This course, as one of three linked First Year Studies courses exploring the broad topic of truth, will focus on the science of energy, its use, and the possible energy futures that lie ahead of us when global oil production begins to decline. As the world grapples with an inevitable shift to renewable energy sources, we'll explore the truth behind the many forces that resist the changes. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 123: Global Epidemics: From Aids to Zika What makes an infectious disease become an epidemic, such as the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, or that of Zika in Brazil in 2015? Moreover, how did COVID, which appear ed in 2019, so quickly become a pandemic? Why does it take so long for pharmaceutical companies to construct a vaccine that protects against disease -causing organisms? In this course, we explore the medical, biological, and molecular complexities of a variety of infectious diseases that plague the world, such as malaria, Dengue fever, and COVID. We study the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause the diseases, how they are transmitted, and the chemical and biological challenges of making and distributi ng vaccines in less developed countries. In addition to class discussions, writing assignments, and oral presentations, students investigate microbial morphology through a high -powered laboratory microscope \u2014and even make bacterial art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 126: Mapping Chicago: How Space Matters This course explores how space matters to human well -being. We will consider theories about how space affects education, health and income in an urban environment, with specific application to the city of Chicago. Using ArcGIS, a software system for managing geographic knowledge, students will learn to map and analyze relationships among socioeconomic, demographic, political and locat ion variables. In individual projects, students will develop spatial analyses of such topics as education accessibility, income inequality, racial segregation, and crime. This course will focus on how spatial analysis can be used to enhance public policy. Students will also gain skill in data management and analysis. Knowledge of Excel is preferred, and additional training will be given in classes. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 128: Robots & Brains:Fantasies & Facts Will computers ever become conscious? Will robots ever have the degree of sentience described in science fiction or shown in films? How does the human mind emerge from the workings of the human brain? How is our brain diff erent from, and simultaneously similar to, the brains of other animals? How are the 'wet brains' of animals different from, and similar to, the 'dry brains' of computers? Readings will include introductory materials on the brain, on mind and consciousness, on science fiction stories about robots, on scholarly and popular articles from current work in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The course will include films, computer 413 simulations, guest lectures, and field trips, all related to brain, mind, rob ots, and artificial intelligence. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 130: The Science of Cooking Since 1992, the term molecular gastronomy has become part of understanding the world's cuisine. This course examines the chemistry and physics of cooking, and the physiology of taste and flavor. We explore such questions as what is the science behind making a foam or gel; how do you prevent food bacteria from forming; and what does it mean t o temper chocolate? The science of cooking includes the important works of Herv\u00e9 This, Heston Blumenthal, Ferran Adria, Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and Grant Achatz, among others. We read their work and not only become familiar with the latest materials and methods of th e world's most innovative cuisine, but also learn how these methods may be part of the solution to ending world hunger. We work with a chef to perform experiments to elucidate the theory we will be studying. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 131: Civil Disobedience/Pol Obligation (Civil Disobedience and Political Obligation.) Every society imposes rules upon its members; without such rules societies could not exist. In liberal societies individuals agree to constrain their behavior through a social contract. That is, individuals consent to their own rule by the majority. Social contracts are considered the most just methods of social organization, because members consent and because right s are traditionally preserved. Rule is maintained through a codified law, made known to all, with proscribed punishments for failure to obey. But sometimes the obligation to obey society conflicts with other obligations: to family, to God, to justice. Thes e conflicts cause crises in both the individual and in society. Our course will explore these crises historically and theoretically. Antigone, the heroine of Sophocles' ancient Greek play, made the choice of obeying the religious commandments but in doing so violated the laws of the city. Socrates, on being condemned to death by Athens, was offered the opportunity to escape the city and save his life, but refused for it would mean breaking the laws of the city. When individuals commit civil disobedience, wh en they purposely and publicly break a law they feel to be immoral or unjust, how should society react? Is there a minimum of obligation that can be demanded? Can civil disobedience be justified? If so, can violence against the state also be justified? Our course explores these questions through traditional literature, such as the writings of Plato, Shakespeare, Locke, Thoreau, King, and Malcolm X. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 138: Art in Chicago While Chicago's extensive contributions to modern architecture are known throughout the world, it's been a critical center of visual art in all media since its earliest years. This course explores the rich and dynamic history of art-making i n Chicago from before the Great Fire of 1871 to the present, as well as the city's role as a center for experimentation and learning in the visual arts. Throughout its history, Chicago has been home to an art community that has always charted its own path, free from the constraints of more commercial centers like New York, and in so doing has had great impact on visual art and our broader visual culture. The city itself is a critical resource for this class, as course content - in the form of readings, disc ussion, and various activities - is augmented by visits to diverse art institutions and meetings with influential art -makers. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 140: Global Science Ficti on Science fiction is more popular than ever: it is almost impossible nowadays to avoid superhero movie \"universes,\" while dystopian novels such as The Handmaid's Tale - and their TV adaptations - are everywhere. This market seems to be dominated by Anglo -American science fiction, but Anglophones do not have a monopoly on this genre. How does science fiction from other regions and languages embrace and address its (multi -) cultural diversity, and how does it differ from Anglo -American science fiction? Is th e experience of reading science fiction different because that work originated in another language and culture? This course explores these questions through texts and films from all over the world. Even if originally published in other languages, all texts will be available in English. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 414 FIYS 142: Dostoevsky on Good and Evil Is a student who murders a wealthy old pawnbroker justified in his murder, if he uses h er money for the common good? Can a novelist realistically represent a purely good person, or would readers regard such a person as nothing more than an \"idiot\"? If the Devil visited one's bedroom, what would he look like and what conversation might he mak e? These are just a few of the fascinating questions prompted by Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels. This course will explore the evolution of Dostoevsky's literary and intellectual work leading up to his final novel of ideas, The Brothers Karamazov. We will focus on the genesis and development of that novel through Dostoevsky's contact with other novelists, such as Turgenev and Dickens. We will explore the novel against Dostoevsky's dramatic biographical and historical context. And we will examine the provocative philosophical, theological, political and aesthetic debates his novel broaches --debates that are as relevant today as they were in Dostoevsky's day. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 14 4: Sacred Spaces in Chicago What do high -steeple churches, personal shrines, pagan festivals, Japanese gardens, and Hindu temples have in common? All are examples of the creation, use, and maintenance of sacred spaces. Individuals and groups representing n early every religious tradition employ specially designated buildings, grounds, and surrounding natural features. In this course we study several examples of sacred spaces, consider how they are formed, and why they are used as they are. We ask questions a bout architecture and design, and also focus on the employment of the spaces. We look to the spiritual practices that take place inside them: everything from worship, ritual, and meditation to eating and drinking. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum , this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 146: BFFs: Besties and Female Friendship (BFFs: \"Besties\" and Female Friendship.) \"Besties\" are found everywhere in contemporary fiction, television, and film. Usually placed behind romantic re lationships, female friendship is now understood to be a powerful and even transformative dynamic, one that is central to female identity. Men and lovers take a back seat: A \"Coldplay song plays in my heart\" whenever Hannah Horvath sees her two closest fri ends in \"Girls.\" Are BFFs taking over the usual unions of romantic or erotic love? How much are girlfriends the focus of these stories? In this course, we examine these contemporary representations of female friendship, from television programs such as \"Gi rls\" to the erotic and dangerous \"besties\" of Emma Cline's The Girls. Throughout, we discover the many sides of this complex, and contradictory, relationship. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 147: Government and Markets Why is the government involved in some aspects of our lives more than others? This question can be answered in many different ways, depending on one's theoretical background. Different economists would provide different analyses of the government's role, especially as it relates to business and markets. They would also base their arguments on fundamental economic theories. The primary goal of this course is to develop an understanding of economic markets and issues where governments have become important participants. Both in the United States and abroad, governments take an active role in the economics of education, the environment, health care, big business, poverty, and unemployment, among other issues. Although the cou rse will be approached from an economic perspective, the topics relate to other fields of study as well, and particularly to the fields of politics and sociology. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirem ent. ) FIYS 148: Fashion, Culture, and Communication Fashion is more than simply how we dress. Among other things, it is a means of personal expression, a reflection of an historical moment, and an international industry. In this course we explore what fas hion means at various points in history by considering how the political and social climate of the time period produces expectations for what should/should not be worn, by whom, and for what purpose. The course therefore situates fashion in terms of both i ts production and consumption, exploring its role in relation to identity and body politics (race, gender, 415 sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, and celebrity and popular culture. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 150: Entrepreneurship in Action Entrepreneurship involves more than merely starting a new business that addresses a problem worth solving or innovating within an existing organization; it is a life skill that contributes to success in any field. This course explores the history of entrepreneurship through case studies, articles, and other activities. Students investigate the evolution of entrepreneurial best practices and pitfalls throughout the years. We dissect recent successes and failures in the world of entrepreneurship, and examine the role of technology in the future of the field. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 153: History Reversed; You to the World Usually, history courses start deep in the past, and move towards the present. In this class, we flip the script, and start with you, right here, right now, at Lake Forest College. By tracing our individual ancestries, we will situate our local lives at the College and in the city of Chicago within a global historical context. Using large -scale datasets and wide -ranging historical sources, we will explore Chicago as a global city of immigrants and the Midwest as an ancient civilization of indigenous peoples. Rewinding from the present, the course will chart a global path back thousands of years to the origins of the human species in Africa. By investigating and debating how change happens over time, we will understand our o wn place in history. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 154: The Irish in Chicago This course places Irish history in context and examine the large -scale emigration from Ireland to the U nited States in the mid -19th century. It traces the destinations of the Irish as they settled in America and focuses primarily on those who came to Chicago. It researches where and how the Irish community lived in the city and surrounding areas. It examine s how the Irish immigrants contended with the darker side of this new life through impoverished times and the rise of mob activity, and yet, how the cultural aspects of Irish life (among them sports, music, dance, art, crafts, literature, and theater) not only survived the transatlantic crossing, but thrived in their new home, and continue to be part of life for the Irish community in 21st -century Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 155: Chicago: Land of Hope In the half -century following World War I, millions of African Americans left the American South in the Great Migration. Settling in northern cities like Chicago, which many called the \"Land of Hope,\" black migrants dramatical ly reshaped American life and culture. This course explores the connections between that history of northward movement and African American cultural production and experiences. We do this through a special focus on Chicago, where the black population grew from just over 44,000 to more than 1.1 million. We read closely and contextualize a variety of texts, including novels, plays, photographs, maps, sociological surveys, oral histories, and correspondence. We examine the historical significance of these text s from a variety of disciplinary perspectives - including history, literary and film criticism, sociology, critical race studies, and cultural studies (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 158: Women to Beyonc\u00e9.) not born, but rather becomes, a woman.\" \u2014Simone deBeauvoir Gender is learned \u2014a collection of behaviors that we all learn to replicate through a kind of performance t hat happens on and offstage. In this course, we will think about how this understanding of gender plays out in performance spaces. We'll take a broad look at the ways women have been portrayed onstage in different kinds of theatrical performance, from play s to music. We'll look at how women have expressed themselves and addressed political issues through theatre and performance \u2014and how their voices have, at times, been excluded. We'll look at the changing answers to the question \u2014what is a woman? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 416 FIYS 163: Independent Media in Chicago This course focuses on the role played by independent media in the contemporary cultural landscape. Students become familiar wit h the workings of different independent media, as represented by the workings of film - makers, music venues, newspapers, zines, comic books, video games, and record labels that survive without direct connections to the large corporations that dominate the m ass mediated culture in the U.S. At all times, readings concerning the role of the media in society contextualize the importance of the independent media. This class features several trips to the sites where these media outlets operate, with likely visits to: Quimby's Queer Store, The Hideout, Kartemquin Films, and The Chicago Reader. Paper assignments find students applying these experiences to the broader meanings of independent media. Students get a first -hand look at what the production of culture looks like in the context of independent media in Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 164: Archaeology of Chicago This course provides an introduction to the discipline of archaeology by exploring the city of Chicago, using to discuss and to engage with the social complexity found in urban America. Archaeology, a disciplinary subfield of anthropology, considers the material traces of human behaviors. Urban archaeological research looks at the complex interrelation of materiality and the documentary record, revealing everyday experiences and social relations at several levels. Through the lens of archaeology, we will cover Chicago as important stop along a prehistoric trail system, its p lace as a multicultural fur trade entrep\u00f4t, the attention from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, and its current preeminence as a global city. Readings cover foundational concepts in archaeology, an introduction to historical archaeology, historical b ackground on Chicago, and comparative urban case studies. Visits to current and future sites of archaeological excavations will be complemented with work on the preliminary archaeological assessment of a Chicago site. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curric ulum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 165: Theater in Chicago The Chicago theater scene is internationally acknowledged to be the greatest in the U.S. In this course, you will have the opportunity to read, discuss, write about, and perform scenes from classic and modern plays, which you will see produced at a wide variety of Chicago theaters, ranging from small storefront companies to such institutions as the world -famous Goodman, Steppenwolf, and Chicago Shakespeare theaters. Y ou will not only see the shows but you will also meet with some of the artists involved in the productions, both in the classroom and after the performances themselves, to talk about their work. This course requires participation in some evening and/or wee kend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off -campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. Note: The plays we read and attend will be dependent upon range of genres, tick et availability, scheduling, and ticket cost. A lab fee of $150 will be charged to your tuition account for this course to defray ticket and transportation costs. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirem ent. ) FIYS 166: The Uses and Misuses of Psychology Science can be a powerful tool to transform society, but the applications of scientific knowledge can result in either beneficial or detrimental outcomes, regardless of scientists' intentions. This course examines the societal ramifications, both real and imagined, of landmark discoveries from the field of psychology. For example, the work of B.F. Skinner greatly increased our understanding of how both animal and human behavior can be shaped through intera ctions with the environment, but these same principles of operant conditioning have been used by the U.S. military to produce soldiers who are more effective at killing in combat. We consider social, cultural, political, financial, and historical contexts as influential moderators of both science itself as well as the ends for which it is used. Readings include a mix of scholarly literature, popular sources, and works of fiction. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year S tudies requirement. ) FIYS 167: Baseball in Chicago What does the study of baseball tell us about life in Chicago? In this course, we will examine this question from a variety of perspectives. We will explore both the history of baseball in Chicago as well its contemporary influences on civic and cultural life. Drawing on their field trips to both Wrigley Field (Cubs) and U.S. Cellular 417 Field (White Sox), students will consider how the two different stadiums and fan bases help to illuminate some of Chicago's geographic, racial, and class -based divides. We will also examine the current political and economic controversies surrounding the renovation of Wrigley Field. In this interdisciplinary course, students will see how a variety of academic disciplines, incl uding history, sociology, anthropology, economics, politics, and religion, illuminates our understanding of America's national pastime. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 168: Global Cul tures: Chicago and Beyond Is the world getting smaller? Will increased cultural mixing and homogenization eventually make cultural differences a thing of the past? Or will resistance to cultural change provoke greater conflict and stronger cultural identif ication? In this course we will examine the accelerating trend of cultural globalization through the lens of cultural encounters and their impact on changing perceptions of identity, particularly in Chicago. Other global cities, such as New York, Shanghai, Beirut, and Paris, will provide further examples of shifting cultural associations and new ways of constructing social identity. Excursions to Chicago will enhance our discussions of the critical essays, literature and films we'll study, all pertaining to Chicago's historical and current cultural influences of various Latino, African American, Chinese and French -speaking groups. Guest speakers with different perspectives on globalization will help us to construct a wider vision of this trend and envision p otential future scenarios such as increased cultural hegemony, balkanization, hybridity, integration, and assimilation. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 169: Recreational Mathematics Puzzles, paradoxes, and brain teasers have inspired many young people to pursue careers in science, and more than one achievement in mathematics has emerged from the desire to solve difficult puzzles. In this course we will examine many famous (and not -so-famous) puzzles, and explore famous games such as Sudoku, tic -tac-toe, and monopoly, to gain insight into all manner of phenomena. To guide us in our mathematical diversions, we will read essays by Martin Gardner, Ian Stewart, Peter Winkler, Terence Tao, a nd other popular mathematics writers. In addition, we will view documentaries and conduct group discussions to explore multiple aspects of mathematics. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 170: Representation,Political & Personal The first year of college is an opportunity to consider what sociologist Erving Goffman called the \"presentation of self,\" or the ways that individuals try to make a favorable impression upon others. This course em ploys an interdisciplinary approach, with a bit of sociology, a bit of psychology, and a lot of political science, to investigate the ways in which people seek, as Dale Carnegie put it, to \"win friends and influence people.\" Many case studies are drawn fro m the interactions between politicians and the voters whose support they hope to win; after all, few individuals spend more time thinking rigorously about their presentation of self than elected officials and their staffers. We use examples from national p olitics, but also take field trips to meet with and observe elected officials around the North Shore and in Chicago. We investigate the art of political representation and how elected officials seek to win constituents' trust, as well as the possibilities of personal \"re -presentation\" that first - year students engage in when they arrive in this new college environment. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 171: My Brain Made Me Do It (My Brai n Made Me Do It: Neuroscientific Challenges to Free Will.) We assume that people have free will. If someone decided to take this course, for instance, we would assume that they chose to take it freely. And if someone did something immoral like steal, we wo uld think that they acted freely and that they should be held morally responsible for their actions as a result. While we may take free will for granted, many neuroscientists and philosophers claim that recent neuroscientific evidence offers new challenges to it. If, for example, our brains show patterns of activity that suggest we will make a particular decision before we are conscious of making it, did we decide freely or was our decision pre -determined? We explore these new challenges to free will and mo ral responsibility and the important moral puzzles that follow from them. For instance, should someone who commits assault - potentially due to the effects of an undiagnosed brain tumor - be imprisoned for 418 that crime? In the course, students develop their analytic writing skills by clearly representing the arguments of the authors who present these new challenges and then by developing their own responses to them. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requireme nt. ) FIYS 173: Am I a \"Normal\" Kid? (Am I a \"Normal\" Kid? Analyzing Messages of Power and Cultural Hegemony in Youth Texts.) Every type of text that young people encounter, from books and cartoons to songs, movies, and magazines, contains underlying messages about what is deemed \"normal,\" valued, and expected in our society. Such texts reflect the worldviews of dominant cultural groups (i.e., white, middle class, heteronormative), which serve to legitimize these views and minimize and oppress the norm s and values of non -dominant groups. This course addresses issues of culture, power, oppression, and social justice; critical literacy theories. such as critical race theory and queer theory; and content/text analysis research methods. Students analyze a v ariety of texts aimed at youth such as advertisements, songs, and fiction books to study how the texts indirectly send messages about what is \"normal\" in our society and how they perpetuate the systemic marginalization of non -dominant cultural groups. Stud ents also read scholarly works about cultural hegemony and critical literacy to inform their analysis of the youth texts. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 174: Chicago's Museums Chicag o's renowned museums and exhibition spaces make it a destination for culture lovers the world over. From the Field and DuSable Museums to Hull House and the Art Institute, Chicago is home to a vast array of cultural, historical, and scientific repositories whose holdings include some of the greatest artifacts of human endeavor, contributing immensely to the city's identity. This course introduces students to some of these museums, with an emphasis on art institutions, while also examining their historic and current roles in the life of the city. Topics include the management, collections, curation, audience, programming, and architecture of these institutions. One museum will be selected for in -depth investigation. Working individually and in small groups, s tudents will research its various functions and present their findings to the class. Because of conflicts with field trips, fall and winter athletes should not register for this course. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Firs t Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 175: Frankenstein: Myth of the Monstrous It's alive! This course will take Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, as its jumping -off point for a semester's exploration of th is uncannily persistent tale of horror, now a byword for the dark side of science and modernity. Shelley's novel gives us so much - the archetypes of mad scientist and monster, inquiries into the origins of evil and nature versus nurture, questions about g ender, sexuality, class, and race - that we could easily spend the whole semester studying the novel and the gothic culture that it emerged from. But we will also look at film adaptations, read plays, stories, and poems on the theme of the monstrous, and c onsider contemporary \"Frankensteins,\" from atomic energy to drag queens to genetically engineered corn. This writing -intensive course will keep literature at its center but will also, as the above suggests, take turns into cultural studies and other discip lines. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 177: Black Activism in Chicago (\"You Can't Jail the Revolution:\" Black Activism in Chicago.) Since its original non -native settlement in 1780 by Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, a Black man of Haitian descent, Chicago has been a space for Black people to make their presence felt. This visibility has often come with struggle and strife. From Ida B. Wells to Fred Hampton to Camesha Jones, Black women a nd men in Chicago have claimed space and freedom despite the institutions working against them. This course will look at the history of Black activism in the city, using a variety of sources, including newspaper articles, speeches, autobiographies, intervi ews, documentaries, and films. This course will also utilize our proximity to Chicago and engage in field trips to witness Black activism in Chicago in action. We will investigate what it means to be an activist, what issues are important to Black activist s in and around the city, what strategies Black activists have used over time, and what the costs of activism are. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 419 FIYS 178: Politics in Film, Politics of F ilm In this course, we discuss political questions as presented in American and foreign films, both classic (Dr. Strangelove [UK, 1964], The Cranes are Flying [USSR, 1957]) and modern (Thank You for Smoking [USA, 2005], Parasite [South Korea, 2020], The Li ves of Others [Germany, 2006], I Saw the Sun [Turkey, 2009]). We focus on five major themes: democracy and dictatorships, migration and citizenship, capitalism and inequality, social movements and revolutions, and international conflicts and wars. We inves tigate how and why these issues are depicted in films in different ways, depending on where and when the film was produced. Students discuss the appeal of political films as entertainment; they also read political science scholarship that critically examin es political issues raised in films. Films thus serve, in this course, as the medium through which to examine how and why political problems emerge and are resolved. We also ponder the question: do films shape the way we think about politics or does politi cs shape the way we view films? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 180: Philosophy of Humans and Animals Western philosophers since Aristotle - at least - have claimed that human beings, as a species and alone among species, are capable of complex reasoning. The seventeenth -century French philosopher Descartes, famously, denied that non -human animals have minds or could think, claiming that they are essentially robots. From these kinds of premises, philosophers have inferred a wide range of ethical and religious claims, e.g., it is ethically permissible to eat non -human animals. Alternative claims, however, have just as long a history. In this course, we will read and discuss an array of p hilosophical opinions on the similarities and differences between humans and other animals, and the practices of industrial farming, training animals to work or entertain, building and patronizing zoos, animal experimentation, and other controversial topic s. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off -campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. (Under the Fore ster Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 182: Borders and Boundaries This is an uncontroversial claim: nouns are persons, places, things, and ideas. Yet, the precise lines separating a person, place, or thin g\u2014and thus delineating their purpose and nature \u2014are more complex. Consider, for example, the type of existence that a historical artifact has in a museum. Labeled and placed within a glass case, it becomes an object of study and observation. However, in it s original deployment, it may have been a tool to complete a task, a document that communicated information, or a good exchanged in trade. Whether as an object in a museum or as a thing in a world, its very being emerges from an intricate web of relations. What we determine the object to be is very much affected by where we find it. In different ways, the boundaries surrounding persons, groups (such as a group of citizens of a nation), and places also have hidden intricacies. This course is a study of these limits and the way that their openness or rigidity affects many features of the human and natural world. We study philosophical sources from ancient India, the United States, and Europe, alongside material from the disciplines of history, robotics, film, and literature. Moreover, students engage with case studies of boundaries claimed within the city of Chicago, the nation of the US, and groups around the world. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requiremen t. ) FIYS 183: Law, Literature and Logic A lawyer arguing a case tries to shape that case into a coherent, persuasive story: a dry recitation of facts and law is not enough. So, law is a literary - a story -telling - enterprise. And a dramatic one: fiction writers and filmmakers use crimes, investigations, court proceedings, and punishments to generate interest in their works. And yet, we still tend to think of literary flourishes as deceptive - after all, one meaning of \"to tell a story\" is \"to tell a lie.\" Legal reasoning, moreover, often seems arcane or merely manipulative, aimed more at obscuring the truth than revealing it. In this course we look into the complex and often bewildering interplay among law, literature, and logic, with the hope of illuminat ing all three - and with the hope of improving your writing skills, your reasoning skills, your rhetorical skills, and your argumentative skills. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 420 FIYS 184: Why College? A Chicago Story Why go to college? Over time, students, families, teachers, employers, and politicians have answered this question in very different ways. In this course, we will explore the changing meaning and realities of college - going in Chicagoland from the 18th to the 21st centuries: from classical finishing school for white clergymen, to teacher -training for new cohorts of women and African Americans, to socialization into a radical youth culture, to \"human capital\" investment for a kno wledge economy. We'll use a range of historical and contemporary sources to answer the questions: Why go to college? Who gets to go to college? Why is college so expensive? Through discussions, debates, and written reflection, we will dig into the past str uggles and policy decisions that shape what college means for you here at Lake Forest College today. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 186: Free Speech Undoubtedly, one of the most impo rtant rights that citizens in liberal democracies possess is the right to freely express themselves without fear of governmental sanction. However, while it may be easy to defend the right of free speech in the abstract, when faced with particular utteranc es that offend, shock, and/or harm, many of us will defend certain limitations on speech as morally appropriate or politically necessary. This course will be an examination of when, if ever, it is appropriate to restrict speech. Is there an absolute right to free speech? If so, does it only apply in certain public settings? And is the notion of \"hate speech\" a coherent idea? We will examine such questions (and many others) through a rigorous examination of iconic Supreme Court cases, classic works in politi cal philosophy, and contemporary debates in politics, sociology, and psychology. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 187: Religion in Gilded Age Chicago Students in this course will study the history and context of religion in Chicago at the turn of the century, roughly 1870 -1930. We will examine pivotal events in the shaping of Chicago's religious communities, including religious immigration and the building of the city's major churches a nd synagogues, the World's Parliament of Religions in 1894, the rise of faith healer and self proclaimed prophet John Dowie, the arrival of the Baha'i movement, and new occult and metaphysical movements. In addition to written histories, this course makes use of field trips and historical archival material. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, so consider your other commitments (such as off -campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you id entify courses of interest to you. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 188: Cultural Diversity and Dialogue In a culturally and socially diverse society like that of our own time, to conf ront and explore issues of difference, conflict, and community helps facilitate understanding and improve relations among social and cultural groups. This course provides an introduction to cultural diversity and social justice. By way of readings, discuss ion, and experiential activities designed to facilitate dialogue among students, we will examine crucial issues in contemporary life that focus on cultural diversity. By examining historical, psychological, and sociological texts as well as interactive exe rcises, students will be challenged to increase personal awareness of their own cultural experience, expand knowledge of the historical and social realities of diverse groups, and take action as agents of positive social change in their communities. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 189: Public Sculpture in Chicago This course is devoted to a first -hand examination of public sculpture in Chicago and its suburbs. Using intensive field stu dy with photographic documentation, background readings and research, group discussions, individual research -based and analytical writings, and the development of an original public sculpture proposal, students will gain insight into the factors involved i n the ideation, planning, funding and execution of public sculpture in urban and suburban venues. The class will tackle problems of community interest, artistic invention and intervention, accessibility, patronage, 'name -branding,' and symbolism in an effo rt to gain practical academic skills while learning about an important facet of the rich cultural experience that Chicago holds for residents, commuters and tourists. This course requires participation in some evening and/or weekend field trips or events, 421 so consider your other commitments (such as off -campus employment or a fall/winter sports participation) as you identify courses of interest to you. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 19 3: Writing Chicago Students in this course will explore how poets, writers, and other artists have described, imagined, and reimagined the city of Chicago as, alternately, \"nature's metropolis,\" the economic dynamo of the American dream, and as a nightmari sh dystopia of corruption, pollution, violence, and injustice. Starting with the Burnham Plan, students will pair the investigation of particular sites and neighborhoods with the study of literary texts and cultural histories, as well as artworks and archi tecture. Urban spaces as envisioned by women, immigrants, African Americans, and the LGBT community will be a particular focus of the course, and students will produce their own creative and critical writings about the city. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 194: Peace Studies This course explores the interdisciplinary field of scholarly inquiry and advocacy known as Peace Studies, which seeks paths to end violent conflict and build ethi cal and harmonious interpersonal, societal, and global relationships. The course considers a range of peace -related topics, including peace concepts and disputes, peace networks, trends in violence, and gender and security. Much of this course focuses on t he peace advocacy of one of Chicago's most famous social activists, Jane Addams (1860 -1935). Best known for her settlement work with poor immigrants in Chicago, Addams believed that pacifism would benefit marginalized populations, from poor immigrants in C hicago's 19th Ward to industrial workers and farmers across the United States. She passionately opposed World War I, believing strongly that people from different nations and cultures were capable of interacting peacefully to advance their shared interests , and that it was necessary to form international institutions that would resolve disputes diplomatically and ensure lasting international peace, security, prosperity, and justice. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Yea r Studies requirement. ) FIYS 196: American Playwrights in Chicago Chicago is home to a vivid and diverse theater scene that includes everything from tiny stages in the back rooms of bars to glitzy Broadway -style productions. This course examines a selecti on of American -authored plays from the Chicago season as the materials for an introduction to literary studies. As such, the course considers the plays we see and read as an occasion to develop skills in critical thinking, research, and writing. A secondar y objective is to connect the various plays to particular moments or themes in American history and culture. We proceed from the acquisition of a simple critical vocabulary for describing a play's form and content, through character study, to more complex questions of the director's decisions in taking a play from the page to the stage. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 197: Tools of Science, Mysteries of Art How are forged works of art detected? Conversely, how is the authenticity of cultural heritage material determined? How do museums identify colorants and use them to date artwork? Can the identification of dyes and pigments help decipher trade routes? Scientists have developed tools to help answer these and other questions posed by curators, art historians, and collectors. In this course, students learn about the scientific tools used to study cultural heritage materials, including carbon dating, infrared spectroscopy, mass spectromet ry, and surface -enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Students read introductory material, newspaper articles, scholarly articles, and case studies to examine how scientific tools have been used to decipher an artist's intent, date works of art, identify trade rout es, authenticate artwork, and discover forgeries. This course includes a field trip to the Art Institute of Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 198: Criminal Justice in Chicago In Criminal Justice in Chicago, we will analyze historical and contemporary Chicago criminal cases to consider how criminal justice is doled out in the Second City. We will focus on the seemingly disparate cases of four 422 Chicagoans: Nathan Leopold and Richar d Loeb, notorious jazz -age murderers, legendary R & B artist R Kelly, and Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, convicted in the murder of 17 -year -old Laquan McDonald. Despite the differences in the defendants, nature of crimes, backgrounds, and outcomes of these cases, we will examine some of the common themes surrounding their cases to gain a better understanding of how high -profile criminal justice cases are handled in Chicago. We will also draw distinctions between such high -profile cases and more routine violent crime cases charged and tried in Chicago. This class will include classroom visits by professionals from a variety of fields (e.g., legal, media) with personal ties to the cases. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 199: The Past and Future of a Plague This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of a disease that has afflicted humanity for its entire history: tuberculosis (TB). We begin by establishing a baselin e understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, and treatments (past and present) of tuberculosis. We then turn to the unique history of this illness and its cultural, economic, and political impact. TB may be the only epidemic disease closely equ ated with glamor and genius: idealized in the nineteenth century as a \"beautiful death,\" TB influenced understanding of beauty, fashion, and the creative process. The reality of TB, however, is that of a terrible disease that particularly ravages marginali zed groups, including the poor, industrial laborers, sex workers, migrants, the unhoused, and indigenous or enslaved peoples in European colonial empires. Our study of TB thus illuminates the intersection of disease with systems of oppression based on race , class, and gender. The course concludes with an examination of the recent history and possible futures of TB, including its deadly confluence with HIV/AIDS and the evolution of multi -drug resistant strains of the bacterium. (Under the Forester Fundamenta l Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 135: Watchmen and Society In 1986, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons published Watchmen , a groundbreaking twelve -issue limited comics series that imagined an alternate history in which comic -book superheroes were real, while exploring the moral ambiguities of the vigilantism and messianic fantasies that characterize the genre. Three decades later, the television writer and producer Damon Lindelof created the Watchmen TV series for HBO, a kind of sequel to the original comic that re -centered the story on America's history of racist violence, beginning with a vivid recreation of the 1921 massac re of Black Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma and moving into a story about racism and policing in 2019 Tulsa. Lindelof's widely acclaimed \"remix\" goes under the hood of Moore and Gibbons' original story to explore and ramify its complex themes, while placing a n all-too-timely focus on issues of racialized violence. In this course, students read and discuss the original Watchmen with an eye to how Moore and Gibbons use the techniques unique to comics to tell their story; they then shift to watching and discussin g the nine -episode series, examining the ways in which it deconstructs the already deconstructive original comic, reimagining its characters and situations to address the meanings of superheroes in the era of Black Lives Matter. (Under the Forester Fundame ntal Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 110: Examining Educational Opportunity This course examines equity issues in public education in America today. We focus this semester on one major school reform issue: how schools can work to address inequality in educational outcomes among African American, LatinX, and White student populations. What facets of school structure, curriculum, school culture, or resources are related to this problem? We investigate urban educat ional environments, but also consider broader issues of segregation/integration and the distribution of resources in rural and suburban environments. The course considers the importance of racial identity formation, family relationships, cultural beliefs, and traditions in building perspectives on learning and the schooling process. Ultimately, the course tackles the questions: What do Americans believe about the quality of and problems in public education today? What are promising practices in reform to cr eate public schools that give all students the opportunity to fulfill the American Dream? (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 423 FIYS 152: The Politics of Population When you were born, you joine d about 6 billion other humans on this planet, but by 2050, the world's population is expected to reach 9.7 billion. What are we going to do with everyone? In this course, we explore the intersections between population growth and its impact on security, e conomics, and the environment. We explore a range of national efforts to manage population growth, from China's infamous \"One Child Policy\" to measures implemented in Japan and Singapore to encourage childbearing. We investigate how the international commu nity shifted from a population control approach to one that prioritizes reproductive health, with accompanying debates surrounding reproductive choice; whether imbalanced sex ratios in a society lead to increased violence, including sex trafficking; and ho w sustainable development goals inform demographic policies, with particular attention to the impact on both women worldwide and on citizens of the Global South. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requireme nt. ) FIYS 106: Medical Mysteries of the Mind This course is for beginning students interested in exploring the human brain in a rigorous interdisciplinary way. If you are intensely interested in how your brain helps you think, feel, sense, read, write, ea t, sleep, dream, learn and move, this course is for you. You will learn how brain dysfunction causes complex medical illnesses, like Alzheimer's, Autism, and Schizophrenia. You will meet Chicago's world -class neuroscientists through guest seminars and clas s-trips to famous laboratories. You will debate ethical dilemmas that face society and dissect human brains. Lastly, you will present at the Brain Awareness Week on campus. One year each of high school biology and chemistry is recommended. (Under the Fores ter Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 109: The Future According to an article published in the Dayton Daily News in September 1920, by the year 2020: \"No one can doubt but that the flying machines of a new and important type, not known today, will be in general use a century removed... The automobile will be succeeded by something entirely different [and] human beings a century hence will become either much smaller or much larger than they are today. Everythi ng will have changed.\" Predicting the future is clearly difficult! Experts in numerous fields are routinely called upon to make predictions, and often fail miserably at their task \u2014not foreseeing a pandemic, the outcome of political races, economic upheaval , whether bridges can withstand stress loads, and so on. And yet, we cannot avoid making predictions \u2014it is an essential part of being human. This course explores the way people have made predictions in the past, both good and bad; students also learn sound methods for improving our own ability to see into the future. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 124: Social Labels and Identity We use social labels (e.g., Hispanic, deaf, woman, heter osexual, working class) to identify ourselves and others. How do such labels shape our understanding of ourselves and how we view the world? How are these labels and identities influenced by the larger social contexts in which we live? How do social catego ries affect our attitudes about our own life circumstances? In this course we'll examine how personal identities form, and how they are influenced by social group memberships and larger social structures. We'll read about psychological research and feminis t theory, participate in field trips, and listen to guest speakers. This course will demonstrate how academic research can help us understand our own experiences as we examine the lives of others. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course mee ts the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 113: Music and Math In this course, students will investigate the connections between the fields of music and mathematics. Commonalities to be explored will include the musical concepts of rhythm, meter, scales , tuning, and temperament, and the mathematical concepts of geometric series, rational and irrational numbers, modular arithmetic, and symmetries of the square. No previous knowledge of music theory is required, only a desire to use critical and analytical skills to understand and appreciate music. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) 424 FIYS 107: College Access and Completion (Public Policy: College Access and Completion.) This course explores key issues surrounding the accessibility of college in the United States, including questions about college debt, college funding formulas, and the impact these policies have on the ability of students from various identity groups to afford and attend college . Furthermore, the course considers factors that impact students' ability to complete their college degrees, as well as policies that might help close the \"graduation gaps\" that exist between different populations of students and increase college completio n rates. Finally, the course works to quantify the economic \"worth\" of a college diploma in the United States and the implications that graduation gaps (racial, socioeconomic, etc.) have on societal outcomes. FIYS 125: Special Needs in the Classroom (Publ ic Policy: Special Needs Students in the Classroom.) The passage of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) in 1990 mandated a \"free and appropriate education\" to every child in the United States through the age of 18, regardless of disab ilities. For the past 30 years, American schools have been required to provide support for medical conditions, learning differences, and other challenges to students who qualify. In this course, students learn how the law was created, how student supports are paid for, what regulations are in place to ensure family involvement in creating an Individual Education Plan (IEP), how mandates regarding the \"least restrictive environment\" possibly led to unintended and negative consequences, and how parents work with government officials on issues related to the IDEA. Students evaluate the effectiveness of the law, study the challenges in enforcing compliance (while the IDEA was enacted at the federal level, individual state boards of education are responsible for ensuring each school district complies), and contemplate legislative improvements for future special needs students. FIYS 127: Pandemic History: The Black Death Since early 2020, the Covid -19 pandemic has reminded the world of a harsh reality familiar to n early everyone in premodern history: in a time without vaccines or robust public health interventions, virulent and novel pathogens and the pandemics they caused were frightening facts of life. Infectious diseases have shaped humankind since the late Neoli thic era, but the Black Death (or, simply, \"plague\") of the mid -14th century was the most catastrophic pandemic in human history, in terms of the mortality rate of the populations it impacted. From the mid 1340s to the 1350s, the plague claimed the lives o f nearly half of the people living in the affected areas of Africa, Asia, and Europe. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the Black Death, while also discussing earlier (6th century) and later (19th -20th century) outbreaks of pl ague. We begin by establishing a baseline understanding of the causative factors, symptoms, spread, and treatments of plague. We then turn to the unique genomic and human history of this illness and its cultural, economic, environmental, religious, and pol itical impact. We also explore multiple facets of the human response to these natural disasters which ranged from prayer and medical treatments to quarantines and scapegoating. In addition to addressing the history of the plague, this course offers a lens through which to view the current pandemic and future public health challenges. FIYS 129: Reading College No, that isn't a misprint. This is not a course on reading in college, though you're in college and we'll certainly be reading. This is a course on ho w to read and interpret college as an institution and concept: how it has been represented in literature, criticism, film, and popular culture and how these representations enhance, distort, and sometimes transform academia. Course texts will include novel s, short stories, essays, criticism, films, TV shows, and archival materials that describe (and often criticize) the postsecondary academic experience in the United States. We'll examine these texts in light of our own personal experiences, with the goal o f coming to a better understanding of college as an institution, our own aims and roles within that institution, and how we can inspire change within that institution and our society more broadly. FIYS 159: Theatre and Medicine This course investigates the intersections of art and science, from therapeutic applications of theatre and performance to plays about medicine. Such collaborations have produced interactive exhibits to teach audiences about neuroscience, used actors to he lp train doctors, and created plays to educate the public about 425 medical issues. Students in this course read plays, watch performances, and participate in workshops with pioneers in the field of art therapy. Students consider how different kinds of knowled ge inform and enrich each other, and they learn about the incredible discoveries that come about when artists and scientists work together. The course makes use of Chicago's vibrant theatre scene to see live plays and meet artists who explore these discipl inary intersections in their work. FIYS 161: Narrative and Knowledge Production Telling stories is a fundamental part of being human. We share stories of our families, friends, and experiences. We examine religious texts, myths, folklore, and the media for insight into ourselves and others. We create, share, and explore internal narratives to better make sense of the world. However, the significance of storytelling is often undervalued in the world of academic knowledge production. In this class, we examine narrative and how it is used to offer legitimacy for our actions and beliefs. Moreover, we look closely at narrative's relationship to knowledge production and how narrative is interwoven with facets of identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, social cl ass, and ability. We read critical, feminist, working class, and queer theory and examine how writers from nondominant identities use narrative to articulate their own complex position in relation to education and culture. This course demonstrates that sto ries are both ubiquitous and integral in knowledge production and that they can both subvert and reinforce the status quo. FIYS 188: Fantasy Fiction of the Inklings (Tolkien, Lewis, and Literature of the Inklings.) Bilbo Baggins, Gollum, and Smaug. Mr. Tumnus and the White Witch. Sound familiar? If you thought you'd left those familiar fantasy figures behind with your childhood reading, think again. This seminar will revisit the delightful fantasy worlds of Middle -Earth, Narnia, and other imagined place s by examining the rich literary legacy of Tolkien, Lewis, Williams, and Barfield \u2014a group of British writers known as the \"Inklings,\" who were pioneers of twentieth -century fantasy fiction. This course will involve close reading of major fiction and nonfic tion by these authors (and their influential precursors) as well as opportunity to discuss the fascinating biographical, historical, theological, and aesthetic context of their works. The seminar will pay especial attention to the Inklings' intellectual an d artistic indebtedness to the medieval past, to their discourses about religion, politics, and ethics, and to the way their fiction refracts major twentieth -century events, particularly World Wars I and II. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 192: Public Policy & Law: Police Reform The murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests questioning the legitimacy of America's policing tactics. Visceral images of police brutality spurned ra llying cries to \"defund the police\" and hold officers and departments accountable, as some Americans pushed for a reevaluation of traditional policing systems deemed ill-equipped to deal with the multifaceted issues endemic in criminal behavior, including addiction, mental illness, poverty, and racism. And yet, the vast majority of policing remains unchanged; notably, voters in Minneapolis, the site of Floyd's murder, rejected proposals to reallocate police funds, and courts have repeatedly rejected cases t hat would end qualified immunity defenses for law enforcement. Through a legal lens focusing on legal case studies and media literacy, and through discussions with legal and police experts, this course will evaluate the policy issues and arguments at the h eart of policing reforms and consider how effective public policy could bring about meaningful reform. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 195: Governing the Global Commons (Public Policy : Governing the Global Commons.) The global commons are the domains throughout the world - and the resources found there - that are outside the jurisdiction of countries. They include the oceans, the atmosphere, and cyberspace, as well as Antarctica and ou ter space. This course studies the international politics of the global commons and the tensions between two competing dynamics around the use of global resources. The first is the effort to operate management structures that ensure the sustainable use of these resources for everyone's benefit. The second is the incentive among nations to use these resources for their individual benefit without regard for the common good of all users, which results in the depletion of these resources, to the world's detrime nt. Case studies of climate change, ozone depletion, ocean biodiversity, and the militarization of outer 426 space will be used to illustrate these tensions, and policy solutions that rely on global governance will be evaluated. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 123: Global Epidemics: From Aids to Zika What makes an infectious disease become an epidemic, such as the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, or that of Zika in Brazil in 2015? Mo reover, how did COVID, which appeared in 2019, so quickly become a pandemic? Why does it take so long for pharmaceutical companies to construct a vaccine that protects against disease -causing organisms? In this course, we explore the medical, biological, a nd molecular complexities of a variety of infectious diseases that plague the world, such as malaria, Dengue fever, and COVID. We study the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that cause the diseases, how they are transmitted, and the chemical and biological challenges of making and distributing vaccines in less developed countries. In addition to class discussions, writing assignments, and oral presentations, students investigate microbial morphology through a high -powered laboratory microscope \u2014and even make bacterial art. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 175: Frankenstein: Myth of the Monstrous It's alive! This course will take Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, as its jumping -off point for a semester's exploration of this uncannily persistent tale of horror, now a byword for the dark side of science and modernity. Shelley's novel gives us so much - the archetypes of mad scientist and mon ster, inquiries into the origins of evil and nature versus nurture, questions about gender, sexuality, class, and race - that we could easily spend the whole semester studying the novel and the gothic culture that it emerged from. But we will also look at film adaptations, read plays, stories, and poems on the theme of the monstrous, and consider contemporary \"Frankensteins,\" from atomic energy to drag queens to genetically engineered corn. This writing -intensive course will keep literature at its center bu t will also, as the above suggests, take turns into cultural studies and other disciplines. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 143: Public Art in Chicago This course is devoted to a firs t-hand examination of public art in Chicago and its suburbs, including mural painting and sculpture, among other genres. Using photographic documentation, background readings and research, lectures, group discussions, individual research -based and analytic al writings, and select visits to see artwork, students gain insight into the factors involved in the rhetorical construction of cities through public art. The class tackles issues including: textual analysis, semiotic meaning, visual culture, the construc tion of public memory, and persuasive writing in an effort to gain practical academic skills while learning about an important facet of the rich cultural experience that Chicago holds for residents, commuters, and tourists. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 154: The Irish in Chicago This course places Irish history in context and examine the large -scale emigration from Ireland to the United States in the mid -19th century. It traces the d estinations of the Irish as they settled in America and focuses primarily on those who came to Chicago. It researches where and how the Irish community lived in the city and surrounding areas. It examines how the Irish immigrants contended with the darker side of this new life through impoverished times and the rise of mob activity, and yet, how the cultural aspects of Irish life (among them sports, music, dance, art, crafts, literature, and theater) not only survived the transatlantic crossing, but thrived in their new home, and continue to be part of life for the Irish community in 21st -century Chicago. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 155: Chicago: Land of Hope In the half -century fol lowing World War I, millions of African Americans left the American South in the Great Migration. Settling in northern cities like Chicago, which many called the \"Land of Hope,\" black migrants dramatically reshaped American life and culture. This course ex plores the connections between that history of northward movement and African American cultural production and experiences. We do this through a special focus on Chicago, where the black population grew from just over 44,000 to more than 1.1 million. We re ad 427 closely and contextualize a variety of texts, including novels, plays, photographs, maps, sociological surveys, oral histories, and correspondence. We examine the historical significance of these texts from a variety of disciplinary perspectives - inclu ding history, literary and film criticism, sociology, critical race studies, and cultural studies (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the First Year Studies requirement. ) FIYS 182: Borders and Boundaries This is an uncontroversia l claim: nouns are persons, places, things, and ideas. Yet, the precise lines separating a person, place, or thing \u2014and thus delineating their purpose and nature \u2014are more complex. Consider, for example, the type of existence that a historical artifact has i n a museum. Labeled and placed within a glass case, it becomes an object of study and observation. However, in its original deployment, it may have been a tool to complete a task, a document that communicated information, or a good exchanged in trade. Whet her as an object in a museum or as a thing in a world, its very being emerges from an intricate web of relations. What we determine the object to be is very much affected by where we find it. In different ways, the boundaries surrounding persons, groups (s uch as a group of citizens of a nation), and places also have hidden intricacies. This course is a study of these limits and the way that their openness or rigidity affects many features of the human and natural world. We study philosophical sources from a ncient India, the United States, and Europe, alongside material from the disciplines of history, robotics, film, and literature. Moreover, students engage with case studies of boundaries claimed within the city of Chicago, the nation of the US, and groups around the world.

Delving into epics, hymns, women's songs, animated films, scholarly articles, and observation of contemporary religious practices, we ask whether stories of Hindu goddesses empower women or serve the interests of a patriarchal culture. Through a variety of approaches, we investigate how women and men experience, negotiate, and subvert constructions of gender, femininity, and masculinity. The course culminates in a role -playing game, which uses an innovative methodology called Reacting to the Past to delve into legislation on Sati (ritual widow -burning) in colonial India. Students research and articulate opinions of historical characters, while learning to express themselves with clarity, precision, and force and developing their public speaking skills.

This course explores how socio -spatial and territorial relations are marked by gender, race, and class in Latin America. From a feminist anthropological and geographical perspective, we revisit different territorial struggles in Latin Americ a and the role of gender in these mobilizations. Specifically, we examine how power functions in \"the body\" or the self, but also in human and non -human relations, which are traversed by colonial nation -State and imperialist formations. This course not onl y engages in critical dialogues on space, and the ways in which race, gender, and class are experienced in the everyday life, but also how these territorial spaces become contested places for Black, Indigenous and other racialized subjects to imagine and p roduce decolonial futures.

This course explores the role of gender and sexuality in shaping U.S. politics, economy, and society. In particular, we examine the way that power itself is \"gendered,\" and explore expressions of gendered power from intimate interpersonal interactions to global foreign policy. In this course we will not assume \"women\" or \"men\" have been solid blocks with unified interests over time, but rather have always been divided along lines of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and political ideology. We explore these divisions by looking at political movem ents throughout U.S. history, including women's suffrage, feminism, gay liberation, reproductive rights, sex -workers' rights, contemporary LGBTQ rights, and the #MeToo movement.

A central question for the course is how biological/physiological components of sex and desire are given meaning by cultures, with particular focus on the late 20th -early 21st century United States. The course wi ll explore the US hegemonic binaries of male vs. female, masculine vs. feminine, and man vs. woman, examine how they articulate with one another, and consider various nonbinary responses.

GSWS 301: Romantic Comedies & Phil of Love (Romantic Comedies and Philosophy of Love) Why do we like to watch romantic comedies? What's satisfying about them, even when they're not great films? Film theorist Leo Braudy claimed that \"genre [film] ... always involves a complex relation between the compulsions of the past and the freedoms of the present. ... [They] affect their audience ... by their ability to express the warring traditions in society and the social importance of understandin g convention.\" In this course, following Braudy, we will investigate the relationship between the film genre of romantic comedy and age -old thinking about love, marriage, and romance. We'll read some ancient and modern philosophy of love, as well as some r elevant film theory, and watch and discuss an array of romantic comedies, trying to unpack what we really believe about love.

How does group affiliation affect identity? What is the relationship between identity and change? How does faith in God influence understanding of the individual? This course considers the following topics: medieval conceptions of the individual in Christian autobiography; the role of the body and gender in determining identity (exploring topics such as the Eucharist, the c ult of saints, and sex difference); how medieval Europeans defined their own identity by persecuting the 434 'other,' including heretics, Jews, and lepers; how change affected identity in medieval texts such as werewolf stories and resurrection theology.

Why are women, people of color , and other groups persistently excluded from entrepreneurial resources? How might we make entrepreneurship more inclusive to drive disruptive innovation, help people reach their full potential, and propel positive economic growth? This course surveys the deeper (and often hidden) causal factors that have contributed to and reinforced entrepreneurial exclusion. We examine disparities at the macro - and micro -level (i.e., gender, race, sexuality, geography, ability, age) through case studies, reading, hands -on activities, and student research projects. Students propose their own reasoned and researched solutions to address the business case for access and inclusion not as a charitable cause but as an economic imperative. The course concludes with students pitc hing their solutions on how to empower an underrepresented group, increase access to high -quality tools to find problems worth solving for this group and the resources to solve them, and create new channels for revenue from a previously underserved and ign ored market.

Empires 436 asserted dominance over far -flung colonies, while technology and innovation churned to keep up with new demands. The era of colonization and expansion set the stage for further conflict and bloodshed in recent centuries, along with the emergence of new ideological assertions regarding individuals, liberty, and globalization. Although understanding the trends in modern global history is a massive undertaking, one group is frequently underrepresented or ignored: women. This course examines the history of the world fro m 1450 to the present with a special focus on women and gender. It seeks to broaden our understanding of participants in world history and identify ways that women helped shape the development of societies and ideologies around the globe. We also learn mor e about the everyday lived experiences of women in various cultures and nations. How have ideas of men's and women's roles, as well as conceptualizations of masculinity and femininity, shaped modern life? How does our understanding of history change when w e focus on women?

Rather than attempt a s urvey of all the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understandings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contempo rary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the tropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential 437 social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' certain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's lives.

A u nifying thread for those theorists generally accepted as working within Queer Theory is the prioritization of gender and sexuality as social ordering devices. Queer Theorists make dualities, power inequalities, and identity performance central to their ana lyses. The creation, rise, and ultimate deconstruction of these theories will be placed within social and historical contexts. Once the student has a firm understanding of the source and content of Queer Theory we will embark upon an exploration of its app lication through the investigation of a number of topics that are often peripheralized in the academy. Ultimately, we will question the utility of the theory in light of factors ranging from its dismantlement under deconstruction to the rise of social cont ingency theory.

Gender and sexual norms are perpetuated and challenged through notions of visibility, a key tactic in the fight for societal acceptance and civil rights. How sexuality is made visible and invisible will serve as a central focus in our analysis of queer film and media, focusing primarily on explicit representations of GLBTQ characters. Through feminist and queer theory, film theory and cultural criticism, we will analyze the contested relationships between spectators and texts, identity and commodities, realism and fantasy, activism and entertainment, desire and politics.

How do we distinguish love worthy of the name from its less er forms (such as love that becomes an exercise of control or fulfilling a social script)? What are the underlying commitments and performances entailed in both traditional forms of love and queer love? How do the structures of race and culture affect our exercise and experience of love? In addition to attending to a range of questions related to romantic love, we will also reflect on other types of emotion (e.g. hatred, desire, empathy, compassion) and their function in key aspects of human life (such as political association, knowing, and morality).

Additionally, we will examine how feminism has been enac ted, defined and denigrated over time in an attempt to understand the cultural tensions within this concept as depicted in popular culture and academic texts. With readings ranging from critical theory to popular non -fiction by and about women, we will spe culate on the impact of and source for popular portrayals of women and what they might be telling us about women's roles in society.

Students explore texts that illuminate the importance of the body to individual and group identity and discuss how these texts' definitions of \"normal\", \"beaut iful\", and \"healthy\" bodies continue to wield influence. Among the course's questions: how was the central role of the body in identity (before and after death) shaped by Christian theology of a God who was embodied, suffered, and died? What assumptions we re made about how biological sex dictated identity \u2014and how did pre -modern authors reckon with those who fell outside the sex or gender binary? How was spiritual morality understood to be inscribed on the physical body in complex ways (skin color, physical features, illness, pain, sexual activity)? How did racism and nascent colonialism shape ideals of body size and appearance?

This course explores the role of gender and sexuality in shaping U.S. politics, economy, and society. In particular, we examine the way that power itself is \"gendered,\" and explore expressions of gendered power from intimate interperson al interactions to global foreign policy. In this course we will not assume \"women\" or \"men\" have been solid blocks with unified interests over time, but rather have always been divided along lines of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and political ideolo gy. We explore these divisions by looking at political movements throughout U.S. history, including women's suffrage, feminism, gay liberation, reproductive rights, sex -workers' rights, contemporary LGBTQ rights, and the #MeToo movement.

Most women end their careers after a single period in the legislature or other offices. Women, it seems, are becoming the constant newcomers.

There is one exception: students may elect to take one required course for the major for a \"Pass\" grade; that course will not be counted toward the required grade point average. There are no limits for minors. Requirements for the Major: At least 9 credits History 110: Global Change:The Power of History - preferably in the first year One of the following two -course sequences: o United States History 200: Empire, Slavery, Freedom: Early United States History 201: Inequity, Rights, Reaction: Modern United States o East Asia History 212: Origins of East Asia History 213: Modern East Asia o Ancient and Medieval Europe History 204: Roman History History 205: Medieval History History 442 o Medieval and Early Modern Europe History 205: Medieval History History 206: Renaissance and Reformation o Modern Europe History 208: Europe 1715 -1890 History 209: Europe in the Twentieth Century o African American History History 202: African American History 1619 -1865 History 203: African American History 1865 -2016 History 300: The Historian's Workshop - taken as a junior Four additional courses, at least two of which must be at the 300 -level or above Completion of the Senior Studies Requirement in one of the following ways: o History 420: Senior Seminar o Senior Thesis Requirements for the Minor: The Minor in History consists of six courses, one of which must be at the 300 -level or above. History 300 is encouraged but not required for the minor. A note on internships The History Department recognizes that internships are a valuable way for students to connect their classroom learning to future careers. Some History majors and minors have completed internships at institutions directly related to History (Lake Forest -Lake B luff Historical Society, Newberry Library, etc.). Our students have also completed internships at other types of companies and institutions that allowed them to utilize the skills of a History major/minor (political campaigns, non -profits, etc.). We enco urage our students to seek out these opportunities. Internships do not, however, fulfill any of the nine credits required of History majors or six credits required of History minors (see above). Rather, they will appear as \"extra\" History credits on the student's transcript (a tenth course for a major, or a seventh course for a minor, for example). For more information, see our \"Internships and Careers\" page. A note on repeated courses Lake Forest College policy states that students who receive a C - or lower in a course may repeat that course once with replacement of the earlier grade. Normally, students must repeat a course with the same course number. However, in the spring of 2014 the History Department instituted a comprehensive course re - numbering. T his could cause confusion among students wishing to repeat a course but finding that it now has a different number. Students in this situation should consult with the chair of History to be sure that they are repeating the same course, regardless of the di fferent number. Learning Outcomes The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the History Department are: 1. The history major will demonstrate the skills required of a historian: critical thinking; writing; conducting historical research; and interpretatio n. 2. The history major will demonstrate an understanding of historiographical approaches to the past and the ability to recognize the limits and biases of documents from the past, and to appreciate the perspectives of both past and present in any reconstr uction of history. History Courses HIST 110: Global Change: The Power of History This course offers an introduction to college -level study of history.

This course follows the transformation of North America and the emergence of the United States as an independent republic from the seventeenth ce ntury to the greatest crisis of the new nation, the Civil War and Reconstruction. Connecting primary sources to major works of historical interpretation, it examines the foundations of the United States by tracing the political, economic, and social underp innings of historical change. Our exploration of this history will revolve around three key themes: land, labor, and territorial conquest and empire. No prerequisites.

We explore the rise of a burgeoning capitalist economy, the rapidly changing role of government in American society, the rise of the U.S. as an imperial power, and political and social movements that redrew the boundaries of inclusion in American democracy along class, gender, and racial lines. By the mid -twentieth century, a powerful labor movement gained new rights for workers, the Civil Rights Movement overthrew t he Jim Crow order, and feminism challenged established gender roles. These challenges to the status quo, however, unleashed a powerful conservative reaction. A central theme of the course is inequality: we explore both the egalitarian movements that reduce d social inequality in the mid -twentieth century, as well as the renewed growth of inequality in the last forty years.

The history of African Americans in the United States is often defined by the chattel slavery experience. However, the early years of American history that made people of Afri can descent American are much more complex. By centering the actions and voices of the heterogeneous African American community, this course examines topics including the Middle Passage, domestic slavery expansion, free and maroon black communities, variou s resistance strategies, interracial coalitions, and the role of enslaved people in bringing about their own emancipation.

In 1865, the centuries -old question of where African Americans would fit into the fabric of United States society was finally answered. As newly freed people and full citizens, African Americans learned that the process of citizenship would not be seamless or easy, and that the fight was just beginning. Blacks redefined their status over and ove r again during this 150 -year period, and this course will examine why and how these shifts occurred. No prerequisites.

During this time, Americans gradually came to see themselves as part of a unified nation with its own distinctive culture and ideals, though this outcome was far from certain. Beginning with the Constitution and the uncertain legacies of the American Revolution, the course considers the fundamental political, social, and cultur al problems that could easily have torn the young Republic apart. Topics and themes include the problems of democracy and popular politics, the limits of citizenship, the formation of a distinctive American culture, the place of America on the world stage, the transition to capitalism and the 'market revolution,' and the figure of Andrew Jackson.

Throughout the Americas, Native people built complex systems of cultural grandeu r and political interaction. These cultures may have changed but certainly did not vanish when these groups came into contact with European colonizers. Rather, Indigenous people created new strategies for survival in a changing geopolitical reality, and im pacted the development of emerging nations like the United States. In modern times, Indigenous people continue to fight for recognition of their sovereignty and rights.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the t ransmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of educational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K -12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U .S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

Along the way, we will also consider the broader context of immigration (i.e., of national, ethnic, and religious groups other than Muslims to France), the formation and evolution of concepts of French national identity, and the history of French citizenship policy. This course represents a postcolonial approach to the history of France, at the nexus of colonial, immigration, and urban histories. These histories will be studied with a focus on the social, economic, political, and cultural stakes raised by immigration, and the course will consider how som e in France have reacted against certain groups of immigrants as antithetical to \"Frenchness\".

Emotions were once considered stable and universal: love was always love, and fear always evidence of irredeemable cowardice. Recently, however, historians have found significant variations in expression and regulation of emotions in different periods and cultures. This course will examine ideas surrounding emotion in the West from Late Antiquity through the Early Modern period. The study of emotions raises a variety of historical questions: how do we research the history of something as intangible as emotions? Should historians use the theories and methodologies of other disciplines? Have institutions and belief systems mobilized particular emotions? Have norms and expectations for emotion changed over time? What is the relationship between the experience and expression of emotion? We will also explore some of the established narratives in the history of e motions, such as the \"hydraulic model\" 449 and the rise of the affectionate family. No prerequisites.

HIST 284: Epidemic Disease in European Histor This course will focus on four epidemic disea ses that caused widespread death and destruction in Europe and the Americas from the fourteenth to twentieth centuries: the Black Death, smallpox, cholera, and malaria. In each case, after learning about the symptoms of the disease, the progression of the epidemic(s), and the identity of the victims, we will explore multiple facets of the human response to these natural disasters, including: theories of disease; religious responses; medical measures; artistic representations; and the intersection of state p ower and public health efforts. We will also study key figures in the history of medicine. A significant portion of the course is devoted to the impact of disease in European imperial possessions (such as India and the Americas), violence against minority groups (notably Jews) in Europe in the wake of epidemics, and the ways in which theories of class and race influenced European thinking on disease. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives and Writing requirements.) HIST 285: Public History Public history is the practice of history outside the academy. Public historians record and preserve evidence of the past in many formats, analyzing and interpreting their findings to general and specialized audiences beyond the traditional classroom setting. This course will survey the theory and practice of various professional historical specialties - ranging from archival administration to historic site management, museum exhibitions, and historical reenac tment. Institutional constraints, audience development, and conflicts between history and public memory will be major thematic issues. Field trips to institutions and sites in the Chicago metropolitan area.

This course explores the role of gender and sexuality in shaping U.S. politics, economy, and society. In particular, we examine the way that power itself is \"gendered,\" and explore expressions of gendered power from intimate interpersonal interactions to global foreign policy. In this course we will not assume \"women\" or \"men\" have been solid blocks with unified interests over time, but rather have always been divided along lines of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and political ideology. We explore these divisions by looking at political movements throughout U.S. history, including women's suffrage, feminism, gay liberation, reproductive rights, sex -workers' rights, co ntemporary LGBTQ rights, and the #MeToo movement.

The centuries from 1600 to today have witness ed unprecedented rates of economic growth, advances in agricultural and industrial productivity, and improvements in the standard of living, which have transformed social, political, and economic life across the world. Over the semester, we will explore a series of questions: What are the origins, consequences, and the future of capitalism? Why did some states and nations become so powerful, some economies so wealthy? Who benefited from economic growth and expanding trade? What roles did public and private actors play? Will capitalism converge on a single \"best\" model under the pressures of globalization? Through an introduction to the methods and major topics of economic history, students will gain essential skills in assessing historical sources and statis tical datasets. No prerequisites.

More than an escape from everyday life, the games Americans have played and watched have been thick with social, cultural, and politic al meanings. Athletes and spectators alike have defined and challenged ideas of gender, race, and the body; they have worked out class antagonisms, expressed national identities, and promoted social change. Topics include: the construction of race; definit ions of manhood and womanhood; industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of modern spectator sport; media and mass spectacle; fitness and athletic reform movements; collegiate athletics; sports figures and social change.

Placing the geographic area that would become the United States into a global frame, this course explores patterns of European, Asian, and Latin American migration into a land already inhabited by mobile ind igenous populations, the forced migration of enslaved Africans to the U.S. and later migration of black citizens northward, as well as the movement of migrants over the long -contested (and moving) U.S. -Mexico border. We learn about the politics of migratio n, including the long history of anti - immigrant nativism and xenophobia in the United States, as well as the role of migrants in shaping major U.S. social and political movements. We also examine how ethnic, racial, and national identities - including \"Ame rican\" -are not fixed categories, but rather constructed and reconstructed over time. No prerequisites.

This course examines how succeeding immigrant groups have practiced and lived their Catholic faith in different times and places. Religion cannot be separated from the larger social and economic context in which it i s embedded, so the course will also pay attention to the ways in which the social and economic conditions that greeted the immigrants on their arrival shaped how they went about praying and working. Finally, the changing leadership of the Catholic Church w ill be taken into account, since it provided the ecclesiastical framework for the new Catholic arrivals.

Critics and audiences have noted that we are in a golden era of black television, with an upsurge of shows over the last few years that display the multiplicity of black life in the United States. And yet, this is not the first time t his has happened. Since the 1950s, African Americans have been depicted on the small screen in both regressive and progressive ways. How have these images changed over time? How do these depictions impact the way people see African Americans and how Africa n Americans see themselves? No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed 451 both to protest and disruption in order to advance their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge authority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly - arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor.

These may include: should Christians use violen ce at all, and if so, under what circumstances? What is the correct relationship between the Church and the government? What makes a person a saint - celibacy? Harsh asceticism? Aiding the poor? Preaching the Gospel? What is the appropriate role of wealth and property in the life of a dedicated Christian? Should a Christian seeking religious truth rely only on the Bible and revelation, or do logic and scientific inquiry have a role to play?

This course teaches the history of environmental transformations and human adaptation through an exploration of some of the natural disasters and climate changes that impacted Europe and the Mediterranean world c. 300 -1500 CE. Using specific case studies (including episodes like the so -called \"mystery cloud\" that troubled Levantine communities in 536 and the unusually well -docu mented 1348 earthquake in central Europe), the course evaluates how medieval people thought about nature, and how moments of crisis shaped individuals, communities, and larger ecosystems.

How does group affiliation affect identity? What is the relationship between identity and change? How does faith in God influence understanding of the individual? This course considers the following topics: medieval conceptions of the i ndividual in Christian autobiography; the role of the body and gender in determining identity (exploring topics such as the Eucharist, the cult of saints, and sex difference); how medieval Europeans defined their own identity by persecuting the 'other,' in cluding heretics, Jews, and lepers; how change affected identity in medieval texts such as werewolf stories and resurrection theology.

This period saw clerics, rulers, and ordinary people wrestle with profound and eternal questions: what does a person need to do to save their soul? Who can claim to mediate betw een God and humanity? What is the role of family, sex, and marriage in a pious life? What gives a ruler the right to rule? When is violence justified in the pursuit of faith?

Empires 454 asserted dominance over far -flung colonies, while technology and innovation churned to keep up with new demands. The era of col onization and expansion set the stage for further conflict and bloodshed in recent centuries, along with the emergence of new ideological assertions regarding individuals, liberty, and globalization. Although understanding the trends in modern global histo ry is a massive undertaking, one group is frequently underrepresented or ignored: women. This course examines the history of the world from 1450 to the present with a special focus on women and gender. It seeks to broaden our understanding of participants in world history and identify ways that women helped shape the development of societies and ideologies around the globe. We also learn more about the everyday lived experiences of women in various cultures and nations. How have ideas of men's and women's r oles, as well as conceptualizations of masculinity and femininity, shaped modern life? How does our understanding of history change when we focus on women?

HIST 231: Indigenous History of the Americas This course is a survey of Indigenous history from pre -colonization to the present across both North and South America. Throughout the Americas, Native people built complex systems of cultural grandeur and political interaction. These cultures may have cha nged but certainly did not vanish when these groups came into contact 456 with European colonizers. Rather, Indigenous people created new strategies for survival in a changing geopolitical reality, and impacted the development of emerging nations like the Unit ed States. In modern times, Indigenous people continue to fight for recognition of their sovereignty and rights.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledg e, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of e ducational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K -12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system was forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

During this time, Americans gradually came to see themselves as part of a unified nation with its own distinctive culture and ideals, though this outcome was far from certain. Beginning with the Constitution and the uncertain legacies of the American Revolution, the course considers the fundamental political, social, and cultural problems that could easily have torn the young Republic apart. Topics and themes include the problems of democ racy and popular politics, the limits of citizenship, the formation of a distinctive American culture, the place of America on the world stage, the transition to capitalism and the 'market revolution,' and the figure of Andrew Jackson.

We will pay special attention to new patterns of inequality in the contexts of industrialization, urbaniz ation, and immigration. We will also examine the complexities and contradictions of progressive reform movements, including efforts to improve housing, sanitation, and labor conditions. We will look at how those transformations affected people's everyday l ives and conceptions of American citizenship, and we will explore the emergence of popular mass culture through photography, art, architecture, advertising, and films.

The course begins with an introduction to some of the major theorists of capitalism: Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Max Weber, a nd Karl Polanyi. Over the semester, we will explore a series of questions using empirical research from leading scholars: What are the origins, consequences, and the future of capitalism? Why did some states and nations become so powerful, some economies s o wealthy? Who benefited from economic growth and expanding trade? How did government and private entrepreneurs contribute to economic development? Assessment will be primarily based on papers analyzing the assigned readings and in class discussion.

HIST 233: Latinx Chicago This course explores the histor y of Chicago's diverse Latinx communities from 1900 to the present. We focus on Mexican and Puerto Rican Chicagoans, but students also have the opportunity to explore other communities. We examine migration experiences and community formation in Chicago ne ighborhoods, and how Latinx communities have understood their own identity. We study how Latinx groups organized social and political movements for empowerment; engaged in struggles around employment, education, and housing; and confronted policing, deport ation, and displacement. Through these efforts, Latinx communities shaped public policy at the local and national level. Finally, we investigate how race, ethnicity, gender, class, and religion have been understood within Latinx communities and have shaped their experiences in the city. No prerequisites.

HIST 241: Charlemagne & the Forging of Europe 300 years after the \"fall of Rome,\" a barbarian named Charlemagne was crowned emperor and a renewal of imperial forms and governance transpired in western Europe. This course unearths the circumstances that led to the rise, spread, and fall of the first medieval pan -European empire, from the collapse o f western Roman power in the fifth century to the collapse of Carolingian power at the end of the ninth. We examine how the Latin Christian church and barbarian kings preserved and transformed aspects of Roman life; how a family of usurpers from northern E urope came to dominate the former western provinces; how colonization and imperialism within Europe prefigured the expansion of European colonizers across the globe; how both elites and commoners experienced a Carolingian world; how the experiences of free and unfree persons shaped these communities; and how the idea of Europe itself was forged within the crucible of Charlemagne's empire.

HIST 258: History of Sports This course offers students an introduction to the history of modern sports from multiple perspectives: athletes themselves, spectators and fans, and the business of sports entertainment. The course begins in the l ate- nineteenth century when sports became increasingly important both as an individual activity and as a 458 professional, commercial spectacle. How has the experience of being a fan changed over time? How has sports shaped gender identities and ideals? How ha ve athlete unions and associations negotiated with business owners and leagues? Why have sports and athletes been at the center of debates over racial justice? As a speaking intensive class, students will give a series of presentations on their own sports experiences and interests in the history of sports. No prerequisites (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism and Speaking requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) HIST 308: Sport and Spectacle Modern America This course considers the history of sport as mass entertainment from the mid -nineteenth century to the present. More than an escape from everyday life, the games Americans have played and watched have been thick with social, cultural, and political meanings. Athletes and spectators alike have defined and challenged ideas of gender, race, and the body; they have worked out class antagonisms, expressed national identities, and promoted social change. Topics include: the co nstruction of race; definitions of manhood and womanhood; industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of modern spectator sport; media and mass spectacle; fitness and athletic reform movements; collegiate athletics; sports figures and social change.

T his course teaches the history of environmental transformations and human adaptation through an exploration of some of the natural disasters and climate changes that impacted Europe and the Mediterranean world c. 300 -1500 CE. Using specific case studies (i ncluding episodes like the so -called \"mystery cloud\" that troubled Levantine communities in 536 and the unusually well -documented 1348 earthquake in central Europe), the course evaluates how medieval people thought about nature, and how moments of crisis s haped individuals, communities, and larger ecosystems.

Students explore texts that illuminate the importance of the body to individual and group identi ty and discuss how these texts' definitions of \"normal\", \"beautiful\", and \"healthy\" bodies continue to wield influence. Among the course's questions: how was the central role of the body in identity (before and after death) shaped by Christian theology of a God who was embodied, suffered, and died? What assumptions were made about how biological sex dictated identity \u2014and how did pre -modern authors reckon with those who fell outside the sex or gender binary? How was spiritual morality understood to be inscri bed on the physical body in complex ways (skin color, physical features, illness, pain, sexual activity)? How did racism and nascent colonialism shape ideals of body size and appearance? Students read primary sources ranging from patristic theology to were wolf stories, as well as important works of scholarship. No prerequisites.

We explore the rise of a burgeoning capitalist economy, the rapidly changing role of government in American society, the rise of the U.S. as an 459 imperial power, and political and social movements that redrew the boundaries of inclusion in American democracy along class, gender, and racial lines. By the mid -twentieth century, a powerful labor movement gained new rights for workers, the Civil Rights Movement overthrew the Jim Crow order, and feminism challenged established gender roles. These challenges to the status quo, however, unleashed a powerful conservative reaction. A central theme of the course is inequality: we explore both the egalitarian movements that reduced social inequality in the mid -twentieth century, as well as the renewed growth of inequality in the last forty years.

Latin American and Lat inx Studies Courses LNAM 120: Beg Portuguese Thru Brazilian Song (Beginning Portuguese Through Brazilian Song.) This introductory course is designed to develop the student's ability to comprehend, speak, read, and write basic controlled patterns of the Por tuguese language. Brazilian 474 music is used as an important tool to reinforce aural and written language acquisition as well as to provide specific cultural context through the examination of historical, social, and political elements of the music. The cours e draws from comparative linguistics to enhance student learning by making explicit connections between Portuguese and other Romance languages (French, Spanish). No prerequisites.

As we delve into the contours and contexts of music scenes across the spectrum from bossa nova to hip hop, we begin to unpack what motivates musicians to create song as well as the meanings that these musicians an d their listening audiences derive from such processes. Students garner essential knowledge about musical expressions in Brazil, including, but not limited to, Carnival, capoeira, country (sertanejo), Afro -Brazilian sacred music (Candombl\u00e9 and Congado). Moreover, the goal of learning about these genres is not only to develop keen playing and listening skills, but also to hone skills in cultural understanding, collaboration, and empathy. To understand how Brazilian music is a site for racial justice, community, and historical struggle is to begin to develop a clear -eyed view of how Brazilians inhabit the social fabric of humani ty in striking and meaningful ways. Learning activities entail lectures, class discussions, guest demonstrations, and student presentations and projects that incorporate creative analysis, writing, and invention. No prerequisites.

Why are women, people of color, and other groups persistently excluded from entrepreneurial resources? How might we make entrepreneurship more inclusive to drive disruptive innovation, help people reach their full potential, and propel positive economic gr owth? This course surveys the deeper (and often hidden) causal factors that have contributed to and reinforced entrepreneurial exclusion. We examine disparities at the macro - and micro -level (i.e., gender, race, sexuality, geography, ability, age) through case studies, reading, hands -on activities, and student research projects. Students propose their own reasoned and researched solutions to address the business case for access and inclusion not as a charitable cause but as an economic imperative. The cours e concludes with students pitching their solutions on how to empower an underrepresented group, increase access to high -quality tools to find problems worth solving for this group and the resources to solve them, and create new channels for revenue from a previously underserved and ignored market.

While Populism does not follow a particular ideology, it is often understood as a set of normative ideas about the nature of society that attaches itself, sometimes is even assimilated, to other ideo logies such as nationalism, liberalism, or socialism. In addition to exploring populism's core principles, this course concentrates on the development of populism in Latin America during the 21st century. This course surveys the leadership and the rise to power of political figures associated to populism in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, and El Salvador. No prerequisites.

MUSC 222: Grateful Dead and American Culture More than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight -Ashbury acid -testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of t he tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jazz to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan -soaked 1980s, and on to the jam -band present. This course will focus on the band's performance of authentic \"Americanness\" throughout its half century run. We'll listen to their music, and also to their fans, enthusiasts, and scholars.

Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often - dead writers become part of our own brain -matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces f rom Jane Austen to Ian McEwan. Moreover, we consider the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" No Prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curric ulum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 249 NEUR 254: The Mind Onstage (The Mind Onstage: Performance, Action, Emotion.) In the last decade, prominent theater scholars have integrated neuroscience research into their studies . Their excitement stems from the realization that current scientific research seems to speak directly to one of the major concerns of theatre scholars for decades: How does performing and/or watching a performance affect the brain? In this interdisciplina ry class, students study plays that depict neuroscience and neurological conditions, learn about how theatre is used therapeutically, and read contemporary and classic theatrical theory, as we explore the ways science and the humanities can intersect. No p rerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) cross listed: THTR 254 NEUR 268: Music and the Mind In this course, we wrestle with fundamental questions regarding music and the human ex perience. Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"Mozart Effect?\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a si ngle human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music.

To allow students flexibility, there are two approaches to completing a Philosophy major. Students may (1) complete a traditional major or (2 ) concentrate on their particular philosophical interests or focus on courses that make connections to other studies. Courses taken Pass -Fail may count towards the major or minor in Philosophy. The requirements for the traditional major are: 1. Core Courses: Philosophy 156: Logic and Styles of Argument Three of the following five courses: o Philosophy 290: Ancient Philosophy o Philosophy 291: Descartes to Kant o Philosophy 320: Back to the Themselves: Husserl, Heidegger, and Derrida Philosophy 322: Hegel to Nietzsche o Philosophy 355: Wittgenstein and the Analytic Tradition Philosophy 325: Major Ethical Theories One of the following courses: o Philosophy 305: South Asian Philosophy o Philosophy 340: Philosophy Born of Struggle: Introduction to African American Ph ilosophy o Philosophy 350: The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful: Introduction to African Philosophy 2. Electives: At least 2 additional Philosophy courses 3. Senior Studies: Philosophy 573 The Senior Studies Requirement can be fulfilled in any of the following ways: o Senior seminar o Independent research project o Senior thesis Option to develop a more focused major: Students who would like to focus more exclusively on a particular area of philosophy may (in consultation with their advisor and with the approval of the chair) subs titute up to two different Philosophy courses for any of the Core Courses. Students can focus, for example, on (1) ethics, political philosophy, or social justice, (2) philosophy across cultures, or (3) metaphysics and philosophy of mind. Courses expecte d for various career interests: Philosophy is a valuable major for students interested in law school, not simply because issues about the law often emerge in philosophical discussion, but because the analytic, reading, and writing skills developed through the study of Philosophy are essential for success in law careers. Students interested in law school should take Phil 156 (logic) no later than their junior year. Note that students interested in law school should take Phil 156 even if they develop a major focusing on courses in law and political philosophy. Philosophy majors may also consider other graduate programs, e.g., MBA or MAT. Some undergraduate course work in fields related to these areas is important. A philosophy major serves students interest ed in graduate work in cultural studies or arts criticism; these students should take aesthetics, philosophy of literature, or philosophy of film. (Philosophy majors have often earned second majors, e.g., in Business or Economics. Those interested in Ele mentary Education can earn their second major in Philosophy.) Students interested in graduate school in Philosophy should complete a traditional major, including courses focusing on the approaches they seek to study: Students considering graduate school i n Philosophy should take Phil 290, 291, and 322. For students interested in Continental philosophy, Phil 320 and/or some independent work in 20th century Continental approaches is essential. For students interested in analytic programs (the majority of gr aduate programs in the United States), coverage of 20th century analytic philosophy, in Phil 355, is needed. Phil 294 and 296 can also be considered. Further, some advanced work in logic (instead of or in addition to Phil 156) would be appropriate. Requir ements for the Minor: At least 6 credits no more than 2 courses at the 100 -level at least 2 courses at the 300 -level Students considering a minor in Philosophy are encouraged to speak to a member of the Department, to plan their programs. Learning Outcome s The expected Student Learning Outcomes for the Philosophy Department are: 1. Philosophy majors will be able to express themselves effectively and conscientiously, with rigor and fairness, in spoken and written forms that seek and promote respectful and fruitful dialogue on substantive and controversial issues. 2. Philosophy majors will be able to demonstrate perseverance and success in comprehending difficult texts and following the main lines of argument, including a basic understanding of logic and the ability to make sense of a number of diverse methodologies associated with philosophical positions. 574 3. Philosophy majors will be able to demonstrate familiarity with important periods in the history of philosophy, including important thinkers from the Eas tern and Western traditions and a recognition of the ways different cultures have engaged in philosophical pursuits which then inform students' reflections on, e.g., what really exists, the nature of the human condition, concepts of social justice and the responsibilities of global citizenship, and the rational, emotional, and aesthetic dimensions of human existence. 4. Philosophy majors will develop a degree of expertise on specific philosophical themes of particular interest to them that demonstrate a rea l excitement, insight, and love for philosophical texts and debate. 5. Philosophy majors will be able to engage in creative philosophical efforts that assess and build on a body of foundational knowledge and ultimately develop their own insights and argume nts. Philosophy Courses PHIL 110: Introduction to Philosophy (Introduction to Philosophy: Classical Questions.) Examination of perennial philosophical issues, such as questions about the nature of reality and how we can know it, discussions of human nature, the meaning of life, and our moral responsibilities. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) PHIL 112: Civilization and Barbarism This course examines the issue of vi olence and its relation to cultural rules and principles. We look at violence from two angles: its destructive and generating power and the rich cultural meanings it reveals. We look at civilization as a system of rules that govern human conduct united und er a highly selective set of guiding principles. The central theme of this course is to study how the pressure of violence will give rise to different rules of human conduct subsumed under a few major principles. We will study those rules and principles through the actions in order to gain a basic understanding of the fundamental ways culture and civilization shape human behavior. Not open to students who have taken FIYS 182. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets th e Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 114: Introduction to Global Philosophies This course studies how various philosophies around the world configure the composition of the universe and the place of humans within that composition. With an understanding of how humans stand in relation to nature, divinity, or evil, we are able to locate how these philosophies' insights impact categorically human pursuits, such as knowledge, morality, and governance. We study texts from Hindu, Buddhist, Daoist, Confucian, Native American Indigenous, Africana, and postcolonial LatinX traditions. In addition to discussing these traditions directly, we also address methodological topics relating to objectivity, cultural r elativism, and colonial hegemony. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 117: Political Phi losophy By tracing the development of political philosophy from its roots in Greek philosphy through the social contract tradition to modern liberalism and critiques of colonialism, this course will examine a number of questions central to political philos ophy. What is the state? What model of government is best? What is the nature of political rights? How do governments gain legitimate authority? Readings will include Socrates, Plato, Locke, Mill, Marx, Martin Luther King Jr., Rawls, Nozick, Chomsky, Churc hill, and Galeano. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 118: Why Philosophy Matters We will examine e thical issues related to topics like killing, family, sex, race relations, and the state. Some of the questions we will explore include: Is killing in war wrong? Is abortion wrong? Is prostitution wrong? Is same -sex 575 marriage wrong? Are reparations for slav ery wrong? We will not only learn why philosophy matters when it comes to those views we hold most dear, but we will also learn how philosophers argue for their views and, in turn, how we should go about arguing for our own. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 120: BK's Finest: JAY -Z and Philosophy (Brooklyn's Finest: JAY -Z and Philosophy.) From growing up in the Marcy Pr ojects in Brooklyn to selling out concerts at Madison Square Garden, JAY -Z has become a global hip -hop icon. Besides being the first rap artist to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and holding the record for the most number one albums by a solo artist, JAY -Z's body of work stands as a monumental contribution to American culture. In this course, we explore the poetics and philosophy of JAY -Z's music. As we cultivate an artistic appreciation for JAY -Z's rap skills such as storytelling, wordplay, a nd delivery, we also treat his music as an opportunity to critically engage topics such as racism, sexism, and economic inequality. Finally, we watch several of JAY -Z's music videos as well as documentaries focused on his life and work. No prerequisites. .

This course considers arguments for and against the existence of God, as well as the resources and methods those arguments use. After some discussion of logic and argumentation, we will consider questions such as: how could one demonstrate that God does or does not exist? What would constitute 'proof' of such a claim? How are faith and reason working for similar or opposed ends in such arguments? What does the character of arguments for or against God's existence say about human life and thought? To address these questions, we will consider the works of theologians and philosophers from monotheistic traditions. (U nder the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: RELG 223 PHIL 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues such as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a 'true' scientific theory, the basis of observation, a nd empirical knowledge.

(Under t he Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 233: Philosophy of Sport This course will consider a host of philosophical issues that ari se as one ponders sport in general and sports in particular, ranging from definitional questions (e.g., what is a sport?), through general value theory (e.g., is sport valuable, and if so, in what way or ways - and to whom?), to questions of applied ethics and public policy (e.g., 577 what is the justification, if any, for allowing athletes to shorten their life expectancies - sometimes quite dramatically - for the sake of glory or pay or both?). Although many of the questions we will consider may seem simple a t first - what for example, is the significance of winning, if any? - on reflection they reveal themselves to be deep and puzzling. The course will thus provide us with a concrete gate through which to access thorny philosophical questions about the nature of - and the complex interplay among - luck, effort, desert, intention, and result.

PHIL 235: Philo sophy & 1960s Popular Culture This course offers a demanding tour through the intellectual milieu of the 1960s in the United States. We will read philosophical works, social theory, popular and literary fiction, and occasional pieces of various sorts (spee ches, journalism, etc.); we will watch films and television shows; we will listen to music: all with the goal of figuring out not just how people in the 1960s were thinking, but also of understanding how philosophy and popular culture reflected and refract ed each other during a particular - and particularly volatile - historical moment. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 242: Cata strophe & Risk: Phil Insurance (Catastrophe and Risk: The Philosophy of Insurance.) This course examines the institution of insurance philosophically. Beginning with a consideration of the problem of induction, and ranging over philosophical discourses about miracles, apocalypse, and the nature of prediction, the course ponders the ways in which the concept of rationality is shaped, both by our knowledge and by our ignorance. The course explores the concepts of risk and luck, considering the extent to wh ich political and social institutions can and should be used as risk - pooling devices to soften the effects of catastrophe and to buffer the effects of luck. We also pay some attention to insurance law, to the relationship between entrepreneurial projection s and actuarial calculations, and to representations of insurance in literature and film. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 245: Philosophy of Humans and Animals Western philosophers since Arist otle - at least - have claimed that human beings, as a species and alone among species, are capable of complex reasoning. From that premise, they have inferred a wide range of ethical and religious claims, e.g., it is ethically permissible to eat non -human animals. Alternative claims, however, have just as long a history, and in the last twenty or so years there has been a boom in the study of non -human animals and the relationships between humans and non -human animals. Not open to students who have taken P hil 420: Philosophy of Humans and Animals. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 250: Philosophy of Religion This course is an introd uction to the philosophy of religion. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of religious experience, ritual, prayer, and sacred books in articulating the idea of God. Course includes a philosophical encounter with mysticism as well as the more traditio nal metaphysical formulations of the divine, in both the West and East. The critical concern of a variety of rational skepticisms will also be examined. No prerequisites.

We pay special attention to the normative, metaphysical, and conceptual problems and solutions that inform philosophical race theory. Some of the key questions we answer include the following: Is race a natural kind, a social kind, or something else entirely? What does philosophy have to contribute to the study of race and racism? What is the relationship between race and racism? We draw on readings from the history of philosophy, mainstream analytic philosophy, and recent European philosophy. Ultimately, the aim of this course is to provide students with a philosophical toolkit that will allow them to engage in civil and inf ormed critical discussions about the nature and consequences of race talk and the practice of racism.

His films ch allenge the stereotypes and paternalistic assumptions about African Americans that have become sacrosanct in America's popular imagination. We will explore how the aesthetic representation of race, class, and gender in Spike Lee's filmography have helped c reate a new genre of film called African American noir. In so doing, we will watch several of Spike Lee's films, documentary projects, and television ads. Ultimately, our goal will be to appreciate Lee's cinematic technique, examine his critique of white s upremacy, and consider the cultural and historical events that have shaped his artistic vision.

We study a variety of theoretical frameworks, including classical liberal theory, postcolonial critiques, and local philosophies of indigenous communities. M oreover, we consider the effects of each framework on various claims to identity, whether of an individual person, a group, community, institution, place, or state. We then attempt to apply these frameworks to a number of real -world cases to better underst and how rights are deployed and denied in practice. No prerequisites.

PHIL 301: Romantic Comedies & Phil of Love (Romantic Comedies and Phi losophy of Love) Why do we like to watch romantic comedies? What's satisfying about them, even when they're not great films? Film theorist Leo Braudy claimed that 'genre [film] ... always involves a complex relation between the compulsions of the past and th e freedoms of the present. ... [They] affect their audience ... by their ability to express the warring traditions in society and the social importance of understanding convention.' In this course, following Braudy, we will investigate the relationship between the film genre of romantic comedy and age -old thinking about love, marriage, and romance. We'll read some ancient and modern philosophy of love, as well as some relevant film theory, and watch and discuss an array of romantic comedies, trying to unpack wh at we really believe about love. Prerequisite: One Philosophy course or permission of the instructor. ('Genre: The Conventions of Connection,' Film Theory and Criticism, eds. Leo Braudy and Marshall Cohen. New York: Oxford U.

PHIL 330: History and Philosophy of Slavery An examination of American slavery and its aftermath from the slave ship to the Age of Neo -slavery. We will read slave narratives, historical accounts of slavery, and philosophical interpretations of slavery from the black radical tradition and contemporary philosophy. All three approaches will provide us with multip le angles from which to consider the institution of slavery and America's supposed commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. On the whole, our aim will be to wrestle with the tortured logic that is the tragic contradiction of American slav ery and American freedom.

African -American philosophy can be defined in two ways: (1) wide -ranging philosophical work done by Americans of recent black African descent and (2) philosophical work on the lived experience of Americans of recent black African descent. We will primarily read philosophers whose philosophical work emphasizes the African -American experience. Thematic ally, the course will be guided by one overriding question: Given the historical reality of the Atlantic Slave Trade, the Three -Fifths Compromise, the anti -miscegenation laws, the Fugitive Slave Law, Lynch Law, and the Jim Crow laws, among many other inhum ane practices, how does the experience of Africans in America constitute a unique combination of philosophical perspectives? Once we answer this question, we will understand how the African -American experience has created a new tradition in Western philoso phy.

This course explores these and other big existentialist questions through the lens of the novel, focusing especially on novelists from the nineteenth and twentieth century. Within the course, we compare and contrast m ajor existentialist perspectives as well as examining significant critiques of existentialism. We also consider the unique possibilities afforded by the genre of the novel in exploring philosophical questions. Possible authors include 582 Kierkegaard, Dostoevs ky, Tolstoy, Camus, and Murdoch.

Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ENGL 341 PHIL 352: Topics in Social Justice Examination of a particular issue in social just ice, through a research project. Common elements of the course will include examinations of theoretical issues and debates, allowing students to select from a range of possible research topics. Significant time will be devoted to periodic student reports o n their projects. Prerequisite: Ethics Center/Philosophy 276 or 277 or permission of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Domestic Pluralism requirement.) PHIL 355: Wittgenstein & Analytic Tradition A brisk and dema nding tour through the analytic tradition in philosophy, from its beginnings around 1880 with the pathbreaking work of Frege in logic and in the philosophy of language, through the empiricist reception of that work in England (Russell, Moore), the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle (Carnap, Neurath), and ordinary language philosophy (Austin, Ryle), until the tradition proper begins to break up around 1960. The course emphasizes epistemological, metaphysical, and linguistic concerns, with some attention to issues in logic and in the philosophy of science. The central figure of Wittgenstein provides the organization backbone of the course. In addition to the work of philosophers already mentioned, the course may also consider the work of Mach, Brentano, A yer, Popper, Strawson, Quine, Sellars, and Putnam, among others. No prerequisite, but the prior completion of PHIL 156 is strongly recommended. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 365: Race, Gender & Sexual Orientation In this class we will examine a number of questions concerning the reality, or metaphysics, of social identities. When people speak of race, are they referring to something biological or something social? Are the gender roles of men and women shaped more b y genetic forces or social forces? Is there a 'gay gene'? Does sexual orientation have a genetic basis? After examining recent literature on the metaphysics of social kinds, we will examine the recent debates surrounding the nature of race, gender, and sex ual orientation. Possible readings will include: Foucault, Searle, Hacking, DuBois, Appiah, Taylor, Sundstrom, Butler, and Longino. Prerequisite: at least one philosophy class or instructor's permission. . (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humaniti es and Cultural Diversity requirements.) PHIL 375: Neuroethics Neuroethics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that incorporates the findings of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and philosophy to tackle key ethical issues in science, philosophy, heal th, and medicine. In this discipline, we explore two primary areas of study. The first is the neuroscience of ethics, which asks what current research in neuroscience and related fields can tell us about ethics. The second is the ethics of neuroscience, which asks how the study of ethics can inform emerging technologies and findings from the rapidly developing field of neuroscience. This course introduces students to both areas of research. As such, the course investigates a variety of questions related to free will, moral reasoning, memory, neuroenhancement, neuromarketing, cognitive enhancement, and how the law deals with these issues. Prerequisite: at least one 100 - level course in philosophy, neuroscience, or psychology, or permission from the instructor . (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 375 583 PHIL 380: Topics PHIL 386: Neurophilosophjy This course familiarizes students with topics in neurophilosophy \u2014i.e., the application of concep ts and findings in neuroscience to traditional questions in philosophy. This course explores a range of such applications. For instance, what can the behavior of patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex tell us about theories of intention ality? What are the implications of neurological syndromes for the concept of a unified self? What can eye tracking teach us about causation? Can results from EEG studies inform theories of free will? This course reviews some of the newest methods and find ings from neuroscience, primarily cognitive neuroscience, and apply these findings to some of the major questions in philosophy. Prerequisite: PHIL 130, PSYC 110, or permission from the instructor. PHIL 410: Major Philosophers (Spring 2018 Major Philosophe rs: Hobbes.) In this course, we will examine, in detail, Thomas Hobbes's arguments for a new conception of politics, put forth in his 1651 classic, Leviathan . Hobbes sought to inaugurate a modern science of politics, rejecting notions of legitimacy rooted in codes of honor, in divine revelation, or in Aristotelian human nature, arguing instead for a notion of political authority arising from universal human fear. We will consider how the goals of Hobbesian politics --peace and security --are related to Hobbes 's commitments to nominalism, to materialism, and to secularism. We will also ponder the vexed question of Hobbes's relationship to liberalism. Although our focus will be on Leviathan, which we will read entire, we will make some attempt to situate Hobbes historically, and we will also discuss the influence of Hobbes on the theory of international relations and on contemporary political philosophy (e.g., Gautier, Hampton, Skyrms). Prerequisites:Three PHIL courses or consent of the instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 420: Plato: Eros, Sexuality, & Memory Fall 2016 Topic: Plato: Eros, Sexuality, & Memory. This course offers an in -depth look into Plato's concept of eros and his understanding of culture as a pursui t of knowledge, as the dynamic, communicative exchanges between equal and reciprocating citizens. A key topic has to do with the issue of memory (the vehicle of cultural transmissions) and the multifaceted impact on human condition from the proliferation o f mnemotechnologies, such as writing (for Plato) and internet (for us). The general concern is quite basic: how shall we live and how shall we adapt to the world of iPhones and internet. Our focus will be on Plato's Phaedrus and Symposium, along with essay s from other perspectives, such as those by Joseph Ledoux (a neuroscientist of the memory of fear) and Larry Squire (a memory psychologist), as well as excerpts from French philosophers Bernard Stiegler and Derrida. (Under the old GEC, this course meets th e Humanities requirement.) PHIL 430: Plato, Kant, Freud In this seminar, we study Plato, Immanuel Kant, and Sigmund Freud in some depth, analyzing similarities and differences in their conceptions of mind, motivation, and action. Plato claims that the soul has three parts, which resemble Freudian components of the mind. Kant also takes the mind to have three faculties. All three thinkers, moreover, believe that this tripartite structure is the key to understanding human motivation and action. Others have no ted these similarities: Alfred Tauber, for example, claims that \"Psychoanalysis . . rests upon a basic claims that Plato and Kant share a \"Constitutional Model\" of the soul, whereby \"deliberative action by i ts very nature imposes unity on the will.\" This course explores the similarities between the perspectives of these philosophers that on the surface seem very different. Prerequisite: Two philosophy courses or permission of the instructor. PHIL 440: Nietzsc he Nietzsche's influence on the present age is undeniable. Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel, wrote the following to his wife in 1902: \"I am sending you Nietzsche: learn to read and understand him. This is the best and the finest thing I can send you.\" The composer Richard Strauss named his symphonic poem after Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Even Freud reluctantly acknowledged his debt to the German philosopher. This course 584 examines the philosophical, religious, and literary influences on Niet zsche's thought as well as his affirmative response and alternative to traditional morality. Some of the key questions we answer include: What is the doctrine of the \"will to power\"? Who or what is an \u00dcbermensch? What is the eternal recurrence of the same? Prerequisites: Two philosophy courses or permission of the instructor. PHIL 460: Cogn. Science & Experim. Philosophy (Cognitive Science and Experimental Philosophy.) This course introduces students to Experimental Philosophy. This area of philosophy uses the methods of cognitive science to conduct quantitative research in order to investigate philosophical questions. Experimental philosophers might ask, for instance, if there is something essential to the self over time, if judgments to philosophical thoug ht experiments are culturally universal and representative, or if the consideration of alternative possibilities affects how we think about causation, intentionality, and free will. The course surveys work in Experimental Philosophy \u2014on the topics of intent ionality, free will, consciousness, morality, causation, the true self, and more \u2014and considers the potential limitations of this approach to philosophy. Prerequisite: At least one 200 -level course in philosophy, neuroscience, or psychology, or permission f rom the instructor.

PHIL 480: Heidegger's Being and Time This course is a reading - and writing -inten sive study of Heidegger's major philosophical work Being and Time, published in 1927. Major themes to be explored include his relationship to Greek philosophy, ecstatic temporality, the question of the meaning of Being, his view of death, and the phenomeno logical method. We may also study Heidegger's 1924 The Concept of Time and parts of his 1927 lecture course The Basic Problems of Phenomenology. Prerequisites: Three PHIL courses or consent of the instructor. PHIL 490: Sr Symposium & Research Project Indep endent research plus discussions of that research in meetings of seniors and faculty.

(Students writing a thesis over two semesters would register for regular th esis credit in the semester without the symposium.) Open to senior majors. PHIL 275: Desire and Discipline: Asian Morals This course offers a focused historical narrative of the development of Asian moral thinking. It shows, at its early phase, how a parti cular moral philosopher's thinking (such as Mencius and Xun -zi) is largely determined by his thinking on human nature. However, in later periods, particularly after the importation of Buddhism, the debates on human nature are replaced by an intense cogniti ve and metaphysical interest in the human mind. Moral cultivation begins to focus less on following moral rules but more on cultivating the mind. The effect of this nature -mind shift on Asian moral thinking is both historically profound and theoretically s urprising. Readings: Confucius, Mencius, Xun -zi, Lao zi, Zhuang zi, Zhang Zai, Chen Brothers, Zhu Xi and D. T. Suzuki. No prerequisites.

Unde r the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) cross listed: ASIA 275, IREL 285 PHIL 212: Multicultural Approaches Environmnt The central theme of this course is Humans and Nature. We will examine various motifs in th e creation myths from different cultures, the images of man and woman, the theme of primeval flood or its absence, the alienation of humans from nature, and the beliefs (e.g., Chinese numerology) in the synchronicity between human affairs and natural event s. We will search for answers to the following typical questions: What is the definition of 585 environment? What is and ought to be the relation between humans and nature? What count as 'environmental issues' and what are their possible solutions? No prerequi sites.

How exactly do such ap peals work, and when are they justified? This class considers the nature, role, and justification of authority. Although our emphasis is on political and legal authority, we pay some attention to authority in other contexts, both institutional and informal , and though our emphasis is on authority as a reason for action, we also pay some attention to authority as a reason for belief. In exploring these issues, we consider a number of thinkers both classical and contemporary, including, but not limited to, Pl ato, Aquinas, Hobbes, Wittgenstein, Arendt, Hart, and Raz. Prerequisites: Two Philosophy courses or consent of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Senior Studies requirements.) PHIL 296: Philosop hy of Mind With the rise of Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Neuroscience, questions about the nature of mind have become increasingly important, and in the last 40 years much work on philosophy of mind has been done in analytic philosophy. The cla ss will begin with an examination of some of the most influential texts in philosophy of mind from the last 50 years, and then proceed to current topics. Central questions may include: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Is it possible to offer explanations of mental states by reducing them to biological, chemical, or physical states? Can human consciousness be best explained in terms of a computer model? Is it possible to describe the functioning of human thought in terms of a rule -based system of processing? No prerequisites.

PHIL 114: Introduction to Global Phi losophies This course studies how various philosophies around the world configure the composition of the universe and the place of humans within that composition. With an understanding of how humans stand in relation to nature, divinity, or evil, we are ab le to locate how these philosophies' insights impact categorically human pursuits, such as knowledge, morality, and governance. We study texts from Hindu, Buddhist, Daoist, Confucian, Native American Indigenous, Africana, and postcolonial LatinX traditions . In addition to discussing these traditions directly, we also address methodological topics relating to objectivity, cultural relativism, and colonial hegemony. No prerequisites.

Students who have tried to complete a physics major starting in their sophomore year have run into significant problems, primari ly because the upper -level requirements are offered in alternate years. PHYS 120/121 is recommended for science majors. If there are scheduling conflicts, PHYS 110 may be substituted for PHYS 120, and PHYS 111 may be substituted for PHYS 121. This change is not acceptable for engineering, however . Both courses have the same laboratories. PHYS 110/111 is not much easier than PHYS 120/121. MATH 110/111 can be taken with PHYS 120/121. Occasionally, \"advanced\" first -year students have sufficient experience in physics to skip the 100 -level courses. This is most easily confirmed by a score of 4 or 5 on a relevant Advanced Placement examination. Please consult a department member for placement of such students. Typically, the correct courses to take are PHYS 21 0 and MATH 210 in the fall, and PHYS 250 and MATH 214 (if offered) in the spring. Learning Outcomes 1. Laws of physics. A large fraction of observed phenomena in the physical universe is accurately described by a small number of laws. Centuries of observation , analysis and logic built the present set of equations that embody these laws. Students see the fundamental ideas of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics and quantum theory; these ideas are not so much the application of the laws as a discussion of the meaning of the laws. 2. Problem solving. Breaking down complex situations into essential and manageable pieces is useful for almost everyone, and crucial for working physicists. This distillation allows the laws of physics to be applied to speci fic problems, and a well -organized report of the solution to be created. 3. Measurement making. Although physicists hope the laws of physics are \"mathematically, philosophically and esthetically complete,\" their key utility follows from careful and successful comparison with experiment. This builds confidence in the predictive power of physics. Physics Courses PHYS 101: Astronomy: The Dynamic Universe The universe is constantly changing.

The \"elite\" include career government officials, the media, and the very wealthy who command political power and use it to their advantage. By contrast, \"the people,\" who are law -abiding an d hard -working citizens struggling to make ends meet, are essentially powerless and therefore ruled over and manipulated by an elite -controlled, out -of-touch government. Often associated with other ideologies, such as socialism, liberalism, and nationalism , populism advocates the empowerment of the people, whose righteousness will democratize politics and redirect the institutions of the state to serve the \"general will.\" In addition to exploring populism's core tenets from an ideational perspective, this c ourse surveys core themes of populism that are found in the various sub -fields of political science (theory, American politics, comparative politics, and international relations). By doing so, it also considers populism's impact on politics and government within liberal democratic countries - developed, post - communist, and developing, as well as these countries' external relations. It also considers political reforms these countries might pursue to meet populism's challenge to liberal democracy. No prerequi sites.

It is therefore obviously worthy of serious study. In this course, we undertake such a study in real -time. But rather than merely track the day to day machinations of the campaign, our goal will be to t ry and analyze the situation as a political scientist would. As examples, we will ask: What is the 'invisible' primary and can it be measured? To what extent do party rules concerning the nomination contest shape the ultimate outcome? What are the most suc cessful tactics and strategies for persuading voters and building a winning coalition? Prerequisite: POLS 120 or permission of instructor.

We must distribute goods, determine crimes, give punishments, and create legislative districts, all with an eye to some idea of justice. Is justice fairness? Proportional? Equitable? Different political and legal theorists have approached these questions differently. Using both traditional political theory texts and contemporary legal theory, we will explore questions of justice and the law and whether justice can be found within the law or is external to it. Readings include those by Plato, Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke, Thoreau, Mill, King, Rawls, Gunier, and contemporary legal theorists. Prerequisite: POLS 130 or consent of instructor.

POLS 352: Liberalism and Its Critics Modern political thought is based on ideas of equality, individuality and individual liberty, private property, and an overall idea of progress. These ideas developed especially in the thinking of Locke, Smith, and Mill. But as modernism grew, so did its critics. The course covers some basic theories of modernism through readings in the liberal tradition. It also considers opposition to liberalism as found in the writings of Burke, Rousseau, Tocquev ille, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Marcuse, Arendt, and contemporary anti - and postmodernists. Prerequisite: POLS 130 or consent of instructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 353: Topics in Political Theory (POLS 353 Topics in Political Theory: The Social Contract) Throughout the history of political thought, the metaphor of the social contract, or the idea that the consent of individuals is necessary for the formation of legitimate government, has been widely used to justify and/or criticize certain institutional arrangements. This course will be an examination of this metaphor. We will try to come to terms with both its philosophical appeal as well as its historical relevancy. In addition to reading classic texts of those like Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Rawls, we will also compare the models of these authors with actual processes of constitutional formation including the American Founding. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 3 54: Identity Politics It is hard to observe recent politics without noticing the seeming central importance of identity and identity - based claims made both by citizens and politicians to press their respective agendas. In this course, we examine this pheno menon thoroughly and critically via an interdisciplinary approach. While our focus is largely on the 612 contemporary United States, we also engage with analogous international cases. While we approach this topic historically, empirically, and theoretically, o ur main goal is to assess what kinds of identity -based claims (if any) are best suited for the healthy functioning of a liberal and diverse democracy.

Our examination begins with President Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. It continues with his successor, Richard Nixon, who, according to some people, epitomizes the concentration of executive power. Though Nixon's resignation signals the end of an 'imperial presidency,' under President Reagan the executive branch's consolidation of power is renewed. The experiences of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s are a backdrop for the study of the expansion of executive power under Presidents George W. Bush an d Barack Obama. Prerequisite: POLS 120 or permission of instructor. Open to Politics majors and minors in the third or fourth year.

POLS 481: Global Governance (Senior Seminar in Global Politics/International Relations: Global Governance.) In this senior seminar, politics and international relations majors survey the theories of international institutions, both inter -governmental and non - governmental, focusing on how they emerge and function, as well as their effect on international relations processes and outcomes. Also central to the course are in -depth case studies of international instituti ons in diplomacy as well as issue areas like security, economics, the environment, health, and human rights. Special emphasis is placed on the role of institutions in fostering governance and cooperation at the global level in the absence of a system of hi gher political authority above states (i.e., world government).

Affirmative action in employment and education is one of the most controversial issues of our time. As such, it transects many subfields of political science: political theory, American political institutions, elections, law and constitutionalism, public opinion, comparative politics. Affirmative action polic ies bring to light American attitudes toward race, gender, sexual identity, and ethnicity. The course begins with a study of the foundational legal, ethical and political issues of affirmative action. Students then pursue their own, specialized projects on the topic.

Do liberal democracies conduct their external relations differently than dictatorships? If so, how, why, and to what result? These questions tak en together constitute a central focus of international relations scholarship. This course finds its intellectual foundations in Immanuel Kant's thesis that liberal democracies at once enjoy a 'separate peace' amongst themselves and act belligerently towar d dictatorships. Students in this senior seminar survey a rich literature on the 'democratic peace' thesis through the lenses of realist, liberal, and constructivist international relations theory, through reference to in -depth case studies and large -scale data analysis. In their seminar papers, students apply these theories and methods to their research on current foreign policies issues among democracies and between democracies and dictatorships. Prerequisite: Open to international relations and politics juniors and seniors only. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 484: Searches, Seizures, and Security (Senior Seminar in American P olitics and Law: Searches, Seizures, and Security). The right against government intrusion into our lives is one of our most cherished freedoms found in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution. The framers believed that agents of government sh ould not enter private homes or search personal 615 property without justification. Yet now, government entities and corporations have access to our personal information raising questions of how current law, politics, and security issues at home and abroad res hape constitutional boundaries of our right to privacy. This course begins with a study of the Fourth Amendment and constitutional rights and limitations of search and seizure and continues with a review of current law affecting our national security. This course is a capstone course for politics majors and students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of the instructor.

POLS 485: Constitutional Change (Senior Seminar in American Politics & Law: Constitutional Change). While the United States may have the oldest written Constitution i n the world, it has been subject to nearly constant change since the moment it was ratified. In addition to formal amendments including the Bill of Rights, our constitutional institutions and culture have been significantly modified and affected by Supreme Court opinions, presidential decisions, legislative constructions, and even citizen -based protest movements. In this seminar, we explore the question of how constitutional change has actually happened in our nation's past, and assess whether some of these procedures and mechanisms of change are better or worse than others. We will then conclude by evaluating a variety of contemporary proposals for constitutional reform. Students will thereby be invited to think both descriptively and morally about the hist ory and future of American constitutionalism. As a capstone course for politics majors, students will pursue their own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Politics senior or consent of instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curri culum, this course meets the Speaking requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) POLS 486: Global Justice (Senior Seminar in Global Politics: Global Justice.) Virtually all of the major pressing and controversial deb ates in international politics revolve on some level around questions of justice: When is humanitarian intervention justified? Are certain tactics of war morally unjustifiable? Are human rights universal ideals that should apply everywhere, or should they be limited by certain cultural and/or religious traditions? How should distributive justice work at the global level? Does justice require that rich countries allow for more immigration? Do we need a world state? In this senior seminar, students will probe these and other questions. We will examine these issues from a variety of perspectives, including ones that are skeptical about the very idea of 'global justice.' As a capstone course for politics and international relations majors, students will pursue t heir own specialized research projects on the topic. Prerequisite: Junior or senior politics and/or international relations majors, or consent of instructor.

POLS 487: Money, Inequality and Power This course investigates some of the ways that money may (or may not) increase inequality in American politics. Money is very unequal ly distributed in America today. We discuss how income or wealth inequality affects our democracy, and how we can tell. Since the Supreme Court has set down complex rules governing the use of money in politics, we also discuss what can be done to address i nequality even if it does produce undesirable results. In this course, students explore many other important and fascinating issues at the intersection of money and politics. The topic intersects with many areas of politics: political theory, American poli tical institutions, law and constitutionalism, and campaigns and elections. It allows students the opportunity to select, for intense study, an area of special interest pertaining to the above themes.

POLS 236: Religion and Politics in the US A This course focuses on the ways religion has been a source of political division and unity in America. Polls indicate that America is, by far, the most religious of industrial democracies and that our contentious political debates are, in large part, due to the religious dimensions of m orally evocative issues like abortion and gay marriage, and the firm positions of such constituencies as the Christian Right and new Religious Left. Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage, and temperance drew on scholarly and legal int erpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We examine the role of religion in the founding of the American republic, and in contemporary political movements such as Black Lives Matter, the F ederation for Immigration Reform, and 21st century civil rights organizations, which address issues including prison reform, the environment, and the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

POLS 212: Organized Crime in North America During the 21st Century, organized crime has consolidated as an important political actor in every region of the world. The level of violence in North America, especially in Mex ico, has increased exponentially as a result of the fight for power between the state, criminal organizations, and other non -state armed groups. This fight includes the control of markets, border dominance, and political influence. Criminal organizations h ave infiltrated state institutions, influenced democratic processes, and in some cases established territorial control. This course offers a general understanding of these organizations, their history, and their political role with attention to Mexico and the United States.

Though it will remain the dominant world power for some time to come, most scholars agree that American global preeminence is waning. Yet scholars disagree ab out the effect of this shift on world order. Some see an effort by the United States and its closest allies to prop -up the current American liberal world order of global economic integration and cooperative security. Others envision either a 'post - American ' world in which the United States and rising great powers re -negotiate the ground rules of a new liberal order, or a world in which the United States is one of a small number of great powers competing for power and influence in an illiberal world. Each of these possibilities raises compelling questions about war and peace, and cooperation and discord in twenty -first century international politics. Will this power shift jeopardize the liberal world order? Can this world order persist in the absence of Ameri can preeminence?

Und er the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) PSYC 388: The Malleable Brain (The Malleable Brain: Mechanisms of Neural Plasticity) This course studies the remarkable fact that the brain is malleable or changeable. Neurons are constantl y altering their behavior at a cellular and molecular level to help us learn, remember, and adapt to new situations. This neuronal plasticity is an essential mechanism of the normal functioning brain but, when plasticity is aberrant, disease is likely to o ccur. We will examine the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, probe current techniques utilized by researchers, and evaluate primary research articles. We will consider how plasticity contributes to the learning and encoding of new information throughout th e lifespan, as well as how aberrant plasticity contributes to disorders such as post -traumatic stress, addiction, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. We also will explore how these disorders are currently treated with drugs and therapy. Prerequisites: BIOL 221 and PSYC 110 or permission of the instructor. cross listed: NEUR 388, BIOL 388 PSYC 410: History and Systems of Psych This course overviews psychological thought and methodology from the emergence of the discipline out of philosophy and the natural sciences to the social science we know today. You will learn about prominent psychological theories and methodologies from a historical perspective. A major focus will be on experimental psychology as it began in 19th century German universities and continued in the United States. The other main focus will be on the development of applied fields such as clinical psychology and i ndustrial/organizational 637 psychology. We will read original works by significant historical figures in psychology, as well as papers by historians. Special attention will be given to the recurring controversies that have fueled debate and motivated research on the nature and origins of human behavior and mental processes. In addition, you will be introduced to the process of historiography, i.e. the theory and methods that underlie the research and writing of history.

Two hundred years ago, the vast majority of men and women in the United States only attended a formal school for a few years at most. Many of the functions we associate with schooling - the transmission of knowledge, socialization, and job preparation - took place in the home, community, or workplace. The story of the 19th and 20th century is the story of the expansion of education into a central experience in the lives of Americans, delivered in a vast network of edu cational institutions. By moving thematically through the roles of both K -12 and higher education, this course will examine the processes through which a wide array of social functions moved into the school system, and the modern U.S. educational system wa s forged. A central course theme will be how established forms of social inequality and exclusion were incorporated into and then reproduced by an expanding system of education. No prerequisites.

What changes took place within the movement over time, particularly at the level of leadership? What underlay the radicalization of the movement and what were the consequences? To what extent did the civil rights movement succeed and how do we measure that success today? F inally, how did the black civil rights movement inspire other groups and minorities in American society to organize? Prerequisite: History 200 or History 201.

We learn about the politics of migration, including the long history of anti - immigrant nativism and xenophobia in the United States, as well as the role of migrants in shaping major U.S. social and political movements. We also examine how ethnic, racial, and national identities - including \"American\" -are not fixed categories, but rather constructed and reconstructed over time. No prerequisites.

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have been committed both to protest and disruption in order to advan ce their causes, and to stability, security, and the maintenance of order. Despite widespread fears about disorder and crime today, Americans in the past were far more violent. In this course, we will trace how ordinary people came together to challenge au thority, and how those with power built state structures that could legitimately use violence. We will see how policing was shaped by fears of newly - arrived immigrants, the demands of a slave economy, and entrenched racism. We will study the intersecting histories of race, inequality, and state power across the American past. Students will develop a major research project on a particular historical instance of policing, inequality, and protest. Prerequisite: HIST 200 or HIST 201 or permission of instructor .

PHIL 245: Philosophy of Humans and Animals Western philosophers since Aristotle - at least - have claimed that human beings, as a species and alone among species, are capable of complex reasoning. From that premise, they have inferred a wide range of ethical and religious claims, e.g., it is ethically permissible to eat non -human anim als. Alternative claims, however, have just as long a history, and in the last twenty or so years there has been a boom in the study of non -human animals and the relationships between humans and non -human animals.

Some of the key questions we answer include the following: Is race a natural k ind, a social kind, or something else entirely? What does philosophy have to contribute to the study of race and racism? What is the relationship between race and racism? We draw on readings from the history of philosophy, mainstream analytic philosophy, a nd recent European philosophy. Ultimately, the aim of this course is to provide students with a philosophical toolkit that will allow them to engage in civil and informed critical discussions about the nature and consequences of race talk and the practice of racism.

Policy and industry leaders join regularly to help students hone their analysis in ways that allow for real -world consideration and discussion by policy makers. Teams produce wh ite papers with executive summaries and develop presentations of their analyses. All teams are required to submit their work to the College's annual Public Policy Challenge. White papers are also presented to external policy makers. No prerequisites. (Unde r the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Experiential Learning requirement.) Learning Outcomes Programming Statement The minor in Public Policy Studies emphasizes experiential learning to help students pursue careers in government, non -government organizations, non -profit organizations, and the private sector. The curriculum 659 initially immerses students in issues of the d ay and shows them how to ask important questions and how to evaluate all sides of an issue. Upper -level seminars require students to analyze policy issues for themselves, to use that analysis in the development of policy proposals, and to further consider strategies to implement their proposed solutions. Each faculty member works proactively to create personalized learning opportunities for students, and we engage elected and appointed officials at all levels of government as well as policy stakeholders in order to provide mentorship opportunities for students who wish to pursue particular areas of policy. Lake Forest College also provides regular opportunities for the entire campus community to engage in policy discussions. We sponsor leaders from academic, industry, and government backgrounds to give talks and engage in lively debate on campus. Every student has the opportunity to take a seminar on a topic of particular interest with diverse topics being offered each semester. The College hosts an annual ca mpus -wide competition in which teams of students compete by developing, presenting, and defending their own solution to an urgent societal issue. The College also funds student research and internships. Program Goal 1: Students minoring in public policy w ill be able to perform data -driven cost -benefit analysis of policy issues and proposed solutions.

Malcolm X (el -Hajj Malik el -Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so often put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle \u2014whether it be throu gh the message of non - violence and Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self - defense and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malcolm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular in style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featured by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to d elve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle in America. We look at the creative activist writings of each -speeches, letters, interviews, autobiographical material \u2014and c omplicate what at first seems a simple battle between \"violent\" and \"non -violent\" approaches to liberation.

Historically, public debates concerning abolition, suffrage, and temperance drew on scholarly and legal interpretations of the Constitutional promise of both religious freedom and the separation of church and state. We examine the role of religion in the founding of the American republic, and in contemporary political movements s uch as Black Lives Matter, the Federation for Immigration Reform, and 21st century civil rights organizations, which address issues including prison reform, the environment, and the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

England saw an explosion of spiritual seekers who wrote stories about contacting the dead, communicating telepathically, levitating, reading Tarot cards, experiencing ghostly visions, and participating in occult or spiritual societies. Whil e these writers were enormously popular in their own day, they are historically underrepresented in conventional narratives about the canon of modern British literature. This course aims to recover some of these long -forgotten stories, as 678 we sort through t his Edwardian -era \"attic\" of dust -covered tales, seeking the gems that still puzzle, challenge, or inspire. Our goal will be to understand this \"spiritual renaissance\" and its prime movers; explore the ambiguous borderland between the occult and the mystic al and their relation to orthodox religion; and assess the legacy that this original \"alt lit\" has left for today's spiritual seekers.

RELG 219: Malcolm & Martin (Malcolm & Martin: The Literature of Peace & Resistance.) Malcolm X (el-Hajj Malik el -Shabazz) and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two prominent leaders of the Civil Rights Movement so often put into conversation with each other, have left us a legacy for how we think about social struggle \u2014whether it be through the message of non- violence and Christian love that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached, or through the message of fearless self - defense and resistance \"by any means necessary\" for which Malcolm X came to be known. Both leaders were prolific authors whose works, singular i n style and rich in rhetoric, comprise a seminal part of the American literary canon, and have been regularly featured by authors of creative works in fiction, drama, poetry, etc. since their publication. This course is an opportunity to delve deeply into the words of both men, long considered the authors of two disparate ways of viewing and engaging in civic struggle in America.

SOAN 220: Domains of Human Evidence Anthropology literally translates to the study of man, and the discipline takes humankind as its object. This course explores the four distinct ways in which anthropologists have sought to understand humans: 1) as animals whose potential and limits are set by their physiological qualities (physical anthropology); 2) as material workers who shape and are shaped by their environment and who leave their mark on the landscape (archaeology); 3) as cultural creatures who collectively produce ways of interacting with and imposing meaning on the world and one another (socio/cultural anthropology); 4) as language bearers who mediate their experience with complex grammars and symbol systems (linguistic anthropolo gy). These domains of evidence are key to developing an in depth understanding of what anthropology can do, and this course is foundational for upper level anthropology courses.

SOAN 239: Social Movements and Society Social movements have contributed to significant changes in modern society. The civil rights movement brought greater equality to African Americans; the Women's Liberation movement created an expansion of rights for women; anti -war and disarmament protests contributed to the end of the Vietnam war and the end of the arms race; and the environmental movement drew our attention to deforestation, climate change, and species loss. 688 This course examines why people participate in social movements, when social move ments emerge, which social movements succeed or fail in mobilizing constituents, how they are organized, how mass media influences movements, and why movements ultimately decline. Special attention will be paid to how social movements influence and are inf luenced by the social context in which they emerge, with the goal of better understanding a significant force of societal change.

SOAN 240: Deviance How society defines deviants - its outcasts and outsiders - and how the people so defined respond to this categorization; the nature of normal and abnormal, legal and illegal . Do these categories have absolute moral meaning, or do they always depend on the particular society and era in which they are defined? Topics to be addressed include stigma and stereotyping, cross -cultural variations in gender roles, the status of the in mate, deviance as blocked opportunity, and the political mobilization of outsiders.

SOAN 241: Gender and Territory in Latin Amer Body -Maps: Decolonial Notions of Gender and Territory in Latin America. This course explores how socio -spatial and territorial relations are marked by g ender, race, and class in Latin America. From a feminist anthropological and geographical perspective, we revisit different territorial struggles in Latin America and the role of gender in these mobilizations. Specifically, we examine how power functions i n \"the body\" or the self, but also in human and non -human relations, which are traversed by colonial nation -State and imperialist formations. This course not only engages in critical dialogues on space, and the ways in which race, gender, and class are exp erienced in the everyday life, but also how these territorial spaces become contested places for Black, Indigenous and other racialized subjects to imagine and produce decolonial futures.

We will consider several case studies and examine the wider phenomenon of such groups in the modern world. We will pay attention to the traditional sociological issues of leadership, charisma , conversion, and belief maintenance, as well as the lived practices and experiences of members of such groups, such as rituals, gender practices, and holidays.

For much of the world, the privileging of schooling as a site of education has had real ramifications on the possibility of maintaining cultural forms that go against the pressures of gl obalization and capitalism. This course opens with a broad consideration of education before focusing on schooling as the preferred institutional form of education under early 21st century globalism. Our questions will include both how schooling operates t o maintain existing social structures and power relations and the possibilities - and consequences - of schools as a site of change.

We will look at how experiences of illness and health are culturally, rather than biologically, constructed. A second objective is to compare the belief systems and medical practices of several specific W estern and non -Western societies. In carrying out these cross -cultural comparisons, we will focus on qualitative research and read several ethnographic case studies.

SOAN 246: Language and Culture This course is an introduction to and survey of Linguistic Anthropology, one of the four primary subf ields within the broader discipline of anthropology. Linguistic anthropology requires competence in several areas that encompass scientific and humanistic approaches to the study of language. Students will acquire a broad grasp of critical issues in langua ge and culture including by grappling with such questions as: What is language? Does language shape our intuition of the world? How might it affect our thoughts and behavior? What does color have to do with language and how can color terms tell us about ou r limits of awareness of the way that culture shapes us? How do we do things with words? What role do groups and social norms play in how we speak? How creative can we be with language? What is verbal art? How does language operate within actual communitie s, for instance serving to support and maintain traditional cultural practices or fostering distinctions between kinds of persons in society?

SOAN 248: Intro to Physical Anthropology This course will introduce students to the discipline of biological/physical anthropology. The course will look at both the commonalities that hominids, and particularly humans, share with other biological organisms and idiosyncratic phenomena that make the human species unique. Students will first be introduced to the evolutionary and biological mechanisms that have gu ided the emergence of the human lineage and to the practices of taxonomy and phylogeny which inform the study of human biological ancestry. Next, the class will focus on the study of modern primates, humanity's closest living relatives. We will then move t o the particular evolutionary history of hominids that produced modern humans. Through this course students will become conversant with the overarching questions and biological techniques employed in the study of both ancient humans and modern human variat ion. This course will directly engage students in anthropological work in both reading and practice and teach the methods used by anthropologists in their fieldwork. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirem ent. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 251: Intro Performance Studies In this course, we will explore the flourishing new discipline of Performance Studies. This field of study began as a collaboration between theater director and theorist Richard Schechner and anthropologist Victor Turner, combining Schechner's interest in 'aesthetic performance' (theater, dance, music, performance art) with Turner's interest in performance as ritual within indigenous cultures, or (as Erving Goffman has written) 'the presentation of self in everyday life.' Performance Studies often stresses the importance of intercultural performance as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldw ork. In addition to the above and other authors, the course will include in -class performance exercises along with field trips to performances in Chicago.

We will look at familie s in their social and cultural context and ask what relationships exist between family forms, practices, and values and the economic 690 system, political organization, religions, and cultures of the larger community. We will also ask what the sources of love and support, as well as conflict and tension, are within families and among kin, and we will question why family forms and ideal family types change over time.

Texts by Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Aquinas, Alfarabi, Confucius, authors of the Vedas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau will be examined for the seeds of questions that were later to grow into the thicket of sociological prob lematics. Extensive weekly readings of original sources will be the basis of class discussions. Prerequisite: SOAN 110.

SOAN 270: Mapping Chicago Creating maps, like anything done by humans, is a socially situated practice. This practice is framed by discourses on heritage, politics, race, socioeconomics, and even archaeology. What can a map make visible, and what might it erase? How do historical narratives materialize around maps, and what decisions are made in the process of committing narrative to boundary, from emplacing event on physical space? How do we remem ber people, incidents, and things through commemorations as locations? What can we gain, analytically, by mapping? This course is designed to teach students to think spatially, historically, and archaeologically through readings, lectures, field trips, and the use of StoryMaps software. Drawing from source criticism of text, artifact, and oral history, and via the use of StoryMaps, students in this course ask and work to answer these questions, creating their own maps drawn from research on selected Chicago land sites and histories to create new spatial data and stories.

A central question for the course is how biological/physiological components of sex and desire are given meaning by cultu res, with particular focus on the late 20th -early 21st century United States. The course will explore the US hegemonic binaries of male vs. female, masculine vs. feminine, and man vs. woman, examine how they articulate with one another, and consider variou s nonbinary responses. It also will look at the ways that social activism around sexuality and gender identity have simultaneously improved and undermined our understandings of both. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 or GSWS 110.

How societies are organized, how they produce and consume, and what values and norms constitute their culture all have varied impacts on what is often referred to as the 'natural' world. As environmental problems - such as climate change, deforestat ion, species loss, pollution, etc. - are constructed and emerge, the impact on societies varies greatly across social groups based on race, class, gender, and national context. This course explores how, in the face of environmental degradation, society has responded in different ways: with social movements, changes in lifestyles, and private certification programs advocating conservation and preservation; and political and economic institutions, definitions of status, and entrenched social organization resi sting change.

Building on modern material culture studies, this focus on materiality can inform and contextualize our understandings of present day human experiences and ch allenges. This course is designed to explore some of these materially -focused anthropological case studies while providing the opportunity for students to undertake their own \"excavation\" of the recent past.

This course examines the ways that we understand (or misunderstand) race, ethnicity, class, and gender from an archaeological perspective. We explore archaeological research projects across time and regions to interrogate an essential problem in archaeology: How can we tell whether material differences in the archaeological record correspond to boundaries human groups draw among themselves? Course topics include race and racialization, ethnic diversity and ethnogenesis, the fo rmation and performance of class, social constructions of gender and sexuality, and the political stakes involved in archaeological studies of difference. Throughout this course we ask how an engagement with intersectionality \u2014the idea that categories of di fference are entangled and covalent \u2014may allow for a more nuanced understanding of the past, and of the present.

The primary methodology of qualitative resear chers, ethnography, tends to be more associated with anthropology as a result of disciplinary history. The writing of ethnographic 'thick description' is part art and part science, a methodology most easily learned by doing. This course is designed to give students exposure to the ins, outs, and ethics of ethnographic research methods and to help students develop a sense of when such methods are appropriate. Course work includes fieldwork of various types culminating in research projects determined by the s tudents. Recommended for junior year.

The specific goal of this course is to familiarize students with the evolution of and critical issues in formal educatio n in most low income, less industrialized nations. Students will be able to explore contemporary themes in education from a historical and comparative perspective. Additionally, they will expand their conceptual schema for rethinking educational issues wit hin and beyond their own societies. Geographically, this course covers countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, but runs comparisons with countries in Europe and North America when theoretically relevant. Reading materials build on development studies and several disciplines in the social sciences and humanities such as history, philosophy, anthropology, sociology and education.

A major goal of t he course is to interrogate the linkages between education and society. Recurrent themes will be examined to demonstrate how every educational system not only arises from but also shapes its particular socio -cultural context. Students will have the opportu nity to deepen and expand their knowledge of educational issues within a global context.

Anthropology and related social sciences have a long theoretical and empirical engagement with the study of rationality and reason, and of perception and empiricism particularly in the early 20th century attempts to make sense of non -western religious and magical systems. At the time, people believed these practices were 'cultural' in a way that western science was not. Over the last two decades this belief has been soundly critiqued and rejected and a great deal of work has focused on the cultural practices of western laboratory scientists and of the cultur al fact of science and technology in society more broadly. This course will present students with an introduction to the anthropological context for contemporary Science and Technology Studies. Prerequisites: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or 220 or consent of inst ructor. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 348: Paranormal & Supernatural Cultural, social, and social -psychological forces operate together to create belief systems; paranormal and supernatural belief systems are e xamples of common systems of belief. These systems of belief are embedded within social institutions in identifiable ways and bearing identifiable consequences. The acceptance or refusal of these beliefs, or of the larger cosmology they reflect, tells the social scientist much about the believers and disbelievers and their societies. This course will examine belief systems that are commonly identified as paranormal, supernatural or occult. Topics may include astrology, magic, UFOs, cryptozoology, ghosts, an d spirit possession. Prerequisites: SOAN 110, and either SOAN 210 or SOAN 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 350: Sociology of Knowledge This course investigates the patterns whereby social organization shapes both the content and structure of knowledge. The connection between knowledge and society is reciprocal: we will observe how a new religious message, scientific insight, or technological development alters the social order. The sociology of knowledge also involves the investigation of consciousness and belief: We will investigate the relationships between mental 694 phenomena and social organization - how, for example, 'false consciousness' is constructed in relations of exploitation and how ideologies and ster eotypes shape what is perceived. Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and any SOAN 200 -level course or higher. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 351: Performance Ethnography Performance Studies stresses the importance of intercu ltural performance as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional qualitative fieldwork. Looking at behavior through the lens of performance offers new ways for ethnographers to understand how identity is formed and expressed. As a discipline concerned with non -textual forms of knowledge, scholars engaged in this field sometimes use performance to present their research, recognizing the modes of knowledge that cannot be reduced to words. Students in this course will study Performa nce Studies scholarship, learn the basics of ethnographic practice, and create performances based on their research. They will study the work of scholars such as Dwight Conquergood and Erving Goffman and artists such as Tectonic Theater, which specialize i n documentary theatre. There will also be required field trips and site visits. Prerequisite: THTR 251 or permission of instructor.

When does a state of war produce its own structures and rules? How do different societies respond in different ways to life during wartime? How does ethnic and class conflict manifest in war? What happens when war and conflict become normalized? Does the perpetual conflict betwee n tribes in Papua New Guinea constitute war in the same way that the war on terror is a war, and are either of these the same as World War II? Does the Arab Spring constitute a state of war? This course takes up the question of the social effects of war, i ncluding the consequences of living 'on war footing.' Potential topics include the militarization of societies, the differences between state and non -state control of violence, and the mechanisms by which populations are mobilized to violence.

A unifying thread for those theorists generally accepted as working within Queer Theory is the prioritization of gender and sexuality as social ordering devices. Queer Theorists make dualities, power inequ alities, and identity performance central to their analyses. The creation, rise, and ultimate deconstruction of these theories will be placed within social and historical contexts. Once the student has a firm understanding of the source and content of Quee r Theory we will embark upon an exploration of its application through the investigation of a number of topics that are often peripheralized in the academy. Ultimately, we will question the utility of the theory in light of factors ranging from its dismant lement under deconstruction to the rise of social contingency theory.

Prerequisite: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or SOAN 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 390: Sociology of Religion This seminar starts with major classical theories of sociology of religion including those of secularization and privatization of religion in the modern world. Then we examine the relevant events of the past quarter of the century, namely the sudden explosion of politicized and highly public rel igions in the Western and the non - Western worlds. The existing sociological literature didn't anticipate the current significance of religion and this tension is expected to generate interesting debates in this seminar. Special attention is given to a comp arative study of public religions in Western countries (e.g., Brazil, Poland, Spain, and the United States) and in the Middle East (Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia). Pre -requisites: SOAN 110 and any SOAN course at the 200 level or higher or consent of the instru ctor. cross listed: RELG 390, IREL 375 SOAN 395: Sociology of Law This course will examine the social organization of legal institutions and the relationship between law and the structure of society. Specifically, the course considers the nature and origin s of law from the viewpoint of classical social theorists and anthropological studies of customary law. The course also emphasizes various aspects of the American legal system: the social structure of the legal profession, courts and dispute resolution, 696 law as an instrument of social control, and the relationship between law and social change. Prerequisite: SOAN 110. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) SOAN 480: Social Explanation and Theory Designe d as a capstone for the Sociology/Anthropology major, this course focuses on exposition, comparison, and appraisal of major theoretical schools whose influence undergirds both disciplines. The course offers contexts for the explanation of social phenomena and behaviors and considers problems of systematic theory construction in social science. Prerequisites: SOAN 110 and SOAN 210 or SOAN 220. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) SOAN 490: Internship SOAN 235: Racism and Eth nic Relations This course surveys of the development of the theories of race and ethnic relations at the individual, group, and cultural levels.

Rather than attempt a survey of all the possible manifestations of romantic love, this course aims to explore how 'love' features into our understa ndings of human interaction in the 21st century, particularly in the United States. We will be particularly focusing on the contemporary American notion that love and money are opposing forces. Our first goal will be to identify at least some of the tropes of love that are in current circulation. We will then explore the potential social consequences of those tropes, including the ways in which such tropes are passed on and reproduced across generations and the possibility of commodifying and 'selling' cert ain tropes as the 'right' way to be in love. Throughout the course, we will collect love stories, and our final task of the semester will be to compare our theoretical and media derived understandings of romantic love to its manifestations in people's live s.

Sociology and anthropology share a focus on exploring the social (group rather than individual) bases of human practices and behaviors that ar e regarded as crucial for working in health care professions. Both disciplines study social interaction and such social institutions as family and religion. This course uses examples from health care settings and scenarios to introduce students to key conc epts for viewing the world through sociological and anthropological lenses, including cultural relativism, material culture, and the social construction of human experience through categories like race, class, and gender.

What are some anticolonial movements in the Americas? How does a decolonial future looks? In this class, we read both colonial -era thinkers and their later interpreters, and we also explore anticolonial and decolonial resistance movemen ts in the Americas. Through this course, students will become conversant in the major debates, issues, and different theories of colonialism, decolonization, settler colonialism, and anticolonialism scholarship and activism. We will work to understand the diverse histories of colonialism/anticolonialism, and the ways these divergent histories influenced scholarship. Students will also begin to distinguish the intersections between this literature and feminist theory, queer theory, and critical race theory. Prerequisite: SOAN 110.

When does a state of war produce its own structures and rules? How do different societies respond in different ways to life during wartime? How does ethnic and class conflict manifest in war? What happens when wa r and conflict become normalized? Does the perpetual conflict between tribes in Papua New Guinea constitute war in the same way that the war on terror is a war, and are either of these the same as World War II? Does the Arab Spring constitute a state of wa r? This course takes up the question of the social effects of war, including the consequences of living 'on war footing.' Potential topics include the militarization of societies, the differences between state and non -state control of violence, and the mec hanisms by which populations are mobilized to violence.

How do they present themselves? What does their clothing convey? What do their gestures suggest? How are their props significant? Are they \"being themselves\" or are they performing a different persona? How important is their performance to our perception of the music they play? Utilizing methodologies from the field of Performance Studies, we survey the history of rock 'n' roll starting with early performers such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Roll ing Stones, Jim Morrison, and Jimi Hendrix. We note the emergence of glam rockers in the early 70s such as David Bowie and Marc Bolan as well as shock rockers like Alice Cooper and Kiss. We also consider groups that seem to be just \"being themselves\" onsta ge like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers.

THTR 206: Grateful Dead and American Culture More than fifty years after the band's founding, the Grateful Dead looms larger than ever. From Haight -Ashbury acid -testers to visionary entrepreneurs, the band that grew up and out of the revolutions of the tumultuous 1960s found a way to mix everything from roots music to free jaz z to rock into an \"endless tour\" that put them in the Fortune 500. The Grateful Dead provided a cultural soundtrack for not only the 1960s, but also the paranoia of the Watergate years, the Reagan -soaked 1980s, and on to the jam -band present.

Urban Studies Courses URBS 110: Introduction to Urban Studies Urban Studies allows students to examine the development and impact of urbanization in the great me tropolitan regions (comprising larger inner cities and suburban communities) in which a majority of the world's population now lives. This interdisciplinary course focuses on the economic, political, environmental and cultural dimensions of the urban exper ience, with guest lectures by a variety of college experts. A core professor will coordinate these visits, encouraging students to see how all elements interrelate to both limit and expand what is possible in metropolitan regions. Field trips to both urban and suburban locations will allow students to understand the range of issues confronting these population centers. Students will be challenged to think about how compromise and negotiation are crucial parts of urban planning and to ask how decisions that affect the urban and suburban community ultimately are made. (Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) 711 URBS 120: American Cities This course is an introduction to the political, economic, and social forces that have shaped Amer ican cities from the colonial era to the present, with a focus on the city of Chicago. We explore the growth of urban economies and new forms of labor, migration and immigration into cities, persistent patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and displacement , and struggles over power and resources that make up urban politics. We also pay particular attention to urban geography and the relationship between cities, rural and suburban areas. Students are introduced to multiple disciplinary approaches to understa nding American cities, and take field trips to relevant sites in Chicago. This course is the foundational course for the Urban Studies minor program. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Domestic Pluralism requir ements.

Auditing MLS Seminars Auditing MLS Seminars Adults may register to audit an MLS seminar, assuming there is space in the class. Students who audit an MLS seminar attend classes and may participate in discussion, but they do not write the papers. Auditors do not earn academic credit but the course they audit w ill be listed on their official transcripts with the designation of AU. Tuition for auditing is currently $600 per course. Option for MLS Auditors to Transition into the MLS Program Students who successfully audit four MLS seminars will be granted one gr aduate credit, which may be counted towards the eight credits needed for the Master of Liberal Studies degree. A total of two MLS graduate credits may be earned in this manner. Master of Liberal Studies 714 What Our Students Have to Say Anita Cukier : \"One of the most important things f or me is to be able to crystallize my own viewpoints and to be able to defend them with facts .\" Thomas Skelly : \"The quality of the discussion around very interesting topics I found to be excellent. You get a clear diversity of opinion among professors and students with different life experiences.\" Jane Steen : \"It gives you confidence to talk about the things that you don't necessarily have a huge grasp on. I developed more confidence in writing and speaking about a variety of subjects. \" 715 To be admitted to the Masters in Liberal Studies program, candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. Candidates should submit transcript records of all college work at the time they submit their application f or admission. Our simple application form asks applicants to write a brief essay stating how the Graduate Program in Liberal Studies will serve their needs. In addition, each applicant will be interviewed by the Director, Associate Director, or another mem ber of the MLS Committee. The Committee is responsible for admitting applicants. The decision to admit an applicant is based entirely on the Committee's assessment of whether the applicant is likely to perform well in the program and to benefit from it. Graduate tuition and expenses Application Fee: $30.00 Tuition per Course for 2022 -2023: $2,944 Full-time teachers qualify for a grant to cover half of tuition costs. Withdrawal and refunds A student who wishes to withdraw from an MLS seminar or an electiv e course must notify the Associate Director of the program. Refunds will be made according to the following schedule. Seminar Meetings Completed Refund 1 90% 2 80% 3 70% 4 60% 5 50% 6 40% 7 or more 0% When students withdraw from elective courses, refunds follow the prorated schedule for regular undergraduate courses. All graduate courses are regarded as beginning on the first day of the term, and the amount refunded diminishes by 10% every week. All financial policies detailed under Underg raduate Tuition and Fees apply to the Graduate Program in Liberal Studies. Admission and Tuition 716 Master's in Liberal Studies A candidate must successfully complete at least eight Lake Forest College courses for graduate credit. Since each of these courses carries four semester hours of credit, the MLS degree represents a total of 32 semester hours of graduate credit. Of these eight courses, at least three must be MLS interdisciplinary seminars and/or colloquia. The remaining five courses are electives and may be c hosen from the following options: additional MLS seminars; advanced undergraduate courses in which the graduate students will be expected to do extra work. In certain cases, students may choose to concentrate electives in a discipline; independent study, one form of which is a master's thesis. An overall average of B or higher is required to complete the MLS degree. MLS students are not required to take any minimum number of courses a year to remain in the program. Part - time students are welcomed and most students take only one course a semester. Students may also choose to complete the MLS degree in one year, or a year and a half, through a special accelerated program which usually requires completion of a thesis or final project. Coursework given a grade of incomplete by the instructor must be cleared within one year; after that, the grade will be recorded permanently as NC (No Credit), which will not affect the student's grade point average. Transfer credit Once a student is admitted to the program, the M LS Committee may approve the transfer of graduate courses from an accredited university. Only courses in which the student has earned a grade of B or higher and that fit into the liberal arts definition of the MLS program can be considered for acceptance i n transfer. Normally, the Committee will accept in transfer no more than the equivalent of two Lake Forest College graduate courses. Apply to the Program Application for Admission Form (Adobe Acrobat PDF format) Requirements 717 Master of Liberal Studies Courses MLS 510: Darwin Seminar Darwin and Darwinism are studied from a variety of perspectives, including the ways thinkers used the prestige of scientific theory to justi fy contemporary business practices and social inequalities; the impact of Darwinism on literature; scientific developments since Darwin; the new sociobiology, the genetic and cultural evolutionary determination of human behavior. MLS 514: Public Policy & Environment The seminar will examine: the historical background of current environmental issues; alternative ways of conceiving of the relationship of humankind and the natural world; the complex issues created by the need to reconcile environmental with o ther social goals such as economic growth; consideration of international law and organization as a means of protecting the ozone layer and preventing global warming; analysis of the consequences of population growth. MLS 516: The Idea of Law The idea of 'law' can mean different things in different contexts and applications. This seminar considers such questions as whether the concept of law is used the same way in the natural and social sciences. How does 'natural' law differ from 'positive' law? While li terature does enlarge our understanding of law in these several senses, how do letters, as well as the other arts, themselves reflect their own 'rules'? And do new theories of literary criticism along with chaos theory challenge older assumptions of order and meaning? MLS 518: Intellectual Revol of 20th Cen In the unsettled years around 1900 new aesthetic visions emerged in the arts, while intellectuals and scientists developed radically new ways of thinking about the natural and social worlds. These intel lectual revolutions permeated the general consciousness during the early decades of the twentieth century. This seminar examines the contributions of major thinkers such as Freud and Einstein and movements such as modernism that had a decisive influence on our worldview. MLS 520: Mind and Brain The brain has been called an 'enchanted loom.' Can our knowledge of the physical brain help us understand our thinking selves, our emotions, and other mental processes? Conversely, can a good understanding of the hu man mind (rational, spiritual, and creative) illuminate our study of the physiological brain? How do personality and intellect develop over one's life? How does the brain develop, and how might consciousness have evolved? Do we have inborn 'social instinct s'? MLS 522: The 18th Century The Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century transformed the intellectual climate of European civilization. In the century that followed, many argued that the rational methods of natural science could be applied to philosophy, religion, politics, aesthetics, and society. The impulse to Enlightenment was challenged by a generation of writers and satirists who, while often introducing new styles of poetry and prose, defended traditional humanistic values. From this ten sion between old and new, continuity and change, emerged a modern world view. This seminar will explore eighteenth -century culture in a variety of its manifestations, including science, literature, the arts, religion, and politics. Courses 718 MLS 524: Ways of Knowin g We know many different things but we also know in many different ways. The poet and the biologist know nature in distinctive manners. What is the basis for scientific knowledge? How can we know the past? What kinds of knowledge are the province of litera ture and the arts? The seminar will explore several of the ways in which we know, concentrating on the scientific, the historical, and the literary. MLS 526: Sound and Image This seminar will consider the aesthetic interaction between ear and eye, especia lly in the mass -mediated forms of music, sound effect, dialogue, photograph, painting, and cinema. We will read both theoretical and literary reflections on the subject, see some movies, and listen to recorded music. Briefly considering the physics and physiology of hearing and vision, we will consider how the artistic imagination, delivered in audio and visual media, interacts with audience experience both as individuals and as a social group. MLS 528: Liberty The concept of liberty is a relatively modern one; we can trace its development from the English Enlightenment to the 21st century. This seminar will explore how the idea of liberty has developed as a political, economic, cultural and social ideal. We will look at liberty in markets, individual right s, conflicts between equality and freedom, international relations, psychological explorations of freedom, conflicts between states and individual liberties, and other topics. Materials will include classic texts and cultural explorations of liberty throug h literature and the arts. MLS 530: War and Peace Conflict/Human Nature (War and Peace: Conflict and Human Nature) This course examines how issues of war and peace frame international relations in the modern era. With a special emphasis on World War I, we will study popular attitudes toward war, including militarism, imperialism, and pacifism. Consideration is also given to Woodrow Wilson's peace plan and subsequent efforts to end states' reliance on armed conflict to settle international political dispute s. The course also considers the effect of technological change on war, efforts to promote democracy as an antidote to war, humanitarian intervention, and Islam's tradition of pacifism as a response to jihadism. MLS 532: Sex & Gender in Nature and Society An interdisciplinary exploration of sex and gender, with emphasis on the perspectives of biology, psychology, history, art, and literature. We will examine the biological bases for differences between males and females and how evolution shapes sex roles i n animal societies. We will consider the social and cultural differences between males and females and how gender and sex affect the social roles of men and women. How, if at all, have gender roles changed in the process of historical development? How does culture construct gender and in what ways can art and literature illuminate aspects of gender? MLS 534: Civil Liberties and Civil Rights MLS 536: Meetings: East and West Encounters between cultures play a significant role in world affairs. This course e xplores the complex and evolving inter -relationships among East Asian cultures and Western societies. It focuses on how both Eastern and Western traditions and discourses encounter, resist, assimilate, and transform each other in unpredictable ways. The co urse will involve history, politics, art, philosophy, film, literature, and music. MLS 538: Ethics and Life Selected topics dealing with the ethical dimension of human activities, institutions, and traditions. Topic for Fall 2005: International Relations. Considerations of the intersection between ethics and U.S. foreign policy, examining tensions and harmony between universal values and national interest. Examination of the extent ethics does, can, or should inform decisions about the U.S. role in interna tional affairs. 719 MLS 540: Cinema & Society Cinema exerts a powerful influence on society. It reflects, shapes and comments upon a variety of social and political concerns. Through careful analysis of films --classic as well as recent --and related texts, the seminar will explore varying representations of such themes as nation, gender, class, and race from literary, socio -scientific, and artistic perspectives. MLS 542: Images of Human Nature This course will consider various views about the nature and meanin g of human existence. Among the images to be examined are the religious and philosophical, the heroic, the psychological, and the sociological and historical. Readings include selections from Augustine, Dante, Shakespeare, Rousseau, Nietzsche, Freud, and various contemporary documents, including film. MLS 544: Sensing Chicago (Sensing Chicago: Past, Present, and Future.) Our experience of place is mediated by our senses. Chicago \u2014a city whose name derives from an Algonquian term for stinking onion \u2014can be gr asped via its aroma (the Stockyards, Blommer's Chocolate Company), sights (1893 World's Fair, the Chicago School of Architecture), sounds (Blues, Jazz, Classical), tastes (deep dish pizza, molecular gastronomy), and touch (the wind toward the Lake, the cro wds on the CTA). By using our senses as a lens, we interrogate the many layers of Chicago. The course will integrate campus sessions as well as field -based explorations of Chicago's sensorium. MLS 546: Relig: Inter -disciplinary Approach Religion has been a cultural universal in the past, and remains a constant in our current societies. Some of the questions that this cross -disciplinary seminar explores are as follows: What is religious experience? How does it interact with other facets of our psychological , sociological, economic, and cultural life? What was its role in traditional societies? What is its future? We shall look at religion from the perspectives of theologians, philosophers, psychologists, and social scientists. MLS 548: Romanticism: Self and Society The Romantic era (ca. 1780 -1830) was a period of revolutionary change in politics, literature, music, and the visual arts. This seminar examines the evolving relation of self and society through five transformational decades of modern European his tory. Discussions will focus on the works of a number of major figures, including Blake, Burke, Schiller, Wordsworth, Keats, Schubert, and Mary Shelley. MLS 550: Latin America: Economy & Culture An interdisciplinary study of the historical development of Latin American societies, highlighting the artistic achievements of Latin American writers and film directors and focusing on the links between political and economic change on the one hand and artistic production on the other. Literary texts and films wil l be treated as complex aesthetic objects whose language does not merely photograph socio -historical reality, but transfigures it. MLS 552: The Science of Science Fiction (Life as We Don't Know It: The Science of Science Fiction.) \"It's life, Jim, but not as we know it!\" An interdisciplinary seminar exploring classic and contemporary texts of science fiction from the perspectives of a scholar of literature and a trained ecologist. We will investigate the science behind some of the classic tropes of the gen re including alien life, artificial intelligence, the ecology of other worlds, and the political logic of dystopia. How do science fiction stories and films help us imagine the future \u2014and perhaps as importantly, better understand the world in which we now live? Materials will include classic science fiction texts by Frank Herbert, Stanislaw Lem, Ursula K. LeGuin, N.K. Jemisin, and others, as well as films such as Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris and Alex Garland's Annihilation. 720 MLS 554: Modern British Culture An interdisciplinary exploration of British culture in the 20th and 21st centuries. Topics include the Edwardians, the impact of World War I; the Bloomsbury circle; culture during the Slump; films of the Second World War; working class realism after the war; the Sixties; Thatcherism its critics; postmodernism and posthumanism. MLS 570: Preceptorial: AmericanGreats The course will focus on great works from American literature and philosophy. Works include those by Thoreau, Emerson, Melville, Twain, Wharto n, and others from the 20th century. MLS 580: The American Founding (The American Founding: Principles, Practices, Controversies.) American politicians and legal scholars often support their opinions by referring to the Founding era of the United States. But what exactly occurred during those important years at the end of the 18th century? What were the major debates about the ratification of the Constitution and how were they resolved? Are these founding principles and institutions still worthy of support as they stand? Do they need to be revised to meet changed circumstances and, if so, to what degree? In this course we will carefully interrogate the history and political philosophy of the Founding Era by examining a wide selection of key texts. In additi on, we will explore how different generations of Americans have (re)interpreted the meaning of these texts. Finally, we will consider how and why debates surrounding the meaning of the Founding era ae still very much present in virtually all of the major p olitical controversies of our day. MLS 582: Iconic Supreme Court Cases American political and legal history is filled with important and influential Supreme Court cases that have dramatically shaped our constitutional tradition. In this course, we will ca refully examine a number of iconic cases, such as Marbury v. Madison, Dred Scott v. Sanford, Roe v. Wade, and Obergefell v. Hodges (to name just a few), with an eye towards understanding their continuing legacies and significance. In addition to analyzing these cases on their own terms, we will also rely on them to illuminate broader questions concerning the proper role of the Supreme Court in our democracy. MLS 583: Hamilton and the Founding Fathers The reputation of Alexander Hamilton has vacillated wild ly over the years. Detractors have called him an elitist, an opponent of democracy, or a crypto -monarchist, while his admirers view him as a realist who believed that the new Republic needed a strong central government in order to build a strong economy. B ecause he played a pivotal role in both the American Revolution and the formation of the Constitution, his story becomes a lens to study many of the defining moments of the founding of the United States. His life takes us into the great debates of the earl y republic over the scope and nature of government power and its role in shaping American society. This course will draw on the musical \"Hamilton\" as well as recent scholarship and key primary source readings to reassess Hamilton's influence upon the key e vents of his lifetime and his legacy. The goals of the courses are: 1) to understand the key personalities, debates, and decisions of the Revolution and the Early National Period and 2) to model and practice the most effective teaching strategies for use i n your own civics and history classrooms. MLS 556: Existentialism and Its Discontents Existentialism was one of the most popular philosophical trends in the twentieth century, attracting philosophers and artists who sought to wrestle with the most persona l and ultimate questions of meaning in the face of rising rationalism and scientific positivism. In part, Existentialism was rooted in the view that philosophy should be a way of life, practical and engaged, rather than mere abstract theorizing by elite in tellectuals. Consequently, some of the deepest expressions of this philosophy have been in popular literature and film, which will be the focus of our seminar. This course will explore the artistic and ideological roots of the Existentialist movement in the 19th century with writers like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky. It will examine the explosion of Existentialist thinking in the 20th century, especially in France through the literature of Sartre, De Beauvoir, and Camus. And, finally, it will cons ider more recent critiques of Existentialism from the vantage of philosopher - novelists like Iris Murdoch. Emphasis will be on the artistic expressions of Existentialism, particularly the novel as 721 a form of philosophical exploration. Other Existentialist ar tists and philosophers to be considered may include De Unamuno, Bergman, Frankl, and Buber. MLS 518: Intellectual Revol of 20th Cen In the unsettled years around 1900 new aesthetic visions emerged in the arts, while intellectuals and scientists developed radically new ways of thinking about the natural and social worlds. These intellectual revolutions permeated the general consciousness during the early decades of the twentieth century. This seminar examines the contributions of major thinkers such as Freu d and Einstein and movements such as modernism that had a decisive influence on our worldview. MLS 570: Preceptorial: AmericanGreats The course will focus on great works from American literature and philosophy. Works include those by Thoreau, Emerson, Melville, Twain, Wharton, and others from the 20th century. MLS 544: Sensing Chicago (Sensing Chicago: Past, Present, and Future.) Our experience of place is mediated by our senses. Chicago \u2014a city whose name derives from an Algonquian term for stinking on ion\u2014can be grasped via its aroma (the Stockyards, Blommer's Chocolate Company), sights (1893 World's Fair, the Chicago School of Architecture), sounds (Blues, Jazz, Classical), tastes (deep dish pizza, molecular gastronomy), and touch (the wind toward the Lake, the crowds on the CTA). By using our senses as a lens, we interrogate the many layers of Chicago. The course will integrate campus sessions as well as field -based explorations of Chicago's sensorium. 722 Learning Outcomes 1. Demonstrate advanced communication skills by a.
