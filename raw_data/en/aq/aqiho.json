Herbology is traditionally one of the more important modalities utilized in [traditional Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) (TCM). Each herbal medicine prescription is a [cocktail](/index.php?title=Cocktail&action=edit&redlink=1) of many herbs tailored to the individual [patient](/index.php/Patient). One batch of herbs is typically decocted twice over the course of one hour. The practitioner usually designs a remedy using one or two main ingredients that target the illness. Then the practitioner adds many other ingredients to adjust the formula to the patient's [yin/yang](/index.php/Yin_and_yang) conditions. Sometimes, ingredients are needed to cancel out [toxicity](/index.php/Toxicity) or side-effects of the main ingredients. Some herbs require the use of other ingredients as [catalyst](/index.php/Catalyst) or else the brew is ineffective. The latter steps require great experience and knowledge, and make the difference between a good Chinese herbal doctor and an amateur. Unlike [western](/index.php?title=Western_world&action=edit&redlink=1) medications, the balance and interaction of all the ingredients are considered more important than the effect of individual ingredients. A key to success in TCM is the treatment of each patient as an individual. See also: [Individualism](/index.php?title=Individualism&action=edit&redlink=1) Chinese herbology often incorporates ingredients from all parts of plants, the leaf, stem, flower, root, and also ingredients from animals and minerals. The use of parts of [endangered species](/index.php?title=Endangered_species&action=edit&redlink=1) (such as [seahorses](/index.php?title=Seahorse_(fish)&action=edit&redlink=1), [rhinoceros](/index.php?title=Rhinoceros&action=edit&redlink=1) horns, and [tiger](/index.php?title=Tiger&action=edit&redlink=1) bones) has created controversy and resulted in a [black market](/index.php?title=Black_market&action=edit&redlink=1) of poachers who hunt restricted animals. Many herbal manufacturers have discontinued the use of any parts from endangered animals. History of Chinese herbology Chinese herbs have been used for centuries. The first herbalist in Chinese tradition is [Shennong](/index.php?title=Shennong&action=edit&redlink=1), a mythical personage, who is said to have tasted hundreds of herbs and imparted his knowledge of medicinal and poisonous plants to the agricultural people. The first Chinese manual on pharmacology, the [Shennong Bencao Jing](/index.php?title=Shennong_Bencao_Jing&action=edit&redlink=1) (Shennong Emperor's Classic of Materia Medica), lists some 365 medicines of which 252 of them are herbs, and dates back somewhere in the 1st century C.E. [Han dynasty](/index.php?title=Han_dynasty&action=edit&redlink=1). Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by a manuscript \"Recipes for 52 Ailments\", found in the MaWangDui tomb, sealed in 168 B.C.E. Succeeding generations augmented on this work, as in the [Yaoxing Lun](/index.php/Yaoxing_Lun) (; also spelled Yao Xing Lun; literally \"Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs\"), a 7th century [Tang Dynasty](/index.php?title=Tang_Dynasty&action=edit&redlink=1) Chinese treatise on herbal medicine. Arguably the most important of these was the [Compendium of Materia Medica](/index.php/Compendium_of_Materia_Medica) by [Li Shizhen](/index.php?title=Li_Shizhen&action=edit&redlink=1), which is still used today for consultation and reference. The history of this literature is presented in Paul U. Unschuld's \"Medicine in China: a History of Pharmaceutics\"; Univ. of Calif. Press, 1986. Categorizing Chinese herbs Chinese physicians used several different methods to classify traditional Chinese herbs: - The Four Natures ( or ) - The Five Tastes () - The Meridians () The earlier (Han through Tang eras) Ben Cao (Materia Medicae) began with a three-level categorization: Low level -- drastic acting, toxic substances; Middle level -- medicinal physiological effects; High level -- health and spirit enhancement During the neo-Confucian Song-Jin-Yuan era (10th to 12th Centuries), the theoretical framework from acupuncture theory (which was rooted in Confucian Han theory) was formally applied to herbal categorization (which was earlier more the domain of Daoist natural science). In particular, alignment with the Five Phases (Tastes) and the 12 channels (Meridians theory) came to be used after this period. The Four Natures This pertains to the degree of [yin and yang](/index.php/Yin_and_yang), ranging from cold (extreme yin), cool, neutral to warm and hot (extreme yang). The patient's internal balance of yin and yang is taken into account when the herbs are selected. For example, medicinal herbs of \"hot\", yang nature are used when the person is suffering from internal cold that requires to be purged, or when the patient has a general cold constituency. Sometimes an ingredient is added to offset the extreme effect of one herb. The Five Tastes The five tastes are pungent, sweet, sour, bitter and salty, each of which their functions and characteristics. For example, pungent herbs are used to generate sweat and to direct and vitalize [qi](/index.php/Qi) and the blood. Sweet-tasting herbs often tonify or harmonize bodily systems. Some sweet-tasting herbs also exhibit a bland taste, which helps drain dampness through [diuresis](/index.php/Diuresis). Sour taste most often is astringent or consolidates, while bitter taste dispels heat, purges the bowels and get rid of dampness by drying them out. Salty tastes soften hard masses as well as purge and open the bowels. The Meridians The Meridians refer to which organs the herb acts upon. For example, menthol is pungent, cool and is linked with the lungs and the liver. Since the lungs is the organ which protects the body from invasion from cold and [influenza](/index.php/Influenza), menthol can help purge coldness in the lungs and invading heat toxins caused by hot \"wind\". Chinese patent medicine medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine). They are [standardized](/index.php?title=Standardization&action=edit&redlink=1) [herbal](/index.php/Herbalism) formulas. Several herbs and other ingredients are dried and ground. They are then mixed into a powder and formed into pills. The [binder](/index.php?title=Binder_(material)&action=edit&redlink=1) is traditionally [honey](/index.php?title=Honey&action=edit&redlink=1). They are characteristically little round black pills. Chinese patent medicines are easy and convenient. They are not easy to customize on a patient-by-patient basis, however. They are best used when a patient's condition is not severe and the medicine can be taken as a long-term treatment. These medicines are not \" [patented](/index.php/Patent)\" in the traditional sense of the word. No one has [exclusive rights](/index.php?title=Exclusive_right&action=edit&redlink=1) to the formula. Instead, \"patent\" refers to the [standardization](/index.php?title=Standardization&action=edit&redlink=1) of the formula. All Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients. 50 fundamental herbs In Chinese herbology, there are Wong, Ming (1976).
