A typical person walks about 3 miles per day. The human body needs energy for walking, thinking, and doing daily activities, and this energy is supplied by eating. Sugar, or glucose, is the most important source of energy for cells in the human body. If the level of glucose in one's blood decreases, it can lead to a loss of consciousness, coma, and finally death within a few hours. However, the excessive increase of glucose in the human body is more common. The excess glucose in the blood should be rapidly turned to glycogen through the secretion of a hormone called insulin. If a person's body loses the ability to regulate the amount of blood sugar, that person suffers from diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in 1985, 30 million people in the world suffered from diabetes. The figure rose to 230 million in 2008. Currently, two people in the world develop diabetes every 10 seconds. Unhealthy diets and incorrect lifestyles have turned diabetes into a serious crisis around the world. Diabetes is the most costly endocrine disease in the world. Studies indicate that nearly 400 million are currently suffering from diabetes. However, money is probably the least important thing a person diagnosed with diabetes may lose. After a while, the disease leads to low vision, blindness, and even loss of limbs. According to the IDF, 2,880 people lose their legs every day, and their ability to walk is undermined for the rest of their lives. ... But this is not the end of the story. Those suffering from diabetes can still save their legs. Until 150 years ago, there was no chemical medicine; doctors used to prescribe medicinal herbs for their patients. Arnebia euchroma L is one of those medicinal herbs, which has been used throughout the history in healing dangerous wounds. Thanks to Iran's ecological features and age-old history in traditional medicine and herbal remedies, grounds are prepared in the country for conducting specialized scientific research on the treatment of various diseases through identification and production of medicinal herbs.
