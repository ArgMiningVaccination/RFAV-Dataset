An Ayurvedic solution to this situation has slowly gained momentum \u2014 a process called Garbha Sanskar. Its revival is the brainchild of Ayurvedic physician Dr Balaji Tambe, who explains it in his upcoming book Ayurvedic Garbha Sanskar. Garbha Sanskar is both a medical practice and a 'culture'. Just like a person brought up in a musician's house imbibes a musical culture, the child is conditioned within the womb. The practice has been developed over four decades of research and medical practice. Tambe says, \"If women are provided with expert guidance during [pregnancy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/5-best-positions-to-get-pregnant-fast/articleshow/5317909.cms) and the early years of their children, it will have an immense impact on society.\"What it involves Traditional diet planning, the use of herbal preparations, yoga, music, behavioural suggestions, and medicines are all used in harmony. The idea is to enhance every aspect of the mother's life. Ideally, preparations should start at least a year before conception. Garbha Sanskar covers pregnancy, childbirth and guides parents until the child is two years old. Parents who have followed these instructions say their babies are able to hold their heads up, turn on their side and begin speaking earlier than other babies. They sleep soundly for several hours and have far fewer [health](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/health) concerns than their peers. In some cases, they show extra-ordinary development.Preparing for conception A healthy diet (see chart) and lifestyle is recommended so the couple achieves peak physical and psychological health. The reproductive cells are the most potent cells in the body and need special nourishment, so health tonics such as panchamrut (see chart), are vital. Seminal fluids are also an indicator of the health of reproductive cells. If either partner suffers from deficiencies of any kind, an Ayurvedic Pancha Karma is recommended before conception. The process aims to cleanse the body of toxins. Its therapies lubricate the body internally and use techniques to expel toxins naturally. This is followed by therapy for specific problems as individually required. Guidelines for sexual interaction describe an ideal atmosphere and psychological readiness for the invitation of a good soul. The couple should eat light food suited to their individual constitutions, and choose a time between 10 pm and midnight for the attempt to conceive.During pregnancy Ancient descriptions of foetal development are surprisingly accurate. A month-by-month diet that supports every development, and health tonics are advised to keep up strength and provide essential nutrients. Yoga and oiling the body is a must. Use oil that is cultured with herbs such as bala, sahachar and ashwagandha to reduce stretch marks and prevent breasts from sagging. Several food and behavioural precautions are listed for the mother. Mixing fruit and milk can be particularly harmful, as it causes allergies in the baby. Around the fourth month, the mother will experience food cravings. These are to be adequately satisfied and sensitively treated, as they are the cravings of the foetus and will help it develop better.Music therapy The use of healing music is the most important aspect of Garbha Sanskar. \"It is well-known that music or sound vibration reaches the baby in the womb,\" says Tambe. \"It has a soul and recognises values. The baby can be cultured, especially through certain mantras and music found in the Indian tradition. But this does not necessarily work with any singing voice. Only certain voices will exhibit the ability to be penetrating and actually reach the child in the womb and help shape its mind.\" The choice of music to be heard during pregnancy is also important. Tambe's music research and compositions such as Vira Rasa Sanskar Shloka, are meant to inculcate courage and prepare the child's mind to face every situation in life. The Rig, Sama and Yajur Veda mantras promote a healthy pregnancy, good growth of the parts of the body, and stimulate the development of the sense organs, respectively. After childbirth, the music serves to calm the child. Babies find it enjoyable and are able to sleep comfortably with its help.Childbirth and childcare Garbha Sanskar favours a natural delivery. It holds that this is far less traumatic for the baby, compared to the shock of sudden exposure to the outside environment through caesarean section. Exercises and external applications during labour facilitate a simple and less painful delivery. Some of the essential steps after delivery include oiling the baby's fontanel (homemade ghee can be used), and feeding it a touch of goldinfused honey to boost nervous system activity. The mother regains her strength through an easily digestible and nutritious diet, and loses excess weight through basic yoga. The date powder, shatavari kalpa and dhatri rasayan must be continued to help the production of good and adequate breast milk.Some guidelines for childcare - Until the child is two years old, it needs regular oil massages to help growth - While he or she can start eating other food after it is six months old, it must be breast fed until it is a year old - Do not place the baby's bed under direct light - Avoid loud and disturbing noises \u00bb Introduce new [foods](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/foods) gradually, and allow the baby to start eating by itself at a certain age even if it creates a messDiet considerations How to make panchamrut Panchamrut, meaning 'the five nectars', is a traditional, extremely nourishing recipe.
