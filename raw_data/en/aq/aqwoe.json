Researchers compared identical diagnostic codes for patients with back injuries who were treated by either doctors of chiropractic or medical doctors. The results concluded that patients under chiropractic care incurred ten times less costs than patients under standard medical care. The study reported the following: 1. Compensation Costs: Chiropractic doctors patients $68 versus medical doctors patients $668. 2. Treatment Costs: Medical doctors $684 versus chiropractic doctors $527. 3. Days of Compensation: Medical patients 54.5 days versus chiropractic patients 34.3 days.

The number of paid days off from work was 6.26 days for chiropractic patients versus 25.56 days for medical patients. 2. The average cost of compensation for chiropractic care was $392 versus $1,569 for medical care. 3. Less patients under chiropractic care required days off. 4.

The study determined the following: 1. Less time of temporary total disability for chiropractic patients: Group excluding surgical cases - 48.7% shorter duration for Chiropractors patients Group including surgical cases - 51.3% shorter duration for Chiropractors patients 2. The average cost of chiropractic services was 50% less than medical services for both groups. 3.
