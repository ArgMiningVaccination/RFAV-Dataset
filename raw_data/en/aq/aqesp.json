Our gastroenterologists perform more than 13,000 colorectal cancer screenings a year. We recommend people schedule a first screening colonoscopy at age 45. Often there are no symptoms of colon cancer in the early stages. This is why screening is vital. Through screening tests, colon cancer can be detected before symptoms develop, this is when this cancer is the most curable. Speak to your Primary Care Physician. A colonoscopy, which provides imaging of the entire colon, is the gold standard for screening. Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), Stool Cologuard, and Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) are home-based tests that may show blood in the stool, and further testing would be needed. CT colonography (AKA virtual colonoscopy), a scan that could show growths in the intestinal wall, will also require further testing. Everyone needs to be screened. In regard to preventative screenings, still only one of every three adults are not up-to-date with their colon cancer screening. Don't be a statistic. The American Cancer Society recommends screenings begin at age 45. Those with a known family history of colorectal cancer, benign polyps, hereditary syndrome (Lynch), Familiar Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) mutations in a gene, accelerates cell growth leading to polyps, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. These people are at a higher risk for cancer, speak to your Primary Physician. Additional Risk Factors are: Age, race, tobacco and alcohol use, obesity, high-fat and low fiber diets. Many people don't realize that colorectal cancer is highly preventable. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends colonoscopy screenings beginning at age 45 for all patients. Considerations for patients' medical and family histories may also indicate they require a screening earlier in life. Colonoscopies have long been considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and detection. Unlike other cancer screenings which can only detect a problem, a colonoscopy could prevent colorectal cancer by removing precancerous polyps during the exam. Removal of polyps presents up to 90 percent of colorectal cancer. Both our hospital GI Center and Endoscopy Center in Arlington Heights use state-of-the-art diagnostic technology and high-definition imaging. Because of this, our detection rate for polyps is 57 percent, well above the national benchmark of 25 percent. To schedule a screening, you should obtain an order from your provider, then call [847-618-9550](http://847-618-9550). You can also call the number to schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist to discuss screening and your personal risks for the disease. Prevention of colorectal cancer is to get screened. Any [screening test](https://ssl.adam.com/content.aspx?productid=117&isarticlelink=false&pid=1&gid=002071&site=nchse3.adam.com&login=NORT3811) is better than no screening test.

Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer have treatment options, which may include the following: Upon diagnosis of colorectal cancer, our multidisciplinary team will work with you to create a comprehensive, individualized treatment plan. This includes, but isn't limited to: No one treatment plan is right for every person. The results of additional tests will determine if the cancer has spread or not. If the cancer has spread to other organs, a treatment plan may include chemotherapy and possibly surgery. The goal of surgery is to relieve any obstruction or bleeding, remove the primary tumor, and assess regional lymph nodes and to maintain gastrointestinal function. About 2/3 of all cancer patients will receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment. Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA within the cancer cells, destroying their ability to reproduce and this would cause these cells to die. If you do not currently have a primary care physician, call Health Connection at [847-618-4968](http://847-618-6596) or visit [nch.org/findadoctor](http://www.nch.org/findadoctor) You will be personally guided through treatment by a dedicated [Colorectal Patient Navigator](https://www.nch.org/conditions/cancer-care/patient-navigators/), who can assist in scheduling additional tests, procedures, surgical, medical oncology and radiation consult appointments. As part of the treatment plan there is a surveillance period that will make sure blood work and imaging will be scheduled to keep a watchful eye on any early indicators of recurrence of the cancer. The navigator is a phone call away at [847-618-6596](http://847-618-6596) to assist in addressing your questions and concerns.
