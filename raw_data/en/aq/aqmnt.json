Participating in the Summer Study Abroad program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong was also the result of a deliberate decision to stretch himself. \"Washington University is a very diverse school, so there are many opportunities to be exposed to diversity, but I knew going to Hong Kong would really push me out of my comfort zone,\" William says. \"I'd have no choice but to build relationships, communicate, and connect better in a different culture.\" William has found plenty of support as he's pushed himself out of his comfort zone. From the swim team to the business school, William says he immediately found people at WU to be friendly and collegial while also hard-working and motivated\u2014without being at all \"cutthroat.\" \"At Olin we do a lot of group work. It's really easy to work with people here\u2014you can tell everyone wants others to succeed as well as themselves,\" he says. \"My friends and classmates have been my best resources throughout my experience at Olin, which is something I hope to retain as I enter the professional world.\" For a semester-long project in a recent entrepreneurship class, for example, William says student teams had to put together an idea for starting a company. \"It was really eye-opening to see all that was involved. It gave us an accurate reflection of what real entrepreneurs go through,\" says William, a finance and entrepreneurship double major. \"It was also very interesting from a team standpoint. It's a challenging dynamic at Olin\u2014 to be a leader among a group of other leaders.\" William also had the opportunity to hone his career plan as a summer financial analyst in the Financial Restructuring Group at Houlihan Lokey. \"Investment banking is particularly appealing to me, because it's an excellent opportunity to make use of my finance coursework while also working in a challenging environment,\" William says. \"I was particularly drawn to restructuring, because it provides a unique opportunity to help distressed firms emerge stronger and healthier than before.\" STRIVING FOR MORE William Miller challenges himself to achieve his career goals Name: William Miller Hometown: Tampa, FLDegree: BSBA '15Internship/Job: Summer Financial Analyst Intern at Houlihan Lokey CAREER ACTION PLANS A successful internship or job search begins with the development of a good career plan.

She came to Olin as a Fort\u00e9 Fellow, an organization that works with top MBA programs to promote women in business. Then, as co-president of Olin Women in Business (OWIB), Kimberly (MBA '15) helped extend to other young women the opportunities she has enjoyed. \"Our goals [in OWIB] are not only to increase the number of women who attend Olin, but to also get the numbers of women in business up in general,\" Kimberly says. \"One of the many things we do is reach out to admitted students and encourage them to attend Olin, but we also promote interactions, support, and networking among women in various organizations and other MBA programs. All of these networks are important if more women are going to be successful in business.\" Building networks has been a business school theme for Kimberly, who says she was immediately impressed by the number of companies, speakers, and alumni who visit Olin. \"There are so many opportunities to have access to people and to engage and ask questions. Learning about other companies' cultures and other types of career paths has really broadened the possibilities for me,\" she says. \"It is fantastic to be constantly interacting with such high-caliber people here, in both professional settings and extracurricular activities.\" In her own career path, Kimberly says she had \"hit a plateau\" in environmental consulting and felt an MBA and a shift toward finance were the right next steps. Her post-MBA summer internship at Frito-Lay/PepsiCo in corporate finance will also open many doors. \"Coming from consulting, where everything changes all the time, I was hesitant to settle into working for one company,\" Kimberly says. \"Pepsi really expects you to move around into different departments and have different experiences, so it's a great fit for me. I really want to be at a company I can grow with\u2014where I can try different things and take different paths.\" Looking at Kimberly's path so far, it seems clear that her openness and sense of adventure have served her well. \"I willingly welcome change, whether professionally, personally, or geographically,\" says Kimberly, who is from Corona, California. \"Attending Olin and getting my MBA has facilitated relocation and new career opportunities, and has changed the way I view many things and interact with others.\" OlinCareers.wustl.edu 314-935-9050 wcc@olin.wustl.edu Easing into life at college was never what undergraduate Laira Torres-Ruiz had in mind\u2014 she's more of a dive-right-in kind of person. In her first year at Washington University, Laira (BSBA '17) participated in an Olin Case Competition, served as an Olin Peer Ambassador, traveled to Cuba as part of the Focus Cuba Freshman Seminar, and landed a summer internship. \"Everything I choose to get involved in is about making an impact on my future and expanding my horizons,\" Laira says. \"I'm learning a lot but I'm also giving back.\"As a Peer Mentor, for instance, Laira is learning about leadership and mentoring, but she's also helping students the way others guided her. \"I want to help others find the school that's going to make them the best person they can become. That's the best advice I received [when I was looking at schools], and I'm happy I can share it.\" Although she was originally considering a major in political science, Laira says she gravitated to Olin because business plays such an important role in the world. \"Everything revolves around business,\" she says. \"It's not about money for me, it's about people\u2014 the study of people and what makes them behave how they do. \"Business is really the study of everything essential to human behavior and human interaction.\" The opportunities for human interaction during her Focus Cuba trip were especially meaningful for Laira, who is from Puerto Rico. The two countries, she says, \"are one people at heart, but we have been separated.\" Laira plans to foster more international learning opportunities by studying in Madrid for a semester. She spent the summer after her freshman year at home in San Juan as an operations intern for Young Life. A COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE Our students are grounded, well-rounded leaders passionate about making a difference. They are inspired by service to society, are well equipped to contribute to organizational success, and thrive in a team environment. Their earned leadership is a result of numerous opportunities on and off campus. The Community Service Office serves as the major initiative of the Gephardt Institute for Public Service at Washington University, supporting cocurricular service among undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.of Washington U students participate in community service during college.WILLIAM WALDRON READY FOR BUSINESSLAIRA TORRES-RUIZ 67%As soon as he arrived on campus as a freshman, Will Waldron took his mother's wise advice and began trying as many classes and activities as his schedule allowed. \"My mom always encourages me to try as many things as I can. Exploring different interests is an opportunity to find yourself,\" says Will (BSBA '15). \"Finding yourself,\" Will believes, is a key aspect of undergraduate education, and Washington University is especially supportive of the pursuit. \"The biggest thing that has stood out to me in my time here at Wash U is the amount of opportunities people have to develop as individuals,\" says Will, who came to St. Louis from Bloomington, Illinois. \"This includes the ease of taking classes in any discipline, the large amount of groups that are open to new members joining them, and the push to get off campus and explore the city. I feel like having these kind of opportunities helps students find their passions and enter the real world with a complete understanding of who they are.\" A variety of extracurricular activities have helped Will explore his interests and identity. His junior year, Will was internal vice president for the Class of 2015, following a term as vice president of programming for the Student Union. He has also been a resident assistant, a Phi Gamma Nu brother, and a member of the Association of Black Students. Those activities, Will says, appealed to him for their collaborative nature and leadership opportunities. Being a member of the Student Union and serving as an RA, for instance, built Will's mentoring and advising skills, and offered opportunities to apply what he was learning in the classroom to real situations. \"It's all helped me think from different points of view and attack problems from different places,\" Will says, adding that learning and practicing communication skills have also been an important aspect of his experiences outside the classroom. Inside the classroom, Will's explorations eventually led him to a marketing major. He's interested in a focus on retail marketing, which he was able to explore in a hands-on way at a summer internship as a business analyst at Target Corporation. \"I just really enjoy the idea of reaching people and changing perceptions,\" he says. \"[In marketing] there's definitely an opportunity to manipulate people to get things they don't need, but there's also an opportunity to fix cultural standards and social pressures\u2014to make people reflect on themselves and want to change in good ways.\"A SOLID SENSE OF SELF Exploring many paths leads to a fully developed identity for Will Waldron Name: Laira Torres-Ruiz Hometown: San Juan, Life Name: William WaldronHometown: Bloomington, ILDegree: BSBA '15Internship/Job: Summer Business Analyst Intern at TargetEXPANDING HORIZONS Torres-Ruiz makes an impact while helping othersTHE OLIN DIFFERENCECASE COMPETITIONS From early on, Olin students have many opportunities to participate in intense case competitions, both on campus and at other universities. These competitions are a perfect testing ground to apply analytical, critical thinking, and communication skills under pressure and provide valuable, real-world learning opportunities to students. More than nine out of 10 freshmen place in the top 10% of high school classes. Over 30,000 students applied for approximately 1,400 freshman class positions. 30,000+9/10 6 OlinCareers.wustl.edu | 314-935-5950 | wcc@olin.wustl.edu READY FOR BUSINESS 7INNOVATIVE LEARNING. DELIVERING IMPACT. Innovative learning. Real-world projects. Outcomes with impact. That's the Center for Experiential Learning (CEL). The CEL matches highly motivated students at Washington University's Olin Business School with organizations seeking strategic consulting services. THE CEL HAS FIVE UNIQUE PROGRAMS DEDICATED TO INNOVATIVE LEARNING AND DELIVERING IMPACT: Practicum pairs teams of talented Olin students with companies seeking smart solutions to management challenges. The Taylor Community Consulting teams of two to four graduate-level students provide pro bono consulting services to St. Louis nonprofits. The Olin/United Way Board Fellows program takes second-year MBA students from the classroom to the nonprofit boardroom to provide a unique lesson in leadership. CELect students consult for entrepreneurs at a tech incubator to better understand the challenges of a startup and advise on best- practice business strategies. Global Management Studies are student-directed courses that focus on industries, management styles, or emerging markets in a country or region outside the United States.THE OLIN DIFFERENCE \"A CEL experience helps students align classroom learning with what happens in a professional setting. The experience can even be the pathway to a specific career direction. In fact, the CEL experience advances the goals Weston Career Center has set for students, specifically, guiding career planning, equipping with job search skills, and preparing for managing a career effectively.\" Annetta Culver Assistant Director, Employer Relations Weston Career Center 5 31 4 52 Find out more about the CEL at olin.wustl.edu/CEL A HEALTHY APPROACH Stephen Price blends clinical experience with business to influence healthcare With a doctorate in physical therapy and six years of clinical practice under his belt, Stephen Price entered Olin ready to shift his career by adding value to all he had already learned.STEPHEN PRICE\"I liked being a PT, but I knew I didn't want to be practicing long term,\" says Stephen (MBA '14). \"I wanted to have an influence on how healthcare is structured and carried out in this country, rather than being a person who provided that care. You begin to realize there's only so much you can do as a provider, yet you see what could be\u2014you see the potential for helping people achieve well-being.\" Stephen was attracted to Olin for its healthcare business program and ties to Washington University's School of Medicine. \"An MBA gives you the ability to be flexible and continue to go down whatever path you choose. I also knew the reputation of the medical school would translate into my MBA in different ways.\" Stephen began to concretely blend his interests in healthcare and business through Olin's Center for Experiential Learning, where he was a Practicum Team lead and a Board Fellow. The Fellow program allowed him to focus on academics his first year, then spend his second year applying what he learned in a community agency setting\u2014in his case, the Center for Hearing and Speech. \"Seeing the work of this agency and the people involved opened me up to the city. I became rooted in the real concerns and needs of real people,\" says Stephen. \"I felt well equipped and was glad to be out in the community, doing meaningful work.\" Before Olin, Stephen says his only exposure to the overlapping of business and healthcare was hospital administration. \"Now I see where I can impact healthcare in many more ways. It's given me the awareness and confidence to think more broadly about my career.\" That career is taking root at Humana. In 2013, Humana crafted an internship for Stephen, leveraging his clinical insights in orthopedic and cardiopulmonary issues and giving him a chance to blend in his new business skills. After earning his MBA, Stephen went to work at Humana full time as a clinical guidance consultant, a position focused on helping the company understand and leverage clinical data. \"I get to work alongside fellow clinicians, as well as project managers and other consultants, to solve complex issues facing the health insurance industry and healthcare delivery in the U.S. It's a perfect fit.\" Name: Stephen Price Hometown: Mountain View, MO Degree: MBA '14 Internship/Job: Clinical Guidance Consultant at Humana \" I w ant to help people reach their greatest health potential.

As a dual degree double-major (accounting and marketing BSBA, and MACC '14), balancing school and life was especially important. In addition to studying hard, Whitley also made time for exercise, relaxation, and friends. \"I think this balance is necessary to keep us sane and content with our lives,\" Whitley says. \"I think being balanced and well rounded makes you a better business person, too. A good work-life balance promotes mental health, a clear mind, and the ability to think outside the box\u2014to have better ideas without getting burnt out.\" For Whitley, playing Washington University club volleyball was key to that balance. \"[Volleyball has] been a really important part of my development. It's fun and it teaches so much, like communication, trust, working together, and encouraging others when they get down. The people I've met in volleyball have been like family.\" In addition to her term as co-president of club volleyball, Whitley was the Beta Alpha Psi vice president of recruitment and social activities and was involved in the Black Senior Alliance. As a minority herself, Whitley says she has always understood the importance of diversity, but her personal experience with it broadened significantly after arriving at Olin and Washington University from her hometown, Spring, Texas. \"I wasn't exposed to different cultures very much in high school,\" Whitley says. Living with Asian students her freshman year at WU helped her \"learn so much about people, and different ways to view things.\" She also appreciates WU's \"promotion of diversity and the vast amount of cultural events on campus.\" But it was a semester in Spain that impacted her most. \"The experience opened my mind. It really helped me see things from different perspectives, and helped me understand how other people view [Americans],\" she says. \"I just enjoyed getting outside of myself and learning about another way of life and gaining a more global outlook.\" That broad understanding of diversity will serve her well, Whitley says, when she goes to work for Ernst & Young, an international company with clients all over the world. After three summer internships at Ernst & Young (2012, 2013, and 2014), Whitley will finish up her master's of accounting in December 2014, then start full time there in 2015 as an assurance staff member. SUPPORTING DIVERSITY Olin's business and academic partners open doors to diverse students and experiences. Olin is a founding member of the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, an organization that addresses the underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans in business schools and corporations. Olin is a member of the Fort\u00e9 Foundation, which provides fellowships to increase the participation of women in management. For the fourth consecutive year, Weston Career Center was recognized with the highest level of certification (A+) by the national OUT for Work Career Center Certification Program. Olin has chapters of the National Black MBA Association (NBMBAA), the National Society of Hispanic MBAs (NSHMBA), and MBA Women International (MBAWI). These organizations sponsor annual career conferences that provide access to recruiting companies. In addition, these associations encourage academic and career development. LEADERSHIP IN ATHLETICS Student involvement in athletics at Washington University is very high at the intramural, club, and NCAA Division III levels. Washington U has been very competitive over the years, having won 19 NCAA Division III championships and 169 UAA titles in 19 different sports.\" Olin enjo ys a deep respect for diversity. Our students bring experiences and perspectives from all walks of life that create a unique Olin DNA within a creative and supportive culture. It's far more than ethnicity or gender. Diversity equals creative, confident, and fresh outlooks for solutions which can only come from respect for differences and similarities, and everything in between.\" Karen Heise Employer Relations Manager and Alumni InitiativesWeston Career Center \"Being a student at Olin allowed me to explore the realm outside of my comfort zone and reach for heights I never thought possible.\" Whitley McDowell (left) with classmate. THE OLIN DIFFERENCE 10 OlinCareers.wustl.edu | 314-935-5950 | wcc@olin.wustl.edu Beijing, ChinaDegree: MSSCM 14Internship/Job: Summer Intern in the Global Engineering Department at Sigma-Aldrich BUILDING CHARACTER . . . AND AN IMPRESSIVE R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 Intensive career preparation is central to Olin's undergraduate and graduate curricula. Olin hires are able to hit the ground running with a polished set of industry-specific leadership and communication skills. BSBA students are equipped with a solid understanding of career planning through participation in career education, presented in segments throughout the four-year program and integrated with the academic curriculum. They learn and practice the tools and competencies\u2014such as self-assessment models and career-plan development\u2014needed to pursue internships and full-time positions. Students also receive informative critiques from business professionals and from our faculty, alumni, and career advisors. At the graduate level, Olin's career preparation program helps students master the art of career readiness through skills workshops, consistent practice, and an educational network of alumni and industry experts. Created in response to recruiter feedback, the program begins before the first day of classes and continues throughout the semester, reflecting the importance we place on market-ready job-search skills and lifelong career management. THE OLIN DIFFERENCEFor Thomas Napier, developing traits like drive and dedication and learning teamwork and leadership skills in the Marines were all great preparation for business school. \"I rarely did an individual assignment at Olin\u2014it was all team-based,\" says Thomas (MSFC '14). \"It was about having a goal together and always communicating and working together to get there. I got so much experience working on a lot of different teams in different roles.\" Although many of the skills are the same, the leadership and teamwork goals in the Marines were clearly different. There, Thomas was an infantry rifleman team leader, performing counter-terror and security operations in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Khanjar. After four years as a Marine, Thomas decided to pursue a business degree and began researching schools that participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program. Olin stood out, he says\u2014not just because it is a full participant, but also because of its rankings and job placement rates. \"Washington University is extremely welcoming to veterans,\" says Thomas, whose hometown is Lexington, Kentucky. \"If they hadn't opened their doors to me I don't know where I'd be now. I really feel prepared to jump into any finance job now.\" Jumping into a finance job is exactly what Thomas is doing. After earning his degree, he accepted a position as an investment banking analyst at Stifel Financial Corporation. He credits his experience at Olin, which \"definitely beat [his] expectations\"\u2014especially the faculty. \"I can't express how awesome the faculty are. They push you to think critically about the details buried in the mechanics and theory of corporate finance. And their doors are open all the time.\" A VETERAN LEADER The skills Thomas Napier developed in the Marines translate well to business THOMAS NAPIER DOUBLE DUTY Sijia Li focuses her energy on thinking outside of the boxSIJIA SCARLETT LI \"I wouldn't call myself a traditional business student,\" says Sijia Scarlett Li of Beijing, China, who simultaneously earned an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and a master's degree in supply chain management. It was this opportunity to pursue her unique interests and goals through a dual degree in Olin's Specialized Master's Program that drew her to Washington University in the first place. \"Olin doesn't promote a cookie cutter by Scarlett (MSSCM '14). \"It encourages students to shine in their own ways. People can come from different backgrounds and still feel comfortable.\" Scarlett's comfort level at Olin prompted her to stretch herself through experiential learning opportunities. As part of the Boeing Center for Technology, Information, and Manufacturing Practicum Project with Monsanto, Scarlett helped the corporation to improve its forecasting system and reduce inventory costs. \"We helped create a model that helps them know optimal inventory numbers to save money. It was a great way to apply the knowledge from class in the real world, and it also affirms my interest in business,\" says Scarlett, who, since middle school, has envisioned being a businesswoman. As vice president of the Olin Supply Chain Club, Scarlett gained experience working with students across programs (both Specialized Masters and MBA), organizing events like tours, case competitions, and seminars, while also building a professional network. All this hands-on experience, along with Scarlett's dual degree, led to an ideal summer internship in the Global Engineering Department at Sigma-Aldrich. \"I'll really be able to approach my work there from a dual-knowledge perspective,\" she says. \"They like people who can think out of the business box, with a science or engineering background.\" SUPPORTING VETERANS In spite of the exceptional credentials, talents, and attributes that military veterans bring to the table, they often face specific challenges as they transition into civilian business careers. For this reason, Weston Career Center coaches veterans on how to translate military experience and skills into civilian terminology and how to effectively communicate their value proposition\u2014for example, skills in multitasking, working under pressure, and leading and managing teams.In partnership with the Olin Veteran Association, Weston Career Center sponsors events dedicated to connecting Washington University and Olin alums with incoming veterans for the purposes of mentoring, professional development, and networking. The career center also publishes a list of military-friendly employers and national recruiting events.

The University's seven schools offer a multitude of areas of study to students. Students are encouraged to take classes across disciplines in 90 undergraduate programs, 22 combined programs, and 1,500 courses offered. Students can earn a second major or minor from Olin, and also declare a minor or second major in an area of study outside of business\u2014for example, history, engineering, physics, or art.

From being a campus tour guide and serving as personnel chair for Chi Omega Women's Fraternity, to involvement in both the Women's Mentor Program and the Latino Youth Mentor Program, Emma has enriched her classroom work with plenty of hands-on learning opportunities. \"You build a knowledge base in your classes, but applying it in real situations is everything,\" Emma says, referencing her negotiations class as an example, and the valuable communication skills she was able to immediately apply in her role at Chi Omega. \"It gives me a chance to work with people, see the big picture, and get practice dealing with stressful situations.\" Emma is also committed to broadening her international perspective. She is a Spanish language major in the School of Arts and Sciences, in addition to her majors in organizational behavior and marketing, and she traveled to Madagascar in May as part of the course \"Sustainable Development and Conservation: Madagascar Project.\" Once in Mahabo, Madagascar, the students built a biosand water filter, working and living with the people who would directly benefit from the project. \"Olin values an international perspective toward business, which is incredibly important,\" says Emma, who is planning to study in Spain for a semester her junior year. \"It challenges how you do things and forces you to see problems and solutions from different perspectives.\" Even with all she is involved in during the school year, Emma has made a point of leveraging her summers as well. The summer after her freshman year, Emma was a change management intern at Amtrak during the company's extensive reorganization. \"I was attracted to this opportunity,\" she says, \"because in an atmosphere of change, even an intern can have great impact on the company's final direction.\" The summer after her sophomore year, Emma was a marketing intern at Fenwal, Inc., a global blood technology company. While she doesn't plan on slowing her pace any time soon, Emma says Olin helps her maintain a healthy balance. \"I've always been very driven, but there's a good balance at WU . . . of being challenged but not pushing yourself over the edge.\" LEARNING AND DOING From mentoring opportunities to a trip to Madagascar, Emma Benjamin seeks out hands-on experiencesEMMA BENJAMIN As a first-generation American, undergraduate Emma Benjamin says her South African-born parents instilled in her the concept of the American dream\u2014of working hard and seeking opportunity.

Students are also able to engage in cross-cultural experiences on campus by taking advanced language classes, joining an international or multicultural club, and tutoring international students\u2014or being tutored by them. Olin Business School's educational partnerships inform students' perspectives, skills, and competencies. The school has relationships with Fudan University in Shanghai, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, ESCP Europe Business School in France, Singapore Management University, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas in Brazil, The Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Israel, Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management at Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, Yonsei School of Business in South Korea, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and Otto Beisheim School of Management in Germany, among others. Olin also manages Brookings Executive Education through a partnership between the University and the Brookings Institution, an independent, nonpartisan think tank based in Washington, D.C. Molly Sonderman Assistant Director, Global Outreach & Business DevelopmentWeston Career CenterTHE OLIN DIFFERENCE \"Being involved in all these opportunities assured me that I can pursue my passion for the environment through my interest and skills in business.\" Name: Ashwin Ramanan Hometown: Chennai, IndiaDegree: MBA CitibankOrganizing and Leading the Way Ashwin Ramanan s natural skills are refined and leveraged through extracurricularsASHWIN RAMANAN Working for five years as a financial software applications analyst illuminated two personal truths for Ashwin Ramanan: the first was that he wants a career that focuses on leadership, and the second was that an MBA was the best way to hone his natural leadership skills. \"In my position [as an analyst], I had the opportunity to work with multiple teams and was ready to move into a career focused on leadership,\" says Ashwin (MBA '15), who was attracted to Olin's emphasis on collaboration. \"Olin also focuses on diversity of thought, which is important to the core of decision-making skills and critical thinking. For anyone who wants to develop leadership skills, the first skill is critical thinking\u2014I saw how important this was in my work experience.\" Ashwin, who is from Chennai, India, was also drawn to Olin's size and friendliness\u2014particularly \"the camaraderie between domestic and international students.\" Once on campus, he wasted no time putting his leadership skills to use. In his first year as an MBA student, he served as cochairman of the Olin Ambassador Club and vice president of the Olin Finance Club, and was also involved in the Olin Net Impact Club and Olin India Club. \"It is important to me to have opportunities to meet experts in many different industries, and to be a part of so many clubs,\" Ashwin says. \"Interacting with a wide variety of people helps you align your goals.\"Of all the experiences he's had so far, Ashwin says his work helping to organize events for the Finance Club stands out. \"I had many opportunities to meet inspirational leaders in the financial services industry. In one instance, I moderated a panel discussion that involved a heated debate between two industry experts in front of a large audience. It was a great experience.\" A lifelong passion for the environment has also been nurtured during Ashwin's time at Olin. He has participated in the Olin Sustainability Case Competition, discussed ideas with Washington University's director of sustainability, and interacted with nonprofit organizations doing environmental projects in the community. After a summer internship with Citibank, where Ashwin worked on a strategic markets project to help banks participate in fair lending practices for low- and middle-income customers, he will be poised to see all of his leadership experiences and skills coalesce during his second year at Olin, ultimately launching him into his career. \"I want to be a leader because I have a vision of what I think the future should be, and because I'm wanting to give back\u2014to help people be their best and develop strengths.\" \" Olin s tudents have global perspective, technical expertise, multilingual fluency, and cross-cultural savvy. Our international students are among the top scholars in their home countries and bring firsthand knowledge of global business practices and customs. Our domestic students benefit from the infusion of diverse worldwide viewpoints, and international students gain insight into American business practices.\" Washington U welcomes students and faculty from all 50 states and more than 100 countries. states50 & 100+ countries 16 OlinCareers.wustl.edu 314-935-5950 wcc@olin.wustl.edu When Jiang Lu was looking at graduate programs in business, he knew the people he would be learning from and with would be just as critical to his education as the quantitative finance knowledge he came to study. \"School is not only about knowledge, but also about the people you're going to meet,\" says Lu, who goes by L.J. (MSFQ '14). \"I could tell that the people at Olin were people I wanted to interact with and learn from.\" L.J., who is from Nanchang, China, says the \"open culture\" at Olin was particularly important to him as an international student. \"In all the classes I took, the professors all encourage in-class discussion. Everyone is welcome to share their opinions and thoughts,\" L.J. says. \"A lot of the classes have a group project component, where this open culture is enhanced in a collaborative way, which promotes critical thinking and teamwork. . . . It's not just about communicating with different people, but also problem solving within diverse groups. It's good to push myself out of my comfort zone.\" This level of openness and interaction led L.J. to get involved in an abundance of activities outside of the classroom. As president of the Quantitative Finance Club, he led the organization in a variety of networking events, including a trip to Chicago for office and firm visits. L.J. also represented Olin as the team leader in the Rotman International Trading Competition 2014 hosted by the University of Toronto. After earning his degree, L.J. was looking forward to a summer internship with RGA in its Quantitative Risk Management Group, and the opportunities it would give him to apply a whole range of skills and knowledge he's acquired at Olin, both in and out of class.A KNACK FOR NETWORKING Group projects and open discussions honed Jiang Lu's skills, knowledge, and goals JIANG LU IN TOUCH Miranda Davis knows firsthand the value of real-world learning opportunitiesMIRANDA DAVIS Olin's Career Platform philosophy guides MBA students into one of five functional or industry-focused curricula\u2014Consulting, Corporate Finance and Investments, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, and Operations and Supply Chain Management\u2014early in the program. Each Platform includes an industry overview seminar (featuring a variety of corporate speakers representing a broad cross section of the industry/function), experiential learning course, career-specific concentration options, access to alumni and industry contacts, club involvement, and more. Students learn critical and creative thinking along with core curriculum, business fundamentals, management models, and career-specific insight and knowledge. All these skills are integrated into experiential-learning opportunities that challenge students and prepare them to contribute to their job on day one.STUDENT CLUB ENGAGEMENT More than 300 Washington University organizations and nine businesses are run by students, affording them the opportunity to better develop their leadership skills. These student-led groups focus on a wide range of industries, business functions, community service, and extracurricular activities. Throughout the academic year, students partner with the Weston Career Center to offer industry-specific and career search-focused workshops that prepare students for the real world. Career-related events, workshops, and seminars bring industry leaders to campus to discuss current business topics and to meet with students. FINDING A FOCUS: MBA CAREER PLATFORMS With degrees in marketing and law, Miranda Davis entered Olin with a rich skill set ready to be honed and tapped. Three experiential learning projects and an MBA later, she was feeling ready for just about anything. \"Hands-on projects are a great way to try out your skills,\" says Miranda (MBA '14), who served as president of the Student Advisory Board and VP of marketing for the Olin Marketing Association.\"A lot of the little things you learn in the classroom seem like minute details at the time, then you see how they fit. It's like you're taking all the pieces of the puzzle from your classes and bringing them together in a way that suddenly makes so much sense.\" In her third project with Olin's Center for Experiential Learning, Miranda led a seven-member team in London, where they met with media companies to discuss the research project they were launching for their client, Second Street. \"The London project was really about creating a sales pitch and explaining our project goals to people,\" Miranda says. \"It was a hands-on experience that proved to me that I have what it takes to succeed when I leave Olin.\" As a marketing intern at Nestl\u00e9 Purina in 2013, Miranda clearly proved herself, too\u2014she garnered a marketing associate job offer from the Fortune 500 corporation. \"I came to Olin because I wanted to work for Purina,\" says Miranda, who won the Olin MBA Milford Bohm Prize in Marketing. \"Two weeks into my time at Olin, I was already on the pathway to interviewing for my dream internship, which I landed two months later. My dream internship turned into my dream job, and I could not be happier!\" Name: Miranda Davis Hometown: St. Louis, MODegree: Nanchang, ChinaDegree: MSFQ '14Internship/Job: at Reinsurance Group of America \" Olin Busines s School students have numerous opportunities to supplement strong academic achievement by demonstrating initiative and leadership\u2014behaviors highly valued by prospective employers.
