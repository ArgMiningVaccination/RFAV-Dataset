Acupuncture, a traditional medicine of China, is a method of using very fine, sterile, stainless steel needles to stimulate the body's own natural healing process. The vital energy of the body is known as QI (pronounced \"chee\"). Symptoms arise when the flow of the body's vital energy - QI - is obstructed. Acupuncture aids in removing these obstructions over time and encourages the QI energy to again flow smoothly. Research has shown that stimulating acupuncture points triggers several measurable changes in various body systems including the nervous system and the circulatory system. Acupuncture patients can maximize the effectiveness of their treatment by following proper dietary and lifestyle guidelines. In an official report from the World Health Organization, Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials, the WHO has listed over 100 diseases, symptoms and conditions for which the therapeutic effect of acupuncture has been shown.
