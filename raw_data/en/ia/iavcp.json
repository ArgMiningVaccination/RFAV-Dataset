Whether you're just starting out or you've already had a long journey with meditation, having a comfortable, soothing space is crucial for [creating a meditation practice you'll stick with](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-start-meditating). The best meditation pillows will keep your body as comfortable and relaxed as your mind. To learn more about what to look for in a meditation pillow, we enlisted the help of meditation expert, yoga teacher, and reiki master [Susy Markoe Schieffelin](https://thecoppervessel.com/). Below, find our picks for the best meditation pillows of 2023, along with expert advice on how to use them, who can benefit from them, and what to look for when shopping for your own. The best meditation pillows of 2023: [Seat of Your Soul Crescent Meditation Inflatable Zafu](https://zafu.net/product/inflatable-zafu) [Go to review](#review-item-9) The best meditation pillows of 2023: What is a meditation pillow? \"Meditation pillows are cushions that are specifically designed to support a straight spine and good posture, as well as to help make seated meditation more comfortable,\" Schieffelin explains. \"They are different from traditional pillows in their shape and also in that they are usually firmer, rather than cushy and comfortable for relaxation or sleep.\" Meditation pillows generally fall into one of two categories: - Zafu: Schieffelin describes this as \"a round cushion, often with gathered sides, that helps elevate the hips to make the cross-legged or kneeling position more comfortable.\" While zafu means \"sewn seat\" in English, it translates as \"seat reedmace\" in Japanese. These cushions are said to have originated in Japan, where they were stuffed with reedmace down and used in zazen Zen meditation. - Zabuton: \"These are large, thin, rectangular cushions that are placed beneath a zafu to create a comfortable base,\" Schieffelin says. Zabuton, which literally means \"sit\" and \"futon,\" is a floor cushion traditionally used in daily life and meditation. How do you use a meditation pillow? There are many ways to use a pillow during meditation. \"You can use a meditation pillow in whichever way best supports your meditation practice, but people typically use them to elevate their hips while seated cross-legged in easy pose or to serve as a cushion between their sitz bones and heels when seated in a kneeling meditative position,\" Schieffelin explains. Since your [meditation practice](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-start-meditating) is meant to be a nurturing, supportive experience, your pillow should enhance that by keeping your body in alignment. Who should use a meditation pillow? Schieffelin says meditation pillows can be used for \"anyone who is interested in feeling more comfortable and supported in their mediation practice.\" She goes on to explain that, \"Pillows are especially helpful for people who aren't flexible, feel stiff in their body, have trouble sitting on the floor, or tend to fall asleep when meditating. Meditation pillows support good posture, which can help you stay present, alert, and comfortable during meditation.\" Regardless of your age or meditation style, a cushion can make your meditation much more comfortable. There are even meditation pillows designed specifically for children, so kids can get in on the Zen time, too. Our picks for the best meditation pillows of 2023: Best for Back Pain: Seat of Your Soul Crescent Meditation Cushion Pros: - GOTS-certified organic cotton cover - Adjustable buckwheat filling - Variety of colors Cons: - Narrow for some people Materials:Organic cotton cover with 100% buckwheat hull filling Dimensions:17\" x 10.5\" x 5\" Colorways:10 options If back pain is interrupting your peace, this Seat of Your Soul Crescent Meditation Cushion may be the answer. Top-quality, USA-farmed buckwheat hulls are dust filtered and inspected before being placed inside an inner pouch within a GOTS-certified organic cotton cover. You can customize the filling to your needs by adding or removing a portion of the buckwheat. The cover is removable, machine-washable, and comes in 10 different colors. This cushion supports people up to 350 pounds and features double stitching for more durability. A subtle carrying strap makes it easy to carry from room to room or to your yoga studio. As the buckwheat conforms to your shape, it encourages healthy posture and spinal alignment. The crescent shape gives more support to the thighs while accommodating different positions, although a few users felt it was a bit narrow. Some people also used it as a bed pillow or between their knees while sleeping. With over 1,100 ratings, most of them 5-star, the Seat of Your Soul Crescent Meditation Cushion has proven to be a fan favorite, especially for those with back pain. An enthusiastic buyer says, \"I bought this for casual floor sitting since our new luxury couches were killing my back...my lower back and hips would just ache and make me hobble...This one is super well made...It gets my back straight, keeps me on my sitz bones, and my legs take much longer to fall asleep.\" Best for Tight Hips: Florensi Meditation Cushion Pros: - Attractive aesthetic - Removable filling - Machine-washable cover Cons: - Heavy Materials:Velvet cover with 100% organic buckwheat filling and padded foam disc Dimensions:16\" x 5\" Colorways:6 options An Amazon bestseller, this meditation pillow is stylish, comfortable, and durable.

Pillows made from buckwheat alone can be firm for some, but this one has a cushy foam layer on top of the hulls. If your hips and behind are sensitive, this feature is especially helpful. Another fun perk, the cushion has a carrying handle for easy movement (which comes in handy because it is on the heavier side). Due to the soft, absorbent nature of the cover, this cushion should be used indoors. With almost [7,000 5-star ratings on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3PHx0eZ), this cushion gets praise for its \"exquisite\" stitching and detailing, how durable it is, and of course the eco-friendly materials.

Here are three important factors to keep in mind when choosing one: Comfort: Your physical size and flexibility will determine which pillow works best. When it comes time to shop, Schieffelin says, \"Have fun with it and know that your comfort is ultimately what matters most.\" Materials: According to Schieffelin, you should find a cushion that attracts and inspires you. She tells us, \"Choose a material that feels attractive and comfortable to you.\" Longevity: If meditation is part of your daily routine, you want a pillow made to last. Schieffelin's recommendation is \"a pillow made of natural materials that are sustainably sourced. Many are made of cotton or canvas.\" FAQ What are meditation pillows filled with? Most natural pillows are stuffed with buckwheat hulls, kapok, or cotton. Synthetic cushions are not as durable or popular and typically use memory foam or polyester. What size should a meditation pillow be? Whatever size is comfortable for you! Schieffelin says people with flexible hips often prefer a \"smaller, shorter pillow filled with husks or seeds for easy adjustment.\" Tall people and those with less flexibility may like a pillow that is \"taller and firmer.\" Can you use any pillow for meditation? Yes, but most traditional couch pillows lack a meditation pillow's firm support that keeps the spine aligned and likely won't be as comfortable over an extended period of time. Is it better to meditate lying down or sitting? This is a matter of preference and circumstance. When meditating in the evening before going to sleep, lying down can help you relax and fall asleep more quickly. However, sitting up is generally preferred for [morning meditation](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/benefits-of-meditating-every-morning) sessions, to avoid the urge to catch a few extra winks. The takeaway.
