Thank You! [NadjaLind.com](https://NadjaLind.com) Never ever would I have imagined my 'Turning In' music would give me my life back! ...Many years of my life I suffered from severe PTSD symptoms including depression and addiction. Constantly haunted by horrific memories replaying in my body-mind I couldn't bare being still. Every single time I fell asleep from pure exhaustion even for only five minutes I had severe flashbacks and nightmares of the worst kind, so vividly I could even SMELL the perpetrators. I was miserable, sleep-deprived and my self-esteem was so low that I even would go so far as to say I hated myself. There were times when I didn't even open the curtains. I felt so empty inside I had not even tears left.I felt lost, stuck, broken and hopeless since usual therapies didn't really do much for me. What happened next forever changed my life: Creating music has always been my refuge and one night working on a dance music track I got really frustrated since nothing seemed to work. Except for this beautiful, layered melody caught my attention. When I removed the beat I immediately got carried away by the flow and deeply affected by the soundtrack because when I came out of it I felt like I was reborn - so refreshed, relieved, full of energy and so much lighter. Suddenly I connected what I had learned earlier studying about the brain and healing post traumatic stress and Shapiro's book on her EMDR findings and started experimenting with (binaural) healing frequencies. Neuroplasticity at work: Whenever I put my earphones on and listen to 'Turning in' my nervous system relaxes, my thoughts quiet, my body gets still and I can actually feel my brain rewiring and healing. Every day I feel lighter, calmer, focused, refreshed, awake, energised, alive, relieved, healed and confident. Of all the electronic music I've been producing my healing ambient frequencies have given my life back. I am so grateful for this frequency healing journey! YOU CAN CHANGE Nadja Your feedback and testimonials are always welcome. Thank you so much for buying my music & your support. (Nadja) EXCLUSIVE ON BANDCAMP 'Abundance' is the new 'Turning in, Vol. 15', a bundle of beautiful, hypnotic meditative ambient music with a touch of fairy dust & glitter effects and a wide range of binaural entrainment frequencies (delta, theta, alpha) and Solfeggio (396, 528, 741 Hz) tones to choose from. Abundance can help you to boost your overall wellbeing and performance. A note from Nadja: My personal favorite binaural entrainment frequency is theta brain waves. I've worked with theta to rewire my unconscious programs and raise my energy towards opening to the quantum field in order to attract possibilities, synchronicity and opportunities and also for boosting my overall wellbeing and health and reprogram old data which is no longer supportive for me today. Specifically, I detect and write down a list of areas in my life that are not going as well as I would like, and then, while listening to my theta hypnosis entrainment, I focus on how I wish things were instead\u2014what I would like to see, hear, feel, taste, touch, and smell\u2014all as precisely as possible. If my mind wanders, I simply come back to my visualization focus. I love listening to Abundance when I want change in my life or also when I feel tired or down, contracted, stuck in thought loops, or experiencing creative blocks and want to ease my body-mind (actually there is no such a 'thing' as mind) into a state of calm openness. It helps me loosen up, relax, get into a flow state, being more creative and focus on my vision and deeper purpose. I listen to this music either lying down or sitting upright with closed eyes preferably eye shades on. The less distraction from the outside world the better for your theta state. Remember, theta is right before sleep, meaning body asleep but you are still present and aware of what's going on. I also love listening to Abundance as background music for working, sometimes for meditating, getting into a lighter mood, for clarity, to relax, or during my Savasana yoga practice. With headphones, you will get the full spectrum of sound and the maximum effect from the binaural entrainments and music composition. I highly recommend to listen with quality headphones, cheap earbuds tend to cut out important frequencies. Many years ago I was blown away when I learned that it is the ENVIRONMENT and its signals that is responsible for e.g. stem cells develop into an ear or a toe! It is the science of epigenetics that shows how our genes can be modified through changes in the environment, changes in our perceptions (!), our behaviors, and our consciousness. So, how can we reprogram our subconscious minds to work for us rather than against us when the subconscious is a million times more powerful than our conscious thoughts? Around 95% of the day, what makes up your life is not coming from your conscious thoughts, intentions, wishes, or desires. Rather, for an overwhelming 95% of your day, you are subconsciously responding to automatic thought patterns and programs you are not consciously aware of. Every thought has a frequency, and every frequency carries information. Unfortunately, most of them are not necessarily positive and supportive; they actually tend to have more of a negative, repetitive nature, which then triggers corresponding feelings with the same vibration, which triggers even more negative thoughts! (They can even be passed on through generations.) Unconsciously, we become caught up in a vicious cycle of disempowerment and self-sabotage. Children are in a hypnotic state until they reach the age of seven: everything they experience is imprinted in their subconscious mind without any analytical filter. So, as a child, your brain was operating with theta brain waves for the first seven years of your life. Theta is a lower vibration than the analytical mind or consciousness. It is also the frequency induced for hypnosis. As children, we are vibrating at a frequency that enables us to download thousands of programs / information simply through observation in the blink of an eye. It's like pressing a record button and copying onto a hard drive. After seven years of age, our brain waves change from theta to alpha and then beta where the door to the subconscious mind is either narrowed or closed in those states. In order to reopen this door, you need to get into a relaxed state -- like when you're lying I a cozy bed -- so that your frequency drops out of beta to alpha and into theta brain waves. Your conscious mind then quiets down, and you are back in the frequency of self-hypnosis where everything is possible! As in all my music I added some ASMR inducing sounds (even in my electronic dance and club music). Thank you for supporting and buying my music. I hope you enjoy this bundle of ambient drone music and get the best results through the entrainment. I'd love to hear from you about your experiences. Feel free to write a comment how you use it. Would be interesting for me and other listeners to know. Nadja \"I highly recommend Bruce Lipton PhD 'The Wisdom of your cells' & 'The Biology of Belief' and Dr. Joe Dispenza's books e.g. You are the Placebo & Braking The Habit of being Yourself & Being Supernatural...\" Testimonials: \"I was lucky to get Nadja's abundance meditation some time before the release and I used it a lot - sometimes daily - for my meditation and manifestation practice. For deep flow and manifestation work this is my absolute favorite track - it instantly puts me in the right place inside myself to rewire, rewrite and recreate my mental and emotional patterns. So powerful!\" - Aaron B. \"I love Nadja and everything she musically creates. I have been enjoying her sound and it's effects on me deeply for many years now. As well techno as her binaural mediation music are distinct! Her mindset and her purpose are being conveyed through her music and therfore pervading me as well.
