The campus has recommended that other local colleges and universities do the same.Vaccinationis a valuable first line of defense against this debilitating infection and can be the difference between a few isolated cases and a full-blown outbreak. Throughout the years, medical professionals observed that if people recovered from an infectious disease, they rarely exhibited a second case. Scientist Edward Jenner put this phenomenon to the test in the late 1790s. Smallpox, a highly infectious disease characterized by small lesions on the skin, ravaged society for centuries. By exposing a healthy patient to a similar, yet less lethal virus, Jenner was able to make this individual immune to smallpox. This method of transferring resistance, calledvaccination(from the Latinvaccus, the word for cow), changed the way we look at disease prevention. The World Health Organization went on to lead a large vaccination campaign against smallpox, and in 1977 the last case of smallpox was reported. Mass efforts to vaccinate against the disease practicallyeradicatedor wiped smallpox off the planet. Isolated cases, however, do arise and some scientists fear the use of the smallpox virus as a biological weapon. Mrs. Smith had her children vaccinated when they were younger, but she did not have Sue vaccinated against bacterial meningitis. The family begins discussing vaccinations and decides it would be prudent to create a schedule of vaccinations that can be shared among the couples with children. Mrs. Smith does not plan on having any more children. James's brother Sean and his wife, Meg, have just had a baby; she knows that James's brother Aaron and his wife, Gina, are thinking of starting a family. Meg and Sean were shocked at how many shots new baby Tyler had to have in the first months of his life. In this activity, you will investigate how vaccines interact with the immune system. By interviewing family members or friends from different generations, you will discover the effect this medical intervention has had on public health and disease prevention in the past century. "}
