Reference ID: 4803215 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis . Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. The median time to first onset of increased ALT/ AST was 9 weeks (range: 0.3 to 42). Increased ALT /AST leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 7% of patients. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to increased ALT /AST in 2.0% of patients. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity . Monitor liver function test s (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin ) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severi ty of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2. 3), Adverse Reactions (6.1 )]. 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal . Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset , and 1 case was fatal . The median time to first onset for ILD/pneumonitis was 2 weeks (range: 2 to 18 weeks ). LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients. Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in pati ents with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in pr actice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to LUMAKRAS as a single agent at 960 mg orally once daily in 357 patients in with NSCLC and other solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation enrolled i n CodeBreaK 100, 28% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 3% were exposed for greater than one year. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of LUMAKRAS was evaluated in a subset of patients with KRAS G12C -mutated locally advanced NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Patients received LUMAKRAS 960 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n = 204 ). Among patients who received LUMAKRAS, 39% were exp osed for 6 months or longer and 3% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of patients who received LUMAKRAS was 66 years (range : 37 to 86); 55% female ; 80% White, 15% Asian, and 3 % Black . Reference ID: 4803215 Serious adverse reactions occurred in 50% of patients treated with LUMAKRAS. Serious adverse reactions in 2 % of patients were pneumonia (8 %), hepatotoxicity ( 3.4%), and diarrhea (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients who received LUMAKRAS due to respiratory failure (0.8%), pneumonitis (0.4%), cardiac arrest cardiac failure (0.4%), (0.4%), and pneumonia (0.4%). Permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LUMAKRAS in 2% of patients included hepatotoxic ity (4.9%). Dosage interruptions of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption 2% were hepatotoxicity pneumonia (2.5%). Dose reductions of LUMAKRAS due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5% of patients.

Avoid c oadministration of LUMAKRAS with proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs), H2 receptor antagonist s, and locally acting antacids. If coadministration with an acid -reducing agent cannot be avoided , administer LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after administration of a local ly acting antacid [see Dosage and Administration (2 .4)]. Strong CYP3A4 LUMAKRAS concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology which reduce efficacy of sotorasib c oadministration of LUMAKRAS with strong CYP3A4 inducers . 7.2 on CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration of LUMAKRAS with a CYP3A 4 its plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may reduce the efficacy of the substrate. Avoid coadministration of LUMAKRAS with CYP3A 4 sensitive substrates , for which minimal concentration changes may lead to therapeutic Reference ID: 4803215 failures of the substrate . If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the sensitive CYP3A 4 substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information . P-glycoprotein (P concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may increase the adverse of digoxin. Avoid coadministration of LUMAKRAS with P-gp substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities . If coadministration cannot be avoided, decrease the P-gp substrate dosage in accordance with its Prescribing Information . 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on LUMAKRAS use in pregnant women. In rat and rabbit embryo -fetal development studies, oral sotorasib did not cause adverse developmental effects or embryo -lethality at exposures up to 4.6 times the human exposure at the 960 mg clinical dose (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In a rat embryo -fetal development study, once daily oral administration of sotorasib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity at the 540 mg/kg dose level [approximately 4.6 times the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the clinical dose of 960 mg]. Sotorasib did not cause adverse developmental effects and did not affect embryo -fetal survival at doses up to 540 mg/kg. In a rabbit embryo -fetal development study , once daily oral administration of sotorasib during the period of organogenesis resulted in lower fetal body weights and a reduction in the number of ossified metacarpals in fetuses at the 100 mg/kg dose level ( approximately 2.6 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 960 mg), which was associated with maternal toxicity including decreased body weight gain and food consumption during the dosing phase. Sotorasib did not cause adverse developmental effects and did not affect embryo -fetal survival at doses up to 100 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of sotorasib or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LUMAKRAS and for 1 week after the final dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LUMAKRAS have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 357 patients with any tumor type who received LUMAKRAS 960 mg orally once daily in CodeBreaK 100 , 46% were 65 and over, and 10 % were 75 and over . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older patients and younger patients . Reference ID: 4803215 11 DESCRIPTION Sotorasib is a n inhibitor of the RAS GTPase family . The molecular formula is C 30H30F2N6O3, and the molecular weight is 560.6 g/mol. The is shown below: Sotorasib has pKa values of 8.06 and 4.56. The solubility of sotorasib in the aqueous media decreases over the range pH 1.2 to 6.8 from 1.3 mg/mL t o 0.03 mg/mL. LUMAKRAS is supplied as film -coated tablets for oral use containing 120 mg of sotorasib . Inactive ingredients in the tablet core are microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The film coating material consists of polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, talc, and iron oxi de yellow . 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sotorasib is an inhibitor of KRASG12C, a tumor -restricted -oncogenic GTPase, KRAS. forms an irreversible, covalent bond with the unique cysteine of KRASG12C, locking the protein in an inactive state that prevents downstream signaling without affecting wild -type KRAS. Sotorasib blocked KRAS signaling, inhibited cell growth, and promoted apoptosis only in KRAS G12C tumor cell lines. Sotorasib inhibited KRASG12C in vitro and in vivo with minimal detectable off -target activity. In mouse tumor xenograft models sotorasib -treatment led to tumor regressions and prolonged survival and was associated with anti- tumor immunity in KRAS G12C models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sotorasib exposure -response relationships and the time course of the pharmacodynamic response are unknown. Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended dosage, LUMAKRAS does not cause large mean increases in the QTc interval (> 20 msec) . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sotorasib have been characterized in healthy subjects and in patients with KRAS G12C -mutated solid tumors, Reference ID: 4803215 pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 180 mg to 960 mg (0.19 to 1 time the approved recommended dosage) once daily with similar systemic exposure (i.e., AUC 0-24h and C max) across doses at steady -state. Sotorasib systemic exposure was comparable between film -coated tablets and film -coated tablets predispersed in water administered under fasted conditions. Sotorasib plasma concentrations reached steady state within 22 days. No accumulation was observed after repeat LUMAKRAS dosages with a mean accumulation ratio of 0.56 ( coefficient of variation (CV) : 59%) . Absorption The median time to sotorasib peak plasma concentration is 1 hour. Effect of Food When 960 mg LUMAKR AS was administered with a high -fat, high -calorie meal (containing approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively) in patients, sotorasib AUC 0-24h increased by 25% compared to administration under fasted conditions. Distribution The sotorasib mean volume of distribution (Vd) at steady state is 211 L (CV: 135%). In vitro , sotorasib plasma protein binding is 89%. Elimination The sotorasib mean terminal elimination half-life is 5 hours (standard deviation (SD): 2) . At 960 mg LUMAKRAS once daily, the sotorasib steady state apparent clearance is 26.2 L/hr (CV: 76%) and oxidative metabolism CY P3As. single dose of radiolabeled s otorasib , 74% of the dose was recovered in feces (53% unchanged) and 6% (1% unchanged) in urine. Specific Population s No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of sotorasib were observed based on age (28 to 86 years) , sex, race (White, Black and Asian) , body weight (36.8 to 157.9 kg), line of therapy, ECOG PS (0, 1) , mild and moderate renal impairment ( eGFR: 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2), or mild hepatic impairment (AST or ALT < 2.5 \u00d7 ULN or total bilirubin < 1.5 \u00d7 ULN). The effect of severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment on sotorasib pharmacokinetics has not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and (8.7)] . Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Acid-Reducing Agents : Coadministration of repeat doses of omeprazole (PPI) with a single dose of LUMAKRAS decreased sotorasib Cmax by 65 % and AUC by 57% under fed conditions, and decreased sotorasib C max by 57% and AUC by 42% under fasted conditions . Coadministration of a single dose of famotidine ( H2 receptor antagonist) given 10 hours prior to and 2 hours after a single dose of LUMAKRAS under fed conditions decreased sotorasib Cmax doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) with a single dose of LUMAKRAS decreased sotorasib C max by 35% and AUC by 51%. Reference ID: 4803215 Other Drugs : No clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of sotorasib was observed following coadministration of LUMAKRAS with itraconazole (a combined strong CYP3A4 and P -gp inhibitor) and a single dose midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A 4 substrate) decreased midazolam C max by 48 % and AUC by 5 P-gp -K substrates : No clinically meaningful on the exposure of metformin (a MATE1 /MATE2 -K substrate) was observed Vitro Studies . 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sotorasib. Sotorasib was not mutagenic in a n in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not genotoxic in the in vivo rat micronucleus and comet assays. Fertility/early embryonic development studies were not conducted with sotorasib. There were no adverse effects on female or male reproductive organs in general toxicology studies conducted in dogs and rats . 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In rats, r enal toxicity including minimal to marked histologic tubular degeneration/necrosis and increased kidney weight, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and urinary biomarkers of renal tubular injury were present at doses resulting in exposures approximately 0.5 times the human AUC at the clinical dose of 960 mg. Increases in cysteine S-conjugate -lyase pathway metabolism in the rat kidney compared to human may make rats more susceptible to renal toxicity due to local formation of a putative sulfur -containing metabolite than human s. In the 3 -month toxicology study in dogs, sotorasib induced findings in the liver (centrilobular moderate to marked colloid depletion, and follicular cell hypertrophy) at exposures approximately 0.4 times the human exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 960 mg. These findings may be due to an adaptive response to hepatocellular enzyme induction and subsequent reduced thyroid hormone levels (i.e. secondary hypothyroidism). Althou gh thyroid levels were not measured in dogs, induction of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase known to be involved in thyroid hormone metabolism was confirmed in the in vitro dog hepatocyte assay. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of LUMAKRAS was demonstrated in a subset of patients enrolled in a single -arm, open -label, multicenter trial (CodeBreaK 100 [NCT03600883]) . Eligible patients w ere required to have locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC with dis ease progression after receiving an immune checkpoint inhibitor and/or platinum -based chemotherapy, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). Reference ID: 4803215 All patients were required to have prospectively identified KRAS G12C -mutated NSCLC in tumor QIAGEN therascreen\u00ae KRAS RGQ PCR Kit performed in a central laboratory. Of 126 total enrolled subjects, 2 (2%) were unevaluable for efficacy analysis due to the absence of radiographically measurable lesions at baseline. Of the 124 patients with KRAS G12C mutations confirmed in tumor tissue, plasma samples from 112 patients were tested retrospectively using the patients ( 28%) did not have KRAS G12C mutation identified in plasma specimen and 3/1 12 (2%) were unevaluable due to Guardant360\u00ae CDx test failure . A total of 124 patients had at least one measurable lesion at baseline assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to RECIST v1.1 and were treated with LUMAKRAS 960 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as evaluated by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the study population were: median age 64 years (range : 37 to 80) with 48% 65 years and 8% 75 former smokers, 12% current smokers, 5% never smokers. All patients received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC; 43% received only 1 prior line of therapy, 35% received 2 prior lines of therapy, 2 3% received 3 pr ior lines of therapy; 91% received prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 immunotherapy, 90% received prior platinum -based chemotherapy, 81% received both platinum -based chemotherapy and anti -PD-1/PD -L1. The sites of known extra -thoracic metastasis included 48% bone, 21% b rain, and 21% liver. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 5. Table 5.
