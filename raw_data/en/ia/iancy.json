There was also a signal that the treatment may also increase risk of adverse outcomes. The study was [published online](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.3066/full) February 8 in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. Under lead author Adrian Tan, MB ChB, of the University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Scotland, investigators evaluated whether an additional 3 years of a treatment strategy designed to normalize bone turnover in Paget's disease of bone (PDB) improved clinical outcomes relative to symptomatic treatment, especially clinical fracture, the primary end point of the PRISM-EZ study. In the original intensive-treatment arm of the PRISM study, the goal was to suppress bone turnover by reducing and maintaining serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentrations within the normal range, as the investigators explain. The aim of treatment in the symptomatic arm was to treat bone pain likely due to PDB, initially with analgesics or, if pain control was inadequate, with bisphosphonates. \"Participants who completed the PRISM study were invited to take part in a 3-year extension in which the same treatment strategies were continued but where zoledronic acid was used as the bisphosphonate of first choice in the intensive arm,\" they write. In the symptomatic PRISM-EZ arm, patients received a bisphosphonate only if bone pain likely due to increased PDB metabolic activity was present. Analgesics were permitted as required in both treatment groups. A total of 270 patients in the intensive-therapy arm transitioned into PRISM-EZ as did 232 patients originally assigned to the symptomatic arm. The average follow-up of PRISM was 4.3 years, and the total duration of follow-up on completion of the extension phase was 7.3 years. Approximately 28% of patients in the intensive arm received zoledronic acid during PRISM-EZ compared with about 10% of the symptomatic group (P < .001). On the other hand, significantly fewer participants in the intensive-treatment group, at about 5%, received pamidronate compared with about 15% of symptomatic patients (P < .001). The proportion of patients who received either risedronate or etidronate was similar in both arms. Serum ALP Concentrations \"Serum ALP concentrations were significantly lower in the intensive group at baseline, and the differences between groups increased as the study progressed,\" PRISM-EZ investigators report. Specifically, at study entry (baseline of PRISM-EZ), three-quarters of patients in the intensive group vs about 64% of those in the symptomatic group had normal or low ALP values. Over the 3-year extension study, these percentages continued to diverge and the difference between the 2 treatment arms was statistically significant throughout. Low-Normal to Normal Serum ALP Across were no clinically important differences in quality-of-life measures or bone pain between treatment groups,\" the group writes. At 1 year, changes in two indices of physical health \u2014 the physical-component-summary score and the arthritis-specific health index \u2014 favored patients in the intensive-treatment group, they add. Conversely, at year 3, changes in the mental-component-summary score favored those in the symptomatic-treatment group. However, as the authors point out, the effect size in body pain and other measures of physical health observed in the intensive-treatment group at 1 year was small and below the threshold that is considered clinically significant. Perhaps more important, there were numerically more fractures and orthopedic procedures in the intensive-treatment group over the 3-year extension trial, but the differences between the two groups were again not significant. On the other hand, fractures were significantly more common among patients who received treatment with a bisphosphonate regardless of the group they were in, at an overall fracture rate for both groups combined of 14.1% among bisphosphonate recipients vs only 1.5% of nonrecipients (P < .0001). Serious adverse-event rates were also similar in both groups, being reported by about one-third of patients in the intensive group vs 28% of those in the symptomatic group. Endocrine Society Recommendations PRISM-EZ study authors state that despite [ recent recommendations](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/835595) by the Endocrine Society to use bisphosphonates to treat most patients with PDB to normalize bone turnover and prevent complications, \"this remains unproven,\" they insist. However, when asked to counter this statement, chair of the Endocrine Society's guideline task force, Frederick Singer, MD, John Wayne Cancer Institute, Santa Monica, California, was highly critical of the design and the clinical outcomes of the PRISM trial and by inference, the PRISM-EZ findings. \"Any rational physician would use zoledronic acid first for the treatment of PDB, and a single infusion should last over 6 years \u2014 we have tons of data to support this,\" he explained to Medscape Medical News. The problem with PRISM-EZ study is that not only did most patients not receive zoledronic acid over the extension phase of the study, \"they were previously treated, and if you want to study Paget's disease, you must start with na\u00efve patients,\" Dr Singer insisted. \"That's how the clinical trials of the drugs we use in PDB were studied \u2014 in na\u00efve patients or in patients who hadn't been treated for a very long time,\" he added. Indeed, in a letter explaining why they felt PRISM trial did not prove that it is not beneficial to normalize bone turnover in Paget's disease, Dr Singer and task force colleagues point out that the levels of disease activity in the trial in both treatment groups were \"very modest\" (J Clin Endocrinol alkaline phosphatase levels that are 10% above the upper limit of normal with those whose mean level is 20% below the upper limit of normal,\" task force members write. Since both 10% above the upper limit of normal and 20% below the upper limit of normal are effectively within the normal range, \"these patients were already pretty much effectively treated,\" Dr Singer explained. Given that evidence clearly supports the use of bisphosphonates in Paget's disease, \"this study is really assessing the effect of additive treatment,\" guideline authors state, \"and the efficacy of the previous treatment is attested to by the fact that more than half of the subjects had normal alkaline phosphatase levels at baseline.\" Dr Tan reports no relevant financial relationships.
