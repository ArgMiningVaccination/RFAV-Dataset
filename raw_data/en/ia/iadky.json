Njar, Ph.D. Professor Department of Pharmacology University of Maryland, Baltimore Cancer is a \"moving target\" disease, as the conditi on progresses, critical driving oncogenes evolve. Effective treatment for cancers, such as prostate cancer (PC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are based o n targeting multiple oncogenes implicated in disease progression and drug resistan ce. Our group pioneered the development of galeterone ( gal, originally designated VN/124-1); a small molecule inhibitor that impedes both AR positive and negativ e tumor growth, suggesting its ability to modulate multiple oncogenes. The goal of this thesis was to assess the ability o f gal and novel analogs to modulate multiple oncogenic target s in a variety of clinically relevant human PC and PDAC models to inhibit cell viability, tumor growth and metastatic potential . Our studies show that gal and VNPT55 VNPT55 exhibiting additional effects on AR-V7 mRNA. We also observed significant gal/VNPT55-induced increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio prec eding cytochrome c release a concomitant of caspase 3 and PARP, culmina ting in apoptosis. implicated in invasiveness (NF-B, Twist1 axis), depleted MMP-2/-9 and and cell (CD44, Oct-4 and BMI-1). These effects resulted in inhibition of cellular biological activities (migration and invasion) in vitro . Furthermore, gal/analogs effectively decreased viability of several drug-resistant PC cells. Stron g anti-proliferative activity on gal- resistant cells by the novel analogs unraveled the lack of cross resistance. Additionally, anti-tumor activity of gal and VNPT55 on CWR22Rv1 x enograft (CRPC model) recapitulated in vitro activities of the compounds, with no apparent host toxicity. Finally, based on the findings that these agents effectively inhi bited pathways associated with PDAC disease progression and drug-r esistance, we assessed the potential of the agents as PDAC therapy. Gal/analogs alone or in combination with gemcitabine significantly decreased viability of gemcitabine-na ive/resistant PDAC cells. Gal/analogs also inhibited transcription factors, prominent in PDAC disease progression. These agents also caused strong growth inhibition of MiaPaCa-2 x enografts. Together, these data demonstrate that gal and novel analogs possess mult iple anti-cancer properties, providing a strong rationale for their development in prostat e and pancreatic cancer therapy.

I walked into my mentor's laboratory in 2012 and with out rotating in his laboratory, he took a leap of faith in me and assigned to me, one of hi s critical projects. I would like to express my profound and deepest gratitude to Professor Vincent C.O. Njar (Ph.D.) , my mentor, for his patience, wisdom, time, inspiration, ideas, immense knowledge, continuous optimism and enthusiasm, guidance and funding to ma ke my Ph.D. experience productive and thought-provoking. I rotated in a number of dif ferent laboratories and I could not have imagined having a better friend, fatherly-figure, a dvisor and mentor without whom this study would not have been possible. I appreciate yo ur efforts! I would also like to express my sincere appreciatio n to my dissertation committee members: Professors Renty Franklin (Ph.D.) and Anto nino Passaniti (Ph.D.), my thesis readers, for the exceptional and thorough work in r eviewing my dissertation. And also to Professors Katherine Squibb (Ph.D.), Arif Hussain ( M.D., Ph.D.) and Assistant Professor Laundette Jones (Ph. D), who were all very instrume ntal in the shaping and proper execution of my thesis project. Their different bac kgrounds, insightful comments and difficult questions encouraged and challenged me to widen my research from various perspectives. I would also like to thank members of the laborator y: Dr. Muirigi, Dr. Sean Vasaitis, David McCarty, Marlena Martin and v all my friends, for all the help with the numerous assays that I had to perform for this project. My gratitude goes especially to John Van Dyke Mensa h and the Armah family (specifically Sampson Armah, R.I.P, Olivia and Ange la Armah), for playing a pivotal role in the commencement of my cancer research career. W hen I needed support to undertake this journey, through you I have been blessed by Go d beyond measure. Thank you! Finally, my family has always been and continuously remain my strongest fortress and cornerstone. Throughout the course of my studie s, I found myself frustrated, stressed and overwhelmed occasionally. During those times my family was always there to get me back 'on track', where I needed to be, constantly r eminding me whence this journey started and why I needed to see it through to the end. The love, encouragement and understanding kept me focused with unwavering determination to co mplete this. To my family ( James and Elizabeth, my loving parents; Francis, Ernest, Clement, a BIG THANK YOU , I could not have achieved this without your preci ous support! vi If you can't explain it simply, you don't understan d it well enough. -Albert Einstein vii Table of Contents Chapter 1: Introduction .................................................. ........................................1 Cancer Overview ................................... ................................................... ............................. 5 Chapter 2: The Prostate: Structure and ..................................10 Prostate Gland function and 26 PSA Testing Examination ........................ ................................................... probed for in needle biopsies ............. ................................................... .............. 29 Staging and Grading ................................................... ........ 58 ..................59 Rationale-Prostate cancer .................................................. ......................................59 Hypothesis.........................................

afflicting about one in three Americans, has been and continuous to be a problem throughout history. It is the second leading cause of death in the United States as repo rted by Siegel et al (Siegel et al, 2015) and also by Heron (Figure 1) (Heron, 2015). Figure 1: Percent distribution of 10 leading causes of death, United States, 2012. Modified from Heron et al 2015 (Heron, 2015), highl ighting percentage of cancer afflicted in males and females in the United States. Cancer is a disease resulting from multiple molecul ar changes at the genomic level (Boutwell, 1974), which induces uncontrollable prol iferation (Friedewald & Rous, 1944) of transformed cells to form masses of tissue. This unchecked growth can result in a benign tumor, which does not invade into surrounding tissu es, or a malignant tumor which breaks off to invade and colonize nearby tissues as well a s distant organs. Cancer describes over 100 forms of related diseases affecting different o rgans in the human body. The frequently 2 occurring ones are few and cancers originating from 10 different sites accounts for about 81% of reported cases in the United states (Siegel et al, 2015). Molecular mutat ions that lead to neoplastic transformation commonly occur in many types of canc ers; however, there exist quite significant diversity among individual forms of can cers which are unique and can be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Regardless of the appreciable diversity between dif ferent cancers, the basic and fundamental defect common to all cancers is uncontr ollable cellular proliferation. This abnormal cell growth is regulated by an accumulatio n of activating mutations (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2000), gene amplification and loss of tu mor-suppressor function. For these mutations to have any effect on cell growth, they m ust induce the expression and activation of cell cycle genes culminating in cell growth. Sin ce a number of these transcription factors function by augmenting cell cycle progression (Alt ucci & Gronemeyer, 2001), to enhance cell proliferation (Figure 2), mutations that activ ate these receptors cause overactive signaling. At the core of neoplastic tumors, is a tightly regu lated balance between positive regulators (proto-oncogenes), negative regulators ( tumor-suppressor genes) and apoptotic regulators. Genes such as p21/waf1/Cip1, which is a ctivated by tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53), and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibito r 2A (p16 ink4A ) act as tumor suppressors and are most often mutated in the early stages of c arcinogenesis. P21 and p16 exert their actions by inhibiting cyclin dependent kinase(cdk) and inducing cell cycle arrest (Altucci & Gronemeyer, 2001). 3 Figure 2: Schematic illustration of the effects of Nuclear receptors on cell cycle Some steroid receptors (AR, ER and PR) stimulate ex pression of the gene that encodes cyclin D1, which interacts with and activates Cdk4, this enhances ce ll cycle progression and growth. In an opposite reg ulatory mode, vitamin D3 and retinoic acids can induce expr ession of the CKI p21, which blocks CDK activity, resulting in G1 arrest. Modified from Altucci et al 2001 (Altucci & Gronemeyer, 2001). . 4 Carcinogenesis Cancer formation involves conversion of benign hy perplastic cells to malignant cells, further genetic and epigenetic changes lead to invasion and metastasis of malignant cells (Balmain, 2001; Cairns, 1975; Jones & Baylin, 2002). Conceptually, carcinogenesis involves four (4) major processes: tumor initiation , promotion, malignant conversion and tumor progression. According to Knudson's \"two-hit\" hypothesis, the de velopment of a number of human cancers, implicates the loss of heterozygosit y (LOH) of tumor-suppressor genes (Knudson, 2001; Knudson, 1971; Knudson et al, 1976) . The basic feature of neoplastic development into individual tumors relies on the ab normal proliferation from a single altered cell. Cells undergo clonal expansion (Nowel l, 1976) to give rise to a tumor derived from that cell. Clonal expansion gives rise to a la rger population of cells that are susceptible to further genetic modifications and malignant conv ersion (Cairns, 1975; Verma & Boutwell, 1980). Normal cells undergo a stepwise pr ocess of accumulating molecular alterations to eventually culminate in malignant ne oplasm. However, not all tissue changes are cancer; several changes in tissues from abnorma l cell proliferation lead to conditions that may or may not lead to cancer Continuous proliferation of transformed cells may l ead to a buildup of cells that may still look normal (hyperplasia). There are seve ral instances where hyperplastic cells may be \"atypical\" and appear abnormal and can be pr emalignant. Chronic irritation of tissue epithelium can also lead to a change in cell type, with one cell type replacing the original cell type of that tissue which can be reve rsed when the stimulating pressure is removed (metaplasia) (Maitra et al, 1999). A more s erious alteration from abnormal tissue 5 growth can precede neoplasia (dysplasia). These cel ls look abnormal with maturation of the disordered cells and can lead to carcinoma in s itu, where the cells are localized in the originating tissue and not extended beyond that. Ev idence of this progression (metaplasia to dysplasia to neoplasia) is best exemplified in u terine, cervix and respiratory tract neoplasms (Maitra et al, 1999) represented in Figur e 3. Figure 3: Molecular analysis of EASI preps for the investigation of multistage carcinogenesis EASI preps resected from a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, showing different clusters of, Normal, hyperplastic, metaplastic, dysplastic, and neoplast ic epithelial cells The progression from normal to carcinoma shows a loss of heterozygosity of the p53 gene in metaplastic, dysplastic and carcinoma cell s. Modified from Maitra et al 1999 (Maitra et al, 1999 ) Cancer Staging Cancer is a complex syndrome with a progressive los s of gene function and activation mutations of several oncogenes, that imp acts cellular motility migration and invasion and invariably the stage of the disease. A proactive management of the disease makes it imperative to determine the severity of di sease to direct the course and options of treatment and prognosis. To determine the extent of cancer disease progression which aids 6 in predicting survival rates, most types are distin ctly classified into five (5) major stages, as represented in the schematic (Figure 4). Figure 4: Schematic illustrating progression of can cer disease Four basic stages with a \"pre-cancer stage\", stage 0, which can lead to cancer. Stage I-III predominan tly are localized with an increasing tumor size which may o r may not affect lymph nodes. Stage IV shows signs of a metastatic disease with a low survival rate. These major stages can then be sub-divided into sev eral sub-stages. Staging is dependent on a combination of three factors: the si ze of the tumor, involvement of the lymph nodes and spread of the disease (TNM designat ion)(Greene et al, 2002). Although, the TNM system of classification is usually utilize d, not all cancers can be staged with the TNM designation, like brain and spinal cancers. Can cers like blood, bone marrow and most types of leukemia do not have a clear cut staging s ystem. In the TNM designation, T- describes the tumor size, N- involvement of lymph n odes and M-describes whether the cancer has spread to surrounding and distant organs . In addition to the 3-step TNM system, different degrees of tumor size and invasion to dis tant organs are specified and denoted with numbers, higher numbers signifying the severit y of the malignancy at that stage. TIS describe carcinoma in situ and T1, a tumor that is more localized than a T4. N0 indicates 7 the lack of involvement of the lymph nodes whereas N1-N3, will describe lymph node involvement at varying degrees. In addition to the four major classes of cancer stages, most cancer types have a stage 0, which is also referred to as carcinoma in situ. Ordinarily, this could represent an early initiatio n of cancer; however, there are no signs of invasion of malignant cells into surroundi ng tissues. Stage I tumors are characterized by lesions smaller than 2 centimeters (cm) and localized to the organ it arose from. Stage II tumors measure averagely 2-5 cm and still localized and not spread to distant organs, at this stage lymph node may possibly be in volved as opposed to what pertains with the stage I. In Stage III tumors, lesions meas ure more than 5 cm and surrounding lymph nodes are affected. At Stage IV, tumor sizes may vary but most signific antly, there's evidence of metastasis to different parts of the body with seco ndary disease developing in different regions. Lymph nodes nearby the origin of cancer in itiation are generally affected. In choosing regimens for cancer treatment, the stag e of the disease becomes very helpful; the stage is also very helpful in determin ing the outcome of the disease with or without treatment and the patients' 5-year survival rate. A stage I patient might need less aggressive therapeutic treatment than a stage II pa tient, with a higher 5-year survival rate than a Stage IV patient. Cancer types affecting different organs have divers e survival rate, due to the aggressive nature of each cancer, the vital organ i nvolved and the potential of a metastatic disease arising from the primary tumor. However, a stage IV disease in each type of cancer shows a grim prognosis in comparison to the stages I, II & III. An example is represented in Table 1 of a list of cancers and their 5-year su rvival rate. 8 Table 1: Five (5) year survival rate for all stages of different cancers Cancer staging are potentially predictive markers t hat also has implication of survival rates. The lat ter stage of the disease is associated with lower survival ra tes. Secondary stage Liver cancer, pancreatic, stom ach and colon cancer shows the worst 5-year survival rate, with prostate and lung cancers showing the highest 5-year survival rate. Prostate and Pancreatic cancer are two of the most occurring genitourinary and lethal cancers respectively in men, with a bleak prognosis and deplorable 5-year survival rate. In 2015 estimated new cases of prostate cancer in the US alone were 220,800.Although estimated incidence of pancreatic cancer was lower at 24,840 in males and 24,120 in females, better medical care and therapeutic inter ventions in prostate cancer, resulted in a lower death rate of 27,540 (12%), whereas a combin ed mortality rate for pancreatic cancer 9 was 40,560 (82.8%) (Figure 5) (Siegel et al, 2015). This clearly indicates a major issue and cause for concern which warrants a lot of research focus. Figure 5: Cancer incidence and Mortality. Ten Leading Cancer Types for the Estimated New Canc er Cases and Deaths by Sex, United States, 2015 Modified from Siegel et al 2015(Siegel et al, 2015) . Although Pancreatic cancer is the 4 th leading cause of death, mortality vs incidence rate suggests a signi ficantly high deficit in pancreatic cancer therapy 10 Chapter 2: The Prostate: Structure and Function The name \"prostate\" originated from the Greek word \"prostates\" meaning to stand before. It is a small dense muscular exocrine gland with an approximate size of a small kiwi fruit, weighing between 20-30 grams in a disea se-free state. The gland is below the bladder and has two lobes that surround part of the urethra (Figure 6). The prostate gland was described by Sir Edward Home in 1806 and Joseph Griffiths in 1889; it forms part of the male reproductive system and is the largest acc essory in the system. Figure 6: Structure of the male reproductive system . The prostate gland is a small walnut shaped organ t hat surrounds the urethra, located beneath the blad der and anterior to the rectum (Red oval circle) https://www.britannica.com/science/prostate-gland/i mages-videos The normal human prostate, disease-free, is made up of five (5) types of acinar cells: 11 \u00b7 Microvillar cells with several microvilli on the ap ical surface \u00b7 Secretory cells \u00b7 Holey cells with several small holes \u00b7 Crater cells with broken apical cell membrane and \u00b7 Bare cells appearing smooth with very little microv illi In addition to these cell types are the basal, stem cells and neuroendocrine cells. Currently the most understood function of the prost ate is its secretory feature. The prostate gland secretes enzymes, lipids, amines and metal io ns that forms 20 to 30% of semen during ejaculation, these are also essential for no rmal function of spermatozoa (Kumar & Majumder, 1995). Prostate gland secretions are slightly acidic with a pH of approximately 6.6: Table 2 details secretions from the prostatic tissue: Table 2: Prostatic Secretions modified from Kumar e t al 1995 (Kumar & Majumder, 1995) 12 The muscular nature also aids in the expulsion of s emen. The prostate gland is made up of 30-50 branched tubuloaveolar glands; this is surrounded by a dense fibro muscular stroma. The prostate consists of distinct glandular layers arranged in concentric manner. These layers correspond to three zones (Figure 7): a. The transition zone makes up about 5-10% of the pro state volume containing mucosal glands that empty into the urethra. It is s ituated in the middle of the prostate between the central and peripheral zones. The transition zone grows bigger with increase in age and can enlarge to beco me the largest zone of the prostate, pushing the peripheral zone towards the r ectum. This might be a case of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) b. The central zone (CZ) makes up 20-25% of the glands ' volume containing mucosal glands with longer ducts and is farthest from the r ectum. c. The peripheral zone (PZ) which is the major part of the prostate gland accounts for 70-75% of the bulk of the tissue. The PZ is closest to the rectum and important in digital rectal examination (DRE). 13 Figure 7: Prostate gland anatomy: A, Sagittal view. gland; bottom, apex. by . Filed under Hematology, Oncology and Palliative M edicine (Image modified). As the transition zone increase in size due to either BPH or prostate canc er, it pushes against the peripheral zone which may help detection during a digital rectal exam. Prostate Gland function and homeostasis Steroid and peptide hormones as well as growth fact ors help in the proper functioning, development and differentiation of the prostate gland (Kumar & Majumder, 1995). Testosterone is the major hormone that influ ences prostate growth and function. It is primarily produced by the interstitial Leydig ce lls of the testis and this is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) which is secreted he luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH-RH) is secreted directly into the hypop hyseal-portal vascular system, from the median eminence of the hypothalamus which contr ols the release of luteinizing 14 hormone. In the prostate the most potent form of an drogens is dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Wilson & Gloyna, 1970) and its synthesis is under the actions of 5-reductase on testosterone (Fang et al, 1969). To a lesser extent , the prostate gland is stimulated by androstenedione which is produced by the adrenal gl and. The pituitary organ is also involved in the regulation of adrenal gland secreti on of androstenedione, by producing Prolactin als o secreted from the pituitary organ is reported to stimulate the growth and function of pr ostatic tissue. 17-Estradiol and estrone which are powerful estrog ens are synthesized from testosterone and androstenedione by enzymatic aroma tization predominantly in the fat tissue and these estrogens can both enhance and inh ibit growth of prostatic tissue. Hormonal regulation of the prostate by testosterone and estrogens also exerts a feedback mechanism on the hypothalamus and this has been uti lized in therapy. A typical example of the impact estrogens have on the progression of prostate cancer, was demonstrated with diethylstilbestrol which exerts the negative feedb ack effect on the hypothalamus to inhibit further secretion of hormones (Citrin et al, 1991) (Malkowicz, 2001). Diffusion of testosterone and conversion to DHT in the cytoplasm of prostate cells enhances its activity by binding to its cognate rec eptor the Androgen Receptor (AR) (Liao & Fang, 1969; Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature, 1999) . The receptor undergoes post- translational modifications and translocate to the nucleus and binds to androgen response elements (ARE), where it induces the transcription and activation of target genes (Lonergan & Tindall, 2011). 15 The Androgen Receptor The androgen receptor is a nuclear receptor and is encoded by the gene localized to chromosome Xq11-12 (Figure 8) (Lonergan & Tindal l, 2011). AR is a phospho-protein with several serine, threonine and tyrosine residue s, most of which are contained in the N- terminal domain of the receptor (van der Steen et a l, 2013). The 90 kb long gene encodes for a protein with three major functional domains, an N-terminal domain, DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain. There are two i soforms of AR: AR-A which is an 87 kDa protein with N-terminal truncation lacking 187 amino acids and AR-B a 110 kDa full length protein. The N-terminal domain (NTD) has sev eral sub-domains required for transcriptional activity, constitutive activation a nd interaction with the c-terminal domain to enhance stability of the receptor. The DNA bindi ng domain (DBD), localized between the hinge and N-terminal domains is required for in teraction of the receptor with DNA sequences. The hinge domain harbors a nuclear local ization signal (NLS) and also functions as a connection between the DNA-binding d omain and ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Figure 8). 16 Figure 8: Schematic representation of the androgen receptor gene and protein. Image modified to show C-Terminal Domain important in mechanism of action of AR antagonists. With indications of its specific motifs and domains (Lon ergan & Tindall, 2011). Androgen receptors are expressed not only in the pr ostatic tissue but also in bone marrow, mammary gland, testicular and muscle tissue s. At steady, the androgen receptor is bound to heat shock proteins (eg.HSP90) (Nemoto et al, 1992). AR activation is preceded by ligand binding of androgens to the rece ptor, which induces conformational changes. Activated receptors undergo modifications which include but not limited to: dissociation from HSP90, phosphorylation and format ion of dimers. Following the posttranslational modifications, AR translocate to the nucleus where they bind androgen response elements (ARE) with an inverted palindromi c 15 nucleotide sequence. These changes enhance the recruitment of co-activators an d or co-repressors to the bound response elements to enhance transcriptional activi ties of target genes. 17 Figure 9: Summary of AR signaling pathway (A) Established pathway of AR exhibits the activati on of AR after binding to DHT which induces conformational and posttranslational modifications leading to changes in cellular localization. (B)The Androgen Receptor can also be activated by the kina se activities of nonreceptor and receptor tyrosine kinases that change the phosphorylation status of the recep tor which activates the receptor and enhances it nu clear localization to bind androgen response elements.(Lo nergan & Tindall, 2011) In addition to direct binding of AR to DNA sequence s to induce gene transcription, the receptor also affects gene transcription throug h interaction with NF-B, STAT and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Insulin-like growth fac tor 1 (IGF-1) is reportedly a target gene of AR as well as genes involved in development of m ale sexual characteristics. The androgen receptor also undergoes ligand independent activation, where the receptor is activated in either the absence or very low levels of ligands. Extracellular peptides such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin-like growth factor an d epidermal growth factor pathways can activate receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases which then induce phosphorylation of the AR to cause its activation and nuclear transloc ation. (Figure 9) (Lonergan & Tindall, 2011). The androgen receptor also plays a significa nt role in the normal development of 18 the prostate and a critical function in carcinog enesis of the prostate. The receptor is implicated in almost all forms of prostate cancer (Chodak et al, 1992; Ruizeveld de Winter et al, 1994; Sadi et al, 1991) as well as the castr ation resistant stage of the disease disease (Chen et al, 2004; Henshall et al, 2001; Ricciardel li et al, 2005). Prostatic Diseases The three common disorders that affect the prostate can further be grouped under either benign or malignant syndromes. These conditi ons cause an enlargement of the prostate and it may increase the size up to 100 g a s opposed to 20-30 g in the normal prostate. This causes the urethra to typically narr ow and may result in several symptoms including difficulty in emptying the bladder, the n eed to urinate frequently, incontinence amongst others. The two common benign conditions a fflicting the prostate are prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The third disorde r is the adenocarcinoma characterized by uncontrolled growth and eventual invasion to sur rounding and distant organs. Prostatitis This is mainly caused by infection resulting in inf lammation of the prostate. It's usually treated with antibiotics. Reportedly two-ten percen t (2-10%) of men worldwide may be affected with Prostatitis at least once in the life time. Some studies have linked and implicated chronic Prostatitis with cancer risk. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Prostate enlargement also known as benign prostatic hypertrophy increases with age and is common in 50% of males over age 50 years . As the prostate enlarges, it pushes 19 against the urethra and causes it to narrow. Excess ive cell growth in the transition zone of the prostate gland is associated with BPH. An enlarged prostate can be detected during a Digit al rectal examination. BPH is diagnosed when serum prostate specific antigen (PSA ) levels are less than 4ng/ml. Another test for BPH measures the time in voiding a specifi ed volume of urine to determine if there's any obstruction (Uroflowmetry). In cases wh ere PSA levels are higher than 4ng/ml, biopsies are done to rule out the existence of mali gnant tissues. Treatment options for BPH include different medicat ions and or surgery, depending on several factors such as age, health condition, a nd size of the prostate and other medical conditions. BPH treatments are mainly directed towa rds improving quality of life, reducing symptoms and progression to more lethal morbidities . Treatment interventions range from watchful waiting to open surgery. Treatments for BPH Untreated BPH can lead to complications and eventua l kidney damage. Some complications of BPH are urinary tract infections, acute urinary retention, and kidney and bladder stones. The following are a number of ways BPH is and can be treated: 1. Alpha Blockers: these agents act by relaxing the ne ck muscles in the bladder and muscle fibers in the prostate. Medications include: involved in the growth of prostatic cells are inhibited by 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, thes e results in the reduction of the 20 prostate gland. Dutasteride and finasteride are two commonly used inhibitors for BPH. 3. Medication Combo: When alpha blockers or 5-alpha re ductase inhibitors are not efficacious, therapeutic options tend to incorporat e a combination of these two inhibitors to enhance their activities. Finasteride is commonly combined with doxazosin and dutasteride with tamsulosin. 4. TUNA Treatment: Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA ) is an outpatient procedure where high frequency radio waves are used to burn specific regions in the prostate. The waves are delivered through twin needles. 5. Hot Water: This procedure is based on the principle of heating a defined area of the prostate, by inserting a catheter into a balloon th at is situated in the center of the prostate and delivering hot water into the balloon to destroy the diseased tissue. 6. Surgical Choices: Surgery for BPH doesn't require a ny external incision, transurethral resection is the procedure of choice by using a resectoscope inserted though the penis during transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Another invasive method is to make an incision in the neck of the bladder and the prostate to increase the width of the urethra, thereby incre asing flow of urine. 7. Laser Surgery: Laser surgery for BPH is a procedur e where a scope is passed through the penis into the urethra to ablate (melti ng) or enucleate (cutting) the excess prostate tissue. 21 8. Open Simple Prostatectomy: In situations where pati ents have complications with bladder damage and a much enlarged prostate, surger y via incisions below the navel in the abdomen and portions of the prostate blockin g urinal flow are removed by laparoscopy. 9. Self-Care: In cases where men with BPH do not neces sarily need medication or surgery, several steps are recommended to ease and manage the symptoms: \u00b7 Pelvic-Strengthening exercises \u00b7 Staying active \u00b7 Decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption \u00b7 Drinking frequently in smaller volumes \u00b7 Desist holding urine \u00b7 Avoid the use of antihistamines and decongestants Prostate Cancer Epidemiology Prostate cancer (PC) is second to lung cancer as t he leading causes of cancer death in men (Siegel et al, 2014). In 2014, estimated cas es and deaths were 233,00 and 29,480, respectively in the US alone (Siegel et al, 2014), making approximately 26% of all malignancies diagnosed in men. These numbers only d ecreased in 2015, to 228,000 for incidence and 27,540 estimated deaths (Siegel et al , 2015). Worldwide statistics on prostate cancer was estimated at about 1.1 million cases in 2012 and this forms 15% of diagnosed 22 malignancies in men, out of which, the estimated de aths averages 307,000 (Perez et al, 2015). The current estimate on prostate cancer risk in men is 1 one in seven (Siegel et al, 2015) and considering growth and aging, the global incidence of prostate cancer is reported to increase to 1.7 million new cases with deaths av eraging 499,000 (Ferlay et al, 2010). Approximately 75% of cases of the total prostate ca ncer incidence are registered in developed countries (659,000). Highest rates are re ported in Australia/New Zealand, Western and Northern Europe and Northern America an d this has been related to the widespread of regular checks and the use of PSA as a diagnostic marker. Generally prostate cancer afflicts the aged and is very uncommon in people under the age of 40. The risk of developing the disease increases after the age of 50 and averages around Six (6) cases out of a Ten (10) at the age o f 65 years or older. Reports show that at 55 years and above, a person's risk increases 17 fo ld as opposed to ages 55 years and younger (Bashir et al, 2014). The reported incidence rate for prostate cancer in all races is 147.8 per 100,000 and for African-Americans who have the highest rates of prostate cancer in the world it averages 223.0 per 100,000, which is about 60% high er than it is in whites (139.9 per 100,000 men). African-Americans also have the highe r mortality rates and from 2007 to 2011 the reported prostate cancer deaths were 2.4 t imes higher than what was reported for whites. The risk of getting prostate cancer in men has been positively correlated with familial aggregation of the disease (Bashir et al, 2014), with a three time higher risk of developing the disease compared to people without a family history. Having a first degree relative (father, son and brother) increased one's risk 2 to 3 fold and having more than one 23 first degree relative afflicted, increases one's ri sks 5 times. Of the 64% of prostate cancer cases with family history, more than 40% were confi rmed to have first degree relatives afflicted with the disease. (Lange et al, 2012). A meta-analysis conducted on 33 epidemiologic studies on risk ratios reported an in crease in risk for men with affected brothers in comparison to men with affected parents , the cause for these differences are not absolutely clear (Zeegers et al, 2003). A study conducted in different ethnic backgrounds b ased on lifestyle and dietary factors has implicated the intake of certain food i tems with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Whites, Asian-Americans and Africa n-Americans with a high fat diet show an increased risk of developing prostate cancer (Wh ittemore et al, 1995). In addition, red meat and dairy products also increased one's risk s ignificantly and also predicted a worse survival at an older age (Song et al, 2013). On the other hand, dietary intake with high fruit and vegetables are associated with lower risk of de veloping the disease (Zhou et al, 2013) and selenium which is present in fish and grains wa s reported to be inversely associated with prostate cancer (Vogt et al, 2003). Obesity has also been reported to play a role in pr ostate cancer development with a six-fold higher risk than non-obese people in devel oping prostate cancer. Current findings on this subject are mixed. However, reports show th at obesity is significantly implicated in an aggressive stage of the disease (Hsing et al, 20 00). Interestingly, treatment of diabetes has been reported to be associated with a reduced r isk of developing prostate cancer. A large number of epidemiology studies gave credence and confirmation that patients with type-2 diabetes showed, significantly decreased the risk of developing prostate cancer (Pierce, 2012). This may be due to the therapeutic agents being administered to diabetic 24 patients. Currently metformin has shown potential i n inhibiting proliferation of a number of cancer cells. Different studies have reports on a positive associ ation of sexually transmitted disease (gonorrhea and syphilis) and prostate cance r, however not all these agree, some very conflicting. Notwithstanding, being afflicted with prostatitis increases ones risk positively in developing prostate cancer (Hosseini et al, 2010). Exposure to chemicals such as used in agriculture ( pesticides, acetic acid, arsenic compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds, gasoline & diesel engine emission, mono nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, lubricating oils and greases, alkanes with 18 carbons and solvents), increased ones' risk of developing prost ate cancer. Farmers, as such had a twofold increased risk of developing the disease th an non-farmers (Parent et al, 2009). Smoking is not generally accepted as a risk factor for prostate cancer, smoking is positively associated with prostate cancer mortality, with a 1 4% higher risk of dying from the disease compared to non-smokers (Huncharek et al, 2010). Prostate cancer disease development and progression is a result of an accumulation of activation mutations and gene silencing. The mol ecular genetics behind the disease is not absolutely understood. However, it is known tha t sequential occurrence of gene changes in the somatic cells gives a growth advanta ge to the cells harboring these genetic mutations. These genetic defects could be either at the nucleotide level (insertion, deletion or base substitution) or at the chromosomal level w here there could be a gain of an entire chromosome or a loss or gain of portions of it. Familial clustering of prostate cancer gives eviden ce of genetic predisposition to the disease and currently only 35% of familial risk is explained by known genes. In 1992 25 a study conducted on nuclear families implicated a rare highly penetrant and dominant gene which was named HPC1 (Hereditary Prostate Cancer 1) . The gene frequency was predicted to be 0.003 and caused 43% of cases by age 55 years (Carter et al, 1992). Familial cancer was thought to be caused by tumor suppressors which would follow the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, where an inherited allele undergoes a f irst hit, and then the remaining normal allele is lost to result in tumor development (Knud son, 1985). Male carriers of mutations in the BRCA1 gene also have a threefold increased r isk of developing prostate cancer (Ford et al, 1994). BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer a relative ris k of 3.0 and 2.6-7.0 respectively. Germ line mutations in BRCA2 have been found and al though rare (1 in 300) they do confer up to 8.6-fold risk in men below 65years and such mutations have been implicated in aggressive cancers (Castro et al, 201 3; Goh & Eeles, 2014). However, its direct correlation with risk is not conclusive and suggestions are that they may be serving as modifiers to some risk factors, this notion obvi ously needs further extensive study. Alterations in genes such as tumor protein 53 (TP53 ) and retinoblastoma protein (RB) are implicated in pathogenesis of prostate cancer at a later stage (Bookstein et al, 1990; Navone et al, 1993). The loss of function or deletion of NKX3.1 (a tumor suppressor) has been implicated in prostate cancer initiation, however, extensive characterization of the coding sequence revealed an un-mutated gene sequence (Voel ler et al, 1997). Gluthathione-S-transferase (GST) gene is reporte d to be altered and inactivated in prostate cancer. A number of studies suggested t hat these changes have a significant correlation to high risk prostate cancer (Kote-Jara i et al, 2001). Epigenetic modification arising from extensive hypermethylation of 5' promo ter sequence on the GST gene has been associated with 96% of primary prostatic adeno carcinomas (Lee et al, 1994). Other 26 rare mutations have also been reported in HOXB13, N BS1 and CHEK2 (Goh & Eeles, 2014). Results from family-based linkage studies, r evealed 7 prostate cancer susceptibility loci, identified on several chromosomes. There are many factors implicated in prostate cancer initiation and progression and studies are s till on-going to fully understand the disease. Detection of Prostate cancer Early onset of prostate cancer is asymptomatic and typically people are screened after the age of 40 years. The disease is sometimes detec ted when they patients present with symptoms that are also seen as a result of BPH: \u00b7 Frequent urination, especially at night \u00b7 Urgency in urinating \u00b7 Trouble starting urine stream \u00b7 A weak or interrupted urine stream \u00b7 Pain or burning during urination \u00b7 A feeling that the bladder does not entirely empty \u00b7 Blood in the urine and, \u00b7 A nagging pain in the back, hips or pelvis The PSA test and DRE are currently the initial meth ods widely used to detect the presence of the disease. These tests also determine whether there is the need for concern, and also establish the necessary steps to evaluate a person's disease status. 27 PSA Testing Prostate-specific antigen is a serine protease (Rit tenhouse et al, 1998) and was first discovered to be produced by the ductal epithelial cells of the male prostate (Sinha et al, 1987; Wang et al, 1981). It is a 33 kDa glycoprotei n with chymotrypsin-like enzyme that aids sperm motility by cleaving seminogelin I and I I proteins of the seminal coagulum (Lilja, 1985). In prostatic tissues PSA exists in a free uncomplexed form, 70% of which is proteolytically active. Recent work has shown that PSA is not only produced by the male prostate but also by the male and female tissues. P SA exists as free and also complexed with serpins in the serum. PSA bound to 1-antichym otrypisin (ACT) makes up 80% of total serum PSA (Pizzo et al, 1988), with only trac e amounts complexed to 2- macroglobulin (A2M) (Otto et al, 1998). The prostate gland is the main source of PSA in mal es and measured levels are generally lower than 2 ng/ml, with a range of 0.2-0 .3 ng/ml for healthy men below the age of 30 years. In cases where serum PSA levels exceed s 4 ng/ml, this may suggest some form of damage to the prostate tissue (Oesterling, 1991) . In seminal plasma, PSA levels are between 500,000-3,000,000 ng/ml (Wang et al, 1998). The male urine also contains PSA, and the main source is the periurethral glands (Alv arez-Vijande, 1993), however, these may not contribute to the serum PSA levels (Oesterl ing et al, 1996). Although PSA levels have proven to be a useful mark er in detecting the onset/presence of neoplastic cells in the prostate, its usefulness is limited. Increase in PSA levels between 4-10 ng/ml can be due to BPH, 96; Ornstein et al, 1997; Rana & Chisholm, 1994). These reduce its usefulness as a m alignancy marker. It's been reported 28 that only 25-30% of biopsies taken from patients pr esenting PSA serum levels of 4- 10ng/ml, had foci of adenocarcinoma. When PSA level s in the serum are elevated above 10ng/ml, it becomes a definitive malignancy marker for prostate cancer. In spite of the limitations of PSA assays in determining presence o f neoplasm, combining PSA serum levels with DRE serves as the best tool in assessin g the risk of prostate cancer (Catalona et al, 1993; Catalona et al, 1991). Comparing the percentage of free PSA in serum gives a more accurate way to utilize the PSA testing. The ratio of free to total PSA (% free PSA) has been shown to be significantly higher in BPH than in prostate cancer ; this form of testing reduces the number of performed biopsies (Marley et al, 1996). For pat ients whose free PSA levels are 10% or less, the likelihood of prostate cancer is high and biopsies are recommended. Another modification of a PSA test is the use of the PSA ve locity, which measures the increase in levels over a period. If the level rises above 0.75 ng/ml per year, prostate cancer is more than likely and these tests are administered at the minimum of three times within 18 months. Other diagnostic methods that improve the a ccuracy of prostate cancer detection have utilized markers such as PCA3, a non-coding mR NA, which is rarely expressed in benign prostate tissue but overexpressed in a major ity of prostate cancer. Although serum PSA increases with advanced patholog ical stage, its usefulness in predicting staging is not promising (Partin et al, 1990). However, its increase in concentration may give a prediction on histological differentiation in patients with grade 4 tumors that are poorly differentiated, these poorly differentiated tumors exist in the interstitial space and produce PSA that leaks into the extracellular fluid (Oesterling, 1991; Oesterling et al, 1988; Partin et al, 1990). The fa ct that PSA levels do not predict staging 29 well, coupled with the fact that PSA levels per gra m of tumor tissue decrease with Gleason grade (Partin & Oesterling, 1994), makes its use as a prognostic tool, limited. Advanced metastatic disease is characterized by an exception ally high PSA level, with the characteristic half-life of 2-3 days; it makes PSA an excellent marker for yet undetected metastasis. PSA levels return to baseline 48 hours after surgery (Rittenhouse et al, 1998), thus in cases where it does not return to baseline, it helps as an indicator of existing disease and also useful in monitoring recurrence of tumorig enicity. Digital Rectal Examination . In a digital rectal examination, irregularities o r abnormally firm area in the prostate is evaluated by a doctor inserting a lubricated, gl oved finger into the rectum towards the prostate to feel for any bumps that might be cancer . However, not all prostate cancer can be detected this way. DRE has been shown to be less effective than PSA blood test, although it does detect some inconsistencies in the prostate, hence its combination with PSA test for prostate cancer screening. Markers probed for in needle biopsies Although biopsies are done at a later stage followi ng results from PSA testing and DRE, it does indeed help to avoid radical treatment when not necessary. Proliferation marker Ki67 is routinely stained by immunohistochem istry (IHC) during biopsies to differentiate between aggressive and indolent prost ate cancer (Berney et al, 2009). A combination of four proteins assessed by IHC has sh own usefulness to predict biochemical recurrence (PTEN, SMAD4, cyclin D1 and SPP1) (Ding et al, 2011). Cell cycle progression markers have shown great potential in p redicting outcomes in a number of studies in TURP, needle biopsy and radical prostate ctomy specimens (Cuzick et al, 2011). 30 Staging and Grading in Prostate Cancer Primarily, staging is evaluated in a number of diff erent ways, clinical and pathological staging. Staging creates room for risk stratification and distribution for reasonable treatment regimens. Initial DRE gives in formation about the prostate irregularities, whether it's confined or extended b eyond the prostate (clinical staging), and biopsy gives more indication of cancer spread. In a ddition, after surgery, further staging can be determined by pathological examination of th e removed tissue and its surrounding tissues to evaluate whether the disease is locally invasive or metastatic (pathological staging). Risk stratification incorporates, PSA tes ting, DRE and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging to enhance proper therapeutic interve ntion. An example for a clinically localized disease is as presented in Table 3. Table 3: Risk Stratification for Patients with Clin ically Localized Disease Patients may be allocated to higher risk group depe nding on the adverse factors (PSA level, DRE, Biops y and Gleason score. (Revised from the NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology, v.1.2010 (www.nccn.org) Prostate cancer staging utilizes the TNM staging wh ich medical doctors have found very useful in making informed decisions pertaining to treatment. The clinical staging is primarily based on results that are collected befor e surgery. The tests include bone scans, 31 MRI, CT scans, x-rays, biopsy and DRE. Surgery norm ally involves the resection of the entire prostate and some lymph nodes. Figure 10, r epresents staging in prostate cancer disease, taking into account lymph node involvement , tumor size and metastatic lesions. Figure 10: TNM prostate grading system The Gleason grading system determines the abnormal characteristics of the tissue after biopsy and is the most commonly used system f or histopathological grading (Hsu et al, 2004; Maygarden & Pruthi, 2005). It also incorp orates the rate of cancer growth and differentiated status. Scores are given to the two most common tissue pattern from 1(most normal or differentiated) through to 5 (most abnorm al or poorly differentiated). The 32 Gleason score is assigned with two numbers which ar e then added to give a total score out of a ten. The most aggressive cancers are given hig hest Gleason score which also reflect the rate of its growth. There are three major risk groups dependent on the Gleason score. Gleason score 2-6 describes a low risk (low grade, well differentiated tumor), Gleason score 7 describes intermediate risk (intermediate g rade, moderately differentiated) and high risk describes a high grade, poorly differentiated tumor with a Gleason score of 8-10. Gleason scores are represented by the Gleason's Pat tern (Figure 11)(Maygarden & Pruthi, 2005). Figure 11: Gleason grading system Gleason scores are assigned based on the primary di fferentiation viewed microscopically. Gleason grade s of 1 through 5 represents diseased tissue lacking the normal feature. The higher the Gleason score the mo re aggressive the disease. (http://trialx.com/curetalk /2011/07/interpret-your-gleason-grading-score/) Prostate Cancer Therapy Treatment options for prostate cancer vary dependin g on the disease severity, tumor grade/stage and patient characteristics (age and co morbidity). The type or form of therapeutic intervention used, takes into account a combination of the aforementioned clinical factors as well as psychological factors. These may include: the need for therapy, level of risk, personal circumstances and the desir e for a certain therapy based on risks and 33 benefits. In recent years, other forms of monitorin g the disease include active surveillance, where prostate cancer is carefully monitored for an y signs of disease progression. During this period, PSA testing and DRE are incorporated a nd periodically done. In situations where changes in PSA levels are observed and DRE de termines a significant growth of the tumor, treatment options are considered and impleme nted where necessary. The common treatment options include surgery, radiation therap y, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. Surgery Early stage disease that's confined to the prostate normally undergoes radical prostatectomy where the entire prostate is removed including some surrounding tissues. Radiation Therapy Radiation is used to kill cancer cells and its surr ounding tissues and this can be used in advanced and recurrent prostate cancer. There ar e three different methods of radiating tumor cells: the external beam radiation therapy, P roton therapy and Brachytherapy. In external beam radiation therapy, CT scans and MRIs are used to map out the tumor location and radiated with x-rays. With Proton therapy the u se of protons target cancer cells without affecting surrounding tissues. Proton therapy is ge nerally efficacious in treating localized, isolated and solid tumors before they spread. As op posed to directing beams of radiation or protons, in Brachytherapy, tiny metal pellets co ntaining radioactive palladium or iodine are inserted in the diseased prostate tissue by the use of needles. The seeds give off radiation over several months killing surrounding p rostate cancer cells. The seeds become inactive after a year and degrade. 34 Anti-Hormone Therapy Since the prostate gland is regulated by hormones, the commonly used method for therapeutic intervention is to inhibit the producti on of hormones and their activity. Hormonal therapy also known as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) specifically inhibits the production of testosterone and or its action on prostate cancer cells. Hormonal therapy may be used for cancers that has spread from the pr ostate tissue and also for recurrent disease. It may also be used in combination with ra diation therapy for advanced stage disease. In the early 1940's, studies by Charles Hu ggins and his colleagues identified androgens as the main fuel of PC growth (Huggins, 1 942). Since then, androgen synthesis inhibitors and androgen receptor (AR) antagonists h ave been the focus of research for treatment of PC (Chang et al, 1995). Major strategi es include inhibiting the endogenous synthesis of androgens via the CYP17 pathway (Vasai tis et al, 2011) and antagonizing the transcriptional activities of AR (Sadar, 2011; Vasa itis & Njar, 2010). The various types of hormonal therapy include: Orchiectomy, Luteinizing- hormone releasing hormone agonists, LH-RH antagonists and the use of anti-and rogens. Orchiectomy : Since the 1940s this procedure of surgically remo ving the testicles, has been a successful remedy in blocking the releas e of testosterone. This proved to be effective since 90% of testosterone is produced by the testicles. LH-RH Agonists & Antagonists : LH-RH is produced from the hypothalamus as a result of a decrease in testosterone levels in th e body. The release of LH-RH induces the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and imulating hormone (FSH) pituitary LH the production and rele ase from Leydig cells in the testis. LH-RH agonists and their analogs cause a sustained activation and release of 35 LH-RH which inhibits the release of LH and FSH and subsequent inhibition of hormone receptor (GnRH) antagonist, binds to the receptors in the pi tuitary gland and block their interaction with GnRH. This works by reducing LH-RH and blocks it from stimulating testosterone production, thereby eliminating the initial testost erone surge. Anti-Hormonal Agents : The agents effectively block the action of testos terone and are used as either monotherapy, neoadjuvant the rapy before local therapy or in combination with LH-RH agonists to prevent flare re actions. Another class of anti- hormonal agents is the 5-reductase inhibitors whic h prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Anti-androgens can further be sub-grouped i nto AR antagonist that competitively bind to the ligand binding domain of the AR, displa cing androgens and inhibiting the transcriptional activities of the AR, and secondly, inhibitors of 17 hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP 17). I. Androgen Receptor Antagonist : These agents bind competitively to the AR and inhibit/displace androgens from ligand binding domain and prevent them from activating the receptor: a. Bicalutamide (Casodex) is a highly selective compet itive synthetic, non-steroidal inhibitor of the AR that was approved in 1995 as a combination therapeutic agent with LH-RH agonist fo r the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. b. Nilutamide is also a synthetic non-steroidal anti-a ndrogen not indicated for monotherapy but in combination with LH-RH analo gs for the 36 treatment of advanced stage prostate cancer. This a lso acts as an antagonist that prevents androgens from binding to the AR. c. Flutamide was first introduced in 1975 in the clini c and was approved in combination with LH-RH analogs in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Its major mode of mechanism is by competitively inhibiting androgens from binding to the ligand bin ding domain of the AR. d. Enzalutamide (Xtandi\u00ae) is one of the recently FDA a pproved AR antagonist (August 2012) for the treatment of castr ation resistant prostate cancer. Its affinity for AR is approximate ly 8 fold higher than bicalutamide and inhibits activation of AR target g enes such as PSA and TMPRSS2. II. 17 hydroxylase/17, 20 lyase (CYP17) Inhibitors : These agents are designed and synthesized to prevent androgen production by i nhibiting the enzyme required for testosterone synthesis from pregnenolo ne and progesterone. Pregnenolone and or progesterone are hydroxylated a t C-17 to produce 17- hydroxy-pregnenolone and 17-hydroxy-progesterone b y the CYP-17 enzyme, the latter then catalyzes the conversion of 17, 20 lyase to DHEA or 4A (Bruno & Njar, 2007; Hall, 1991; Nakajin & Hall, 1981). CY P-17 has been reported to be mainly expressed in the adrenals and testis, how ever current work has suggested its expression in tumor cells as well as adipose tissues (Locke et al, 2008; Puche et al, 2002). 37 a. Ketoconazole: This agent was initially designed as a synthetic imidazole anti-fungal agent, taken orally for fungal infectio ns. Treatment required the use at high doses and patients experienced loss of libido (Yap et al, 2008), this led to its identification as an anti-an drogen that inhibited a broad range of enzymes including CYP17 (Loose et al , 1983; Santen et al, 1983; Trachtenberg et al, 1983). The applicatio n of Ketoconazole was limited due to its lack of specificity and incr eased toxicity, however clinical testing of Ketoconazole showed the potenti al for targeting CYP17 as a form of androgen deprivation therapy. b. Abiraterone Acetate: Following the discovery of Ket oconazole and its inhibition of the CYP-17 enzyme, several clinical t rials were conducted with Ketoconazole in combination with other agents, which provided the impetus to develop more potent CYP-17 inhibitor s. Abiraterone was designed as a substrate analog of pregnenolone with 3-pyridyl residue substitution at C-17 and a double bond at the 16-17 -position, theses alterations enhances a tightly and irreversible int eraction with the heme iron of CYP-17 (Ki app < 1nM). Abiraterone was approved in 2011 by the FDA and is a steroidal anti-androgen used in co mbination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic castrati on resistant prostate cancer. 38 Anti-Mitotic Chemotherapeutic agents Systemic agents that disrupt mitotic spindle assemb ly have been commonly used to treat a number of cancers. Microtubule inhibitors s uch as taxol and the vinca alkaloids have shown potency in the clinical setting. This is base d on the fact that cancer cells proliferate faster and are constantly growing in comparison to normal cell. Cancerous cells are therefore targeted, however certain groups of cells in body such as epithelial cells lining GI tract, which are constantly being renewed are al so affected. Microtubules represent one of the important filamen ts of the cells cytoskeleton, implicated in various biological functions such as cell motility, mitosis and intracellular transport; this makes it an important target to be exploited in cancer therapy. Microtubule- associated protein (MAP), actin, intermediate and m icrofilaments and tubulin forms the major microtubular components involved in microtubu lar dynamics, regulated by their polymerization and depolymerization. Recent studies have reported the significance of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cdc2 ki nase in activating MAPs and microfilaments (Ookata et al, 1995). Based on the mechanism of action of anti-mitotic ag ents, they can be group into two categories, the vinca alkaloids and the taxanes . The and E7010 act by second category (taxanes such as paclitaxel and docetaxel) on the other hand, promote polymerization of microtubules and enhance microtub ule stability. A study conducted on the mechanism of actions of paclitaxel revealed tha t the latter inhibits the catalytic activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cdc2 kinase in lung cancer cell lines (Fukuoka & Saijo, 1997). 39 Since this class of anti-mitotic agents' target tub ulin activity of rapidly dividing cells, their therapeutic potential is limited. Seve ral cellular functions such as cell motility, shape, signal transduction, intracellular transport , require proper physiological of microtubules and tubulin targeting agents show dele terious effects on these processes. These compounds also cause neurotoxicity by interfe ring with the function of axonal microtubules that are important for neuronal vesicl e transport (Nagle et al, 2006). \u00b7 Docetaxel : This agent is an FDA approved drug for treatment of many indications including use as either a single line t herapy or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of hormone refra ctory prostate cancer. \u00b7 Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride : The combination of mitoxantrone and prednisone is used as second-line therapy for metas tatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Mitoxantrone's mechanism of action is different as it disrupts DNA synthesis by intercalating DNA topoiso merase. \u00b7 Cabazitaxel : This agent was approved by the FDA in 2010 for th e treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Cabazitaxel is mainly used in combination with prednisone in the metastatic disea se, following resistance to docetaxel-based treatment and has shown more pot ency than Mitoxantrone. Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) In prostate tissues, androgens bind to the androgen receptor, this induces post- translational modification of the AR, resulting in its activation. AR dissociates from heat shop proteins, is phosphorylated, homo-dimerizes an d translocate to the nucleus where it binds to androgen response elements (ARE) to direct transcription of target genes (Kang 40 et al, 2004; Wang et al, 2005). Activated AR bound to ARE recruits co-regulators and transcription factors (Heinlein & Chang, 2002) to i nduce transcription. ADT remains one of the major treatments for prostate cancer since t he latter depends on steroid hormones and AR to mediate oncogenic growth (Wang et al, 200 9). During ADT, production of androgens are significantly decreased and this inhi bits the transcriptional activities of the androgen receptor, impeding tumor growth (Lian et a l, 2015). Although ADT is effective initially, the disease eventually relapses and ther e emerges a very aggressive and fatal form of prostate cancer. The recurrence of prostate cancer (PC) with metasta ses following androgen deprivation therapy is a major concern since it is the primary cause of death in patients initially diagnosed with localized PC (Miyamoto et al, 2004; Vasaitis et al, 2011; Vasaitis & Njar, 2010). This more aggressive stage of the di sease is referred to as castration- resistant prostate cancer. Since 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five new agents, including, docetaxel plus prednisone, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, sipuleucel-T (Osanto & Van Poppel, 2012; Shapiro & Tareen, 2012). Despite these current therapeutic options, CRPC still presents a great clinical challenge due to inevitable development of drug resistance (Antonarakis et al, 2014; Li et al, 2013 ; Mostaghel et al, 2011; Schrader et al, 2013; Shapiro & Tareen, 2012). Studies on the whole genome has implicated genomic rearrangements and modifications in the transcriptional program predom inantly related to AR signaling in CRPC cells (Shtivelman et al, 2014). Resistance to current therapy has implicated ligand independent signaling and gene amplification of AR, mutations causing promiscuity (Chen 41 et al, 2004), and emergence of splice variants of t he AR that lacks the C-terminal domain (AR-Vs) (Dehm & Tindall, 2011). Indeed, the lack of ligand binding domain in AR-Vs is a potential cause of resistance to drugs that targe t AR via LBD (Antonarakis et al, 2014; Li et al, 2013; Mostaghel et al, 2011; Schrader et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). A recent study characterized a number of AR splice variants expressed in CRPC cells. These had alterations in the transcripts tha t caused the expression of shorter protein forms either lacking the C-terminal region of the A R or duplication of exons in several regions (Figure 12). The well-characterized AR-V7 (a.k.a., AR3) reported ly increases transcription of AR target genes in PC cells (Dehm et al, 2008; Guo et al, 2009a; Guo et al, 2009b; Sun et al, 2010; Watson et al, 2010) and has been implicat ed in a number of cellular processes (Figure 13). In fact, expression and transcriptiona l activity of AR-V7 has currently been implicated in enzalutamide (Xtandi) resistance, and a study on blood tests on its expression has been related to non-response of patients to Enz alutamide (Table 4) 42 Figure 12: Androgen Receptor splice variants The existence of splice variant ARs in prostate can cer cells that results in constitutive activation o f the receptors. Some variants show truncation at the C-T erminal which results in the expression of receptor s lacking the ligand binding domain and hence resista nt to AR antagonists. Most extensively studied and also implicated in drug-resistance and metastases are th e AR-V7/AR3 and ARv567es (modified Image from Guo et al 2011; highlighted in red, these variants are implicated in resistance to enzalutamide and abirat erone therapy.(Guo & Qiu, 2011) 43 Figure 13: Effects of AR3/AR-V7 on cell processes Splice variant AR-V7/AR3 is implicated in a number of cellular processes including cell migration, ant i- apoptotic activities by modulating several cell sur vival pathways and gene expression Table 4: AR-V7 expression impairs response to Enzal utamide Clinical studies have shown that AR-V7 expression d ecreases response to enzalutamide treatment. Patien ts show no significant change in PSA level when AR-V7 is expressed, whereas in the lack of AR-V7, enzalutamide treatment led to significant reduction of PSA level. (Modified from:urologytimes.modernmedicine.com) Phosphorylation of the androgen receptor is implica ted in resistance to ADT and also in castration resistant prostate cancer (Wang et al, 2009). AR phosphorylation on serine 81 (ser-81) residues is induced by cyclin-de pendent kinase-1(CDK-1) after ligand binding (Chen et al, 2009b). Another group has also showed that this phosphorylation at Ser-81 is necessary and precedes androgen-dependent DNA binding (Chen et al, 2012; Chen et al, 2009b) and makes the AR responsive to l ower concentrations of androgens 44 (Chen et al, 2012). A number of growth factors, cyt okines and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in activating AR in the absenc e of androgens (Lamont & Tindall, 2011). The src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and othe r members in this family of receptors have been implicated with prostate cancer progressi on via AR activation (Guo et al, 2006; Posadas et al, 2009). Considering the extensive wor k done on src kinase in prostate cancer (in vitro) , with very promising findings, several combination al strategies in the clinic with docetaxel did not show any improvement in overall s urvival. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor su ppressor which is usually mutated in prostate cancer and can induce apoptosis through its interaction with Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/Prot ein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) (El Sheikh et Reid et al, 2010; Sakamoto & Kyprianou , 2010). This mutation inactivates PTEN and results in an accumulation of Phosphatidyl inositol (3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P3) (PIP3), the latter then activates AKT enhancing cell survival and apoptosis inhibition (Courtney et al, 2010; Morgan et al, 200 9). Several alterations in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway have been reported in 40% of pros tate cancers and 70% of metastatic prostate cancers (Shafi et al, 2013b). There exists a feedback inhibition loop between the androgen receptor and the PI3K/AKT pathway which ha s been implicated in resistance to ADT therapy and emergence of CRPC (Carver et al, 20 11; Morgan et al, 2009; Thomas et al, 2013). Dual inhibition of both the AR and PI3k/ AKT pathway disrupts the feedback loop between AR and PI3k/AKT signaling pathways. Th is simultaneous antagonism enhances prostate cancer disease regression with a longer survival than inhibiting either of the pathways alone (Thomas et al, 2013). 45 It has also been suggested that drugs that target t he N-terminal domain or regions other than the LBD of AR could be more potent in an tagonizing both fAR and AR-Vs signaling (Sadar, 2011). However, other groups envi sion that agents that cause depletion of both fAR and AR-Vs (i.e., androgen receptor degr ading agents, ) are most likely to have a major impact on hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) and CRPC therapy (Kwegyir-Afful et al, 2015; Purushottamachar et al, 2013a; Yamashita et al, 2012). A number of natural products (Cao et al, 2013a; Li et al, 2011b; Li et al, 2012b; Mashima et al, 2010) and related analogs (Yamashita et al, 2012) have been shown to induce degradation of both fAR and splice variant A R. The curcumin analog, ASC-J9 has exhibited excellent drug-like properties (Shi et al , 2009; Yamashita et al, 2012). Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (Migration, Invas ion and Metastasis) Therapy for late-stage prostate cancer (PC) remains very limited and few drugs have shown modest overall survival for its treatmen t. Prostate cancer mortality, most frequently results from the metastatic disease whic h makes it important to design and develop inhibitors to target oncogenes involved in cellular migration and invasion. PC metastasis involves distinct series of genotypic an d phenotypic alterations in the cancer cell that enhances the cells' ability to migrate fr om the organ of cancer initiation to distant tissues/organs to repopulate. PC primarily metastas izes to the adrenal gland, bone, liver and lung. One of the most crucial changes is the de tachment of cells from the primary tumor and invading through the surrounding extracel lular matrix (ECM) (Martin & Jiang, 2009; Sakamoto & Kyprianou, 2010). 46 Tumor metastasis involves a series of stages that r esults in the formation of secondary tumors in distant organs. Cells induced t o metastasize lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire a more mesenchymal phen otype, in a process termed epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mesenchymal/metastati c cells possess the ability to penetrate surrounding tissues, by secreting protein s that proteolytically break down basement membrane of the extracellular matrix. Inva ding cells penetrate into the lymphatic or vascular circulation. Cells journeying in the ci rculatory system then undergo extravasation by invading the vascular basement mem brane and extracellular matrix. At a secondary site with conducive microenvironment and growth factors, cells proliferate to establish secondary tumors (Figure 14). Figure 14: Schematic of Tumor Metastasis (Quail & J oyce, 2013) Tumor microenvironment enhances cells to acquire a more metastatic phenotype and undergo EMT by losing epithelial characteristics and acquiring mesenchyma l characteristic. Upregulation of signaling pathway s such as WNT and TGF- enhance in cell invasion. Macropha ges, platelets and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated to play a crucial role in cancer cell me tastasis and colonization of metastatic niches. [Im age altered from original, to indicate circulating tumor cells( CTC)]. 47 Epithelial-Mesenchymal transition, a critical proce ss in metastasizing cells (Thiery, 2002) is known to be modulated in part by the trans criptional activities of NF-B (Chua et al, 2007) and translational MAPK s et al, 2015; Robichaud et al, 2015). The NF-B pathway regulates transcription o f EMT genes such as Snail, Slug, Twist1 and MMPs. On the other hand, translation of MMPs, Snail and Vegf mRNA is tightly regulated by the cap-dependent mRNA transla Activation of matrix metalloproteinase enhances extracellular matrix deg radation which plays a major role in cell migration and invasion, essential for metastat ic the potential of cancers. Substantial studies have revealed the significance of eIF4E phosphorylation in the progression and metastasis of several cancers inclu ding prostate cancer (Anthony et al, 1996; Kerekatte et al, 1995; Li et al, 2002; Nathan et al, 1999; Rosenwald et al, 1999; Rosenwald et al, 2001; al, 2001; Wang et al , 1999a). EIF4F complex translates a number of oncogenic mRNA's involved in cell cycle p rogression, survival and invasion. Interestingly, both the PI3k/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MAPK pathway converge on Mnk1/2- eIf4E axis (Haghighat et al, 1995)., The PI3k/Akt/m TOR pathway phosphorylates 4E- binding protein 1/2 (4E-BP1/2) which then releases its inhibitory effect on eIF4E. The increase in phosphorylation of 4E-BP in cancers suc h as ovarian, lung breast and prostate cancers has been implicated in poor patient prognos is (Armengol et al, 2007; Graff et al, 2007). phosp horylates Mnk1/2 which in turn activates eIf4E to initiate the formation of the tr anslational complex (Fukunaga & Hunter, 1997; Waskiewicz et al, 1997). Reports have shown t hat inhibiting the MAPK pathway reduced Cox-2 expression which incidentally has bee n shown to be modulated by eIF4E 48 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation also mediates protein expression of snail (Robichaud et al, 2014). Although Mnk-eIF4E phosph orylation has been reported to be dispensable for normal cell growth and development (Ueda et al, 2004), its role in cancer cell transformation is very critical (Furic et al, 2010; Ueda et al, 2010; Wendel et al, 2007). Phase 1 clinical trials using an antisense oligonuc leotide (ASO) targeting eIF4E (Graff et al, 2007) has been conducted. Ribavirin, which also targets eIF4E phosphorylation, has also been tested in acute myeloid leukemia (Assouli ne et al, 2009; Kentsis et al, 2004). These studies further emphasize the significance an d potential of targeting Mnk1/2-eIF4E translation axis in cancer therapy. During cancer metastasis, cells are noted to lose t he epithelial phenotype and attain mesenchymal characteristics to enhance invasion. St udies have shown that several EMT- induced transcriptional factors (Snail, Slug, Twist 1 and Zeb1/2), when activated recruit histone deactelyase to E-cadherin promoter and sile nce the expression of E-cadherin (Peinado et al, 2007). These factors also activate genes that are implicated in cell migration, invasion, stemness and drug resistance. Twist1, a b asic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor is critical in EMT and stemnes s has been implicated in PC metastasis (Kwok et al, 2005). Polycomb group (PcG) proteins enhance modification of the chromatin and are implicated in the maintenance of embryonic, adult s tem cells and carcinogenesis (Gil et al, 2005; Konuma et al, 2010; Pietersen & van Lohuizen, 2008). PcG proteins can occupy the promoter regions of genes, silencing them. PcG are multimeric transcriptional repressors consisting of two complexes Polycomb repressive com 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb repressive complex Spradling, al, B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1) is a member of t he PRC1 (Park et al, 2004) and has been shown to be activated by twist1 (Yang et al, 2010). Several studies have also implicated twist1 in N-Cadherin and MMP activation (Hammon et al, 2011; Weiss et al, 2012). In a recent breast cancer study, strong correlation between BMI-1 and Nanog was established and overexpressing BMI-1 also resulted in an increased expression of nanog. BMI-1 overexpression also caused NF-B activation and its target genes, thereby increasing stemness and drug resistance (Paranjape et al, 2014). An extensive study has shown a strong molecular link between cancer stemne ss and epithelial Mesenchymal transition (Yang et al, 2010). Autophagy Prostate cancer cells use several mechanisms to ind uce resistance and counteract the effects of androgen deprivation or anti-androge n therapy. Autophagy is one of these mechanisms that is up-regulated in resistant cells to enhance growth and survival even under ADT (Kim et al, 2009). The deleterious and ha rsh conditions induced in tumors by taxane-based chemotherapy, targeted kinase inhibiti on (Farrow et al, 2014), nutrient starvation, metabolic stress or ionization radiatio n amongst others (Yang et al, 2011b) are subverted by autophagy induction. Autophagy contributes to the maintenance of homeost asis in the cells by degrading damaged or long lived proteins and organelles via a n evolutionary conserved process (Meijer & Codogno, 2009; Mizushima et al, 2008). Au tophagic proteins and processes are up-regulated during cellular stress, which results in an increase in energy required by the 50 cells for survival (Gozuacik & Kimchi, 2007). Autop hagy is characterized by the formation of a double membrane structure called autophagosome that encapsulates damaged or long lived protein and organelles, this then fuse with l ysosomes to enhance the degradation of the contents (Pattingre et al, 2008). Autophagosome formation involves several autophagy related proteins (Atg) and ubiquitin-like conjugati on systems leading to the docking and fusion of autophagosome with lysosome, resulting in the formation of autolysosomes and subsequent degradation of their contents by lysosom e hydrolases (Glick et al, 2010). mTOR complex is a serine/threonine kinase made up o f two subunits: mTOR tightly regulates autophagy by det ecting signals from changes in growth factors, amino acid content, hypoxia and ene rgy content (Jung et al, 2010; Laplante & Sabatini, 2012). This is translated to modulate s everal cellular processes including autophagy. Nutrient starvation causes mTOR inhibiti on and this result in autophagy activation by initiating autophagosome formation. I n the initial stages of autophagy, the un-coordinated-51-like kinase (ULK) and class III p hosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3KCIII) complexes are crucial in the formation o f the double-membrane structure. This structure (autophagosomal) then localizes to (ER) (Itakura & Mizushima, 2010). The PI3KCIII complex is made up o f Beclin 1, the vacuolar protein sorting 15 (Vps15) and class III PI3K (Vps34). During the latter stages of autophagy, the maturati on and elongation of the autophagosome involves the microtubule-associated p rotein 1 chain phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and the Atg12-Atg5-At g16L complex. Atg10 and 7 serves as a catalyst enhancing the interaction between Atg 5 and 12, the Atg5-Atg12 conjugated complex then binds to Atg16L, noncovalently to form a tetrameric structure (Mizushima 51 et al, 2011). At complete formation of the autophag osome, the complex localizes to the outer membrane and gets released. LC3 is first hydr olyzed by Atg4 to PE ing the lipidated by Atg7 and Atg3. The Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L co mplex is also implicated in assisting the conjugation of LC3-I with PE. (Mizush ima et al, 2011). LC3-II is recycled by either delipidation of the molecules on the cytopla smic side and those inside are degraded after the formation of autolysosomes, during this p eriod the content of the autolysosome are also degraded. Autophagy and autophagosome form ation is represented in Figure 15. Figure 15: Autophagy process and potential targets for modulating autophagy Agents for cancer therapy that induce autophagy hav e been combined with Chloroquine in clinical development for the treatment of several cancers, i ncluding prostate cancer (Nakahira & Choi, 2013) Interplay between Autophagy and Apoptosis Generally autophagy and apoptosis interact and can act antagonistically to each other, however in some cases, extensive autophagy c an induce apoptosis (Maiuri et al, 2007) or necrosis and excessive cytoplasmic degrada tion leads to autophagic death. 52 The anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has b een shown to interact with Beclin 1 through its BH3 domain, Beclin 1 was thus described as a Bcl-2 interacting protein (Liang et al, 1998; Sinha & Levine, 2008). Since Be clin 1 is implicated in the initiation process of autophagy, its interaction with Bcl-2 in addition to its family members (such as Bcl-xl) have been implicated in autophagy inhibitio n (Pattingre et al, 2005). Autophagosome formation is inhibited by ER localize d Bcl-2-like molecules by inhibiting Beclin1 function, this interaction can be disrupted by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2, thus enhancing the autophagic process (Wei e t al, 2008). Beclin 1 involvement in autophagy has been extensively studied and a number of signaling pathways are known to modulate autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1 (Ab rahamsen et al, 2012; He & Levine, 2010; Wirawan et al, 2012) (Kang et al, 2011). Beclin1, caspase-8 which then inhibits autophag y and promote cell death. On the other hand, activated caspase 8 can also be degraded by t he autophagic process (Cho et al, 2009; Djavaheri-Mergny et al, 2010; Hou et al, 2010; Li e t al, 2011a; Luo & Rubinsztein, 2010; Wirawan et al, 2010). Fas-associated death do FLIP (FLICE-like et al, Irmler et al, 1997) and can compete with LC3 in binding to ATG3 which can then inhibit autophagy (Lee et al, 2009). During autopha gy, Atg5 complexes with Atg12 in addition to other Atg proteins to form the autophag osome by associating with the isolation membrane (Jounai et al, 2007); when Atg5 is proteolytically cleaved this truncated of Atg5 wh ich then translocate to the to induce apoptosis (Yousefi et al, 20 06). Atg7 is also reported to interact 53 with caspase-9 and inhibits its activity, leading t o autophagosome formation (Han et al, 2014). Autophagy and apoptosis crosstalk is represe nted in Figure and auto phagy Beclin 1, which and pushes cells towards apoptosis. Cleaved Beclin1 fragments insert into mi tochondria release. Differen tial cleavage cking of autophagy or further induction of autophagy.(Kang et al, 2011) Androgen deprivation therapy induces Autophagy On-going work has combined autophagy inhibitors an d anti-androgens to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and tumo r growth. Several clinical trials have investigated the use of chloroquine in cancers with favorable endpoints (Amaravadi et al, 2011; Sotelo et al, 2006). Studies have shown that knocking down the androgen receptor 54 in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells induced autophagy (Jiang et al, 2012). It has also been shown that in hypoxic conditions, androgen dep rivation increased autophagy (Chhipa et al, 2011; Li et al, 2008). Published work has al so demonstrated that LNCaP cells treated with Bicalutamide induced autophagy and knocking do wn Atg5 with siRNA sensitized the cells to Bicalutamide therapy (Boutin et al, 2013). Studies using enzalutamide, which also induces autophagy, showed that, autophagic inductio n was accompanied by AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and mTOR suppression by phosphorylation of Raptor at serine 792 (Nguyen et al, 2014). ADT has been known to cause hypoxia in the tumor mi croenvironment that induces autophagy (Jain et al, 1998). Low oxygen levels in tumor microenvironment induce autophagy through multiple mechanisms, including hy poxic pathways such as and also mTOR genes affecting nutr ient availability and thus autophagy are affected by the androgen signaling pathway. In prostate cancer, after androgen removal, cells undergo energetic stress that triggers the au tophagic response (Chhipa et al, 2011). Energy deficiency as a consequence of androgen remo val, results in AMPK activation which drives mTOR suppression, promoting fatty acid a nalogs was discovered as part of an ongoi ng search to design and synthesize potent small molecule inhibitors that ex hibit strong anti-prostate cancer activities for clinical development. Designing spec ific compounds to potently TOK-001, formerly called VN/124-1) w as identified as a selective development candidate which modulates the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway at multiple points reviewed (Kwegyir-Afful et al, 2015 ). Galeterone is 17-heteroazole steroidal analog, currently in phase III clinical d evelopment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Figure 17: Lead Optimization of Galeterone Initial synthetic studies to identify selective CYP 17 inhibitors, yielded a group of pregnene derivatives with substitutions at C-17 and C-20. These compounds showed higher potency than Ketoconazole (Klus et al, 1996; Li et al, 1992; Li et al, 1995; Li et al, 1996). Based on the structure and function of CYP17 a new generation of small molecule inhibitors was designed and synthesized that antago nized both CYP-17 and the androgen receptor (Clement et al, 2003; Grigoryev et al, 199 Handratta al, 1998). Chara cterizing these new compounds revealed the lead compound, galeterone, to have the most anti-tumor activity in vivo, 56 although it was neither the most potent CYP-17 inhi bitor in vitro nor the greatest AR antagonist. Using several in vitro and in vivo human prostate cancer models, it has been established that galeterone (gal) inhibits CYP17, a ntagonizes fAR, and degrades both fAR and AR-Vs in vitro ; and also reduces the expression of these proteins in tumor xenografts (Bruno et al, 2008; Bruno et al, 2011; Clement et a l, 2003; Handratta et al, et 2010; Schayowitz et al, 2008; Vasaitis et al, 2008). What is most interesting is that gal inhibit s AR positive and negative prostate cancer cell growth, suggesting involvement of additional t argets (Bruno et al, 2008). In a previous study, gal's effects on inducing endo plasmic reticulum stress response in androgen receptor (AR) negative prostate cancer cells was established (Bruno et al, 2008). Preclinical studies in androgen-independent PC cells showed that gal upregulated genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress resp onse (ERSR) (Bruno et al, 2008). Protein expression of several unfolded protein resp onse (UPR) markers that influence protein translation, eIF2 and CHOP were shown to b e modulated after gal treatment in PC-3 cells. Phosphorylation of eIF2 increased cons iderably with a significant increase in CHOP, this led to investigation of the efficacy of gal in PC-3 xenografts. Interestingly, the study showed significant reduction in tumor volumes and weights of PC-3 xenografts with gal treatment. AR-positive LAPC4 xenografts were established and t reated with gal. At the end of the study, protein expression analysis of UPR an d ERSR markers in tumor sections however revealed that, contrary to that observed in vitro, effects seen on eIF2 phosphorylation and BIP were not significantly diff erent between treated and untreated 57 groups. On the other hand, cyclin D1 protein expres sion was significantly . Cyclin D1 mRNA translation is known to be tightly regulated by the cap-dependent mRNA translation machinery (Rosenwald et al, 1995; Rosenwald et al, 1993) and since its protein expression was down-reg ulated in vitro and in vivo, both in AR-negative and AR-positive cells, we surmised that galeterone may potentially exhibit some inhibitory effects on mRNA translation . The effects seen on protein metabolism (Bruno et a l, 2008) and the compound's anti-AR activity (Purushottamachar et al, 2013b) le d to the hypothesis that gal exerts its anti-prostate cancer activities by subverting sever al oncogenic targets. In recent studies, Tokai reported that gal suppress ed castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer growth in vitro and also blocked nuclear translocation and decreased AR dependent genes (PSA , TMPRSS2, and Nkx3.1) (Nakouzi NA, 2013). Furthermore, recent clinical data show t hat administration of gal to four distinct CRPC patient populations, enzalutamide -refractory in clinically meaningful PSA reductions and an accepta ble safety profile (Montgomery G, 2014; Taplin M-E, 2014b). Additionally, following a recent report by our group that gal also strongly degrades AR-V7 (Purushottamachar et a l, 2013a), Tokai conducted a retrospective study of their phase 2 clinical data and reported positive clinical data in patients with AR C-terminal loss. This data showed PSA50 response in 6 of 7 (85.7% response) CRPC patients with AR C-terminal loss, su ggesting that gal has activity in AR- Vs-expressing CRPC patients (Montgomery G, 2014; Ta plin M-E, 2014b). This data is in contrast to a recent study where no AR-V7-positive patient had any appreciable clinical 58 benefit from enzalutamide or abiraterone therapy (A ntonarakis et al, 2014), which clearly differentiates gal from these related aforementione d androgen/AR targeting drugs. Design and synthesis of analogs of Galeterone Considering that every compound that has been appro ved by the FDA for the treatment of all stages of prostate cancer has enco untered resistance in the clinic, it is imperative to be proactive to constantly investigat e, design and synthesize small molecule inhibitors that are more potent than existing ones. Increased interests and design of more potent compounds may help stay ahead of resistance development and also be able to properly combat resistance. Continued efforts on im proving the efficacy of gal in prostate cancer treatment and also development of more poten t analogs, has seen changes being made to gal to develop prodrugs and also changes on the 3-OH of gal with several active subgroups that potentially can increase the activit y of compounds. Based on rigorous structure activity relation (SAR) studies (Purushottamachar et al, 2013b), lead optimization strategies with galet erone led to the design and synthesis of several lead compounds (Figure 17), which have show n increased potency and anticancer activity in prostate cancer cells. Our current new lead compounds (VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3), despite the promising clinical success of gal, has shown si gnificant superior anticancer activity generating the basis for further development of gal -based compounds. Because we have established that the Androgen Receptor degrading (A RD) activity appears to be the reason why gal is more efficacious than abiraterone or enz alutamide in experimental ( in vitro and in vivo models) (Bruno et al, 2011; Nakouzi NA, 2013; Puru shottamachar et al, 2013b) and 2014; Taplin M -E, 2014a; Taplin M-E, 2014b), we on strategies to discover more potent drug-like Androgen Receptor Degrading Agents (ARDA)s for further development (P urushottamachar et al, 2013b). Hypothesis and Specific Aims Rationale-Prostate cancer Prostate cancer (PCa) therapy is dependent on the s tage of diagnosis. Primarily, surgery and radiation is used for clinically locali zed prostate cancer. The standard of care treatment for patients who present with systemicall y recurred disease or locally advanced or metastatic disease is androgen-deprivation thera py. Recent studies have implicated the transcriptional significance of splice variant ARs (AR-Vs) in CRPC and resistance to two recently approved prostate cancer (PC) drugs, abira terone acetate (Zytiga\u00ae) and enzalutamide (Xtandi\u00ae). Recent reports have shown c ross resistance between the taxanes, abiraterone and enzalutamide (van Soest et al, 2013 ). The significance of the MAPK and PI3K pathways has opened up investigations into dua l acting inhibitors and combination treatment for prostate cancer. These pathways both crosstalk with the AR and are also involved in cancer cell motility and metastasis. T he promising effect of gal and its analogs in both in vitro and in vivo models of human prostate cancer provides a strong rationale for the current study. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate the molecular targets and mechanisms affected in androgen receptor downregula ting agents-induced tumor regression and in vitro anti-proliferative activities. The efficacy of ARD As on cell migration and invasion in vitro will also be investigated using PC3 and DU145 cell s. 60 Hypothesis We hypothesize that the multi-target effects of ARD As (Gal as the lead compound) on activated oncogenic pathways involved in ADT resist ance and CRPC will increase their efficacy in inhibiting prostate cancer proliferatio n, migration, invasion and tumor growth.

Combination studies to assess Synergy, additivity o r antagonism To analyze interactions between ARDAs and CGP-5738 0, chloroquine, docetaxel and gemcitabine, MTT cell viability assays were per formed for the indicated compounds with the respective cell lines. The GI 50 values were calculated using graphpad prism. Two different compounds were combined at a constant rat io and cells treated just as in cell viability assays. The fraction of cells affected af ter treatment period was analyzed as described previously (Chou et al, 1993). The calcus yn software was used to determine the combination index (CI), where CI<1 indicate synergy , CI=1 indicates additive and CI>1 indicates antagonism. Cell Cycle analysis Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 60% confluenc e overnight to allow cells to attach. The cells were then subsequently serum star ved with phenol-red free RPMI to arrest 70 the cells at G0/G1 phase. After 12 hours, media was replaced with complete RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and cells treated with co mpounds at (5-20 \u00b5M) for 24 hours. After the indicated time point, cells were washed 2 X with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and thoroughly resuspended in 200 \u00b5l of PBS. Sevent y percent (70%) ethanol was used to fix the cells. The fixation step was incubated at 40C overnight. Cells were washed twice with 2ml PBS and pelleted at 800g for 5 minutes.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation Treated cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyd e at room temperature for 30 minute and crosslinking neutralized with 125 nM gly cine for 5 minutes. Cells were washed and resuspended in FA lysis buffer. Samples were so nicated 10 secs for 10 X. Clarified samples were incubated with 5 \u00b5g of NF-B (p50) or 5 30 \u00b5l of agarose A/G beads for 14 hours at 4 0C. Control samples were incubated with 5 \u00b5g of normal rabbit IgG and beads alone as negative contr ols. Complexes were washed 3X with wash buffer and eluted.

Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD) Studies Toxicity of VNPP433-3 was evaluated in male nude mice. The first study was an acute dosing with 25, 50 and 100 mg with vehicle co ntrol. Animals were put in groups of 3. After administering a bolus dose intraperitoneal ly, weights of mice were taken 2X a week for duration of 16 days. Animals were sacrific ed. The maximum tolerated dose was then used in chronic dosing at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 MTD, where animals were injected 5X a week for 16 days and weights of mice taken 2X a week. At the end of the chronic dosing animals were sacrificed and liver, kidneys and lung were ha rvested for H & E staining to evaluate toxicities. Developing Resistance cells and Microarray Analysis LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were cultured in doses of Galeterone from (0.1 to 14 \u00b5M). Concentrations were increased at 0.5 \u00b5M and ma intained at a particular concentration and media replaced every 3 days until cell death re duced and cells started to grow aggressively. Cells were eventually maintained at 3 , 6 and 9 \u00b5M for LNCaP cells and 4.5, 9 and 14 \u00b5M for CWR22Rv1 cells. Resistance cells we re developed and maintained for over 24 months. MTT cell viability assays were perf ormed on these cells to ascertain their resistance to Galeterone and compare their 50% grow th inhibition constant (GI 50 ) values to the parental cell lines. Cells were re-named LN-124 R (for LNCaP Galeterone resistant cells) and RV1-124R (for CWR22Rv1 galeterone resist ant cells), with the concentrations at which they are resistant at the end. 76 CWR22Rv1 cells resistant to Galeterone were treate d with VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 at 5 \u00b5M for 72 hours. Cells were treated in triplicates and RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit following manufacturer s' protocol. Triplicate samples were treated with DNase and analyzed using an Affymetrix GeneChip (Human Transcriptome genome wide array 2.0) In Vivo xenograft tumor growth All animal studies were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Maryland , School of Medicine, Baltimore. Male severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice 5 -6 weeks of age were obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Fredrick, MD). Surgically castrated mice were housed under complete aseptic conditions, fed autoclaved p ellets and sterile water ad libitum. Following a week of acclimatization, approximately 5\u00d710 6 CWR22Rv1 cells were inoculated into both flanks. Tumor-bearing mice (tu mor volume around 50-70 mm 3) were randomized into 3 groups (6 mice in each group; com pounds formulated in vehicle) and treated as follows: (i) vehicle control (40% days/week) and (iii) VNPT55 (0.15 mmol/kg, intraperitoneal, twice daily, 5 days /week). Tumors were measured twice weekly with calipers and tumor volume was calculate d by the formula: length x width 2 x 0.5 (mm 3). Animals were also weighed weekly and monitored f or general health status and signs of possible toxicity due to treatments. Mice were sacrificed after the indicated periods of treatment and tumors and organs excised. Tumors were divided and either flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or placed in 10% buffered formal in for western blot analysis, IHC and hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining. 77 Immunohistochemical Analysis All specimens were kept in 10% buffered formalin fo r 24 hours after which they were embedded in paraffin and 4 M thick slides pre pared and used for immunostaining and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunostaining sect ions were de-parafinised, soaked in alcohol, and antigen retrieval was performed for fo rmalin fixed tissues by heating in citrate buffer (pH = 6). Sections were blocked in 3% hydrog en peroxide for 5 minutes, followed by incubation with the appropriate antibody and epi topes detected using the Ultra-sensitive Avidin-biotin complex (ABC) staining kit (Thermo fi sher scientific, USA). The images were captured with an EVOS\u00ae FL Auto Imaging System (Life Technologies). Statistical analysis All in vitro experiments were repeated at least three times and reported as means with standard error of the means (S.E.M) where appl icable. Western blot on in vivo samples were repeated in at least 2 different tumor section s from different animals. Student T-test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to deter mine the significance of deviations or lack thereof. 78 Chapter 4: Results: Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the molecular mechanism involved in Gal/VNPT55-induced AR/AR-V7 degradation and apoptotic induction in prostate can cer cells. Effect of gal and VNPT55 on full length AR and spli ce variant AR- Vs Recent efforts in our lab are focused on designing and synthesizing more potent analogs of gal (Purushottamachar et al, 2013b) whic h targets and deplete full length AR/splice variant AR-Vs (fAR/AR-V7) to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells (Purushottamachar et al, 2013a). Our initial attemp t to compare gal and its new lead analog was determined using cell viability assays in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 18). VNPT55 exhibited stronger growth inhibitory activit y (GI 50 = 0.87 and 2.45 \u00b5M vs. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1, respectively) compared to gal (GI 50 = 3.35 and 4.46 \u00b5M vs. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1, respectively). 79 Figure 18: Gal and VNPT55 decrease cell viability i n AR positive PC cells. Cell viability assays were conducted in LNCaP and C WR22Rv1 cells over a 7-day period and cell viabilit y analyzed by graphpad Prizm 4. GI 50 values were plotted on a bar chart to compare grow th inhibition activities of both gal and VNPT55. Analysis of GI 50 values shows a significant increase (p<0.05) in pot ency of VNPT55 over gal in both cell lines. Based on the recent report that gal decreases fAR m RNA in LNCaP cells (Soifer et al, 2012), we compared the effects of gal and VNPT5 5 on fAR/AR-V7 mRNA levels. Both gal and VNPT55 decreased fAR mRNA levels in LNCaP c ells (Figure. 19, left panel ). Interestingly, although gal had no effect on AR-V7 mRNA, VNPT55 significantly decreased AR-V7 mRNA even at 1 \u00b5mol/L (Figure. 19, right panel ) in CWR22Rv1 cells. It is interesting that minor modification to the pa rent compound increases the analog's potency and efficacy in modulating fAR/AR-V7 at bot h transcriptional and posttranslational levels. 80 Figure Gal and VNPT55 downregulate AR/AR-V7 A.

B, CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of gal and V NPT55 (1, 5, 10, 20 M) for 24 hours and mRNA collected, qRT-PCR of analysis of AR-V7 mRNA levels To establish and compare the efficacies of gal/VNPP T55 on AR-Vs, we analyzed the potency of gal and VNPT55 in depleting protein levels of fAR/AR-V7 in CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 20, left panel ). Densitometry analysis of the efficacy of gal and VNPT55 on AR/AR-V7 protein levels shows a strong decrease of AR/AR-V7 to 0.4/0.3 after gal treatment and a more profound decrease after VNPT55 treatment to 0.3/0.09 of AR/AR- V7, respectively (Figure 20, right panel ). In agreement with our earlier report (Purushottamachar et al, 2013a), the efficacy of VN PT55 on cell viability and AR-induced depletion appears to be superior to that of gal. 81 Figure 20: Gal and VNPT55 significantly deplete fAR /AR-V7 protein expression. Effects of gal and VNPT55 on fAR/AR-V7 in CWR22Rv1 cells ( left panel ), (3) of experiments **p < 0.001 ( right panel ), show significant decrease of fAR/AR-V7 protein expression. It is well documented that CWR22Rv1 cells express a number of AR-Vs (Guo et al, 2009a; Kong et al, 2015). Thus, to eliminate th e possibility of AR-V7 antibody cross- reacting with other AR-Vs and to specifically deter mine its effects on particular AR-Vs, DU145 cells were transfected with AR-V7 expression plasmid and treated with gal or VNPT55. At concentrations of 5 and 10 \u00b5M, each comp ound significantly depleted AR- V7 (Figure 21, right panel ). Transfection of AR v567es (AR splice variant expressed in CRPC (Sun et al, 2010)) and subsequent treatment with ga l/VNPT55 yielded similar results (Fig. 21, left panel ). 82 Figure 21: Gal and VNPT55 deplete protein expressio n of AR-V7 and ARv567es. (Left panel ) DU145 cells were transfected with 0.5 g of AR v567es expression plasmid as in B and treated with gal and VNPT55 (5 and 10 M) for 24 hours, ( right panel ) DU145 cells transfected with 0.5 g of AR-V7 expression plasmid for 16 hours and Cells subsequen tly treated with gal and VNPT55 (5 and 10 M) for 2 4 hours. We also confirmed the effects of gal and VNPT55 see n on AR protein expression by incubating LNCaP cells for 48 hours with the ind icated compounds at 5\u00b5M and performed immunocytochemical analysis, counterstain ing with DAPI. Here we observed the same depletion effects, via decrease in fluores cence stain (Figure 22). Figure 22: Gal and VNPT55 deplete AR nuclear expres sion. LNCaP cells were serum starved for 12 hours and sub sequently treated with indicated compounds for 72 hours. Decrease in AR nuclear stain suggested that VNPT55 retained the AR degradation activity of the parent compound (gal). 83 Gal and VNPT55 antagonize AR transcriptional activi ty Gal has been shown to antagonize AR transcriptiona l activity by using several binding assays and luciferase activity inhibition. In these studies, gal shows binding to the androgen receptor and inhibiting it. Current studie s, in our laboratory, to establish VNPT55's mode of action in antagonizing AR activity , showed that VNPT55 bound less strongly to AR compared to galeterone. However, our studies also showed that in addition t o depleting fAR protein and mRNA level, VNPT55 also decreases mRNA levels of sp lice variant AR-V7. We also evaluated the effects of VNPT55 on AR transcription al activity. (Figure 23). We exposed LNCaP cells to increasing concentrations of galeter one and VNPT55 for 24 hours. Although the time point for calculating EC 50 was not long enough, we observed that just as with galeterone, VNPT55 had a lower EC 50 value in depleting PSA than AR as shown in Figure 23. This suggests that in addition to deg rading the receptor, VNPT55 like gal antagonizes the transcriptional activity of AR. A r ecent published work on gals activity on AR indicated that gal inhibited AR from binding to chromatin (Yu et al, 2014). These recent findings demonstrate that gal and its analog s may use several mechanisms in antagonizing the transcriptional activities of the androgen receptor. In addition, even though VNPT55 was more efficaciou s in depleting the AR over a 24-hour time point, with a lower EC 50 value, the fold change in decreasing PSA expressio n between the two agents was comparable and not signi ficantly different. This suggests that, although our binding studies indicated that VNPT55 had weak interaction with the androgen receptor compared to gal, it may in fact a ntagonize its transcriptional activity more potently. 84 Figure 23: Gal and VNPT55 antagonize AR transcripti onal activity (A), Western blot analysis were performed in LNCaP cells with increasing concentration of VNPT55 and protein expression of AR and PSA evaluated after 24 hours. (B), Densitometry of western blot bands wer e analyzed with ImageJ and dose-effect curves plotted to compute EC 50 values analyzed with graphpad prism, (C) Bar chart was used to emphasize the fold change in antagonizing AR transcription of PSA. Gal/VNPT55 induced proteasomal degradation of AR/AR -V7 The proteasomal pathway has been described as one o f the major mechanisms regulating AR turnover (Gioeli & Paschal, 2012; Hoe ller & Dikic, 2009; Lin et al, 2002a; Lin et al, 2002b). To determine the involvement of the 26S proteasome in gal- or VNPT55- enhanced depletion of AR/AR-V7 protein, we co-treat ed LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells with gal or VNPT55 and a proteasome inhibitor, MG13 2. As shown in 24, significantly rescued gal- a nd VNPT55 induced fAR/AR-V7 CWR22Rv1 cells. 85 Figure 24: Gal/VNPT55-induced AR/AR-V7 degradation is via the proteasome (A), LNCaP and (B) CWR22Rv1 cells treated with gal at 20 \u00b5M for 16 hours, thereafter, MG132 (5 \u00b5M) was added for an extra 8 hours. Immunoblot analysis was carried out on fAR and AR-V7 protein expressio n Our previously published report implicated intracel lular calcium ion ([Ca 2+ ] i) release and induction of ERSR in PC-3 PC cells as a possible mechanism of action of gal (Bruno et al, 2008). Because other studies have est ablished Ca 2+ -dependent, calpain- mediated breakdown of f-AR in human PC cells (Chen et al, 2010a; Pelley et al, 2006; Sivanandam et al, 2011; Yang et al, 2008), we consi dered it important to determine whether gal's depletion of AR may implicate calpains. Indee d, although inhibition of calpains with calpeptin (Cal) did not entirely rescue gal/VNPT55- induced AR degradation (Figure 25), it indicates to a minor extent (~20%), that the poss ible release of Ca 2+ induced by gal treatment enhanced AR depletion. In addition, we ev aluated the effects of caspases, if any, on Gal-induced AR protein depletion, from Figure 26 , we observed that, with the use of 86 pan caspase inhibitor (ZVAD-fmk), caspases do not p lay any significant role in gal-induced AR degradation. Figure 25: Calpain activation decreases fAR express ion in vitro . (A), LNCaP cells treated with galeterone ( top panel ) and VNPT55 ( bottom panel ) with or without calpeptin (40 M) for 24 hours and western blot analysis carr ied out on AR protein expression.

(A), LNCaP cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M of gal wit h or without caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk (20 M) fo r 24 hours and AR protein expression analyzed. (B), D ensitometry analysis of AR protein expression normalized to control. 87 Since ubiquitination precedes 26S proteasomal prote in degradation (Baumeister et al, 1998), we examined whether gal enhanced AR and AR-V7 ubiquitination. Gal treatment in the presence of MG132 significantly increased AR ubiquitination compared to MG132 alone (Figure 27, left panel ) in LNCaP cells. In CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 27, right panel ), immunoprecipitated AR-V7 in the presence of gal and MG132 interestingly also shows an increase in AR-V7 ubiquitination. Figure 27: Gal induce ubiquitination of AR and AR-V 7. (A), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 (B) cells were treated with gal at 20 \u00b5M for 16 hours, thereafter, MG132 (5 \u00b5M) was added for an extra 8 hours and 1 mg of tota l cell lysate used in immunoprecipitation and probe d with ubiquitin antibodies. Implication of Akt and Mdm2 phosphorylation in gal/ VNPT55- induced AR degradation PI3k of Akt (at Ser473 and Thr308), Mdm2 (at Ser166) and AR (at Ser210/213 and Ser790) this post translational modification can serve as a signal for AR ubiquitylation and subsequent de gradation (Deep et al, 2008; Gioeli & Paschal, 2012; Lin et al, 2002a; Lin et al, 2002b). We next examined the effects of gal and VNPT55 on Akt and Mdm2 phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 28A and B, treatment of LNCaP or CWR22Rv1 cells with gal or VNPT55, resulte d in increased phosphorylation of 88 Akt at Thr308 and Ser473. Mdm2 phosphorylation at S er166 also increased significantly. It is important to note that, although phosphorylat ed levels of AR seem to decrease (see band intensities), the relative levels of phosphory lated AR to total AR show an increase in AR phosphorylation, both in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cell s (Figure 28 C, densitometry ). Total AR levels decrease due to depletion effects o f gal and VNPT55, so in order to quantify phosphorylated AR levels we calculated the p-AR/AR ratio (Figure 28 C). We then investigated the significance of Akt/Mdm2 p hosphorylation in gal/VNPT55-induced co-treating g al/VNPT55 suppressed agent- induced AR degradation significantly (~90%) (Figure 29 A and B). In CWR22Rv1 (Figure 29 C) cells, we observed that rescue of gal-induced fAR degradation was similar to the trend in LNCaP cells in Figure 29 A. In contrast, A R-V7 depletion was not rescued, but was further depleted compared to gal alone treatmen t. It is well-established that the lack of LBD and thus loss of N-C interaction changes AR-V7 dynamics and interacting proteins (Cao et al, 2013b; Sarkar et al, 2014). It is reaso nable to suggest that this phenomenon may contribute to the effects seen when gal is combined with LY294002. 89 Figure 28: Gal and VNPT55 enhance phosphorylation o f Akt, Mdm2 and AR. (A and B), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, serum starved for 12 hours were treated with increasing concentrations (5, 10 and 20 \u00b5M) of gal or VNPT55 f or 24 hours. Immunoblot analysis show that gal and VNPT55 induce phosphorylation of Akt at Threonine 3 08 and serine 473. The agents also enhanced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at serine 166 (C). Densitom etry was done for phosphorylated levels of AR, normalizing p-AR to the total AR expression after g al and VNPT55 treatment. Here it was observed that both agents enhanced phosphorylation of AR at both serin e 210 and 213 90 Figure 29: Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3k/Akt pat hway restores AR expression (A & B), LNCaP cells were serum starved for 12 hour s and pre-treated with and then treated with gal/VNPT55 (20 M). PI3k/Akt inhibition rescued the effects of gal on A R, whereas inhibiting MAPK did not rescue gal-induc ed AR depletion (C) CWR22Rv1 cells were serum starved in phenol red free media supplemented with charcoal dextran FBS for 12 hours and treated with gal (20 M) for 24 hours after pretreating with LY294002 (20 M) or U0126 (20 M) for 1 hour. Here we observed s imilar results with full length AR, however AR-V7 expression was not restored with neither LY294002 n or U0126 91 The PI3k-Akt and the mitogen activated protein kina se (MAPK) pathways both crosstalk with the AR and induce its phosphorylatio n at different serine and threonine residues (Gioeli & Paschal, 2012; Lin et al, 2001; Yeh et al, 1999). To rule out any possible involvement of MAPK pathway in gal/VNPT55-induced A h gal in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. As shown in Figure 29 A, B and C, t he ability of gal to degrade fAR and AR-V7 were not blocked in the presence of U0126. It has been reported that both LY294002 and UO126 e xhibits off-target effects and decreases AR protein expression (Agoulnik et al, 20 08; Eisold et al, 2009; Liu & Dong, 2014; Sharma et al, 2002). In agreement with previo us reports, we observed that U0126 suppressed AR expression (Figure 30 A). In addition , we show that U0126 decreased AR- V7 expression in CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 30 B). In c ontrast to the effects of LY294002 or U0126 on fAR degradation, the combination of the se inhibitors with gal cause enhanced AR-V7 degradation (Figure 29 C). It is possible tha t the loss in N-C interaction in AR-V7 and as a consequence, the loss in c-terminal phosph orylation sites needed to enhance AR- V7 stability and/or possible off-target effects of the inhibitors may be potentiated by gal. Collectively, these data suggest that unlike MAPK k inase, PI3k/Akt kinase plays a significant role in gal-induced fAR degradation. 92 Figure 30: PI3k/Akt and MAPK inhibitors shows contr asting effects on AR/AR-V7. (A and B). LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were treated wi th PI3k inhibitor (20 M) and MAPK inhibitor (20 M) for 24 hours and their single effects on AR and AR-V7 analyzed. MAPK inhibitor (U0126) depleted expression of AR and AR-V7 modestly. Inhibiting the PI3k/Akt pathway on the contrary showed no effects on both AR and AR-V7 Gal enhances fAR/AR-V7-Mdm2/CHIP interaction Mdm2 and CHIP are two of the well-studied and estab lished E3 ligases involved in AR al, 2003; He et al, 2004; Sarkar et al, 2014). To determine their involvement in gal-induced fAR/ARV7 degradation, Mdm2 or CHIP were silenced using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in LNC aP or CWR22Rv1 cells followed by treatments with gal for 24 hours. As shown in Figur e 31 A, although both Mdm2 and CHIP knockdown inhibited fAR degradation, the effect was more significant with Mdm2 knockdown in LNCaP cells. Conversely, in CWR22Rv1 c ells, silencing of CHIP E3 ligase exhibited a higher rescue effect on gal-induced deg radation of AR-V7 (Figure 31 B). Knocking down Mdm2 in CWR22Rv1 cells and treating w ith gal also showed that Mdm2 93 is involved in gal-induced AR-V7 degradation, altho ugh to a lesser degree (0.5 rescue effects as opposed to 0.9 with CHIP knockdown) (Fig ure 31B). We also knockdown Mdm2 or CHIP and in the absence of gal, there was no sig nificant effect on fAR or AR-V7 (Figure 31 C and D). Figure 31: Knockdown E3 ligase sfected with or CHIP siRNAs (100 nM each), with scrambled siRNA as control. Cells were then ex posed to 20 \u00b5M gal for 24 hours. Results show that Mdm2 is more significant in gal-induced AR degradat ion, although inhibiting the CHIP E3 ligase also inhabited gal-induced AR degradation (B), CWR22Rv1 cells were subjected to similar transfection and treatment conditions as in A, separated proteins we re probed for fAR, AR-V7, Mdm2 CHIP. We observed that CHIP E3 ligase is more critical in gal-induced AR-V7 degradation. We did observe a modest rescue effect of AR-V7 when Mdm2 was knocked down. (C), LN CaP and CWR22Rv1 (D) cells were serum starved for 12 hours and transfected with Mdm2 or CHIP siRN A for 72 hours and protein expression analyzed by western blot. 94 Mdm2 has previously been reported to interact and e nhance AR ubiquitination preceding its degradation via the 26S proteasome (L in et al, 2002b). From our siRNA knockdown experiments (Figure 31 A), we hypothesize d that gal enhanced AR-Mdm2 and AR-V7-CHIP interactions, thereby increasing the rec eptors' ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. To ensure immunoprecipitating approxim ately equal amount of proteins, specifically fAR/AR-V7, in both control and treated groups, cells were treated for either 11 or 14 hours with gal at 10 M and total cell lysates analyzed prior to immunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 32 A and B) . Figure 32: Time point shows approximately equal amo unts of Immunoprecipitated proteins. (A & B), Total cell lysates from treated and untrea ted cells (LNCaP and CWR22Rv1) were analyzed to determine the effects of gal before immunoprecipita tion assays were conducted. Protein expression was not significantly altered after gal treatment at the in dicated (11 and 14 hours in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 respectively) time points to enable equal amounts o f immunoprecipitated fAR/AR-V7. Full length AR has been shown to interact with HSP 90 and Mdm2 to either stabilize it or enhance its degradation respectively. In our initial efforts to analyze the effects gal had on AR and its interacting proteins, we evaluate d AR-V7's interaction with Mdm2 and 95 HSP90 in the presence of gal. Our preliminary scree n showed that in the presence of gal, interaction between mdm2 and AR-V7 or HSP90 and AR- V7 decreased (Figure 33 A-C). Figure 33: Gal treatment decreases interaction betw een AR-V7 and HSP90/Mdm2. (A, B & C), Immunoprecipitation assays showed that AR-V7 lost interaction with Mdm2 and HSP90 in the presence of gal. Treatments with gal greatly enhanced fAR-Mdm2 inter action in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 34 A, top and middle panels ). Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to interact with AR in a heteromeric complex which enhances stability of the non- ligand bound receptor (Gioeli & Paschal, AR-Hsp90 dissociation AR degradation (Solit et al, 2002). We dete rmined the effects of gal on Hsp90- fAR interaction. Interestingly, we found that in bo th LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, gal treatment significantly reduced this interaction (F igure 34 B, top and middle panels ). Results from immunoprecipitation assays were consis tent with our siRNA experiments, in that the CHIP ligase is more sig nificant Gal enhanced associ ation between CHIP and AR-V7 (Figure 34 A, bottom panel ). A recent report on the possibility of HSP70-AR- V7 interaction (Shafi et al, 2013a), prompted us to in vestigate the effects of gal on this interaction if any. Indeed, we found that gal enhan ced HSP70-AR-V7 interaction (Figure 96 34 C, bottom panel ), suggesting HSP70 involvement in the formation of a degradation complex. The Co-IP with AR confirmed increased inte ractions in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, respectively, between fAR and Mdm2 and a los s in interaction between fAR and HSPp90 (Figure 34 C, top and middle panels ). As shown in Figure 35 C ( bottom panel) , we immunoprecipitated AR-V7 from CWR22Rv1 cell lysa tes and observed an increase in interacting proteins CHIP and HSP70. These data sug gest that, changes observed in HSP90-AR and HSP70-AR-V7 interactions after gal tre atment possibly rendered the receptors more susceptible to proteasomal degradati on, in agreement with documented reports of small molecule-induced fAR degradation v ia the ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis pathway (Gioeli & Paschal, et al, 2014; Shafi et al, 2013a). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that gal/VNPT55-induced fAR/AR- V7 protein degradation is mediated predominantly through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway that involves Mdm2 and CHIP E3 dissociation. Input lanes are from control (DMSO) treated cell l ysates to confirm molecular weights of immunoprecipitated proteins. (A), LNCaP ( top panel ) and CWR22Rv1 ( middle and bottom panel ) cells were serum starved for 12 hours and treated with 10 \u00b5M o f gal for 14 hours (LNCaP) and 11 hours (CWR22Rv1); 1 mg of total cell lysate was subjected to immunopr ecipitation with Mdm2 and CHIP rabbit polyclonal antibodies. (B), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were trea ted as in A and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with HSP90 and Hsp70 rabbit polyclonal Co-immunoprecipitation AR (N20) polyclonal and AR- V7 mouse monoclonal antibodies were carried out with 1 mg cell lysates after treating with gal (10 M) for 14 hours (LNCaP cells) and 11 hours (CWR22R v1 cells). monoclonal antibodies. Gal and VNPT55 induce significant apoptosis in PC c ells Considering the strong impact gal or VNPT55 have in promoting the degradation of AR/AR-Vs proteins, and thus, their preclinical a nti-prostate cancer activities and their efficacy in the clinic ( vide supra ), another important focus in this study was also t o determine whether these compounds induce apoptosis in PC cells. Apoptotic induction was 98 initially (AO/EB) dual staining of LNCaP or CWR22Rv 1 with gal or VNPT55 (2.5 \u00b5M each) for 72 hours induced apoptosis as assessed by loss of cell membrane integrity and nuclear fragmentation (cells stained yellow/reddish orange) (Figure 35). Cells undergoing apoptosis loose membrane integrity enabling ethidiu m bromide to penetrate cells, whereas viable cells are only permeable to acridine orange which stains green (Huang et al, 2012; Ramalingam et al, 2014; Ribble et al, 2005). Figure 35: Gal and VNPT55 induce apoptosis in PC ce in LNCaP (to p panel) and CWR22Rv1 (bottom panel) cells. Indicated cells lines were treated with 2.5 M of gal or VNP T55 for 72 hours. Live, apoptotic and necrotic cells st ain green, orange and red respectively. Arrows next to L indicate live cells; arrows pointing to A indicate apoptotic cells; and arrows pointing N indicate nec rotic cells Furthermore, we also assessed gal/VNPT55 apoptotic induction by flow cytometry. CWR22Rv1 cells treated for 24 hours with gal and VN PT55 (5 and 10 \u00b5M) were stained with Annexin-v and Propidium iodide, following manu facturers protocol. Interestingly, we observed that at 5 \u00b5M, gal and VNPT55 significantly induced apoptosis in CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure. 36). 99 Figure 36: Apoptotic measured by fluoresc ence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. CWR22Rv1 cells treated with gal and VNPT55 at 5 and 10 M after 24 hours were collected and washed 2X with PBS. Cells were then stained with annexin-v an d PI. FACS analysis was performed for apoptotic cel ls Results indicate significant increase in apoptosis with increasing concentration (* p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001) Further analysis on poly (ADP) ribose (PARP) cleava ge, a well-established signature et al, 1995), sho ws a dose-dependent effect on activated caspase 3 and cleaved PARP in both LNCaP (Fig 37, left panel ) and CWR22Rv1 cells (Fig. 37, right panel ). Figure VNPT55 ), cells were serum starved in phenol-red free medi a supplemented with charcoal dextran cFBS for 12 hour s and treated with increasing doses of gal or VNPT5 5 (5, 10 and 20 M) for 24 hours. Cleaved PARP and ca spase 3 were analyzed by western blot. We observed increase in caspase3 and PARP cleavage with increas ing concentration of the agents. 100 As stated earlier, we previously reported that gal modulates intracellular Ca 2+ levels and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Increase in intracellular Ca 2+ ions is reported to activate calpains. This activation can result in calpain-induced-apoptosis, by activating a variety of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bid, to enhance cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (Smith & Schnellmann, 2012). Thus, we directed our efforts to determine whether gal-induced apoptosis was a result of activ ated calpains, and/or solely due to other well-established pathways. Initial attempts with ti me-dependent analysis of gal on PARP cleavage showed this to coincide with calpain activ ation at 12 hours post gal treatment (Figure. 38A). To assess whether gal/VNPT55-induced PARP cleavage is a consequence of caspase activation via other mechanisms or due t o calpain activation, LNCaP cells were treated with gal in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, or the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin. Data presented in Fig ure 38 B and C shows that both gal and VNPT55-induced PARP cleavage was predominantly not via calpain activation. 101 Figure 38: Gal and VNPT55 induce apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway. (A), LNCaP cells were treated with gal at 20 M for different time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 hours). , protein expression analysis show that PARP cleavage and cal pain activation coincided 12 hours' post-gal treatm ent (B & C). LNCaP cells were exposed to gal or VNPT55 at 20 \u00b5M in combination with calpeptin (40 \u00b5M) or ZVAD-fmk (20 \u00b5M) for 24 hours. The results suggest that gal/VNPT55 induced PARP cleavage does not implicate calpain activation Since calpain inhibition not significantly inhi bit caspase 3 and PARP cleavage, we focused enhance mitochondrial et al, 2003; Huang et al, 201 2; Tan et al, 2006). LNCaP cells treated with increasing doses of gal resulted in significan t and remarkable enhancement of the pro- apoptotic protein, Bax and a modest decrease in ant i-apoptotic Bcl2 (Figure 39, left blot ), leading to profound increase of the Bax/Bcl2 ratio (Figure 39, right chart ). 102 Figure 39: Gal induces Bax upregulation and deplete s Bcl2. LNCaP cells serum starved for 12 hours were treated with gal (5, 10 and 20 M) for 24 hours and immunoblotted for Bax and Bcl2 ( left panel ). Densitometry analysis of Bax/ Bcl2 ratio show a remarkably strong increase with increase in gal concentration (** p < 0.001) ( right chart ). An increase in Bax and its translocation to the mit ochondria has been implicated in cytochrome c release into the cytosol (Eskes et al, 1998; Jurgensmeier et al, 1998; Pastorino et al, 1998), and it has also been shown that Bax c o-localization with mitochondria results in Bax protein pore formation to enhance the releas e of mitochondrial intermembrane protein (Antonsson et al, 1997; Eskes et al, 1998; Schlesinger et al, 1997). We therefore stained for Bax-mitochondria co-localization in bot h LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells after 24 hour-treatments with gal or VNPT55. As shown in Figure 40 gal/VNPT55 treatments cause Bax co-localization with mitochondria (yellow stains). To show cytochrome c release as a result of Bax translocation and pore f ormation in the mitochondria, CWR22Rv1 cells mitotracker and cytochrome c af ter a 24-hour gal/VNPT55 treatment. As illustrated in Figure 41, we see a si gnificant release of cytochrome c, as indicated by co-localization of cytochrome c (green ) and mitotracker (red) in control (DMSO) contrary to treated cells. 103 In summary, gal and VNPT55 induce profound apoptosi s in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. Importantly, these promising and ro bust data differ from previous reports which suggest that current PC drugs that bl ock AR transactivation do not cause significant apoptosis, which is thought, in part, t o be the basis of their failure in the clinic (Sadar, 2011). Figure permeability. (Top panel) LNCaP cells were treated with 10 M galeterone or VNPT55 for 24 hour s. Cells were then stained with mitotracker (RED CMXRos) and Bax antibody. ( Bottom panel ) CWR22Rv1 cells were treated as in LNCaP cells and subsequently stained with mitotracker and Bax antib ody. Images were taken and merged. Areas of co- localization are yellow. Results suggest that gal/V NPT55 enhance Bax co-localization to the mitochondr 41: Gal/VNPT55 induce cytochrome c release. CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in an 8-chamber slide an d treated with gal or VNPT55 (5 and 10 \u00b5M) for 24 hours. Cells were then incubated with 125 nM of mit otracker at 37 0C for 15 minutes after which cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with c ytochrome c at 4 0C for 12 hours. In the treatment wells, we observe cytochrome c release represented by gree n fluorescence, contrary to what was observed in co ntrol wells (yellow fluorescence). Effects of Gal and VNPT55 on Nuclear Receptors To demonstrate the specificity of gal/VNPT55 and ev aluate any off-target effects, we assessed the effect of gal or VNPT55 on the leve ls of related nuclear receptor proteins in LNCaP cells, including, progesterone receptor (P R), estrogen receptor beta (ER) and retinoic acid receptors (RAR- and -), which are k nown to be regulated by the 105 proteasome-mediated pathway (Varshavsky, 2005). As shown in Figure 42 A, whereas gal/VNPT55 caused profound depletion of AR, no chan ge in PR, RAR and RAR protein levels were detected. In addition, and as expected, there was a modest up-regulation of ER (a PC tumor suppressor) (Dondi et al, 2010), as a c onsequence of AR depletion (Hartman et al, 2012). Interestingly, gal had no significant effect on AR expression in immortalized untransformed PWR-1E (epithelial) prostate cells (F igure 42 B) and prostate stromal cells (Figure 42 C), however VNPT55 did show significant depletion of stromal expressed AR. These data suggest that gal and VNPT55 exhibit cell selective induction of AR degradation. Figure 42: Gal/VNPT55 show no significant effect on PR/RAR/RAR. (A), 12 hours' serum starved LNCaP cells were treat ed with gal (5, 10, 20 M) or VNPT55 (5, 10, 20 M) for 24 hours, using DMSO as control. Contrary to ef fects observed on AR, there was no observable downregulation effects on PR/RAR/RAR. There was increased in ER expression (B), Immortalized untransformed prostate epithelial cells (PWR-1E cel ls) were incubated in phenol red free charcoal dext ran FBS for 12 hours and treated with gal or VNPT55 at 5, 10 and 20 M for an additional 24 hours. There w as no significant effect on AR expression in these non cancerous cells (C), Immortalized untransformed pro state stromal cells (WPMY-1) were treated as in (B) and A R expression analyzed. Protein expression of stroma l cell AR was decreased, although not as significant in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. 106 Summary and Discussion of Specific Aim 1 Androgen receptor pathway antagonism is one of the major strategies in prostate cancer therapy. Currently gal's efficacy against HS PC and CRPC cancer cells is strongly related to its multiple effects. Additional inhibit ory effects of gal on AR binding to chromatin were reported by Balk and colleagues (Pel ley et al, 2006). Overexpression of fAR and AR-Vs is implicated in resistance to curren t approved therapy in HSPC and CRPC (Chen et al, 2004; Dehm & Tindall, 2011). Through t he use of clinically relevant PC cell lines and pharmacologic inhibitors, we demonstrated that fAR and AR-V7 protein degradation by these two novel agents involves pred ominantly, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The potential roles of Mdm2 and CHIP E3 li gases in gal-induced degradation of fAR and AR-V7, respectively, are summarized in a mo del in Figure 43. Interestingly, the fact that fAR and AR-V7 mRNA lev els and their protein levels following treatment of PC cells with gal or VNPT55 were significantly depleted, as well as AR v567es protein levels, suggest that these agents could de plete a wide range of AR mutants or variants that are expressed in CRPC. AR is known to auto-regulate its transcription (Wolf et al, 1993), and a decline of AR protein would be expected to cause an increase in AR transcription. However, the fact that we observe a decrease in AR mRNA and protein depletion suggests that gal and its ana log could sustain a down-regulation of AR in PC patients. It is also important to note tha t resistance and proliferation abilities of PC cells due to activated pathways by non-genotropi c activities of AR (Peterziel et al, 1999) will be eliminated resulting in an enhanced a nti-cancer activity. 107 Figure 43: Schematic for gal induced AR/AR-V7 degra dation. 1) Major pathway for gal-induced fAR degradation ( left ). Gal treatment of PC cells implicates PI3K/Akt pathway: Akt phosphorylates AR at Ser210. Active Ak also phosphorylates Mdm2, which enhances ubiquitination of AR. Ubiquitinated AR is degraded by the 26S proteasome. 2) Major pathway for gal- induced AR-V7 degradation ( right) ). Gal treatment of PC cells stimulates increased i nteraction between CHIP-AR-V7, which then enhances ubiquitination of A R-V7 and targets it to degradation via the 26S proteasome. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that pharmaco logical inhibition of Akt phosphorylation suppressed gal-induced fAR degradat ion in contrast to the effects seen with AR-V7 degradation. Single agent treatment with LY294002 did not significantly affect AR-V7 protein expression (See Figure 30), ho wever the combination decreased its expression further, and this was the case with MAPK inhibitor also, which leads a potential future combination treatment studies to target AR-V 7. From our data, Akt and Mdm2 phosphorylation was significantly implicated in fAR degradation in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. Using targeted siRNA knockdown of M dm2/CHIP and immunoprecipitation assays we demonstrated that, un like fAR, gal induction of AR-V7 108 degradation significantly involved enhanced interac tion with CHIP E3 ligase. The lack of C-terminal domain of the splice variant AR-V7 has b een reported to change its dynamics and cofactors impacting protein-protein interaction s (Lapouge et al, 2008). It is possible that this truncation also changes protein-protein i nteractions induced by gal on the variant AR to favor CHIP E3 ligase mediated AR-V7 degradati on. Further studies on AR-V7- CHIP interaction are needed to fully delineate the significant factors involved in AR-V7 modulation. A recent report suggests that AR phosph orylation may favor CHIP E3 ligase-mediated fAR proteasomal degradation (Chymkowitch et al, 2011). This may be the case with gal-induced AR-V7 degradation. Gal induced dissociation of fAR from HSP90 after tr eatment in LNCaP cells. Although there is sparse literature on AR-Vs and th eir interactions with co- activators/chaperones, Weigel and colleagues recent ly reported that unlike fAR, AR-V7 is resistant to inhibitors of the Hsp90-AR heterocompl ex and suggested possible existence of HSP70-AR-V7 complex (Shafi et al, 2013a). Our data appear to be consistent with this report, because AR-V7 degradation was preceded by H sp70 and CHIP association. Perhaps, what's more interesting is that, although AR-Hsp90 disruptive inhibitors have no effect on AR-V7, we show that AR-V7 undergoes ubiqu itination and proteasomal degradation and hence can be targeted via that path way. In addition to gal's well-established triple mechan ism of anti-AR activity (Purushottamachar et al, 2013a; Vasaitis et al, 200 8), we report for the first time that gal- induces robust apoptosis in PC cells in vitro and in vivo . Induction of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage is possibly one of the major reasons for t he efficacy of gal and its analog in inhibiting PC cell growth. We note that the apoptos is-inducing effect of an agent is also 109 dependent on the balance of anti-apoptotic and pro- apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) (Ghobrial et al, 2005). Typically, the ratio of Bcl -2 and Bax protein expression is used as an index of apoptosis (Mirjolet et al, 2000). We ob served a remarkable up-regulation of Bax protein levels and a moderate decrease in the B cl-2 protein levels, leading to an increase of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. This observation i s important, as induction of robust apoptosis is crucial for inhibition of growth and p rogression of PC, and may be considered as a paramount predictive marker for forecasting th e clinical therapeutic response to gal and its analogs. Depletion of Bcl-2 may also contri bute significantly to the anti-cancer efficacy of gal, as Bcl-2 is known to cause chemo-r esistance in prostate cancer (Miayake et al, 2000). To confirm that most of these effects seen on the v arious pathways were not a result of high utilized doses, we compared induction of ap optosis at different doses (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 \u00b5mol/L) over 24 and 72 hours, using differen t complementary analytical tools. We also evaluated the effects on AR/AR-V7 at low conce ntrations with positive results. This suggests that the effects of gal and VNPT55 (at con centrations ranging from 1 to 20 \u00b5mol/L) on fAR/AR-V7 and apoptosis are not off targ et or toxic effects. The fact that gal and VNPT55 also induce calpain-dependent AR depleti on led us to conclude that gal and VNPT55 induce well-established cell based mechanism s to inhibit cell proliferation. Remarkably, gal and VNPT55 had no significant effec t on the expression of fAR in immortalized untransformed prostate epithelial c ells (PWR-1E). This is very significant as it gives an insight to the low toxic nature of t he agent, as observed in the clinic (Kwegyir- Afful et al, 2015; Montgomery G, 2014; Taplin M-E, 2014b), and the potential of a minimal effect on AR expressed in healthy non-cancerous tis sues. This finding is consistent with 110 the ability of agents to preferentially induce depl etion of AR expression in PC tumors, without affecting AR expression in normal prostate cells, as recently reported by others (Deep et al, 2008; Li et al, 2011b). One major mechanism of resistance in CRPC is the ov erexpression of AR and the emergence of splice variant ARs (AR-Vs). Recently a pproved PC drugs, i.e., abiraterone and enzalutamide have been reported to cause rapid induction and increased expression of AR-Vs in laboratory and clinical settings (Antonara kis et al, 2014; Li et al, 2013; Mostaghel et al, 2011; Schrader et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). In addition, anti-androgens currently used for the treatment of PC do not cause significant apoptosis that may contribute to their failures in the clinic (Sadar, 2011). The present study shows significant gal-induced degradation of fAR, AR-V7 a nd AR v567es that are implicated in all stages of PC progression and resistance settings (A ntonarakis et al, 2014; Li et al, 2013; Mostaghel et al, 2011; Schrader et al, 2013; Sun et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2011). Overall, this study yielded results of high translational re levance because it provides strong preclinical validation of phase II results and the ongoing pivotal phase III clinical trials of gal in PC patients with AR-Vs. Future Directions Previous studies have shown that gal binds to the L BD of the androgen receptor, it would be interesting to determine if the molecule b inds to other motifs of the receptor in addition to the LBD. This will enable us draw concl usions as to whether binding to the receptor is a requirement for inducing its degradat ion. As stated earlier, VNPT55 binds weakly to the AR LBD but degrades it more efficient ly than gal. In addition, the effects on splice variant AR-Vs which lack the LBD also makes it imperative to investigate whether 111 these small molecule inhibitors bind to any other d omain of the androgen receptor. AR phosphorylation has been shown to precede its degra dation. In this study we focused on serine 210/213 phosphorylation resides. Thus, furth er studies will evaluate the involvement of other phosphorylation residues in gal-induced AR /AR-V7 degradation. Although, the CHIP E3 ligase has been shown to ubiquitinate AR in the absence phosphorylation, other reports have also shown that phosphorylated AR can be ubiquitinated by CHIP prior to its degradation. It would be interesting to determine t hese phosphorylation residues induced in the splice precedi ng its ubiquitination degradation. Currently, extensive studies on AR-V7 and ARv567es emphasize their implication in drug resistance and metastases. Since a number o f other splice variants are also expressed in CRPC cells, future work will analyze t he effects of gal and it analogs on their protein and mRNA expression. 112 Specific Aim 2a: To determine effects on oncogenic pathways modulated by ARDAs in inhibiting prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Gal's activity against AR negative cells and xenogr aft may be due to modulation of translation machinery. Gal induces ER stress in AR positive prostate cance r cells at low doses Previous studies in PC-3 cells revealed that gal up regulated ERSR genes (CHOP and phosphorylated eIF2) (Bruno et al, 2008), whic h are also known to influence protein translation. Following these observations, establis hed PC-3 xenografts were treated with gal. Interestingly, it was observed that although g al did not prevent tumor formation; average tumor volume and weights were significantly smaller compared to controls. Efficacy of gal on PC-3 xenografts in addition to i ts effects on AR signaling suggested a multi-target activity of galeterone. Galeterone's effects on ERSR genes in PC-3 cells we re recapitulated in AR positive cells (LNCaP and CWR22Rv1) in vitro (Figure 44), increasing CHOP and phosphorylated eIF2 (peIF2). However, analysis xenografts (Vasaitis et al, 2008) revealed no signi ficant difference between vehicle and gal treated groups. In contrast, cyclin D1 protein expr ession was significantly down-regulated in vivo. Since cyclin D1 expression is known to be tightly r egulated by the Mnk1/2-eIF4E translation complex (Rosenwald et al, 1995; Rosenwa ld et al, 1993), we surmised that gal negatively impacted protein translation. We hypothe sized that gal's efficacy in PC-3 cells was not only as a result of ER stress induction but possibly due to additional multiple effects on the translation machinery and other onco genic pathways. 113 Figure 44: Gal induces ERSR markers at low micromol ar concentrations. 1 X 10 6 LNCaP ( left panel ) and CWR22Rv1 ( right panel ) cells were seeded in 10 cm plates in 5% charcoal dextran supplemented RPMI and subsequently treated with gal (1-5 \u00b5M) for duration of 72 hours. Immunoblot analysis revealed that gal, at low micro molar concentrations increased ERSR markers. Simultaneous targeting of the androgen receptor and translation machinery We performed cell viability assays in PC cells with CGP-57380 (Mnk kinase inhibitor) to highlight the significance of inhibit ing Mnk1/2. In Figure 45 and Table 5, we observed that CGP-57380 GI 50 values in DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells were comparable to gal; however, CGP-57380 showed reduced potency i n PC-3 cells. A study by Bianchini and colleagues reported that PC-3 cells expressed s ignificantly lower levels of peIF4e than DU145 (Bianchini et al, 2008), and this may have co ntributed to CGPs high GI 50 values observed. 114 Figure 45: Anti-proliferative ability of gal and VN PT55 compared to CGP-57380. 2500 cells/well were seeded in 96 well plates and a llowed to attach overnight. Indicated compounds wer e serially diluted in complete culture media, cells w ere treated for 72 hours and media and compounds re placed for an additional 96 hours. Mtt reagent was used to determine cell viability and dose-response curves plotted using graphpad prism 4 to compute GI 50 values. Cell viability assay, revealed that CGP-573 80 maintained modestly low GI 50 values, suggesting that significant inhibition of t he Mnk-eIF4E axis, decreases cell viability Table 5: GI 50 values of gal/VNPT55 and CGP-57380 in AR positive/ negative cells. Cell viability assays were performed in DU145, PC-3 and CWR22Rv1 cells comparing anti-proliferative activities of gal, VNPT55 and CGP-57380. We observe d that, with the exception of PC-3 cells, CGP-57380 Mnk kinase inhibitor decreased cell viability of bo th AR positive and negative PC cells with GI 50 values comparable to that of gal/VNPT55. To show that gal/VNPT55 exerted their anti-cancer a ctivities, partly through antagonizing both AR and Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis, we tran sfected CWR22Rv2 cells with AR and/or Mnk1 siRNA (Figure 46), and analyzed cell vi ability after treatment with gal/VNPT55. Figure 47 shows that in the absence of AR and/or Mnk, GI 50 values of 115 gal/VNPT55 were significantly higher in comparison to treated/untransfected cells. This suggests that by silencing both AR and/or Mnk1, we eliminated the prime targets of gal/VNPT55, thus minimizing their full impact on ce ll viability. Figure 46: AR and/ Mnk1 were silenced in CWR22Rv1 c ells. Western blot analysis was conducted on CWR22Rv1 cel ls transfected with 50 nM of AR and Mnk1 siRNA alone and in combination for 4 days, complexes were washed off and cells lysed after an additional 72 hours and analyzed for AR and Mnk1 protein expression. Figure 47: Growth inhibition after knockdown Mnk1 and treatment with ARDAs. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells from figure 46 were seeded at 2500 cells/well in a 96 well-plate, allowed to attach overnight and subsequently treated with gal and VNPT55 for an additional 72 hours, cell viabili ty was determined as in materials and methods, and GI 50 values represented as a barchart. GI 50 values of gal alone were compared to GI 50 values of cells transfected with AR or Mnk1 siRNA or both. This was repeated for VNPT55. Analysis shows a significant increase in GI 50 values in the absence of AR, Mnk1 or both (*p<0.05 ). 116 We also evaluated the impact of combining CGP-57380 and gal on PC cell proliferation. Using the calcusyn software, combina tion indices (CI), in both CWR22Rv1 and (CI values at ED50 = 10.32393 and 1.58119 , respectively) showed antagonistic interaction (Figure 48, Table 6 and 7) . Figure 48: Isobolograms of combination Gal-CGP-5738 0. CWR22Rv1 and DU145 cells were seeded in 96-well pla tes and treated with a combination of both gal/VNPT55 and CGP-57380 at a constant ratio of the ir respective GI 50 values. After cell viability was determined with MTT reagent, the fractional effects of the compounds alone and in combination was determined and analyzed by the Calcusyn software to determine the combination indices (CI), to evaluat e whether compounds act in synergy (CI < 1), additive (CI = 1) or antagonistic (CI > 1). CI values at ED 90 indicate strong antagonism. Table 6: Combination index of gal and CGP-57380 at ED50, ED75 and ED90. Table of results for experiments conducted in Figur e 48. Showing CI values in CWR22Rv1 cells. Gals interaction with CGP-57380, are strongly antagonist ic at all levels evaluated. 117 Table 7: Combination index of gal and CGP-57380 at ED50, ED75 and ED90. Table of results for experiments conducted in Figur e 48. Showing CI values in DU145 cells Complementary colony formation studies were also co nducted, treating cells with gal, VNPT55, CGP-57380 and their combinations at ra tios of their GI 50 values. Results from colonies revealed lack of enhanced activity (F igure 49). The compounds alone and in combination, significantly inhibited colony formati on when compared to controls. However, growth inhibition when compounds were comb ined did not show significant differences when compared to gal, VNPT55 and CGP at comparable concentrations. 118 Figure 49: Colony formation analyzing combination e ffects of galeterone, VNPT55 and CGP-57380. 1000 cells/well of CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in 6- well plates and treated with gal/VNPT55 alone or in combination with CGP-57380 ( left panel ), colonies were stained and counted and presented as bar chart (right graph ). Quantifying colonies, show a significant decreas e in colony formation in comparison to control (*p<0.05, **p<0.001) 119 Gal and VNPT55 modulate the Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis Gal and VNPT55 deplete protein expression of Mnk1/2 PC cells EIF4E plays a critical role in activating oncogen es implicated in cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastasis (Mamane et a l, 2004). EIF4E phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase activity of the MAPK kinase interacting kinase 1/2 (Mnk1/2), which are downstream of the Ras/MAPK pathway. On-go ing work from our laboratory, part of which has been published, showed simultaneo us degradation effects of our novel retinamides (NR) on the androgen receptor and Mnk1/ 2 (Mbatia et al, 2015; Ramamurthy et al, 2015). Considering the effects of gal seen o n cyclin D1 protein expression and the possibility that gal and VNPT55 may exhibit multipl e activities like the NR, we analyzed protein expression CWR22Rv1, DU145, and PC- 3cells. Our initial analysis on the effects of gal were evaluated in LNCAP and CWR22Rv1 cells at 1-5 M over a 72-hour time point (Figure 5 0) Figure 50: Gal depletes protein expression of Mnk1. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded at 50% conflue nce and serum starved for 12 hours. Cells were subsequently treated with gal at indicated concentr ation for 72 hours rylated eIF4E show a decrease after protein were analyzed at the indicated time point. 120 We further evaluated whether VNPT55 exhibited the s ame effects on the translation axis. Cells were treated with both gal/VNPT55 (5-20 M) and protein expression analyzed 24 hours post compound treatment in LNCaP and CWR22 Rv1 cells (Figure 51). Indeed, gal and VNPT55 decreased eIF4E phosphorylation and also significantly depleted Mnk1/2 protein expression. Perhaps what was most significa nt was the fact that gal and its analog also had the similar effects on the Mnk-eIF4E axis in both PC3 and DU145 cells (Figure 52). This was the first proof supporting the idea t hat depletion of Mnk1/2 by gal and its analogs was AR independent, Gal/VNPT55 and CWR22Rv1 (right panel ) cells were treated with increasing dose of gal/VN PT55 and Mnk1/2 protein expression analyzed by western blot with 50 \u00b5g total protein. We observed that effects on Mnk1 were more pronounced in LNCaP cells, whereas e ffects on Mnk2 were significantly downregulated in CWR22Rv1 cell Figure Gal and PC-3 ( right panel ) cells were treated with gal and VNPT55 at 10 M f or 24 hours. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer and 50 and 100 \u00b5g of total protein used in analyzing total and phosphorylated proteins respectively. 121 Gal modulate Mnk1 protein via the proteasome and de crease mRNA levels of Mnk1 We also evaluated whether the proteasomal enzyme pl ayed a significant role in gal- induced depletion of Mnk1 protein expression. Inter estingly as reported for the novel retinamides, depletion effects of gal/VNPT55 on Mnk 1 were significantly inhibited by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells (Figure 53 A), suggesting the role of the proteasome in Mnk1/2 depletion. We next examined whether this enhanced degradation was also preceded by ubiquitination. Indeed, gal enhanced Mnk1 ubiquitin ation prior to its degradation (Figure 53 B). In attempt to evaluate whether these effects are only seen post-translationally on Mnk1, we analyzed mRNA from gal/VNPT55 treated PC c ells (PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells) and subjected them to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR) analysis. Data presented in Figure 53C sh ow that at 5 and 10 \u00b5M, both compounds decreased mRNA of Mnk1 significantly (p<0 .05). We also analyzed downstream effects of Mnk1-eIF4E inhibition in LNCa P cells and observed that Cox-2, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 protein expressions were strong ly depleted by both gal and VNPT55 (Figure 53 D). 122 Figure 53: Gal and VNPT55 decrease mRNA levels of M nk1 and also degrade the protein via the proteasomal pathway. (A), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells incubated with gal al one or in combination with MG132, to determine the role of the proteasomal enzyme in gal/VNPT55 induce d post-translational modulation of Mnk1. (B), LNCaP cells treated as in A, and 1 mg total protein used in immunoprecipitation analysis and probed with ubi quitin antibodies. (C), RNA was collected from PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells incubated with indicated compounds for 24 hours. Mnk1 primers were used in q uantitative real-time PCR to evaluate effects on mR NA expression levels. Although there were no significa nt differences between the treated groups, in compa rison to controls, both compounds significantly downregul ated Mnk1 mRNA expression in all three cell lines (*p<0.05). (D), LNCaP cells were treated with 10 M of gal/VNPT55 and downstream targets of Mnk-eIF4E axis were evaluated 123 Gal and VNPT55 decrease N-Cadherin and up-regulate E-Cadherin protein expression Based on the significant effects seen in our initia l analysis on Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis, we hypothesized that gal/VNPT55 may inhibit migrati on and invasion of PC cells, by down regulating factors involved in EMT. Several lines o f evidence have implicated an over- active translational complex in cancer disease prog ression, migration and metastasis (Bianchini et al, 2008; Robichaud et al, 2015). The Mnk-eIF4E axis plays a pivotal role in the expr ession of mesenchymal markers such as MMPs and & Graff, 2004; Graff et al, 2008; Robichaud et al, 2015). We first examined the effects of gal/VNPT55 at 5 and 10 M on N-Cadherin protein expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 54, the compounds significantly decreased N-Cadherin protei n levels and increased expression of epithelial marker, tight junction protein zona occl udens protein, ZO-1 in PC-3 cells. However, effects on N-Cadherin in DU145 were not as significant as was observed in PC- 3 cells. We also determined whether gal/VNPT55 had any effec t on E-cadherin expression levels using fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly , both gal and VNPT55 caused strong up-regulation of E-Cadherin in PC-3 and DU145 cells (Figure. 55), suggesting a reversal in mesenchymal characteristics to a more epithelial non-invasive state. 124 Figure 54: Gal and VNPT55 Reverse EMT markers. Lysates from PC-3 and DU145 cells treated with 5 an d 10 \u00b5M for 24 hours were subjected to immunoblot analysis to evaluate N-Cadherin and ZO-1 protein ex pression. We observed a significant decrease N- Cadherin protein expression in PC-3 cells with an i ncreased expression of Zona occludin 1(ZO-1) in bot h cell lines. On the contrary, N-Cadherin in DU145 ce lls was not remarkably downregulated. Figure 55: Gal and VNPT55 increase expression of E- Cadherin. PC-3 and DU145 cells incubated with gal and VNPT55 at 10 M for 24 hours were stained with E-Cadherin polyclonal antibodies. Images were taken with Zeiss microscope. E-Cadherin expression was remarkably increased by both agents. 125 Gal and VNPT55 inhibit MMP collagenase activity in PC cells Dysregulation of MMPs play a critical role in carci nogenesis, tumor invasion and tissue remodeling (Coussens et al, 2002; Sternlicht et al, 1999; Vu et al, 1998). Activation of MMPs enhance cell invasion by degrading the ECM. Migrating and invading cells express and secrete MMPs that degrade the ECM; henc e we focused our next analysis on the expression of MMP-2/-9 in PC cells. As shown in Figure 56 A, MMP-2 was strongly down-regulated in CWR22Rv1 cells and both MMP-2/-9 protein expression were also markedly downregulated in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Con ditioned media from 36 hours' gal treated LNCaP cells were analyzed by zymogram gel. Strong inhibition of collagenase activity was observed (Figure 56 B, upper panel and bottom chart ) Figure 56: Gal and VNPT55 deplete MMP-2/-9. (A), PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells were analyzed f or MMP-2/-9 protein expression after gal/VNPT55 treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed a decrease in protein expression (B), LNCaP cells were treated w ith indicated concentrations for 36 hours. Conditioned media was analyzed for collagenase activity of MMP- 2 (top), densitometric analyses (bottom bar chart) sh ows significant decrease in MMP-2 collagenase activ ity in treated groups compared to controls (*p<0.05, ** p<0.001) 126 Since AR negative PC cells have been shown to migra te faster than AR positive cells in vitro , we analyzed the effects of gal/VNPT55 on MMP acti vity, prior to conducting migration/invasion assays. Conditioned media from P C cells incubated with compounds for 72 hours (PC-3 and DU145) were analyzed for col lagenase activity. PC-3 (Figure. 57 A) and DU145 (Figure. 57B) cells were incubated for 72 hours with gal/VNPT55 at 2.5 and 5 \u00b5M. Zymogram gels analyzing conditioned media from PC-3 cultures show a significant decrease in collagenase activity. Quant ification of digested bands from DU145 zymogram gels shows a significant down-regulation o f secreted MMP-2/-9 (Figure 57 B). Clearly, the ability of secreted protein to digest collagen in zymogram gel was significantly inhibited by gal/VNPT55. Figure 57: Gal and VNPT55 decrease MMP-2/-9 proteol ytic activity. (A), PC-3 cells were treated with gal/VNPT55 at 2.5 and 5 \u00b5M for 72 hours and media concentrated and a zymogram gel used to determine proteolytic activity of MMP-2/-9. (B), DU145 cells were treated as in A , at 2.5 \u00b5M with gal/VNPT55 and analyzed with gelatin ge ls. Densitometric analysis shows a significant decr ease in MMP-2/-9 activity in treated controls compared t o untreated controls (*p<0.05). 127 Gal and VNPT55 inhibit migration of PC cells in vitro We also determined whether gal/VNPT55-induced deple tion of EMT markers also subsequently caused inhibition of PC cell migration and invasion. Prior to conducting these assays, we evaluated cell viability with gal, VNPT5 5, CGP-57380 and enzalutamide (1-10 \u00b5M), over a 24-hour time point, to show that doses used did not compromise cell integrity and also that cell numbers did not increase signifi cantly (Figure 58). Figure 58: 24 hour MTT cell viability assay. To evaluate whether PC-3 and DU145 cells used in mi gration and invasion assays at indicated compound concentrations did not significantly compromise cel l numbers and viability, we performed a 24 hour MTT cell viability assay with gal/VNPT55, CGP-57380 and Enzalutamide (1-10 M) for 24 hours and analyzed. Results show that after 24 hours, there was no sign ificant differences between untreated and treated c ells. PC-3 and DU145 cells grown to a monolayer and scrat ched with 200 l pipette tip, were subsequently treated with gal/VNPT55 (5 \u00b5M) ov er 12 hours Compared to controls gal/VNPT55 significantly inhibited migration of bot h PC-3 and DU145 cells (Figure 59 A). Wound healing was quantified by the difference in distance at 0 and 12 hours normalizing distance migrated to control after 12 h ours (Figure 59 B). 128 Figure 59: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit migration of PC3 and DU145 (A), PC-3 top panel DU145 ( middle cultured in 24-well plates to a confluent monolay er were scratched with a 200 \u00b5l pipette tip and subsequentl y treated with indicated compounds for 12 hours. (B ), Wounds were measured before and after the 12-hour t ime point. Distance migrated were quantified by measuring the difference at time 0 and 12 hours and normalized to control. (Distance migrated = Distan ce at time 0 hour - distance at 12 hours/ Distance migrat ed by control) (**p<0.001). 129 Gal and VNPT55 inhibit invasion of PC cells in vitro Boyden inserts pre-coated with BME were utilized in invasion assays. 0.75 X 10 5 PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in the u pper chamber in phenol red-free RPMI (as in schematic, Figure 60) and treated with gal, VNPT55 or CGP-57380. Figure 60: illustrating invasion assay set-up, cells are seeded in the upper chamber on BME pre-coated inserts and lower chambers containing media and chemo-attra ctant (10% FBS). Invading cells after 24 hours were stained with 0.5 % crystal violet solution (Figure 61 A) and quantified by counting cells at the botto m part of the insert (Figure 61 B). Gal, VNPT55 and CGP-57380 significantly inhibited invasi on of PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells compared to DMSO treated controls (F igure 61). Notably, gal and VNPT55 were significantly more potent than CGP-5738 0. 130 Figure 61: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit invasion of PC3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells. (A), seeded in Trevig en BME pre-coated inserts. Cells treated with gal, VNPT55 and CGP at 5 M. (B), Quantified invaded cel ls show a significant inhibition of PC cell invasio n (* p < 0.05, **p<0.001). Gal abrogates EGF-induced migration and collagenase activity Epidermal growth factor family ligands are critical ly implicated in cell motility and tumor invasion (Wells, 1999; Wells et al, 2002). Th e mTORC2-NF-B pathway, promoting chemoresistance has been shown to be acti vated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Tanaka et al, 2011). Previous stud ies have shown that MAPK inhibitor (U0126) retards cell migration and invasion (Chen e t al, 2009a). Here, we compared the ability of gal, U0126 and CGP-57380 to inhibit cell migration in the presence of activating EGF ligand (10 ng/ml). We observed that both U0126 and CGP-57380 inhibited migration 131 of PC-3 cells (Figure 62A) as prior reported. Howev er, in the presence of EGF ligand, only gal and CGP-57380 significantly inhibited cell migr ation. We also observed that in the presence of EGF ligand, cells migrated faster than DMSO treated controls. It was interesting that U0126 did not inhibit cell migrati on in the presence of activating EGF ligands. This possibly might be due to the concentr ation of U0126 used in the assay, as different compounds exhibit efficacy at different c oncentrations. Migration assays were repeated at least three times and represented as av erage \u00b1 S.E.M. Figure 62: Gal inhibits migration of PC3 cells in t he presence of activating EGF ligand. (A), PC-3 cells grown to a monolayer and scratched with 200 l were treated with EGF (10 ng/ml) alone and in combination with gal (5 M), CGP (5 M) and U012 6 (5 M). Wound healing was analyzed as in figure 59 A. (B), gal and CGP significantly inhibited migr ation in the presence of EGF ligand (*p<0.05). (C), PC- 3 cells treated with TNF- (10 ng/ml) with or witho ut gal and protein expression analyzed. All experim ents were repeated at least three times and represented as mean \u00b1 S.E.M. 132 Distance migrated were quantified as earlier and re presented as a barchart (Figure 62 B). We also analyzed the effects on EMT markers in the presence of activating EGF ligand. PC-3 cells treated with 10 ng/ml of EGF wer e subsequently treated with gal at 10 M. Figure 62C, indicate that gal is able to deplet e MMP-9, Cox-2 and N-Cadherin expression We also analyzed gal's ability to decrease collagen ase activity in the presence of activating EGF ligand. Cells seeded in phenol-red f ree RPMI, just as in all zymogram assays (materials and methods), were treated with g al andVNPT55, alone and in combination with EGF. Analysis of MMP-9 collagenase activity in PC-3 revealed that in the presence of EGF ligand, gals' ability to decrea se MMP-9 activity was not diminished (Figure 63). Figure 63: Gal decreases collagenase activity in pr esence of activating EGF ligand. To evaluate whether activated MMP-9 could be inhibi ted by gal as in Figure 62, we treated cells with g al, VNPT55 with or without EGF at (gal-5 \u00b5M + EGF-10ng/ ml) and incubated for 72 hours. Conditioned media was concentrated and separated on zymogram gels. We observed, just as in Figure 62 A & B, that gal in the presence of EGF, inhibited collagenase activity. EG F treated cells also showed a significant increase in MMP-9 activity when compared to untreated controls. Experiments were repeated three times (*p<0.05, **p<0.001) 133 Gal and VNPT55 antagonize the NF-B signaling pathway The NF-B pathway has been implicated in cell proli feration, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, cell survival (Luo et al, 2005) and i nduction of drug resistance. EMT markers such as Snail, Slug, and Twist1 have been reported to be activated by the NF-B signaling pathway. Twist1 has many times been referred to as a master regulator and is implicated in EMT regulation in several cancers including pros tate cancer (Kwok et al, 2005). Activated NF-B (p65) heterodimerizes with p50, thi s complex translocate to the nucleus where it binds to cognate DNA response elements in promoter regions to induce transcription of target genes (Zhong et al, 1998). Considering the effects seen on migration and invas ion of PC cells, and also downstream targets of NF-B signaling (E-cadherin, N-Cadherin and Cox-2), we proceeded to analyze potential effects of gal/VNPT5 5 on p-p65 and its transcriptional activities. We evaluated p52 point post gal/VNPT55 trea tment. As shown in Figure 64, gal did not affect total protein expression of p65 and p52, but significantly decreased phosphorylation of p65 in DU145 cells p65 phosphorylation markedly in both PC-3 and DU145 cel ls, with no effect on the p52 subunit. However, we did observe a very low decrease in tota l expression of p65 protein level in both cell lines (more prominent in DU145 than PC-3 cells). 134 Figure 64: panel ) cells were treated with gal and VNPT55 for 24 hou rs and 50 or 100 g of total cell lysates separated on a 10% Tri s/glycine gel to analyze p65, p52 and phosphorylate p65 (p-p65). Total proteins were significantly affe cted, on the other hand, phosphorylated p65 was mar kedly downregulated. As stated earlier, NF-B has been implicated in the regulation of EMT transcription factors (Li et al, 2012a; Pham et al, 2007) and the Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis also tightly regulates the translation of Snail and Vegf mRNA (Korneeva et al, 2010; Robichaud et al, 2015). To delineate whether gal/VNPT55 suppression of PC migr ation and invasion resulted from a combined inhibition of both NF-B and Mnk/eIF4E axi s, we analyzed mRNA levels of NF-B target genes, Snail, Twist1, MMP-9 and E-Cadh erin. Interestingly, Snail and MMP- 9 mRNA expression were significantly down-regulated with a significant increase in E- Cadherin mRNA (Figure 65). In contrast, Twist1 mRNA was not significantly affected by gal/VNPT55 (Figure 65). This was very interesting s ince it suggests that gal and its analogs selectively modulate genes which are known to be ac tivated by NF-B. It is possible that other pathways involved in activating these genes ( e.g. Twist1), may not be affected by gal and its analogs. It is also likely that gal/VNPT55 induced modulation of these factors may not necessarily be at the protein or mRNA level but via posttranslational modifications. 135 Figure 65: Gal and VNPT55 decrease Snail and MMP-9 mRNA expression. MRNA collected from treated PC-3 cells were subject ed to quantitative real-time PCR to analyze E-Cadhe rin, MMP-9, Twist1 and expression (**p<0.001) . Interestingly, although we observed modulatory effects on Snail, MMP-9 and E-Cadherin, there was n o significant effect on Twist1 mRNA at 5 \u00b5M. There seemed to be an increase in Twist1 mRNA expression at 10 \u00b5M of gal and VNPT55 treatment. Immunoblot analysis of Snail, Slug, Twist1, Vimenti n and VEGF expression, showed that both gal and VNPT55 significantly deple ted protein expression of Snail, Slug, Vimentin and VEGF in both PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig ure 66). However as observed in mRNA analysis, Twist1 was not significantly modulat ed (Figure 66). Interestingly gal/VNPT55 depleted RhoA (Figure 66), which is invo lved in cell motility and migration (Kurokawa & Matsuda, 2005; Pertz et al, 2006; Sahai & Marshall, 2002). 136 Figure 66: Gal and VNPT55 deplete protein expressio n of EMT markers PC-3 (left panel) and DU145 (right panel) cells wer e treated with gal and VNPT55 for 24 hours and 50 g of total cell lysates separated on a 10% Tris/glyci ne gel to analyze protein expression Protein of Snail, Slug, e valuated by immunoblot analysis, which revealed marked depletion on these proteins. We also evaluated whether decreases in p65 phosphor ylation led to a decrease in p65 nuclear after gal/VNPT55 treatment . Fractionation of DU145 with gal/VNPT55 at 10 \u00b5M, revealed that p-p65 was significantly decreased in the nuclear compartment, as opposed to no observed change in total p65 (Figure 67A and B, left panel ), with a concomitant accumulation in the cytosolic compartment (Figure 67A and B, right panel ). Interestingly we also observed that Twist1 was almost completely not expressed in the nuclear fraction in the treatment wells, suggesting that these agents strongly inhibited Twi st 1 nuclear translocation (Figure 67 A and B). 137 Figure 67: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit nuclear accumulat ion of p-p65 and Twist1. PC-3 (A) and DU145 (B) cells were pre-treated with 10 ng TNF- for 2 hours then subsequently treated w ith gal/VNPT55 at 10 \u00b5M for an additional 24 hours. Tot al cell lysates were subjected to cell fractionatio n. [PC- cytosolic fractions]. LSD1 was loading for nuclear fractions and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for cytosolic Twist1 expression l evels were analyzed in the different compartments We next determined whether decreases in nuclear p-p 65 had any consequence on its transcriptional activities. Primers spanning th e NF-B consensus binding sequence in Snail promoter region (Figure 68, upper schematic ) were used to amplify cDNA assay, immunop recipitating with NF-B (p65) antibody. Our data showed that indeed, gal and VNPT 55 decreased p65 binding to Snail 138 promoter region (Figure 68, bottom chart ), which may be responsible for the observed decrease in Snail mRNA (see Figure 65). Figure 68: Gal and VNPT55 decrease NF-B (p65) acti promoter. (Top panel ) Schematic of NF-B binding site at Snail promoter region. ( Bottom chart ). PC-3 cells incubated with 10 \u00b5M for 36 hours were used in a ChIP assay t o determine Gal/VNPT55 activities on p65 binding activity at Snail promoter region. Gal and VNPT55 inhibit Twist1 transcriptional activ ity Since we observed an increase in E-cadherin express ion and a decrease in BMI-1 protein, we hypothesized that Twist1, which has bee n shown to activate BMI-1 (Yang et al, 2010) and repress E-cadherin, is inhibited by g al/VNPT55 from translocating to the nucleus to bind and activate BMI-1 and also repress E-Cadherin. BMI-1 (PRC1) works in concert with PRC2 proteins to modulate gene express ion and it has been shown that BMI- 139 1 and Nanog regulate each other via promoter-bindin g activity (Paranjape et al, 2014; Xie et al, 2014). TNF- has been shown to promote cance r cell invasion via activation of NF- B (p65), which in turn activates Twist 1 transcrip tion factor to either repress or activate target genes during EMT (Li et al, 2012a). To confi rm inhibition of nuclear translocation of pre-treated PC-3 cells with 10 ng/ml of TNF- and subsequently treated the cells with gal/VNPT55. Our results show that, gal/V NPT55 strongly inhibited Twist1 nuclear translocation (Figure 69). Figure 69: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit Twist1 nuclear tr anslocation at \u00b5M PC-3 cells were pre-treated with 10 ng TNF- for 2 hours and then co-treated with gal/VNPT55 for an additional 24 hours. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraf ormaldehyde and stained with Twist1 mouse monoclona l antibody. Images were taken with a Zeiss mounted fl uorescence microscope. We also investigated the resulting transcriptional effects of Twist1 inhibition by gal, on BMI-1 promoter enrichment. QRT-PCR analysis revealed a significant decrease in BMI-1 mRNA in PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells (p<0.0 5) 70). ChIP assays showed that Twist1 binding to BMI-1 promoter (Figur e 71) was several folds decreased after gal/VNPT55 treatment (Figure 72 A and B, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cell respectively ), indicating a significant decrease in Twist1 binding to the BMI-1 promoter. This might explain the observed decrease in BMI-1 and increase in E-cadherin mRNA level. 140 Figure 70: Gal and VNPT55 decrease mRNA levels of B MI-1. RNA isolated from PC-3; DU145 and CWR22Rv1 cells, p reviously treated with gal and VNPT55 at indicated concentrations for 24 hours and analyzed for BMI-1 expression level.

(A), DU145 and CWR22Rv1(B) cells were treated with gal/VNPT55 for 36 hours at 10 M and interaction between Twist1 and BMI-1 promoter evaluated using C hIP assay. BMI-1 promoter fold enrichment was normalized to input controls and presented as mean \u00b1 SEM (**p<0.001) Gal and VNPT55 deplete stem-cell like factors and i nhibit CFU. Since cancer cells undergoing EMT express self-rene wal characteristics (Mani et al, 2008) we evaluated the effects of gal/VNPT55 on putative stem cell factors in PC cells. PC-3 and DU145 cells treated with 10 \u00b5M of gal and VNPT55 down-regulated protein expression of Nanog, CD44, -catenin and BMI-1 (Fig ure 73 A and B). The repressive effect of BMI-1 is dependent on PRC2 activity (Pere ira et al, 2010). EZH2, a member of the PRC2, binds to promoters of target genes and me thylates lysine 27 of histone H3 methylated H3K27 is recognized by PRC1 (Min et al, 2003) and both PRC1 and PRC2 bind promoter regions of target genes to maintain their suppression. Treatments with gal or VNPT55 significantly decreased protein expression of EZH2 in PC-3 and DU145 cells (Figure. 73 A and B). C-Myc, an oncogene implicated in cell proliferation was also down-regulated in both PC-3 and DU145 cells after gal/VNPT55 treatment (Figure 73 A and B ). 142 . Figure 73: Gal and analogs deplete protein express ion of stem cell like factors. (A), PC-3 and DU145 (B) were treated with gal/VNPT5 5 as indicated and stem cell-like factors expressio n analyzed by immunoblot with 50 g of protein lysate . Gal and analog markedly depleted protein expressi on of putative stem cells With the multiple activities shown by gal and its a nalog, it was of interest to determine if the compounds could inhibit formation of colonies at low doses over 14-day period in AR negative cells, further emphasizing it s activities on multiple oncogenes. PC- 3 and DU145 cells were treated with increasing conc entrations of gal, VNPT55 and CGP (0.5 - 10 M). Our data shows that at 1 and 2.5 M, gal/VNPT55 exhibited the same effects as CGP at 10 M and reduced the ability of PC-3 and DU145 to form colonies (Figure. 74). Colony quantification relative to untreated co ntrol show a significant dose-dependent decrease in colonies (Figure 75), this also confirm s the efficacy of these agents in decreasing cell viability of AR positive and AR neg ative PC cells. 143 Figure 74: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit CFU of PC cells. 1000 cells/well (PC-3 and DU145), seeded in 6-well plates were treated with indicated concentrations o f compounds for a period of 14 days. Media containing compounds were replaced every 3 days. Colonies wer e stained with 0.05% crystal violet and counted. Figure 75: Gal and VNPT55 inhibit CFU (Quantificati on of colonies). Colonies from Figure 75 were counted and presented as bar chart. Colony assays were repeated three tim es and colonies counted in four quadrants of the wells . Results are represented as averages with S.E.M. t reated cells were significantly inhibited in forming colon ies compared to controls (*p<0.5, **0.001) 144 Effects of inhibiting Mnk-eIF4E axis on AR and vice versa We analyzed whether effects seen on Mnk1/2 may be a result of gal/VNPT55- induced AR depletion. Thus, we knocked down AR and analyzed Mnk1/2 protein expression and vice versa. Our observations show th at, silencing AR had no significant effect on Mnk1/2 protein expression. Similar result s were obtained when Mnk1/2 were silenced and AR protein expression analyzed (Figure 76 A & B, top and bottom panels ). Our data suggests that the effects of gal and VNPT5 5 on AR and Mnk-eIF4E may be mutually exclusive. Figure 76: Knockdown of AR shows no significant eff ect on Mnk1/2 and vice versa. (A), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 (B) cells were transfected with AR or Mnk1 siRNA (25 and 50 nM) for 72 hours and protein expression analyzed by western bl ot. Silencing AR in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells did not decrease the protein expression of Mnk1/2. The same was observed with knocking down Mnk1 with siRNA. 145 Depletion of AR or Mnk1 induce apoptosis in PC cell s Since antiandrogens specifically target the AR sign aling pathway, we next evaluated whether silencing AR or Mnk-eIF4E axis, i n separate experiments, would result in induction of apoptosis. We analyzed expression l evels of apoptotic markers after knocking down AR with siRNA. Interestingly, in addi tion to downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax, we observed that AR knockdown resulted in a negative effect on BMI- 1 protein levels (Figure 77 A and B). In CWR22Rv1 c ells, we observed similar effects on Bcl-2 after AR knockdown. Caspase 3 and PARP cleava ge also increased with knockdown of AR (Figure 77 B). PC-3 cells also exhibited simi lar observations when Mnk1 was knocked down, increasing both Bax expression and ca spase 3 cleavage (Figure 77 C). A brief analysis of VNPT55 induced PARP cleavage in C WR22Rv1 cells revealed that depletion of Mnk1 coincided with PARP cleavage, six (6) hours post VNPT55 treatment (Figure 77 D). Suggesting that this may be one of t he mechanisms of VNPT55-induced apoptotic induction. 146 Figure 77: Depletion of AR or results in apopt otic induction. (A & B), LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were transfected with 25 and 50 nM of AR siRNA for 72 hours. Cells were lysed and 50 and 100 \u00b5g of total protein lysat e separated on 10 and 12.5% tris/glycine gels. Indi cated proteins were probed for with their respective anti bodies. (C), PC-3 cells were transfected with Mnk1 siRNA at 25 and 50nM for 72 hours and protein expression analyzed for Bax, Mnk1 and caspase 3 cleavage. (D), CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M of VNPT55 ov er a time course and PARP cleavage analyzed together with Mnk1 depletion. We observed that knoc king down AR or Mnk1 induced apoptosis in PC cells, we also observed that VNPT55 may deplete Mnk1 which may lead to increase of Bax: Bcl-2 ratio, leading to release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria an d eventual cell death. Gal and VNPT55 have shown multi-target effects on s everal oncogenic pathways. Considering the effects seen on the AR, Mnk1/2-eIF4 E axis and stem cell factors, we were curious to evaluate whether siRNA knockdown of Mnk1 would lead to the down-regulation of cancer stem cell factors and EMT transcription f actors. To show that gal/VNPT55's effects on Mnk1/2-eIF4E a xis resulted in the depletion of multiple oncogenes as observed in this study, we transiently transfected PC-3 and 147 DU145 were down-regulated in PC-3 and DU 145 cells (Figure 78 A and B). We also analyzed EMT factors (N-Cadherin, MMP-2/-9, Snail, Slug and Twist1); all but Twist1 protein expression were significantly deplet ed (Figure 78 A and B). Previous studies have shown that decreasing peIF4E resulted in a concomitant decrease in MMP-2/- 9, Snail, VEGF and -Catenin protein expression (Li m et al, 2013). Several mRNAs have been reported to harbor an inter nal ribosome entry segment (IRES) that makes such mRNAs resistant to inhibitin g the Mnk1-eIF4E axis (Jackson et al, 2010). Initially we thought that Twist1 may pos sess such sites that make it resistant to Mnk1 knockdown. However, c-Myc is also reported to possess IRES, but inhibiting eIF4E phosphorylation reduced its protein expression (Fig ure 78 A and B). Additional studies are needed to delineate Twist1 mRNA translation with or without Mnk1-eIF4E inhibition. In summary, these studies clearly show that the effect s of silencing Mnk1 (i.e. protein translation) mirrors the effects of gal and VNPT55 in PC cells and suggests that Mnk1/2 may be prime targets of these unique agents. 148 Figure 78: siRNA knockdown of Mnk1 results in a sub sequent depletion of EMT and stem cell markers. (A), PC-3 ( left panel ) and DU145 (B, right panel ) cells were transfected with 25 and 50 nM Mnk1 siR NA for 72 hours. EMT and stem cell factors were analyz ed by western blot. Effects on downstream factors a fter downregulation of eIF4E phosphorylation mirrored ef fects the Mnk-eIF4E axis. Interestingly knocking down Mnk1 which resulted in downregulation of eIF4E phosphorylation did not deplete Twist1 protein Gal analogs (VNPP414 and VNPP433-3) exhibit multip le-target effects in PC cells VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 deplete EMT markers and inhi bit PC migration and invasion In our efforts to characterize the potential of gal and its analogs, most of the studies revolved around gal and its carbamate analog, VNPT5 5. We are yet to show whether these novel analogs exhibit effects if any on the ability of CRPC to migrate and invade. In LNCaP and PC-3 cells we analyzed the effects of VNPP414 a nd VNPP433-3 on EMT inducing proteins, Figure 79. We observed that the agents ex hibited similar activities as gal, in depleting protein expression of Mnk1/2, peIF4E and EMT markers. Figure 79: VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 reverse EMT. (A), PC-3 cells were incubated with 10 M of VNPP41 4 and VNPP433-3 and indicated proteins analyzed by western blot. (B), LNCaP cells which are not kno wn to migrate aggressively was also used to analyze the effects of the agents on these mesenchymal factors, to represent an AR positive model. 150 From our extensive studies with gal and VNPT55, we observed that the effects seen at the protein expression level of EMT markers, tra nslated to functional assays in inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Although, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 have shown an increased potency with cell viability assays, to as sume that these two agents would also act in similar manner would be erroneous. We therefore analyzed their ability to inhibit DU145 cell migration in a scratch wound healing assay (Fi gure 80 A and B) Figure 80: VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 inhibit cell migr ation. (A), in 24-well plates to a confluen t monolayer were scratched with a 200 \u00b5l pipette ti p and subsequently treated with 5 M of indicated compoun ds for 12 hours. (B), Wounds were measured before and after the 12-hour time point. Distance migrated were quantified by measuring the difference at tim e 0 and 12 hours and normalized to control. (Distance m igrated = Distance at time 0 hour - distance at 12 hours/ Distance migrated by control). Distance migrated sh ow that the compounds significantly inhibit PC cell migration (**p<0.001). Although we did not compare the efficacy of VNPP4 14 and VNPP433-3's anti- migratory ability, we observed that these analogs a lso significantly inhibited migration of AR negative DU145 cells, suggesting that they posse ss similar activities against multiple targets just as gal and VNPT55. From our analyzed m igration, cell migration in the presence of the compounds was less than 40% compare d to the control (Figure 80 B). 151 We also determined the anti-invasive capability of these compounds, using pre- coated BME inserts. Cells seeded in the upper chamb er of the invasion assay set-up was treated with 5 M of VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 and inc ubated at 37 0C for 24 hours. Invaded cells were treated as in materials and meth ods and quantified. As was observed in our previous studies with gal and VNPT55, these age nts also significantly inhibited PC-3 cells from invading through the basement membrane ( Figure 81 A & B). Figure 81: VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 inhibit PC3 cell invasion in vitro. (A) PC-3 cells were seeded in Trevigen BME pre-coat ed inserts. Cells treated with indicated agents at 5 M in the upper chamber in serum free RPMI media. The bottom chamber was filled with 1ml RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS. Set-up was placed in 37 0C incubator for 36 hours. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and stained with 0. 05% crystal violet; cells in upper chamber were wip ed off with cotton swabs and invaded cells at the bott om of inserts analyzed by counting. (B), Quantified invaded cells show significant inhibition of PC cell invasi on (**p<0.001). VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 deplete stem cell like facto rs and decrease CFU AR positive and negative PC cells were treated with 10 M of VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 to determine their effects on stem cell- like factors that are often up-regulated in invading and resistant cancer cells. In PC-3, DU 145, LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, we observed a significant depletion of CD44, Nanog, BM I-1 and -Catenin (Figure 82 A, B, C & D). We also performed a 14-day colony formation assay at low doses to confirm the 152 compounds ability to inhibit cell viability at low doses and also inhibit the repopulation of single cells into colonies (Figure 83 A & B). From our results the analogs seem to act and inhibit cellular functions like the lead compound, gal. Figure 82: VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 deplete stem-cell factors. CWR22Rv1 (C) and LNCaP (D) ce lls were treated with VNPP414 and VNPP4333- 3 at 10 M for 24 hours and cell lysate analyzed b y immunoblot to evaluate effects on stem cell facto rs. 50 g quantified was used for total protein analysis a nd 100 g total protein used for phosphorylated pro teins. 153 Figure 83:VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 decrease CFU in bo th AR positive and negative PC cells in vitro.

Colonies were stained with 0.05% crystal violet. B, Colonies from A were counted for (PC-3, DU145 and CWR22Rv1 colonies) and presented as bar chart. Colony assays were repe ated three times and colonies counted in four quadr ants of the wells. Results are represented as averages w ith S.E.M. (*p<0.05, **0.001). 154 Summary and Discussion of Specific Aim 2a Multiple pathways and oncogenes are implicated in c ancer disease progression and the great majority of PC mortality is a result of m etastatic disease rather than localized disease (Norgaard et al, 2010; Sathiakumar et al, 2 011). The presence of putative cancer stem cells that possess self-renewability and tumor initiating ability enhance resistance to therapeutic agents (Li et al, 2007). This stemness has been implicated with EMT (Yang et al, 2010). Activity of BMI-1 has also been implicat ed in docetaxel resistance in PC (Crea et al, 2011) and studies have shown that by silenci ng BMI-1, resistant cells were sensitized to docetaxel therapy. Another pathway that increase s resistance is the protein kinase c/Twist1 axis which has been reported to be involve d in enzalutamide resistance and CRPC (Shiota et al, 2014). The main objective of this study was to evaluate th e efficacy of gal and its analog on pathways involved in PC metastasis, which are al so implicated in drug resistance. Here, we report for the first time the inhibitory effects of gal and VNPT55 on Mnk1/2 expression with concomitant decrease in peIF4E. EIF4E activati on is reportedly elevated in human PC (Graff et al, 2009), this promotes tumorigenesis (F uric et al, 2010) and also enhances EMT (Robichaud et al, 2015). Down-regulation of peIF4E results in a concomitant downregulation of several oncogenic transcription f actors implicated in cell invasion, proliferation and resistance, as was observed in th is study by silencing Mnk1. -Catenin is normally sequestered by E-cadherin, h owever in metastatic cells, the loss of E-cadherin releases -Catenin which then fo rms a complex with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF), this act ivates the transcription of genes including Snail (MacDonald et al, 2009; Rao & Kuhl, 2010) and VEGF (Ceteci et al, 2007). 155 Our data lead us to suggest that gal and analogs ma y potentially reverse EMT via down- regulation of N-cadherin expression with concomitan t increase in E-cadherin. In addition to effects on the translation machinery , gal and VNPT55 showed inhibitory effects on the NF-B pathway. The agents also exhibited differential modulation of NF-B and NF-B down downstream targets. Perhaps most significantly, is the inhibition of Twist1 nuclear translocation. Inhibit ory effects on Twist1 may have a high clinical impact, as Twist1 is involved in EMT, drug resistance and stem cell renewal. Stem cell factors like CD44 have been implicated in tumo rigenicity, cell motility and bone metastases (Gvozdenovic et al, 2013; Hiraga et al, 2013), and inhibiting these factors may prove to have favorable clinical implications. Sinc e BMI-1 is upregulated in CRPC and implicated in metastases (mCRPC), its inhibition wi ll greatly impact efficacy of gal and its analogs in PC therapy. The presence of IRES in some genes, as indicated ea rlier, makes them resistant to Mnk1 inhibition, as we observed with Twist1 protein expression. However, gal/VNPT55 shows an interesting and hitherto unique mechanism by inhibiting Twist1 nuclear accumulation and thus preventing its transcriptiona l/repressive activities. This indicates the potential effects on targets that have not been pre viously investigated. Another example is the decrease in c-Myc protein expression when Mnk1 is depleted. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) that modulate E2F1 expression are regulate d by c-Myc (O'Donnell et al, 2005). C-Myc has also been reported to stimulate EZH2 expr ession by repressing its negative regulator miR-26a (Sander et al, 2008).Although fro m our first aim, we showed that gal and its analog induced apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, most anti-androgen therapy targets the AR and ruling out the fact that these o ther agents may have multiple effects on 156 the apoptotic pathway, we evaluated whether knockin g down the AR alone with siRNA would induce apoptosis in PC cells. Secondly, our s tudies have revealed the effects of gal and its analogs on the translation machinery and se veral studies have implicated the significance of Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis in cancer disease progression and metastasis. And efforts have been focused on developing therapeutic agents to target the translation machinery. Published works have indicated that Bcl- 2 mRNA translation was under the control of the cap-dependent mRNA translation. So i n addition to AR knockdown, we also evaluated whether Mnk1 silencing will induce apopto sis. Interestingly, depletion of both targets separately using siRNA induced apoptosis by activating caspase and PARP cleavage, a decrease in bcl-2 with a concomitant in crease in Bax protein expression. This suggests that gal and its analogs by targeting thes e pathways increases their efficacy in antagonizing disease progression by not only inhibi ting their growth but also inducing cell death via multiple mechanisms. Gal and VNPT55's multiple target effects on differe nt signaling pathways are summarized in Figure 84. From our studies, we propo se that gal/VNPT55 inhibit Snail transcription by targeting NF-B phosphorylation an d inhibiting it from binding to Snail promoter region. Twist1 repression and transcriptio nal and activities on E-Cadherin and BMI-1, respectively, are disrupted by gal/VNPT55 by inhibition of Twist1 nuclear translocation. Gal/VNPT55 additional targeting of t he Mnk1/2-eIF4E axis, may result in a significant and augmented effect on antagonizing mu ltiple signaling pathways. In summary, our study demonstrates that gal/VNPT55, target oncogenic protein translation, via Mnk1/2 degradation. These two agen ts markedly attenuate EMT, stem cell characteristics and PC cell migration and invasion. As a consequence of these multiple 157 properties, gal/VNPT55 could become promising agent s for the prevention of CRPC and treatment of both early- and late-stage PC. In addi tion, these agents may be valuable for tackling PC metastasis, a major contributor of PC-a ssociated patient mortality. Figure 84: Schematic of of ARDAs. NF-B (p65) p50 heterodimerizes and binds to it s cognate sequences in promoter regions of target g enes to activate them, gal/VNPT55 in addition to decreas ing p65 phosphorylation levels also inhibits bindin g to the chromatin (1). Twist1 binds to BMI-1 gene to ac tivate its transcription; ChIP analyses shows gal/V NPT55 inhibits this interaction (2). Twist1 also binds to E-Cadherin promoter to repress its transcription, with gal/VNPT55 inhibiting nuclear translocation of Twis t1; this significantly inhibits the process and enh ances E-Cadherin expression (3). Mnk1/2 phosphorylation l eads to phosphorylation of eIF4E and subsequent formation of the translation complex to translate o ncogenic mRNAs (4). Gal and VNPT55 deplete protein expression of Mnk1/2 (5) and ultimately inhibit the metastatic potential of Mnk-eIF4E axis (6) 158 Future Directions The presence of IRES in genes such as proapoptotic factors enable them evade inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA translation. Sever al other oncogenes which are up- regulated during carcinogenesis (c-Myc and cyclin D 1) have also been reported to express these internal ribosomal entry sites; however, stud ies have shown that silencing the Mnk- eIF4E axis reduce protein expression of these facto rs. It is likely that there are several other mechanisms involved in translating these mRNAs. Twi st1 may be an example of such proteins. In our study, the results demonstrate no effect of gal and analogs on both mRNA and protein expression of Twist1. It would be inter esting to evaluate the mechanisms involved in translating Twist1 mRNA in the presence /absence of gal and its analogs. Future studies will also be directed at posttranslational modifications induced by these compounds on Twist1, which inhibit Twist1 nuclear translocati on and transcriptional activity. Inhibiting cell migration and invasion in vitro, does not indicate anti-metastatic activity in vivo . Future studies with gal and its analog will focus on in vivo metastatic models and also analyze the effects on stem cell po pulation in PC. Another interesting focus is the implication of miRNAs in modulating on cogenes. Factors such as CD44 and Snail are regulated by miR-34a (Liu et al, 2011; Si emens et al, 2011), whereas MMP-2/-9 and VEGF are modulated by miR-29b (Fang et al, 2011 ; Foxler et al, 2012). The notion arises whether gal and its analogs also modulate mi RNAs in exhibiting these multiple effects we see on different targets. 159 Specific Aim 2b: To determine the anti-proliferati ve activities of gal/analogs on drug resistant cells. Gal and analogs inhibit cell proliferation of docet axel, mitoxantrone and enzalutamide resistant PC cells We utilized a CRPC cell model (CWR-R1), made resistant to docet axel (CWR-R1 10E) and mitoxantrone (CWR-R1 MTX-20nM)(Xie et al, 2008), to analyze potential cross- resistance between taxanes and gal and its analogs. A recent report has implicated cross- resistance between taxanes and anti-hormonal drugs (enzalutamide and abiraterone) (van Soest et al, 2013). Here we the emphasis was to eva luate whether resistance to these drugs would elevate the GI 50 values of gal and its analogs, as they are also bei ng developed for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant pr ostate cancer. A previous study reported that PC cells resistant t o abiraterone showed impaired efficacy towards enzalutamide, docetaxel and cabazi taxel, and the same was true for cells resistant to enzalutamide (van Soest et al, 2013). Another study showed that AR was responsible for conferring cross-resistance between agents targeting AR and docetaxel, and that cabazitaxel still retained a high potency agai nst these resistant cells and inhibited the growth of tumors resistant to enzalutamide and abir aterone in an AR independent manner (van Soest et al, 2015). From our data in specific aim 2a, we observed significant effects on pathways other than just the AR signaling pathway . These effects suggested molecular mechanisms of ARDAs that may possibly enhance their efficacy in a ntagonizing a wide range of resistant pathways and hence the growth of resistant cells 160 Docetaxel and mitoxantrone resistant cells were de veloped from CWR-R1 parental cells (Xie et al, 2008). Interestingly, these cells also express splice variant ARs, which recapitulates what occurs in the clinic where AR-Vs have been implicated in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistance (Antonarakis et al, 2014 ; Nakazawa et al, 2014). However, in a recent clinical study, where the significance of s plice variant ARs were evaluated in docetaxel resistance, the preliminary results sugg ested that AR-Vs do not play a significant role in docetaxel resistance (Antonarak is et al, 2015). Our initial experiments were to determine if the fo ld increase in GI 50 values of docetaxel in docetaxel and mitoxantrone resistant P C cells, were significantly elevated, before analyzing the effects of ARDAs. From Figure 85, we observed that GI 50 values in the resistance cells were 5, 3K and 10K fold higher in CWR-R1(MTX-20nM), CWR- R1(10E) and CWR-R1(100E) respectively, compared to the control line CWR-R1 (GI 50 : 0.49 \u00b1 0.40 nM). in Docetaxel/Mitoxantrone-na\u00efv e/resistant cells. Drug-naive/resistant cells were seeded at 5000 cell s/well in a 96-well plate and allowed to attach ove rnight. Cell viability was analyzed after a 7-day treatment schedule and GI 50 values computed from the dose-response curve. GI 50 values were plotted on a barchart to represent the fold increase in GI 50 . 161 Consistent with a previous report that showed high activity of anti-androgen therapy docetaxel resistant cells (Shiota et al, 20 13), we found that, GI 50 values of abiraterone in docetaxel resistant cells were not s ignificantly different from what was observed in the parental cell line (Figure 86), and in fact, was lower in mitoxantrone- resistant cells. We went ahead and compared the ant i-proliferative activity of gal, its analogs, and enzalutamide in docetaxel and mitoxant rone resistant cells. From our results, we observed that docetaxel and mitoxantrone resista nce also impaired the efficacy of enzalutamide in these cells lines. In comparison, g al and its analogs maintained fairly approximate GI 50 values between docetaxel-naive and docetaxel, mitox antrone and enzalutamide-resistant PC cells with no appreciable differences (Figure 87). Fold change in GI 50 values (gal and analogs), between the drug-naive a nd drug-resistant cells did not exceed two fold. Considering that GI 50 values of enzalutamide in the drug-resistant cells in comparison to drug-naive cells also did not exceed 2-fold, one might suggest that docetaxel or mitoxantrone does not impair enzalutamide' effic acy appreciably. However, contrary to enzalutamide's high activity in LNCaP cells, apprec iably high GI 50 values (30 \u00b5M) were observed in CWR-R1 cells. These values, were furthe r increased in drug-resistant cells (40 - 50 \u00b5M) and may be due to the expression of AR spl ice variants in addition to factors upregulated during docetaxel-resistance. 162 Figure 86: Abiraterone efficacy in docetaxel-resist ant cells. Cell viability assays performed in drug-naive/resis tant cells with abiraterone shows modest efficacy i n both docetaxel and mitoxantrone-resistant CRPC cells. Th ese values were appreciably lower than what was observed with enzalutamide treatment in these same cell type in vitro . To confirm the high growth inhibition activity seen in cell viability assays with ARDAs in enzalutamide, docetaxel and mitoxantrone-r esistant cells, we performed colony formation assays over a 14-day period. Cells, count ed were seeded at 1000/well in 6-well plates, treated with 0.5, 1 and 2.5 \u00b5M. Media cont aining compounds were replaced every 3 days and experiment terminated after 14 days. Col onies were stained with crystal violet and counted (Figure 88). Indeed, as represented in Figure 88 and 89, gal and VNPP433-3 exhibited strong growth inhibition in both drug-res istant cell lines including drug-naive cells. Our results confirmed what we observed in th e MTT cell viability assays. We also observed that VNPP433-3 inhibited colonies more po tently at a lower concentration (0.5 M). 163 Figure 87: Comparing GI 50 constants of gal, its analogs and enzalutamide in drug- naive/resistant cells. Drug-naive/resistant cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Indicated a gents were serially diluted in media and incubated on cel ls for 8 days, changing media on the 3 rd day. MTT reagent was added to analyze cell viability and GI 50 values computed from the dose-response curve. GI 50 values are represented on a bar chart to compare differences. Gal and analogs exhibit strong growth inhibition in enzalutamide/docetaxel and mitoxantrone-resistant c ells. 164 Figure 88: Gal and VNPP433-3 inhibit colony formati on of drug-naive/resistant CWR-R1 (10E), CWR-R1 -MTX20nM), seeded in 6-well plates were treated with indicated concentrations of compounds for a period of 14 days. Media containing compounds were replaced every 3 days. Colonies were stained w ith 0.05% crystal violet. 165 Figure 89: Quantification of CFU in drug-naive/resi stant cells. Colony assays were repeated three times and colonie s counted in four quadrants of the wells. Results a re represented as averages with S.E.M. (*p<0.05, **0.0 01). VNPP433-3 exhibited the and mitoxantrone-resistant cells. the hig hest activity of gal was observed at 2.5 \u00b5M. Protein Expression analysis in drug-naive/resistant PC cells Docetaxel/mitoxantrone-resistant cells used in thi s study were previously characterized in an article published by Yun Qiu an d her group (Linn et al, 2010). Microarray analysis on the resistant cells showed t hat several genes implicated in EMT (Snai1 MMP1 and CDH2) were differentially upregulat ed in the resistant cells. Stem cell factors (POU5F1/Oct-4 and Sox-2) in addition to dru g efflux proteins (MDR1/Pgp and ABCG2/BCRP) were also upregulated and possibly resp onsible for the observed resistance to docetaxel. We determined the protein expression levels of some oncogenes which have been shown to be modulated by gal and its analogs. A brief analysis showed that N- Cadherin which was reported at the gene level to be upregulated (Linn et al, 2010) was also overexpressed at the protein level (Figure 90). 166 Figure 90: Relative Protein expression in docetaxel and Mitoxantrone resistant cells. (Left panel ) 50 g of quantified total cell lysates of CWR-R1, CWR-R1 (10E) and CWR-R1 (MTX-20nM), were separated on a 10% tris/glycine gel and the in dicated proteins probed with their respective antib odies to determine the expression levels between drug-na\u00ef ve/resistant cells. ( Right panel ) Densitometry of three representative experiments were averaged and plotte d as bar charts. Expression analysis show a signifi cant increase of Mnk2, BMI-1, Twist1, peIF4E and N-Cadhe EZH2, Twist1, Mnk1/2 , BMI-1 and peIF4E also suggested that these factors were up-regulated in d ocetaxel resistant (Figure 90). Interestingly, these factors (EZH2, Twist1, Mnk2 an d eIF4E phosphorylation) are depleted at the protein level by gal and its analogs. A prev ious study on docetaxel resistance in PC also reported that AR expression was lower in docet axel-resistant LNCaP cells, and targeting the AR signaling in these resistant cells exhibited higher anti-proliferative activities than in the parental cell line (Shiota e t al, 2013). This also confirmed what was observed in the clinic where the efficacy of abirat erone and enzalutamide therapy increased overall survival after docetaxel resistance (de Bon o et al, 2011; Fizazi et al, 2014; Fizazi et al, 2012; Scher et al, 2012). 167 There has been some evidence suggesting depletion e ffects of abiraterone acetate on AR protein expression. Although we did not analy ze this in the current study, our MTT assays, suggested that abiraterone was more potent than enzalutamide and exhibited lower GI 50 values in drug-resistance cells. In addition, we d id not observe any significant difference in the expression of full length AR, on the other hand, AR splice variant expression levels were lower in drug-resistant PC c ells. (Figure 91). It is possible that the low expression levels of AR -V7 in drug resistant cells contributed to the modest anti-proliferative activi ty of abiraterone acetate in this study. Since expression of AR-Vs have been implicated in e nzalutamide and abiraterone resistance, its low expression level and activity o f abiraterone was not that surprising. Lack of efficacy of enzalutamide on the other hand, was not expected since expression of AR- Vs in drug-resistant cells were modestly lower. Cle arly factors that are up-regulated in docetaxel/mitoxantrone-resistant cells (Figure 90), also play a vital role in their resistance to enzalutamide. Figure 91: fAR and AR-V7 protein expression in Doce taxel and Mitoxantrone resistant cells. Total cell lysates from drug-resistant and drug-nai ve cells were analyzed for differences in protein e xpression of full length AR and splice variant AR-V. Protein expression of AR-V7 in drug-resistant cells was lo wer when compared to expression levels in the parental cell line. 168 Expression of Twist1, which has been reported to be activated in docetaxel resistance was also increased in both docetaxel and mitoxantrone resistant cell in vitro . Studies have shown that docetaxel resistance implic ates activation and over expression of Twist1 and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) and knock ing both down (silencing the gene), consequently increased the anti-cancer activities o f taxane agents in these cell lines (Shiota et al, 2013). We assume that the multiple effects s een in specific aim 2a on Twist1 transcriptional activities, NF-B, Mnk1/2 and AR/AR -Vs, may be responsible for the high growth inhibitory activities of gal and analogs in drug-resistant PC cells. Some studies have shown that the constitutively act ive Mnk2 variant, is overexpressed in some cancers (pancreatic) during d rug resistance (Adesso et al, 2013). Thus we isolated RNA from the parental cell line (C WR-R1) and docetaxel-resistant cells. We analyzed Mnk2 mRNA levels by realtime PCR in the cells resistant to 10 nM of docetaxel, using the parental as reference. Interes tingly, Mnk2 mRNA was significantly elevated (Figure Mnk2 transcr iption complex and thus the translation of oncogenic mRNAs significant in disease progressi on. Although, the Mnk-eIF4E axis has not been extensively studied in docetaxel resis tance, a number of oncogenic mRNAs that are potentially translated by this axis are si gnificantly upregulated. The high expression of these proteins and our current observations on M nk2 and peIF4E suggests that this axis may play a significant role during docetaxel resist ance. 169 Figure 92: Increased Mnk2 mRNA expression in doceta xel resistant PC cells. Drug-na\u00efve cells were cultured in regular media and docetaxel-resistant cells were cultured in regular media supplemented with 10 nM docetaxel, leading to the s tudies. Collected mRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and quantified with realtime PCR analysis. Gal and analogs deplete oncogenic proteins in drug- resistant cells. From our previous results, we observed that gal an d its analogs target multiple oncogenic pathways which may result in inhibiting c ell proliferation. We hypothesized that these same targets would be affected in drug-resist ant cells, and since most resistance cells utilize these pathways to maintain cell proliferati on and tumor growth, depleting them may decrease cell viability. Oct-4, a stem cell factor, has been shown to be overexpressed in docetaxel resistant cells and greatly enhances the resistance characteristics of CWR-R1 (10E) cell lines. Knocking down Oct-4 with shRNA si gnificantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo (Linn et al, 2010). Previous studies have shown that enzalutamid e although, a very efficacious AR antagonist, does not significantly deplete AR prote in expression nor the splice variant AR- V7 (Figure 93). The expression of AR-V7 has been im plicated in resistance of CRPC patients to enzalutamide and abiraterone therapy (A ntonarakis et al, 2014). 170 Figure 93: Enzalutamide shows no effect on AR and A R-V7. (A), CWR22Rv1 cells were treated with 15 M of gal, VNPT55 and enzalutamide (MDV3100) and protein lysates separated by western blot analysis. AR and AR-V7 protein expression were evaluated with their respective antibodies. (B), ImageJ was used to quan tify the blots and plotted. Densitometry analysis s hows that as opposed to gal and VNPT55, MDV3100 caused a significant up-regulation of AR/AR-V7. A 24-hour treatment with gal, VNPT55 or enzalutamid e in CWR22Rv1 cells show that as opposed to gal and VNPT55, enzalutamide did not deplete protein expression of both full length AR and splice variant AR-V7 (Figur e 93). Furthermore, we observed that enzalutamide caused an increase in AR/AR-V7 express ion. We have already established that gal and its analogs exhibit significant deplet ion effects on multiple pathways in both AR positive and negative PC cells. Here, we treated the parental cell line (CWR-R1) with enzalutamide (5-20 M) over 24 hours. From the west ern blot analysis, even at 20 M of enzalutamide, there was no significant effect on Mn k1/2, -Catenin, Nanog, MMP-2 nor phosphorylated eIF4E (Figure 94) as opposed to the effects that are observed with gal and analogs. Although, enzalutamide failed to show any significa nt effect on protein expression of EMT and stem cell markers, we went ahead and eva luated its anti-migratory and anti- invasive activity in docetaxel-resistant cells. In modulating oncogenes, other mechanisms 171 such as posttranslational modification of the prote in/gene play a role in its activation. If a small molecule inhibitor can inhibit these modifica tions, it may antagonize the activity of these proteins. Since enzalutamide, in our brief an alysis of drug-naive cells, did not show any significant effect on EMT markers, we did not e valuate its activity against protein expression in drug-resistant cell lines. However, a s stated earlier, these drugs may have effects on protein modifications, which ultimately may affect several biological processes in cancer cells. It is also possible that in additi on to antagonizing the transcriptional activity of AR, these drugs can also modulate posttranslatio nal modifications and hence activity of EMT markers, consequently regulating migration and invasion. Figure 94: Enzalutamide shows no effects on Mnk and EMT expression. Enzalutamide (MDV3100) treated CWR-R1 cells were an alyzed for EMT related protein expression. Analysis reveals no observable effects on protein e xpression after a 24 hour treatment with increasing concentrations. There was also no significant effec t on Mnk1/2 and peIF4E expression Gal/VNPP433-3 inhibit docetaxel-resistant PC cell migration and invasion Gal and analogs exhibit anti-migratory and anti-inv asive activities in both AR positive and AR negative prostate cancer cells. The se novel analogs also showed low GI 50 values in decreasing cell viability of docetaxel, e nzalutamide and mitoxantrone resistant PC cells. From Figure 90, we observed increased exp ression of N-Cadherin and other EMT 172 markers (Twist1 and BMI-1) in docetaxel-resistant c ells, suggesting a high metastatic potential. Since the most debilitating effects of c ancer disease arises from the metastatic disease, this in addition to the fact that gal and its analogs are being developed for mCRPC, prompted us to evaluate whether at low doses, these novel compounds could inhibit the migratory and invasive ability of drug-resistant PC cells. Docetaxel resistant cells overexpress EMT proteins (Marin-Aguilera et al, 201 4) and the polycomb protein BMI-1 has been implicated in evading docetaxel-induced ap optosis (Crea et al, 2011). EZH2 overexpression has also been shown to silence miR-3 1 (pro-apoptotic) and increase E2F6 (E2F transcription factor 6) expression (Eaton et a l, 2014). In that same study. It was observed that E2F6 (an anti-apoptotic protein) inhi bited docetaxel-induced apoptosis (Eaton et al, 2014). Since our studies have shown t hat gal and analogs significantly modulate and deplete EMT markers, it was logical to evaluate whether these effects translated to inhibiting biological functional acti vities. A brief analysis of Snail, BMI-1 and Mnk1 in doceta xel-resistant cells after treatment with gal and VNP433-3, show remarkable d epletion of these proteins after a 24-hour time point (Figure 95). Significant effects were observed at both 5 and 10 \u00b5M concentration. 173 Figure 95: Gal/VNPP433-3 decrease expression of EM T markers in docetaxel- resistant cells. (A), Gal and VNPP433-3 (B), depletes EMT markers d ose-dependently after exposing CWR-R1 (10E) cells to the inhibitors for 24 hours. Western blot analys is shows a marked downregulation of proteins. In Figure 96 and 97, we show that gal, VNPT55 and V NPP433-3, significantly inhibit cell migration and invasion of AR-V7 expres sing drug-na\u00efve and drug-resistant PC cells. Interestingly we observed that although MDV3 100 and Zytiga have not shown any significant effects on protein expression of EMT fa ctors, in CWR22Rv1 cells, both drugs decreased the number of invaded cells. Both drugs a re potent anti-androgens and may possibly act by antagonizing the AR as the receptor is known to be implicated in metastases (de Bono et al, 2011; Efstathiou et al, 2012; Fizaz i et al, 2012). 174 Figure 96: Comparison of anti-migratory and anti-in vasive activities of compounds (A) CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in Boyden chambers p re-coated with BME and simultaneously treated with 5 M of indicated agents and incubated for 24 hours.

Cells were incubated with compou nds for a 12-hour period. (C), CWR-R1 (10E) cells were seeded at 0.75 x10 6 cells in each insert of pre-coated BME Boyden cham bers and treated with 5 over a 24-hour period [CWR-R1 ( 10E)-IN]. Figure of agents in drug- naive/resistant PC cells. Quantified invaded cells (from Figure 96) show a si gnificant inhibition of drug-naive/resistant PC cel l migration and invasion by analogs compared to vehic le treated controls (* p < 0.05, **p<0.001). Interestingly enzalutamide and abiraterone inhibited invasion of CWR22Rv1 cells 175 CGP-57380 and Chloroquine exhibit modest anti-proli ferative activities in drug-resistant PC cells Considering that resistant cells use several surviv al mechanisms to evade toxicity induced by chemotherapeutic agents, we decided to f urther evaluate the role autophagy and the Mnk-eIF4E axis played in docetaxel and mitoxant rone-resistant PC cell viability. We determined whether Mnk and autophagy inhibitors cou ld decrease cell viability Indeed, chloroquine (CQ), an inhib itor of autophagy, exhibited modest activity in decreasing cell viability of drug-resis tant prostate cancer cells (Figure 98), although CGP did infact inhibit cell viability, the GI 50 values were moderately high (Table 8). Contrary to what we observed with Chloroquine, CGP- 57380 had increased GI 50 values in the drug-resistant cells and especially s o in the docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells (Table 8), with an increase of 1.2 and 1.7 fo ld in GI 50 values in mitoxantrone and docetaxel-resistance cells respectively. We also performed colony formation assays (CFU) wit h the two inhibitors to confirm the results we observed in the MTT cell via bility assays. It was interesting to note that cell CFU with both compounds show that inhibit ing autophagy with Chloroquine significantly decrease colony numbers and was more efficacious than the Mnk inhibitor (Figure 98). Suggesting that autophagy induction ma y be implicated in docetaxel/mitoxantrone-resistance in PC cells, howe ver this does not preclude the fact that chloroquine may have additional activities. 176 Figure 98: Chloroquine decreases cell viability of drug-resistant prostate cancer cells. PC cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well in a 96-wel l plate and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were treated with serially diluted chloroquine in complete growt h media. Mtt reagent was used to analyze cell viabi lity and GI 50 values computed by the graphpad prism software. Va lues show that Chloroquine decreases cell viability of drug-resistant cells (docetaxel and Mi toxantrone), with comparatively low GI 50 values. Table 8: CGP-57380 show modest efficacy in cell via bility assays. GI 50 values from CGP-57380 treated drug-na\u00efve/resistant cells show an increase in growth-inhibition constant in docetaxel resistant cells. Cell viabili ty assays in drug-resistant cells (docetaxel and mi toxantrone), with CGP-57380 show that although the latter decrea se cell viability, its effects were not as strong a s the gal, analogs or Chloroquine. 177 Figure 99: CFU in CGP and Chloroquine treated ce lls. and B)) 1000 cells/well (CWR-R1, CWR-R1 (10E), C WR-R1-MTX20nM), seeded in 6-well plates were treated with indicated concentrations of compounds for a period of 14 days. Media containing compounds were replaced every 3 days. Colonies were stained w ith 0.05% crystal violet and counted. Chloroquine w as more potent in inhibiting colony formation compared to effects of CGP-57380. 178 The activity of Mnk observed here indicates that, i t may not be a potent anti-cancer agent and perhaps a more potent Mnk inhibitor may y ield better results in antagonizing proliferation of drug-resistant cells. Cercosporami de has been shown to be more efficacious in targeting and decreasing colony form ation in triple negative breast cancer (Ramalingam et al, 2014), however its efficacy coul d also be attributed to the inhibitors' effects on other kinases including Jak3, GSK3, ALK 4 and Pim1 (Konicek et al, 2011). The possibility exists that this may be the reason for CGP's limited efficacy in drug resistant cell. However, it's also possible that do cetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells have several activated mechanisms which enable them to e vade protein translation inhibition. The induction of autophagy during drug-resistance s upports the efficacy of chloroquine and its analogs in treating cancer pati ents, reported in several xenograft studies and clinical trials (Amaravadi et al, 2011; Sheen e t al, 2011; Tormo et al, 2009; Yang et al, 2011a). The ERK pathway, which is reported to be ov erexpressed during drug-resistance has been shown to activate autophagy. Inhibiting mi togen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) induction. Autophagy enhances apoptotic evasion by recycling drug-induce d damaged proteins (Levine & Kroemer, 2008), thus reducing injury to cells and p roviding energy for cancer cells. In therapeutic strategies where drugs are combined wit h autophagy inhibitors, this may result in a potentiated or synergistic effect. In this study, we confirm that chloroquine possesse s anticancer activities, as has been previously reported in melanoma cells and xeno grafts models (Lakhter et al, 2013). Although chloroquine is an autophagy inhibitor, its activity indicates that there are 179 additional properties, in addition to apoptotic ind uction(Maclean et al, 2008; Tang et al, 2011; Walls et al, 2010), which may not have been fully characterized. Chloroquine enhances efficacy of anti-androgens Numerous studies with chloroquine in prostate cance r emphasize the importance of autophagy as a prosurvival pathway (Janku et al, 20 11; Kondo et al, 2005). Another study also showed that anti-androgen therapy enhanced aut ophagy, and a combination of autophagy inhibitors with enzalutamide, increased t he latter's activity (Nguyen et al, 2014). Here, we aimed at inhibiting autophagy in combinati on with ARDAs to determine whether this would enhance the effects of ARDAs. Our initia l experiments were performed in drug- na\u00efve PC cells. LNCaP cells were treated with 20 \u00b5M chloroquine for an hour and subsequently with gal for an additional 24 hours. I mmunoblot assay was used to analyze PARP and caspase cleavage in LNCaP cells (Figure 10 0A). Here we observed that, co- incubation with chloroquine did not enhance PARP no r caspase 3 cleavage. Gal modulates two pathways that are implicated in t he regulation of autophagy, caspases and calpains. Caspase activation has been reported to cleave Beclin 1 into two fragments (N and C), the C terminal fragment then t ranslocate to the mitochondria to induce apoptosis, hence losing its ability to induc e autophagy (Zhu et al, 2010). Activation of calpains by calcium ion release has also been re ported as one of gal's mode of action in inhibiting cell viability (Bruno et al, 2008). Calp ain activation also inactivates autophagy by cleaving Atg5, thereby enhancing apoptosis (see Figure 16) (Yousefi et al, 2006). Thus, based on these previous studies on gals' acti vities, we evaluated nhibitor (calpeptin) with gal would 180 enhance apoptotic induction. We observed that gal i n combination with ZVAD-fmk significantly inhibited gal-induced Beclin1, PARP c leavage (Figure 100 B), and Bax expression. These data suggested that gal induced P ARP and Beclin 1 cleavage was via caspase activation, which have already been shown i n aim 1. Although cleaved PARP expression was not enhanced, gal and chloroquine co mbination increased Bax expression, an indication that apoptotic induction may be enhan ced. Furthermore, gal and calpeptin also increased Bax expression compared to controls (Figure. 99 B). Figure 100: Inhibiting autophagy potentiate the eff ects of gal on Bax expression. (A), LNCaP cells were incubated with 20 M of CQ fo r 1 hour and then treated with gal at 10 M for an additional 24 hours. Cell lysates were separated by immunoblot and probed for indicated proteins. (B), LNCaP cells pretreated with CQ, ZVAD-fmk and calpep tin for 1 hour were treated with gal for 24 hours, c- Beclin 1, Bax, p62 and c-PARP expression were analy zed. Finally, we performed combination analysis with ARD As and chloroquine at their respective GI 50 values (constant ratio) and analyzed fractional ef fects of the compounds. Using the Calcusyn software we determined whether i nteractions between gal activity and chloroquine were synergistic, additive or antagonis tic. Interestingly we gal and chloroquine interacted synergistically in inhib iting cell viability, as represented by the Isobologram in Figure 101.Combination Index values indicate strong synergy between 181 these two compounds in LNCaP cells (CI at ED 50, ED 7 5 and ED 90 : 0.03766, 0.08107 and 0.17712 respectively) (Table 9). Figure 101: Combination analysis of gal and Chloroq uine. Cell viability assays were conducted for gal and ch loroquine individually and GI 50 values calculated. Both compounds were subsequently combined at their GI 50 (constant ratio) and serially diluted and cell via bility assays conducted. Fractional effects of single agen ts and in combination were calculated and analyzed by calcusyn software to calculate the combination indi ces at ED 50, ED 75 and ED 90. Table 9: CI values of combination gal and chloroqui ne in LNCaP cells Combination indices from figure 101 show that gal a nd chloroquine strongly synergize to decrease cell viability of LNCaP cells at all analyzed levels (ED 50, ED 75 and ED 90) Combination analysis in drug-resistant cells Next, we analyzed interactions between approved dru gs and investigational agents in the drug-resistant and parental cells. Although cancer cells characteristically employ a number of activated signaling pathways and oncogene overexpression, we envisaged that 182 since gal possess multiple activities, it may be po ssible to target a number of these pathways with gal and also inhibit autophagy to potentiate g al's activity. We performed similar studies with enzalutamide, since it's already been established to induce autophagy and showed improved activity in combination with autoph agy inhibitors(Nguyen et al, 2014). We co-treated CWR-R1 and CWR-R1 (10E) cells with ch loroquine and gal or enzalutamide and analyzed their combined effects on cleaved PARP, Beclin 1 cleavage and LC3-I/II protein expression. Remarkably, both g al and enzalutamide enhanced LC3- I/II expression in parental cells (Figure 102 A/B). In docetaxel resistant cells, however effects of gal and enzalutamide (MDV-3100) alone di d not show changes in LC3-I/II (Figure 103 A/B). Interestingly, chloroquine enhanc ed gals induce PARP cleavage in both drug-naive and drug-resistant cell s, with no apparent change in enzalutamide treated drug-naive cells (Figure 102 A and 103 A). Surprisingly, enzalutamide also induced Beclin 1 cleavage, which could suggest an inhibition of autophagy at low levels; however, published work ha s shown that autophagy inhibitors enhance enzalutamide activity in vivo (Nguyen et al, 2014). This could possibly imply tha t enzalutamide-induced Beclin1 cleavage does not sign ificantly inhibit autophagy. Analysis of Beclin 1 cleavage in docetaxel-resistant yielded the same results as was observed in drug-naive cells. With the exception of drug-naive CWR-R1 cells treated with gal, Figure 102 and 103, show increased LC3-II expression, when gal/enzalutamide were combined with chloroquine. These results suggested that both anti-androgens induced autophagy in drug-resistant cells. 183 Figure 102: Autophagic response after gal/enzalutam ide treatment in CWR-R1 cells (A), Gal and enzalutamide (B), were incubated with or without chloroquine in CWR-R1 cells for 24 hours and protein expression analyzed to determine autoph agy induction. LC3-I/II, Beclin 1 and PARP cleavage were treated CWR-1 cells, although Chloroquine enhanced PARP cleavage, there was no difference in LC3-II expression, however in enzalut amide treatment, there was significant upregulation of LC3-II in combination with chloroquine. Figure 103: Gal/enzalutamide enhance LC3-II express ion in drug-resistant cells. (A), Gal and enzalutamide (B), were incubated with or without chloroquine in CWR-R1 (10E) cells for 24 hours and protein expression analyzed to determine autophagy induction. LC3-I/II, Beclin loroquine enhanced expression of LC3-II when combin ed with either agent compared to single-agent treatmen t 184 In studies using LNCaP cells, where we combined gal and chloroquine, although there was no appreciable increase in PARP and caspa se-3 cleavage, the CI values from showed a strong synergistic inte raction. In CWR-R1 cells, however, we observed a significant increase in PARP cleavage in both drug-na\u00efve and drug-resistant cells. The next logical step was to determine wheth er these compounds put together would act in synergy in decreasing cell viability of CRPC cells line CWR-R1. As represented in Table 10, roquine synergistically at was observed only at ED75 and ED9 0 for gal and chloroquine combination. In docetaxel-resistant cells, gal interacted with c hloroquine weakly synergistic at ED75 and ED90, also showed weak synerg y at ED50 and ED75. In the case of enzalutamide-chloroquine interaction, this diffe rence between the drug-na\u00efve and drug resistant cells could be attributed to the fact tha t in drug-resistant cells, there are multiple up-regulated mechanisms in addition to autophagy; a nd thus the use of chloroquine does not necessarily augment enzalutamide activity. Howe ver, since in vivo data shows an improved efficacy in drug-naive models, further stu dies in combination could be evaluated. Duration of exposure and sequence of drug treatment , may all affect how these compounds interact to inhibit cell viability or tumor growth. In the case of gal-chloroquine interaction in drug- na\u00efve/resistant cells, we observed antagonism at ED50 and then weak synergy at higher doses. Gal has shown effects on multiple pathways, it is likely that at low doses, chloroquine does not complement the effects of gal. Further studies, with sequence of c ombination treatment or ratios of 185 combination are required to provide comprehensive c onsequence of combining gal and chloroquine in drug-resistant PC cell lines. Table 10: Combination Indices to determine compound interactions in vitro Combined compounds at their respective GI 50 values at constant ratio. Cell viability assays we re conducted for gal, enzalutamide, docetaxel and chloroquine in dividually and GI 50 values calculated. Compounds were subsequently combined at their GI 50 (constant ratio) and serially diluted and cell via bility assays conducted. Fractional effects of single agents and in combinat ion were calculated and analyzed by calcusyn softwa re to calculate the combination indices (CI) at ED50, ED7 5 and ED90. Initial clinical studies showed that both abiratero ne and enzalutamide increased overall survival in docetaxel-resistant patients; h owever, the emergence and expression of splice variants in CRPC caused resistance to both c ompounds. We hypothesized that by antagonizing Twist1-BMI-1 signaling, gal and its an alogs could sensitize docetaxel- resistant cells to docetaxel therapy . We performed combination studies, just as with chloroquine, to determine in vitro interactions between gal/VNPP433-3/enzalutamide a nd docetaxel in drug-naive/resistant PC cells. In CWR- R1 cells both ARDAs acted in synergy with docetaxel. In drug resistant PC cells, however , gal showed only weak to moderate synergy with docetaxel, VNPP433-3 on the other han d, showed strong synergy at ED75 186 and ED90. We surmised that at higher doses, the eff ects on resistant pathways were significant to sensitize the resistant cells. Inter estingly, enzalutamide had the strongest synergy at all levels with docetaxel in the resista nt cells. Obviously enzalutamide has limited activities on multiple signaling pathways. In combining docetaxel with enzalutamide, it is possible that, these agents com plement each other in targeting multiple pathways that are upregulated, which results in an increased activity in both drug- naive/resistant cells. On the other hand, if the mo de of action of both agents on similar pathways are opposite then this combination might n ot necessarily yield favorable results when combined. Agents with similar activities on si milar pathways may not also result in a synergistic outcome. In this thesis project, in addition to already publ ished studies on gal, it has been revealed that gal and analogs exhibit effects on mu ltiple pathways. We also found antagonistic effects on the Mnk-eIF4E axis and AR s plice variants, which are two of the most important pathways implicated in CRPC resistan ce. Previously published work, in addition to protein e xpression analysis conducted by us on drug-naive/resistant cells informed us of the limited activities of enzalutamide as opposed to the multiple activities of the ARDAs. Al though enzalutamide possesses superior anti-AR activity (luciferase activity), co mpared to gal and some of its analogs, we surmised that combining gal with enzalutamide, migh t possibly potentiate enzalutamide's activity and may even act synergistically in drug-r esistant cells. Indeed, we observed that in all three cell lines, gal and enzalutamide acted in synergy. Interestingly, synergy was superior in docetaxel-resistant and mitoxantrone-re sistant cells (Table 10) compared to drug-na\u00efve cells. 187 CRPC resistance to enzalutamide has been attributed in part to the expression of splice variant AR-Vs (Antonarakis et al, 2014) and the overexpression of PKC/Twist1 signaling pathways (Shiota et al, 2014). The effect s observed with ARDAs, as single agents or in combination with enzalutamide may easily be e xplicable and rationalized as ARDAs significantly deplete and antagonize resistance-ind ucing factors. Development and Characterization of Galeterone-resi stant cells Developing compounds and ultimately getting them ap proved for cancer therapy also takes into account potential acquired drug-res istance. It is important to note that almost every compound designed and developed for the treat ment of different types of cancers invariably encounter resistance. This realization p rovides the impetus to constantly look for 'druggable' targets and also more potent inhibi tors, not only to reduce toxicity but also to combat drug-resistance. Thus, we developed gal r esistant cells from LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 parental cell lines, the most widely used PC cell lines that express full length AR and AR-Vs. These studies will allow us to have a n idea about the potential pathways that might be involved in gal induced-resistance, s hould it be approved for PC therapy. LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were exposed to increasing doses of gal (0.1 through to 14 \u00b5M) for over 24 months until cells were resis tant to gal at different concentrations. Cells were maintained in complete culture media con taining gal. For LNCaP, cells were maintained at (3, 6 and 9 M of gal) and renamed LN -124R-3 \u00b5M, LN-124R-6 \u00b5M and LN-124R-9 \u00b5M. RV1-124R-4.5 \u00b5M, RV1-124R-9 \u00b5M and RV1-124R-14 \u00b5M. Images of the mor phology of the cells were taken to determine whether there would be any changes in cell phenotype. Indeed, we observed a gradual transition from epithelial-looking cells (cuboidal-shaped with tight junctions) to 188 a more Mesenchymal characteristic, lacking tight ju nctions, with a fibroblastic phenotype (Figure 104 A and B, LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 ). In between the epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype, cells attain more a more stem cell like characteristic during EMT. Figure 104: Acquisition of fibroblastic phenotype i n Gal-resistant cells (A), CWR22Rv1 and LNCaP (B) cells were exposed to i ncreasing concentration of gal over a 24-month period and maintained at indicated doses. Images we re taken every six months to determine any changes in cell morphology. Cell morphology suggests that gal- resistant cells, over time acquired a more fibrobla stic metastatic phenotype. In docetaxel resistance in PC, there is increase in Twist1 activity and BMI-1 expression, whereas in enzalutamide and abiraterone resistance, there's upregulation of splice variant AR-Vs. CRPC use several mechanisms t o evade cell death induced by agents. The NF-B pathway has been implicated in drug-resis tance as well Mnk1/2-eIF4E. The overexpression of multidrug resistant proteins and drug efflux proteins also contributes to drug-resistance (Linn et al, 2010), just to name a few. Knowing these effects helps to take informed decisions during therapeutic development. Resistance to ADT is due to the emergence of several mutations to enhance the recep tors activity, vis a vis, promiscuity, constitutive activation, kinase activation and loss of ligand binding domain. Reports of splice variants of cyclin D1 have also been shown i n prostate cancer (Comstock et al, 189 2009), this in addition to Mnk2 expression constitu tive activation during drug resistance (Adesso et al, 2013) makes it imperative to determi ne potential pathways that may be implicated in a would-be galeterone resistance. We conducted a brief immunoblot analysis of protein expression on the following: fAR/AR-Vs, LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells. It was rather interesting that in a ll resistant concentrations in both LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 gal-resistant cells, there was a bsolute loss of fAR and AR-Vs. Although Mnk1 expression was upregulated in both ce ll lines (resistant), CWR22Rv1 resistant cells showed a significant increase in eI F4E phosphorylation (peIF4E) (Figure 105 A and B). It has been reported that the loss of AR enhances autophagy in PC cells (Boutin et al, 2013; Chhipa et al, 2011; Jiang et a l, 2012; Li et al, 2008), so it was not surprising to see a significant up-regulated expres sion of LC3-I/II (Figure 105 A & B). To evaluate whether effects seen on the AR and Mnk were being modulated only at the protein level, we also analyzed the mRNA exp ression of full length AR and Mnk1. We observed that expression levels of AR mRNA were significantly suppressed in contrast, Mnk1 mRNA was significantly upregulated (Figure 106 ). 190 Figure 105: Protein expression analysis gal-resi stant cells (A), Gal-resistant CWR22Rv1 and gal-resistant LNCaP (B) were subjected to protein expression analysis. Comparing lysates drawn from resistant cells, we ob served a strong depletion of AR/AR-V7, up-regulatio n of Mnk1, increase in eIF4E phosphorylation (especia lly) in gal-resistant CWR22Rv1. We also observed increase in LC3-II expression (autophagy marker). Figure 106: mRNA levels Mnk1 in gal-resis tant CWR22Rv1 cells. MRNA collected from parental and resistant cells we re subjected to quantitative real-time PCR to analy ze AR and Mnk1 mRNA analysis showe d that AR and Mnk1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated compared to the parental (*p <0.05, **p<0.001). We further evaluated, whether by removing the resis tance-inducing agent (gal), AR expression could be restored. Both gal-resistant LN CaP and CWR22Rv1 cells were 191 subcultured without gal for 14 weeks and the experi ment subsequently terminated thereafter. Lysates were drawn at specific interval s and western blot analysis performed to evaluate whether AR expression would be restored. T he data showed that after culturing gal resistant cells for 14 weeks without galeterone , the effects which gal had induced in the cell lines were not reversed (Figure 107) with resp ect to AR/AR-V expression level. Figure 107: Lack of AR restoration after agent remo val in gal-resistant cells CWR22Rv1 (A) and LNCaP (B) gal-resistant cells were subcultured in media without gal for 14 weeks and lysates drawn at indicated intervals. Immunoblot an alysis compared expression of AR to the parental. W e observed that AR protein expression was not restore d, after 14 weeks of gal removal from culture media . Epigenetics play a major role in gene activity and expression and are tightly regulated by two major modifications to either the cytosine residues of DNA (DNA methylation) and or histone modifications (Bernstei n et al, 2007; Goldberg et al, 2007). DNA methylation is implicated in transcriptional si lencing of genes and plays a major role in development and tumorigenesis (Esteller, 2008; F einberg & Tycko, 2004; Vince et al, 2007). Histone amino terminals are subjected to sev eral different types of posttranslational modifications such sphorylation amongst others (Kouzarides, 2007; Ruthenburg et al, 2007), this ca n affect chromatin structure and subsequently gene transcription (Consortium et al, 2007) (13,25). Taking a cue from a report where the investigators induced the reactivation of ER in ER negative breast cancer cells, using histone deactelyase (HDAC) inhibitors in 192 combination with green tea polyphenol (Li et al, 20 10). We treated these cells with HDAC inhibitors (SAHA & MS-275), to evaluate whether AR could be re-activated. In gal- resistant LNCaP cells, SAHA at 2.5 and 5 \u00b5M for 72 hours re-activated the AR (Figure 108, left panel ), full length AR reactivation in gal-resistant CWR 22Rv1 cells was not that significant. It was rather interesting that reactiv ated AR did not restore PSA expression (Figure 10, left panel ). This may suggest that reactivated AR was not tra nscriptional active or the PSA gene was silenced, it is also possible t hat the assay duration did not allow transcription of the PSA gene. Interestingly, protein expression analysis revealed extra bands with molecular weight between fAR and the known AR-Vs even in the HDAC untreated resistant cells, which were not significantly evident in our earlier analysis of RV1-124R-14 M (Figure 108 B, right panel ). There seemed to be an emergence of a \"novel\" var iant of the AR-V which is resistant to the activities of gal. Figure 108: Reactivation of AR using HDAC inhibitor s LN-124R-9 ) and (B) RV1-124R-14 M ( right panel ) were treated with 2.5 and 5 \u00b5M of SAHA or MS-275 for 72 hours. Cell lysates were quan tified and compared to untreated gal-resistant cell s and the parental cell line. AR/AR-Vs and PSA expres sion were analyzed with their respective antibodies . We observed reexpression of AR in LNCaP cells and a n emergence of a \"novel\" splice variant in gal-resi stant CWR22Rv1 cells. 193 The purpose for developing gal-resistant cells was not only to determine the pathways and mechanism of resistance but also to de termine whether gal resistance would create cross-resistance between the novel analogs o f gal. Our initial efforts were to determine with cell viability assays if the analogs would be as efficacious as in gal-naive cells. Surprisingly, the novel analogs still mainta ined low submicromolar GI 50 values in all the resistant cells (Figure 109). Although GI 50 values of VNPT55 were slightly increased, it was still less than a 2-fold increase; GI 50 VNPP433-3 on the other hand was not significantly altered in all gal-resistant cells. Figure 109 Comparative GI 50 values of analogs in gal-resistant cells Gal-resistant cells were subcultured for three days without gal, to reduce its effects on the cells. 2 000 cells/well were seeded and allowed to attach overni ght. Serially diluted analogs were used in cell via bility assay and GI 50 values computed using the graphpad prism software. Results are represented in a bar chart. Analogs of gal, maintained very low GI 50 in gal-resistant cells. 194 Comparing anti-proliferative activities of gal/anal ogs in AR positive/negative PC cells Although, we have studied the effects of the analog s in LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells, we are yet to determine whether these compou nds maintain significantly low inhibitory GI 50 values in AR negative cells. We have already shown that these analogs show efficacy on multiple proteins in AR negative c ells, however, that does not give an absolute indication of their ability to inhibit the ir growth and viability. In addition to that, since gal-resistant cells lacked the expression of AR, this would give an indication of the multiple-target activities of the analogs, and thei r increased potency. Indeed, in PC3, and three AR positive cell lines, t he novel analogs showed several folds lower GI 50 values than gal. Perhaps most importantly, the GI 50 values of the analogs in the parental cells (LNCaP and CWR22Rv1) were not significantly different from what was observed in gal-resistant cells. In PC3 cells G I 50 values of VNPP414 and VNPP433- 3 averaged approximately 1.48 and 0.85 M respecti vely, which was even less than observed in AR positive cells (Figure 110). It is absolutely necessary to fully delineate the a ctivities of these compounds to determine their ability to target oncogenes and als o to analyze their toxic profiles. Histopathologic gross analysis of lung, liver and k idney sections failed to demonstrate any toxicity of gal and VNPT55. Studies conducted by To kai pharmaceuticals also showed minimal toxicity of gal, and the appreciably high d ose being utilized in the clinic seem to confirm the minimal toxicity of gal. We propose tha t this high dose can be improved by further investigation into its formulation and poss ibly active metabolites of gal. However, considering potential resistance in the clinic, dev elopment of more potent analogs would yield compounds that can be used at low doses with low potential toxicities. 195 Figure 110: Cell viability assays comparing efficac y of gal and analogs. (A), C4-2B, CWR22Rv1 (B), LNCaP (C), and PC3 (D) ce lls were seeded in 96 well plates at 5000 cells/wel l overnight. Serially diluted ARDAs were incubated on cells with complete growth media for 72 hours. Med ia and compounds were replaced and incubated for an ad ditional 96 hours. Mtt reagent was added and cell viability and GI 50 values were analyzed by graph pad prism. 196 Comparing gal and analogs' ability to deplete oncog enes. Following the remarkable efficacy of the novel anal ogs against AR-negative PC and gal-resistant cells, we further proceeded to de termine the effective concentration of the analogs that cause 50% (EC 50 ) suppression of AR, AR-V7 and Mnk1 protein express ion. CWR22Rv1 cells were seeded in 100 mm culture dishes and synchronized in phenol-red free media for 12 hours. Cells were treated with in creasing concentration of compounds (0.1 to 7.5 M) for 72 hours. Quantified protein ly sate was analyzed by immunoblot. AR, AR-V7 and Mnk1 protein expressions (Figure 111 A) w ere quantified by ImageJ software. EC 50 values for each protein were computed by a dose-ef fect plot (Figure 111 B), using graphpad prism. EC 50 values for all four compounds (gal, VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3) are represented in Figure 112. Although, the analogs were more potent than gal (wi th several folds lower GI 50 values), their AR EC 50 values were not significantly different (Figure 112 ). However, the analogs' EC 50 values for AR-V7 and Mnk1 were several folds lower than gal, 10 to 60 fold more efficacious in depleting protein expression of AR-V7 and Mnk1 (Figure 112). The ability of VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 to depleteMnk1 ex pression might be responsible for their activity in gal-resistant and AR-negative cel ls. 197 Figure 111: EC 50 values of gal/analogs on AR/AR-V7/Mnk1 protein expr ession. (A) Protein expression analysis AR, AR-V7 and Mn k1was performed in gal-treated CWR22Rv1 cells over a 72-hour time point. (B), Densitometry of pro tein bands were used in analysis of EC 50 values. Dose- effect curves were plotted using graph pad prism an d EC 50 values computed. Figure 112: EC 50 values for gal and analogs on AR, AR-V7 and Mnk1. Protein expression analysis was used in computing t he EC 50 values for all compounds on the indicated proteins. Western blot bands were quantified with I mageJ and values normalized to controls. Dose-respo nse curves were computed with graphpad prism and EC 50 values computed. Our observations show that the analogs depleted AR-V7 and Mnk1 more potently than gal. 198 We also analyzed the effects of these analogs on ce ll cycle proteins (Figure 113 A & B) and their ability to inhibit cell cycle progre ssion (Figure 114). Figure 113: Gal and its analogs deplete protein exp ression of cyclin D1. (A & B), Western blot analysis on Gal and analogs t reated cells, show a significant depletion of cycli n D1 protein expression in LNCaP cells. Figure 114: VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 inhibit cell cyc le progression. LNCaP cells synchronized for 12 hours in serum-free media were treated with 2.5 and 5 M of VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 and 20 M of gal, for 24 hours. Cell s were stained with propidium iodide and cell cycle phases analyzed. VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 exhibited a pproximately similar effects at 5 \u00b5M as gal at 20 \u00b5M. 199 Results from the cell cycle analysis, showed that b oth analogs arrested cells in the G1 phase, interestingly these effects were seen at low micromolar values, 8-fold less than the concentration of gal producing similar effects. These compelling results and activities, provide a strong rationale for the development and synthesis of the newer and more potent analogs to target mCRPC. Microarray analysis of gal-resistant CWR22Rv1 cells Protein expression and mRNA analysis that was perfo rmed on the gal-resistant cells barely scratched the surface of the enormous change s effected in the resistant cells. To better and fully appreciate the changes that have o ccurred in these cell lines, we collected mRNA in triplicates from CWR22Rv1 gal resistant cel ls and performed a genome wide human transcriptome array. We also treated gal-resistant cells VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3, for 72 hours to evaluate gene expression changes induced by the analogs. Figure 115 represen ts the schematic for developing the resistant cells and outline of microarray analysis. Microarray data showed that gene expression of the AR was markedly down-regulated mo re than 30-fold in resistant cells compared to parental, as was observed in qRT PCR an alysis (Figure 106). Several mesenchymal and metastatic markers were up-regulate d at the gene level in the resistant cells in comparison to the parental. Epithelial mar ker, E-cadherin, was significantly downregulated in gal-resistant cells. Several cytoc in metabolizing compounds were upregulated. Solute carriers involved in drug uptake (Thwaites & Anderson, 2011) and implicated in drug resistance were also noted to be modulated in gal-resistant cells. A recent study de monstrated that using Bestatin which is 200 a substrate for PEPT1 (SLC15A1) and PEPT2 (SLC15A2) decreased tumor growth after 4 weeks' oral administration (Nakanishi et al, 2000). In addition, many of these solute carriers are reported to transport anti-cancer agen ts (Badagnani et al, 2006) into cells and have been exploited in cancer therapy. A recent review went further to suggest the signifi cance of solute carriers in cancer stem cells and whether their expression could be ex ploited in targeting cancer stem cells (Nakanishi, 2007). A brief list of modulated genes ( RV1-P vs RV1- 124R-4.5 \u00b5M ) is in Table 11 and 12. The high expre ssion of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) ( 465 fold, Table 11 and Figure 116 ) in gal-resistant cells indicates the acquisition of a more metastatic char acteristic, MMP-1 implication in PC metastasis has (Pulukuri Rao, 2008) . Figure 115: Schematic for developing gal-resistant cells and Microarray analysis Parental cells were exposed to gal at incremental d oses until cells were able to survive at that conce ntration. Media containing increased doses of gal are replace d and cells continued to be sub-cultured until they develop resistance to that concentration. Cells were mainta ined in media containing compounds at indicated concentrations over several months. Gal-resistant c ells were also treated with analogs to determine po tential genomic changes induced by the analogs. 201 Table 11: Up-regulated genes in Galeterone-resistan t cells (RV1-124R-4.5 M vs RV1-P) Transcript Cluster ID Gene Name Fold Change FDR DIVISION CYCLE ASSOCIATED 7- LIKE -17.61 0.000023 TC07002222.hg.1 CAMP RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 5 -15 0.000185 TC01001645.hg.1 NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 5, GROUP A, RECEPTOR ant cells (RV1-124R-4.5 M vs RV1-P) 204 Figure 116: Gene expression analysis in gal-resista nt cells ( RV1-124R-4.5 M Vs RV1-P ).

Genes upregulated in gal-resistance (Red) compar ed to parental. And green indicates genes up-regulated in parental cell line in compared to gal-resistant cells. 205 Figure 117: Gene expression changes observed in gal -resistant cells treated with analogs Gene expression changes shows an overlap between ac tivities of analogs on modulated genes in gal-resis tant cells. Gene expression changes analyzed for the newer anal ogs, on gal-resistant cells (Figure 117) shows significant number of gene chang es. Most of these genomic changes overlapped between the treatments, suggesting that these analogs may infact use similar mechanism of actions in exhibiting their anti-cance r properties. Using the Ingenuity pathway analysis system, we obs erved that both VNPP414 (Table 13) and VNPP433-3 (Table 14) downregulated ALDH1L2 and solute carriers in gal-resistant cells. Further analysis may yield inv aluable insight into resistance-inducing mechanisms up-regulated in gal-resistant cells. Ant i-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2) up- regulated in gal-resistance lated the analogs. (ASNS) reported to be overexpressed in C RPC and implicated in disease progression to therapy-resistant state was downregu lated by both VNPP414 and VNPP433- 206 3 (Table 13 and 14). Infact a study utilizing ASNS inhibitors significantly decreased tumor xenograft growth and inhibited cancer cell pr oliferation (Sircar et al, 2012) Table 13: Gene expression changes induced by VNPP41 4 at 5 M in gal-resistant cells 207 Table 14: Gene expression changes induced by VNPP43 3-3 in gal-resistant cells It will be very interesting to fully analyze gene e xpression changes induced by the analogs. We observed that in Figure 117, in additio n to modulation of a significant number of genes by the analogs in gal-resistant cells, qui te a number of these modulated genes overlapped between treatments. This may be another indication that these analogs possess a similar mode of action, however this similarity d id not cause cross-resistance between gal and analogs. Clearly there is the need to study the activities of these compounds extensively and they may be promising anti-cancer a gents, which gives insight to mode of actions of agents due to structural modifications. 208 Summary and Discussion of Specific Aim 2b In recent years, treatment options for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer have expanded with the approval of therapeutic agen ts, such as abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel. The sequence of administration of these drugs and optimal doses becomes very important because of the need to consider toxi city and also the reported cross resistance between these drugs. An ongoing clinical study is investigating the utility of combining enzalutamide and docetaxel in mCRPC. A pr evious study which compared the efficacy of enzalutamide and docetaxel in mCRPC sho wed that patient response, to drugs, were not significantly different (Suzman et al, 201 4). Cross-resistance between the taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and the AR targeting ag ents (abiraterone and enzalutamide) was related to their mode of action, modulating AR signaling at different points in the pathway (van Soest et al, 2013). However, in spite of the efficacies of all these therapeutic agents, resistance is constantly being reported. Wi th the emergence of splice variant ARs, overexpression of (docetaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide), there still exists t he need to discover more potent agents for prostate cancer treatment. Published work and ongoi ng clinical trials implicate the significance of autophagy and the efficacy of autop hagy inhibitors in prostate cancer treatment. In this section of the current study we focused on evaluating the efficacies of ARDAs on docetaxel/mitoxantrone/enzalutamide resist ant cells and also determined the impact of combining approved FDA drugs, with ARDAs. We envisaged that the multi- target effects of ARDAs would play a critical role in impeding resistance induced by these compounds. 209 Protein expression analysis showed that gal and VNP P433-3 did infact deplete Mnk1 and BMI-1 protein levels in docetaxel-resistan t cells. These agents exhibited high efficacy in anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive activities. Surprisingly, although neither enzalutamide nor abiraterone have exhibited any effects on EMT markers, they showed considerable anti-invasive properties i n drug-na\u00efve CWR22Rv1 cells. Autophagy inhibitor Chloroquine showed modest inhib itory effects with surprisingly low GI 50 values and higher efficacy in drug-resistant cells than enzalutamide. It was also very interesting that abiraterone was more efficacious i n inhibiting docetaxel-resistant cell growth than enzalutamide. This further re-emphasize s the idea that agents exhibit multiple properties as opposed to the activity on a specific target for which they were designed to inhibit. Combination assays with ARDAs, docetaxel, chloroqui ne and enzalutamide yielded very interesting results. Perhaps the most compelling result for our group was the fact that gal combined with enzalutamide showed hig h synergy in drug-resistant cells as opposed to modest synergy in drug-na\u00efve cells. This suggests that factors implicated in enzalutamide resistance are antagonized by gal henc e sensitizing the cells further. At high doses gal and VNPP433-3 synergized with either chl oroquine or docetaxel in inhibiting cell viability and growth of both drug-na\u00efve/resist ant cells. These activities need further investigation and can be appropriately exploited in combination therapeutics for metastatic castration resistance prostate cancer. Considering that cancer cells become resistant to a gents used in therapy, we developed gal-resistant cells to help better unders tand potential resistant mechanisms and also develop counteracting measures. Our investigat ion of gal-resistant cells revealed very 210 interesting data that can be utilized in the design and development of next generation ARDAs. The fact that cross-resistance is nonexisten t between the 1 st generation and 2 nd generation ARDAs, with the latter exhibiting strong efficacy in gal-resistant cell, provides a strong rationale for their further development. O bviously from the microarray data, we note that a number of pathways are up-regulated and the resistant cells also acquire a more metastatic potential, both genotypically and phenot ypically. proteins and detoxifying genes were all up-regulated. Solute carriers which have been reported to be involved in steroid molecules t ransport and also in their resistance were also up-regulated. Anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2), transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFRII) may contribute to resistance to gal, howe ver, overexpression of these pathways did not cause resistance to the analogs. Depletion and possible silencing of the AR gives fu rther information about what might occur in the clinic. The fact that AR could b e reactivated in these cells could give an indication of what treatment schedule to apply. On- going studies seek to evaluate whether the emergence of a novel AR splice variant in gal-r esistant CWR22Rv1 could be a potential pivotal point for the action of gal analogs. Doceta xel resistant PC cells have been shown to express less AR and the use of anti-androgen the rapy was efficacious. To determine whether gal-resistant cells would be susceptible to enzalutamide or abiraterone therapy, we conducted MTT cell viability assays in gal-resistan t cells. Both drugs exhibited high GI 50 values not worthy of further analysis, this was exp ected because of depletion of AR. Observing that there was considerable increase in a utophagic response, we treated the resistant cells with chloroquine and the GI 50 values were high. Interestingly, autophagy 211 related 16-like (Atg-16) was up-regulated at the ge ne level, observed in the microarray analysis, this may be responsible for the high expr ession of LC3-I/II observed in the western blot analysis (see Figure 105). Though preliminary, our data gives an idea of what to expect and what might work. However, from these results, it can be assumed that gal and its analogs have the capability, clearly, to destabilize resistance and re-sensitize cells to therapeutic agents. Further work on these resistant cells, supported by the microarr ay data needs to be addressed to fully appreciate the potential of gal and analogs and the ir possible applications. Future Directions Following the profound activities of gal and its an alogs on docetaxel/mitoxantrone and enzalutamide resistant cells, future studies wi ll aim at determining their potencies in vivo . Docetaxel-resistant cells may be used to develop xenograft models to test these compounds, comparing them to efficacies of enzaluta mide and abiraterone. In order to reduce toxicity and potential resistance, several c ombination studies were investigated in vitro. We intend to perform further studies to evaluate g al's ability to either potentiate or synergize with enzalutamide, microarray analysis on gal-resistant cells reve aled effects on multiple genes that modulate metastasis and stem cell characterist ics. In RV1-124R-14 \u00b5M gal-resistant cells we observed emergence of a novel splice varia nt with a molecular weight between 80 and 110 kDa. This variant of the androgen receptor may not have been identified previously. However, since this isoform emerged aft er 24 months of gal treatment, we will 212 seek to clone and characterize this variant. We als o intend to determine whether the 1 st and 2 nd generation ARDAs exhibit any effect on this \"novel \" AR splice variant. Rigorous analyses of the microarray data will help us unders tand the potential mechanisms of gal- resistance which would likely benefit clinical use of gal. Specific Aim 3: Determine the anti-tumor efficacy of ARDAs in a clinically relevant CRPC model. Evaluating the MTD of VNPP433-3 Acute Dosing The parental compound, gal, has shown little to no toxicity, considering that VNPP433-3 is several fold more potent with sub-mic romolar GI 50 values. We found it necessary to evaluate its MTD and toxicity, in orde r to determine whether it was beneficial to further its development both in vitro and in vivo . We performed an acute dosing, where male nude mice were injected once with 25, 50 and 1 00 mg/kg body weight of VNPP433- 3 formulated in -cyclodextrin, and observed for t wo weeks. Considering the efficacy of VNPP433-3 in vitro and the fact that it is several fold efficacious th an gal, we decided to use 100 mg/kg body weight as the highest dose. Body weights were taken twice a week and animals examined for any adverse effects (inact ivity, skin changes, bleeding). One of the three mice died in the 100 mg/kg group on the s econd day after injections. The rest of the animal in groups 25 and 50 mg/kg did not exhibi t any signs of toxicity. From the overall average body weights and physical appearance of mic e there were no apparent toxicities from the treatment (Figure 118). 213 Figure 118: Mean body weights of mice treated with one bolus of VNPP433-3. Nude mice were grouped with three mice per dose. Bo dy weights were taken on the first day of injection and subsequently on indicated days. Body weights were a veraged and compared. At the end of the study there was no significant change in body weight Chronic Dosing Results from the acute dosing indicated that 100 mg /kg body weight of VNPP433- 3 was tolerated well by the two mice in that group . Hence we decided to use 100 mg/kg as the maximum tolerable dose for the next phase in determining the viable dose for in vivo studies. We then performed a chronic dosing adminis tering 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 MTD, five days a week for two weeks. Body weights were taken as before, twice a week and any adverse conditions noted (Figure 119). After 14 day s, the experiment was terminated and animals sacrificed. Two mice died in the 0.5 MTD gr oup on day 7. All other groups looked healthy, including the lone mice in group 0.5 MTD. Based on the acute and chronic dosing results, we estimate that the MTD for VNPP433-3 in nude mice is approximately between 25-50 mg/kg body weight. However, more rigorous tox icology studies are required to characterize VNPP433-3 adverse effects. 214 Figure 119: Mean body weight of mice after chronic dosing. Nude mice were grouped with three mice per dose. Bo dy weights were taken on the first day of injection and subsequently on indicated days. Body weights were a veraged and compared. 100 mg/kg treated mouse showed a significant decrease in body weight after two observed mortalities. Gal and VNPT55 suppress CWR22Rv1 xenograft tumor gr owth . Gal is currently in clinical development for the tr eatment of CRPC. Because splice variant AR-V7 plays a significant role in castratio n resistance, we further evaluated the efficacy of gal and VNPT55 in CRPC AR-V7 positive C WR22Rv1 xenografts. Male SCID mice were castrated and allowed to heal and assigne d into three groups of five per cage; mice were treated with gal or VNPT55 twice daily, 5 days/week ( schematic , Figure 120). Cells inoculated on flanks of mice after castration grew into sizeable tumors even with complete ADT. Castrated male SCID mice bearing CWR2 2Rv1 tumors were treated with vehicle, gal or VNPT55 for 34 days as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure 121, gal and VNPT55 significantly inhibited CWR22Rv1 tumor growth by 60% (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle) and 70% (p < 0.0001 vs. vehicle), respectively. Body weights taken once a week were analyzed to determine if there wer e any changes. Interestingly, no host toxicity was observed as monitored by changes in bo dy weight throughout the study 215 (Figure 122). The H & E staining of liver, lung and kidney in the treated groups did not show any gross organ abnormalities on histological examinations (Figure 123). Figure 120: Schematic for PC in vivo study design using CWR22Rv1 xenograft. Castrated SCID mice were put into three groups with five mice per group. Animals were dosed twice a da y with vehicle, gal or VNPT55. Body weights were meas ured every week during the course of the study. Figure 121: Gal/VNPT55 inhibit the growth of CWR22R v1 xenografts. Representative tumors from the 2 groups. Effect of gal and VNPT55 was evaluated in castrated CWR22Rv1 xenograft-bearing mice. Mice (n = 5) were administe red with gal (0.15 mmol/kg/twice daily) and VNPT55 (0.15 mmol/kg/twice daily), by intraperitoneal inje ction, 5 days per week for 34 days. Tumors were mea sured twice a week. 216 Figure 122: Body weights of mice show no host toxic ity.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining of normal organs, fo rmalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissues to show in vivo and off-target toxicity or not of compounds To further validate the anti-prostate cancer activi ties of gal and VNPT55 seen in vitro ; we evaluated the expression levels of fAR, AR-V7 and cell cycle and apoptosis- 217 related proteins in vivo using representative tumor samples. Immunohistoche mistry analysis with anti-fAR and AR-V7 antibody on tumors showed that gal and VNPT55, significantly reduced intensities and expressions o f fAR and AR-V7 in treated samples (Figure 124 A) In addition, a significant decrease in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was observed in gal and VNPT 55 treated tumors, suggesting the inhibitory effects on cell cycle in vivo (Figure 124 A). Immunohistochemical stain quantification of Figure 124 A shows a significant decrease in protein expression in vivo (Figure 124 B). Figure 124: Protein expression analysis in Gal and VNPT55 tumor sections. (A) Representative images of full length AR, AR-V7 and PCNA immunostaining in vehicle and treated groups. (B) ImageJ was used to quantify Immunohisto chemical staining in A. 218 Western blot analysis further confirmed that gal an d VNPT55 degrade both fAR and AR-V7 in the tumors. As shown in Figure 125 A, both agents caused significant depletion of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 and a concomitant increase in Bax expression, indicating induction of apoptosis in analysis of fAR, AR-V7 and cyclin D1 protein expression in two representative tumors in the treatment groups and the vehicle treated group are represented in Figure 125 B. Take n together, these data show that gal and VNPT55 suppress the growth of CRPC xenograft tumors in complete androgen-deprived conditions possibly via depleting expression of bot h fAR, its constitutively-active splice variant, AR-V7, in addition to inducing significant apoptosis of tumor cells. Gal and VNPT55 downregulate expression of Mnk1/2 an d BMI-1 in vivo Effects seen in vitro are not necessarily observed in vivo as seen with ERSR markers in LAPC4 xenografts. Therefore, we found it necessary to determine whether effects seen on the translation machinery would be recapitulated in vivo. Tumor sections from xenografts studies, were stained with Mnk1/2, peIF4E, Slug and BMI-1 antibodies to determine whether effects seen on these markers occ urs in vivo as well. Representative tumors from gal and VNPT55 treated groups were minc ed, lysed and used in immunoblot analysis. It was interesting to observe that -Cate nin, Mnk1/2, and BMI-1 were downregulated in vivo in both treated groups compared to vehicle treated controls (Figure 126 A & B). Analysis of westerns by densitometry sh ows a marked downregulation of expression of indicated proteins (Figure 127). Stai ning of parafinised sections of xenografts also confirmed observations with western blot analy sis (Figure 128 & 129). 219 Figure 125: Densitometry of Protein expression in v ivo. (A), Xenograft tumor tissues were harvested and ana lyzed by western blotting. Effects on fAR, AR-V7, cyclin D1, Bcl2 and Bax were analyzed in both gal a nd VNPT55 groups compared to controls. B, Densitometry analysis of protein expression from we stern blot analysis was plotted to quantify the eff ects seen in vivo . Western blot analysis was performed on at least 3 different tumors from the same groups and compared to controls. Results indicate a significan t downregulation of protein expression in vivo (*p<0.05, **p<0.001) 220 Figure 126: Gal and VNPT55 downregulate cell f actors and Mnk1 /2 expression vivo. Protein expression of -Catenin, Mnk1/2, BMI-1 and Oct-4 were analyzed in Gal (A) and VNPT55 (B) treated groups by western blot. This shows that eff ects seen on expression of indicated protein in vitro were also observed in vivo. Figure 127: Protein quantification of analyzed prot eins in vivo. Densitometry analysis of protein expression from we stern blot analysis, in Figure 12, was plotted to q uantify the effects seen in vivo. Immunoblot analysis was performed in at least 3 re presentative tumors. 221 Figure 128: Immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression on in vivo parafinised images of Mnk1/2, BMI-1, Slug IF4E immunostaining in vehicle and Parafinised tumor sections were stained with Mnk1/2 BMI-1, Slug and peIF4E antibodies following protoc ol in materials and methods. Both gal and VNPT55 show strong depletion effects on Mnk1/2, peIF4E, BMI-1 and Slug. Figure 129: in Figur e 125. IHC staining in Figure 128 were quantified using th e ImageJ software and represented as a bar chart. I mages were taken from 4 different quadrants in 3 replicat es. Quantification shows that BMI-1 expression was significantly downregulated. 222 Summary and Discussion of Specific Aim 3 Perhaps the most significant piece of data from thi s study is the anti-tumor efficacy of gal and VNPT55 Gal/VNPT55 significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to vehicle treated groups, with no apparent host toxicity. Gal and VNPT55 also degraded both fAR, AR-V7 in vivo and also depleted cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, but enhance d the level of Bax. In strong support of their mechanisms of anti-tumor ac tivities, most effects seen in vitro were recapitulated in vivo. Perhaps, most importantly is to determine whether t hese effects observed in vitro can be repeated in vivo . From our previous publication, using CWR22Rv1 xen ografts in a CRPC model, gal and VNPT55 exhibited anti-tumor eff icacies by inhibiting tumor growth and also depleting protein expression of AR/AR-V7. Here we used tumor sections from that study and evaluated whether gal and VNPT55 had any significant effect on Mnk1/2, peIF4E, BMI-1 and -Catenin. Interestingly we obser ved modest depletion of -Catenin and substantial loss in protein expression of Mnk1/ 2 and BMI-1 in both treated groups. Immunohistochemical staining of Mnk1/2 and BMI1 als o confirmed these effects seen in vitro. Both Gal and VNPT55 have shown minimal to no toxici ty in vivo and in fact this is exemplified by the current dose that's being use d in the clinic for therapeutic purposes. Galeterone is currently dosed at 2550 mg per day, a lthough current formulation strategies might allow for this and proper formulation may dec rease the efficacious dose used, it gives a clear indication of the low toxicity of the compo unds. In the in vivo study, we also observed that at comparative doses, VNPT55 showed n o toxicity and was more efficacious 223 in inhibiting xenograft growth. Since the character istics of VNPT55 gives an indication that it might cleave in vivo to gal, this could be a viable option for a prodru g that possibly might use lower doses in treating metastatic castra tion resistant prostate cancer. These observations in addition to its low toxicity suggests that, gal and VNPT55 characterized properly will enhance their potential application in therapy Future Directions Putative stem cells have been implicated in drug-re sistance. Thus, our next series of in vivo studies will be to isolate stem cell populations a nd develop xenograft models to test anti-tumor activities of gal and its analogs. Chapter 5: The Pancreas: Structure and Function The pancreas (Figure 130) is a long slender organ w eighing about 80 g in a healthy adult human and is located posterior to the bottom half of the stomach. The pancreas consists of two glands intimately connected togethe r, an endocrine (Islets) of Langerhans) and an exocrine (acinar and duct tissue) component that are involved in several processes in maintaining homeostasis in the body. The pancrea s is enervated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The pancreas is st imulated by both these systems, the vagus nerve with originates from the dorsal vagal c omplex of the brain is connected to the efferent parasympathetic system. The celiac and sup erior mesenteric arteries supply blood to the pancreas and the splenic vein and the superi or mesenteric vein drains the blood from the pancreas into the portal vein. 224 Figure 130: Structure of the Pancreas Human pancreas showing the different types of pancr eatic cells and blood vessel enervation. Micrograph shows pancreatic islet depicting alpha, beta and ex ocrine acinus cells. Image modified from micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan M edical School \u00a9 2012. http://philschatz.com/anatomy - book/contents/m46685.html The endocrine and exocrine tissues of the pancreas are connected by blood vessels and capillaries surrounding the islets before enter ing the general circulation (Ballian & Brunicardi, 2007).. The islet of Langerhans produce s hormones that include insulin, amylin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polyp eptide. Studies have not been able to fully delineate the role of all these hormones, how ever, the acinar cells of the pancreas have been reported to express insulin receptors that are involved in regulation of digestive enzyme synthesis of the exocrine pancreas (Korc et al, 1981; Sankaran et al, 1981). The exocrine component of the pancreas is mainly in volved secreting enzymes that aid in the digestion of food. The exocrine cells re lease these enzymes into pancreatic ducts that run along the body of the pancreas, these in t urn are released in the duodenum. The 225 acinar cells of the pancreas are mainly involved in the synthesis of digestive enzymes and have the greatest rate of protein synthesis of any mammalian organ. The endocrine compartment of the pancreas is mainly involved in producing hormones necessary for regulating blood sugar level s in the body. The islets of Langerhans consist of four different types of cells: the alpha cells, Beta cells, delta cells and PP cells (pancreatic polypeptide producing cells). Diseases of the Pancreas Disorders that affect the pancreas include pancrea titis, precancerous is characterized by inflammation of th e pancreas, and this occurs when digestive enzymes start acting on the pancreas itse lf. This can either be an acute or chronic problem. Pancreatic cancer Pancreatic cancer (PAC) is one of the most intracta ble malignant neoplasms with the worst prognosis and mortality rate approaching 99%. The most common type of the cancer accounting for 85% of the disease is the ade nocarcinoma (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC), which originates from the du ct cells in exocrine component of the pancreas. The neuroendocrine disease forms a mi nor part of the disease and arises from the islet cells. These tumors uncommon and reported cases average 1000 per year in the United States. Currently, Pancreatic ductal adenoca rcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading 226 cause of cancer related death in the United States (both male and females) (Niederhuber et al, 1995). Almost 80-90% of patients diagnosed pres ent with the metastatic disease and in 2013, incidence of PDAC incidence was estimated at 45,220 cases out of which 38,460 were fatal. Despite attempts of resection and adjuv ant therapy patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to have poor prognosis. The overall 5-year survival rate for PAC is not that promising as it averages 6%. This poor survival rate can be attributed to the innumerable mutations presented with the disease, a bsence or inappropriate early detection biomarkers, the desmoplastic stroma characteristic of pancreatic cancer, which hinders drug delivery (Chu et al, 2007; Mahadevan & Von Hof f, 2007) and high resistance to available therapy. Currently, there is no efficacio us treatment for pancreatic cancer. Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy hav e shown only limited success in improving patient survival. A novel treatment to in hibit cancer cell proliferation with less toxicity is quintessential. Pancreatic cancer disease progression, just as any other cancer, is accompanied by an accumulation of activation and inactivation muta tions that enhances cellular proliferation, disease metastasis and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. KRAS oncogene mutation is expressed in 90% of the tumors , maintained in its activated form and constitutively activating the RAF-MAPK pathway. Nin ety-five percent (95%) inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene, which results in the loss of the p16 protein. The tumor suppressor p53, which impedes cells from bypassing DNA damage and a ctivates proapoptotic signals, is mutated in approximately 50-75% of Pancreatic cance r tumors (Maitra & Hruban, 2008). The deleted in pancreatic cancer 4 (DPC4/SMAD4) gen e (Feldmann et al, 2007), mutated 227 and inactive in about 50% of pancreatic cancer caus es abnormal signaling of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF) surface rece ptors. Pancreatic stellate cells play a key role in the s troma that surrounds pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These stellate cells, when stimulat ed by growth factors, produce an abundance of collagen fibers which contribute to hy poxia in the tumor microenvironment (Erkan et al, 2009; Masamune & Shimosegawa, 2009). Stromal cells have been shown to interact with the epithelial cells (via paracrine s ignaling) inducing growth and migration of the malignant cells (Zhang et al, 2007). This strom al density has also been implicated in poor drug delivery, poor prognosis and resistance o f pancreatic cancer. They secrete cytokines and overexpress proteins cysteine-rich) and a very active hedgehog pathway which have all been positiv ely correlated with resistance to conventional therapy (Infante et al, 2007; Mukherje e et al, 2009). Current therapy for pancreatic cancer Since its approval in 1996, gemcitabine (a nucleos ide analog) has been established as standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cance r treatment. Gemcitabine therapy is at best modest, (Neesse et al, 2011) and this is part ly due to the dense desmoplasia and acquired resistance. Clinical trials combining seve ral FDA approved drugs with gemcitabine to sensitize pancreatic tumors have bee n conducted (Vaccaro et al, 2011). A number of these drugs' mechanism of action is to in crease perfusion or retention of drugs in the tumor, resulting in a potentiated effect of gemcitabine. Gemcitabine treatment however, reportedly increases activation of the NF- B signaling pathway. Gemcitabine treatment also induces the expression of a constitu tively active splice variant Mitogen phosphorylates eIF4E. EIF4E phosphorylation is know n to be a critical step in the activation of oncogenic protein translation machine ry. Although gemcitabine treatment in the clinic impro ves overall median survival, it remains hardly beneficial and more robust combinati on chemotherapies or novel inhibitors are needed to target the metastatic potential of pa ncreatic cancer. Phase II and III studies investigating combination of gemcitabine and plat inum analogs and irinotecan did not show any significantly improved therapeutic respons e (Rocha Lima et al, 2004; Stathopoulos et al, 2006). Some modest benefit was shown by capecitabine in combination with gemcitabine. FOLFIRINOX a combination of drugs (5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxalipatin) has been used as first-line treatment a nd although it showed increased patient survival, the toxicity and side effects were report ed to be intolerable (Conroy et al, 2011). Currently, erlotinib is the only agent that has sho wn some statistical significance and benefits in improvement to therapy when combined wi th gemcitabine. Following presentation of data from the FOLFIRINOX study, th e interest arose to investigate potentially efficacious combination strategies wit h drugs that were not gemcitabine based (Vaccaro et al, 2011). Several other studies evalua ted polychemotherapy regimens where 3-4 cytotoxic agents were combined with gemcitabine , these yielded promising results where the regimens were more efficacious than gemci tabine alone (Reni et al, 2005). Growing evidence implicated the significance of th e dense stroma surrounding pancreatic adenocarcinoma in drug resis tance. These concerns prompted studies that were directed at increasing the concen tration of active gemcitabine alone, in the tumors. Studies in murine pancreatic cancer tum ors, however, failed to show significant 229 responses resulting from the increase of tumoral g emcitabine (Neesse et al, 2013). In another study nab-paclitaxel (which reduces cytidin e aminase levels) in combination with gemcitabine showed improved tumor regression in mou se pancreatic cancer disease (Frese et al, 2012). Nab-paclitaxel (an albumin bound drug ) acts by depleting the stromal tissue which resulted in a significantly enhanced intratum oral gemcitabine concentration. The activities of pancreatic stellate cells surroun ding PDAC results in poor vascularization and increased tumor microenvironmen t hypoxia, which can induce several alterations leading to a metastatic transition. Inc identally, these stellate cells also regulate the stroma turnover and can serve as potential drug targets. This dense desmoplastic stroma has been reported to be largely responsible for imp aired drug delivery and drug-resistance exhibited by pancreatic cancer tumors during chemot herapy (Neesse et al, 2011). Combination Therapy in PAC/PDAC Targeting multiple pathways to decrease resistance and enhance efficacy, has shown great potential. Aggressiveness and resistanc e of cancer cells are attributed to aberrant signaling of several kinase pathways such These kinase pathways death. NF-B poss esses anti-apoptotic, proliferative, motility and invasive promoting properties (Cao & K arin, 2003); it is also well known to induce genes such as cyclin D1 and urokinase-type p lasminogen activation (uPA). Gene amplification such as Akt2 has also been detected i n 10-20% of pancreatic cancer tumors. Studies have shown that Akt phosphorylation can cau se activation of NF-B, MAPK and the wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signali ng pathways. Akt activation serves to impact by phosphorylating FOXO3A whic h then inactivates pro-apoptotic 230 proteins like and p27. Other apoptotic proteins , Bad and caspase 9, are also inhibited by Akt phosphorylation. Current investigational therapeutic strategies are evaluating dual inhibition of PI3k pathway in combination with other inhibitors, to re tard tumor growth. Preclinical evaluation of dual PI3k/mTOR inhibitor and pan-hist one deactelyase inhibitor (NVP- anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl- cyanidin non-toxic phytochemical, exhibit wn-regulating cyclin B1, Bcl-2, and PI3k subunit 110 and 85 in vitro and in xenograft models. These phytochemicals also induce apoptosis in PDAC cells in vitro (Prasad et al, 2012). Rapalogs (Rapamycin and its analogs) is approved by the FDA for the treatment o f pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Wander et al, 2011), however, this class of compou nds are not very efficacious in treating PDAC (Wolpin et al, 2009). Deregulation of translation initiation control is a very critical oncogenic step in cancer progression. Abnormal signaling of the PI3k/ mTOR and MAPK pathways reported in pancreatic adenocarcinoma also crosstalk with ke y components of the translation initiation complex (Figure 131) (Bhaskar & Hay, 200 7). MTOR directly phosphorylates initiation protein thereby releasing its inhibitory effects on the com plex and enhancing the rate of protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases its i nhibitory effect on eIF4E which then induces the formation of the translation complex. M itogen activated protein kinase interacting kinase 1/2 (Mnk1/2), phosphorylates eIF 4E preceding the of the 231 eIF4F complex. Mnk1 a serine/threonine kinase and p38 MAP kinase (Figure 130). Normal pancreatic cells are reported to express the highest levels of 4E-BP1 (Tsukiyama-Kohara et al, 2001; Tsukiyama-Kohara et al, 1996), however, this expression level is significantly reduced in the early stages of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Martineau et al, 2013). Incidentall y eIF4E which promotes tumor formation is overexpressed in many human tumors inc luding pancreatic cancer. The formation of the complex enhances the translation o f anti-apoptotic proteins (MCL-1 and Bcl-2) (Wendel et al, 2007) and proliferation promo ting proteins such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1 (Hsieh et al, 2010; Hsieh et al, 2011; Mendoza e t al, 2011). Reports on 4E-BP1 expression in pancreatic tumors showed that more th an 50% of PDAC lacks the protein, which contributes to resistance to Rapalogs. Transc ription factor SMAD4 reportedly, directly activates the 4E-BP1 gene (Azar et al, 200 9). The function of SMAD4 in PDAC has been associated with TGF signaling exerting pr otective functions on duct cells and inhibiting cell growth. In trying to correlate SMAD 4 levels to 4E-BP1 in different human pancreatic lesions, there seems to be a positive re lationship. The gene encoding 4E-BP1 is neither deleted nor mutated in pancreatic cancer (B iankin et al, 2012), further studies also show that the gene is not silenced (Martineau et al , 2013). Authors from this study concluded that the only possible explanation for 4E -BP1 loss would be the deactivation of SMAD4. Drug design and development for inhibitors t argeting the Mnk1/eIF4E axis and kinase activity of Mnks are actively under investig ation for the treatment of several cancers (Furic et al, 2010; Oyarzabal et al, 2010; Schalm e t al, 2010). 232 Figure 131: Role of eIF4E in cancer therapy and tra nslation oncogenic mRNAs The PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway and MAPK pathways conve rge on the translation complex. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway releases its inhibitory effec t on the Mnk-eIF4E by then dissociates from eIF4E.The pathway activates the translation complex by phosphorylatin g Mnk1/2 which in turn phosphorylates eIF4E. This lea ds to the assembly of the eIF4F (eIF4E, rate-limiting step in the formation of th e complex to initiate translation of proteins. Image modified from Hay et al,2010, to show prime targets of investigational efforts including targets of gal an d analogs(Hay, 2010) PDAC is characterized by a high metastatic potentia l enhanced by cancer cell- stroma interactions. MMPs play a pivotal role in ca ncer cell invasion and metastasis and is up-regulated in invading cancer cells. Overexpressi on of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been implicated in cancer progression (Dimberg et a l, 1999; Khuri et al, 2001; Ladetto et al, 2005; Liu et al, 2001; Park et al, 2009; Shirah ama & Sakakura, 2001) and is overexpressed in (Okami et al, 1999; Tucker et al, 1999; Yip-Schneider et al, 2000). Studies have shown a strong positive correlation be tween MMP-9 and COX-2 expression (Bu et al, 2011). Pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) also express a high level of COX-2 in comparison to pancreatic cancer cells. A study by Pelham et al. in 2005 showed that conditioned media 233 from pancreatic cancer cells increased COX-2 as wel l as growth of PSC (Yoshida et al, 2005). The activities of PSC results in the desmop lastic tissue reaction surrounding pancreatic tumors (Yen et al, 2002). In 2005, Adria n et al . in their experiments confirmed the dependence of PSC growth on COX-2, also charact erizing a direct crosstalk between the MAPK pathway and COX-2. The involvement of STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) in tumor cell transform ation, survival, invasion and metastasis is well established (Germain & Frank, 2007). Interl eukin-6 (IL-6) which induces the phosphorylation of MAPK and is upstream of JAK/STAT 3 is reported to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer patients (Noh et al, 2006). Chemotherapeutic agents directed at disrupting the integrity of tumor microenvironments enhance drug delivery of chemo-ag ents and can also sensitize tumor cells to the drugs. One significant pathway that is up-regulated in pancreatic stromal cells is the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, and several st rategies has targeted this pathway to augment gemcitabine drug delivery (Olive et al, 200 9). An example of an agent used is a Cyclopamine derivative, IPI-926, which targets and deplete stromal cells, resulting in increased active gemcitabine levels in tumors (Oliv e et al, 2009). Another stromal target which is extensively expressed in the extracellular matrix is glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). Its expression causes constriction of blood vessels. A study by two groups, showed that significant degradation of HA b y PEGPH20 increased tumor perfusion, which resulted in an enhanced delivery o f chemo-agents without increasing tumor volumes (Jacobetz et al, 2013; Provenzano et al, 2012). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is expressed in both stromal and panc reatic cancer cells and causes the characteristic PSC-mediated fibrogenesis typical of the stromal region of pancreatic 234 cancers. Studies have shown that, inhibiting CTGF, enhanced drug delivery to the tumors. Their study also suggested that inhibiting stroma-t umor interactions in addition to increasing intra-tumoral drug concentrations may pl ay a pivotal role in pancreatic cancer therapy. Pancreatic cancer Specific Aims Gemcitabine (Gemzar), is currently used as first-li ne chemotherapy standard care for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and ha s been in use since 1997 (Burris et al, 1997). Gemcitabine is also used as adjuvant therapy after surgery and tumors have been resected. Although, gemcitabine is initially potent and efficacious, this drug induces resistance in pancreatic cancer cells via upregulat ion of the Akt and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) pathways (Banerjee et al, 2005). The over active MAPK pathway in pancreatic cancer has also been associated with overexpression of neuropilin-1 (Wey et al, 2005). Several investigational agents are under investigat ion as monotherapy or evaluated in combinatorial strategies to combat drug resistance. The rationale behind combining several drugs also stems from the inability to target pancr eatic cancer tumor cells due to the dense and poorly vascularized stroma characterized by the disease. The objective of this study is to investigate the p otential development of a novel class of compounds (ARDAs) to be used as either sin gle-agent therapy and or combination therapy with gemcitabine in both gemcitabine-na\u00efve and gemcitabine-resistance PDAC cells. Androgen Receptor Degradation Agents (ARDAs) have shown potential in vitro , for targeting multiple oncogenic pathways, inhibiting c ancer cell growth and migration. Studies with prostate cancer xenograft models have also shown antitumor activities of these ARDAs. Analogs of the parent compound, gal, have sh own increased potencies and 235 minimal toxicity in vitro and in vivo . The efficacies of these ARDAs will be investigate d on pancreatic cancer cell growth, tumor burden, red uction and migration/invasion inhibition. The overall hypothesis for this work: Hypothesis Inhibitory effects of gal and it analogs on cell cy cle kinases, NF-B pathway and Mnk- eIF4E axis, will increase their efficacy in inhibit ing cell proliferation, migration and invasion and ultimately reduce PDAC tumor burden. S ince resistance to gemcitabine implicates that ARDAs will synergize with gemcitab ine in inhibiting proliferation of PDAC cells and tumors Specific Aim 4a: To evaluate the efficacy of ARDAs as anti-prolifera tive agents in vitro on pancreatic cancer cells. Hypothesis : ARDAs decrease pancreatic cancer cell viability an d inhibit cell growth by modulating key components in the cell cyc le and inducing caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. Strategy : \u0001 Determine the effects by MTT 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium br omide assay.

Specific Aim 4b: To determine the effects of ARDAs on up-regulated a nd resistance- inducing signaling cells and metas tatic inducing protein EZH2 and whether these effects are significant enough to syn ergize with gemcitabine in inhibiting PDAC cell proliferation and tumor xenografts Hypothesis : ARDAs target Mnk-eIF4E axis and NF-B (p65) pathway to inhibit the high metastatic potential characteristic of dru g-na\u00efve and gemcitabine resistant PDAC cells.

Gal and novel analogs inhibit PDAC cell proliferati on Recent published studies from different groups have implicated the significance of the androgen receptor in pancreatic Greenway, 2000; et 2007). One such study used flu tamide as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in an in vivo study showing that flutamide exhibited strong anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer xenog rafts (Konduri et al, 2007). Another group also established a strong link between interl eukin-6 (IL-6) and the AR signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer (Okitsu et al, 2010). These and other reports prompted us to screen compounds designed and synthesized in our la b, that are known to degrade the AR and also exhibit inhibitory activities on multiple signaling pathways. We initially screened a list of ARDAs and novel re tinamides in different PDAC cells lines, MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-2 and S2-013. Cells w ere treated with 1 and 10 \u00b5M for duration of 8 days replacing the media and replenis hing compounds on the third day, comparing them to gemcitabine at same doses. We obs erved from this initial screen that the ARDAs at 10 \u00b5M acted as potent as gemcitabine i n decreasing cell viability (Figure 132) of MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-2 and S2-013 cells. We sel ected to use the ARDAs, because clearly they were more potent in inhibiting PDAC ce ll proliferation in vitro than the NRs. Our brief screen yielded four potential lead compo unds (Gal, VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3), to investigate and further charact erize in PDAC cells. Since pancreatic cancer has a high potential to develop resistance t o therapy and metastasize, our focus was 238 to develop these compounds (pre-clinically) for dru g-resistant and metastatic pancreatic cancer disease. Figure 132: Initial screen of gal, analogs and NRs in PDAC cell lines S2-013, MiaPaCa-2 and CaPan-2 cells were seeded at 2500 cells/well in a 96 well plate and treated with serially diluted compounds for 72 hours and media r eplenished with compounds for an additional 96 hour s. Cell viability was normalized to DMSO treated contr ols. We performed rigorous cell viability assays to det ermine GI 50 values of gal and its analog in drug-naive PDAC (MiaPaCa-2) (Figure ). cell viability assays showed and analogs inhibited PDAC cell prolif eration at low micromolar concentrations (0.15 to 7.08 \u00b5M) (Table 15). Reports have shown that gemcitabine treatment, indu ces phosphorylation of eIF4E (Adesso et al, 2013) and this may result in an enha nced translation of mRNAs involved in 239 PDAC tumor progression and metastasis. Depleting (Adesso et al, 2013; Robichaud et al, 2015). We hypothesized that gal and its analogs by depleting Mnk1/2 may possibly sensitize gemcitabine resistant PDAC cells to gemcitabine. He nce, PDAC cells were treated with ARDAs for three days and then subsequently treated with gemcitabine for an additional four days, analysis of GI 50 values of combined treated cells, compared to gemc itabine alone shows a significant (p<0.001) decrease in GI 50 values (Figure 134 and Table 16). Average fold decrease in GI 50 values observed in gemcitabine-na\u00efve and gemcitabin e-resistant PDAC cells ranged from 3.6 to 27.5 in gem-resistant and gem/erlotinib-resistant PDAC cells. Figure 133: Gal and its analogs show high efficacy in PDAC cell line MiaPaCa-2 Cells were seeded at 2500 cells/well in a 96 well p late and treated with serially diluted compounds fo r 72 hours and media replenished with compounds for an a dditional 96 hours.

Cell viability was normalized t o DMSO treated controls Figure 134: Gal/analogs sensitize drug-resistant PD AC with gemc itabine in MTT cell viability assays show a signifi cant decrease in GI 50 values (**p<0.001), when the two different classes of compounds are combined compared to gemcitabine alone 241 Table 16: Table showing GI 50 values from Figure 134. Sequential treatment with ARDAs then with gemcitabi ne in MTT cell viability assays shows a significant decrease in GI 50 values in gemcitabine-resistant and gemcitabine/er lotinib-resistant PDAC cells. Drug combinations have the potential of either incr ease or reduce toxicity, increase efficacy of therapeutic agents and reduce the abili ty of cancer cells to develop resistance. In PDAC treatment, it has already been shown that c urrent drug combinations cause considerably high toxicity to the patients, hence t he need to find potent low toxic compounds that can be combined with gemcitabine or used as single agent therapy. Here, we determined whether combining the ARDAs and gemci tabine at their respective GI 50 values, would result in synergistic anti-proliferat ive activities. It was interesting to observe that in gemcitabine-naive PDAC cells, combination o f ARDAs with gemcitabine did not show any significant synergy at low ED50 values, in contrast to weak synergy at ED90 (CI=0.8). However, gal-gemcitabine combination in g emcitabine-resistant PDAC cells, resulted in very low CI values indicating strong sy nergy (Figure 135 and Table 17), in gemcitabine-erlotinib resistant PDAC cells, VNPP433 -3 in combination with gemcitabine also showed strong synergy (Table 18). This provided a strong rationale for the continuous development of gal and its analogs, either as single agent therapy or in combination with gemcitabine, for treatment of all forms of PDAC 242 Figure 135: Gal and gemcitabine synergize to decrea se cell viability of gemcitabine- resistant PDAC cells Cell viability assays were conducted for gal and ge mcitabine individually and GI 50 values calculated. Compounds were subsequently combined at their GI 50 (constant ratio).

Gal and analogs induce G1 cell cycle arrest in PDAC As an initial effort to delineate, the mode of act ion of ARDAs in pancreatic cancer, we assessed their effects on cell cycle progression . CDC25 phosphatases have been reported as key regulators of the cell cycle and r ecent studies have shown their increased expression in cancer which correlates with patient outcome (Kristjansdottir & Rudolph, 2004). A previous study showed that CDC25B plays a significant role in pancreatic cancer progression and its mRNA was upregulated 7.5 fold i n PDAC cells compared to the normal pancreas. In that same study, CDC25B inhibitors sig nificantly inhibited PDAC cell growth (Guo et al, 2004). Gal, VNPP414, VNPP433-3 at 2.5 to 20 M, significantly induced cell cycle arrest. Indeed, contrary to gemcitabine where we observe an accumulation of cells in S phase in PDAC cells, gal and analogs caused signi ficant accumulation of cells in the G1 phase (Figures 136 & 137, MiaPaCa-2 and S2-VP10 ). 244 Figure 136: Gal and VNPP433-3, induce cell cycle a rrest in MiaPaCa-2 cells. MiaPaCa-2 cells synchronized for 12 hours in serum- free media were treated with 1, 2.5, 10 M of VNPP4 33- 3 and 20 M of gal, for 24 hours. Cells were stain ed with Propidium iodide and cell cycle phases anal yzed. Gal and analogs caused significant cell cycle arres t of MiaPaCa-2 cells at the G1 phase. Figure 137: Gal/analogs induce cell cycle arrest in metastatic PDAC cells (S2-VP10) S2-VP10 cells synchronized for 12 hours in serum-fr ee media were treated with 5 M of Gal, VNPP414, VNPP433-3 and gemcitabine for 24 hours. Cells were stained with Propidium iodide and cell cycle phase s analyzed. Cell cycle arrest by gal and analogs also extended to cells derived metastatic lesions. 245 We also evaluated the effects of ARDAs on protein e xpression of cell cycle markers. We observed that gal, VNPT55, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 depleted protein expression of CDC25A (Figure. 138 A and B) Further immunoblot analysis showed that VNPP414, VNPP433-3 and VNPP397 at the indicated co ncentration, depleted cyclin D1 protein in MiaPaCa-2 cells VNPP397 downregulated cyclin D1, its effects on CDC25A was not significant. Studies have implicated the expression of the andro gen receptor (AR) in pancreatic cancer incidence and disease progression. Although, this remains debatable and other groups doubts its role, AR is expressed in some pan creatic cancer cells and in spite of the low levels in comparison to LNCaP cells, in vivo studies with anti-androgens have shown some modest efficacy (Konduri et al, 2007). Clinica l studies with flutamide showed modest efficacy and increased overall survival of t reated patients (Greenway, 2000). IL-6 induced PDAC cell migration also implicated AR sign aling and silencing AR inhibited PDAC cell migration (Okitsu et al, 2010). This sugg est that the expression of AR in some pancreatic cancer cells may play a critical and PDA C disease progression and metastasis. We therefore evaluated the effects of the ARDAs on AR expression in Panc-1 cells (Figure 138 C). Detectable AR expression was deplet ed by gal and VNPP414 and this might play a role in the anti-proliferative activit ies of ARDAs in PDAC cells expressing AR. Indeed, it is possible that the efficacies of a nti-androgens in pancreatic cancer disease therapy may be due to multiple or \"off-target\" effe cts of the agents. However, in the case of our ARDAs, previous studies show that these agen ts exhibit effects on multiple pathways, which possibly can be recapitulated in pa ncreatic cancer to explain their activities. These effects of the ARDAs suggests tha t investigational compounds or drugs 246 may not necessarily have \"off-target\" effects, sinc e small molecule inhibitors have the potential to affect multiple signaling pathways. Pe rhaps extensive characterization of compounds would enhance its rational use by elucida ting its potential efficacy or lack thereof and toxic profile based on its molecular bi ological activities. Deregulation of c-Myc has been reported to be commo n in the early stages of pancreatic cancer disease and its progression (Schl eger et al, 2002). A recent study also showed that gli2 induced overexpression of c-Myc is implicated in pancreatic cancer cell resistance to JQ1 and 1-BET151 (selective inhibitor s of BET bromodomain proteins) (Kumar et al, 2015). Figure 138: Protein expression analysis in PDAC aft er treatment with ARDAs. (A-C) PDAC cells were treated with 10 M of ARDAs f or 24 hours. Quantified protein lysates were analyz ed by immunoblot; effects on AR, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and CDC25A expression levels were detected with their respective antibodies. 247 Since c-Myc is implicated in proliferation of cance r cells, we analyzed the effects of ARDA on c-Myc protein expression. Immunoblot ana lysis revealed that gal and analogs decreased protein expression of c-Myc in S2-013 and Panc-1 cells (Figure 136 A and C), these effects may contribute to their anti-prolifer ative efficacies Gal and VNPP433-3 induce apoptosis in PDAC cells. One of the most desirable and crucial properties of anti-cancer agents is the ability of the inhibitors to induce apoptosis in cancer cel ls. Some compounds are known to be cytostatic (Rixe & Fojo, 2007; Sparreboom et al, 20 02) and have been implicated in the failure of therapy (Millar & Lynch, 2003).We determine in cells wit h compromised cell membrane. S2-013 cells were incubated with all four lead compounds, comparing their effects to that of gemcitabine at 2.5 \u00b5M for 72 hours. Stained cells s how apoptotic and necrotic cells at the indicated time point in all five treatment wells (F igure. 139 A). FACS analysis using MiaPaCa-GR cells treated with gal or VNPP433-3 at 5 and 10 \u00b5M for 24 hours showed significantly increased early and late apoptotic ce lls, superior to what was observed in gemcitabine treatment at 10 M (Figure 139 B). Here , our observations show that although, gemcitabine induces cell death in gemcitabine-resis tant cell, ARDAs are more proficient in apoptotic induction in these drug-resistant cell s. 248 Figure 139: Gal and analogs induce significant apop tosis in PDAC cells in vitro. (A), Gal and analogs induce apoptosis in S2-013 cel ls analyzed by acridine orange ethidium bromide sta ining. Cells were treated with 2.5 M for 72 hours. Arrows next to L indicate live cells; arrows pointing to A indicate apoptotic cells; and arrows pointing N ind icate necrotic cells (B) Gal and VNPP433-3 were compared to gemcitabine in inducing apoptosis analy zed by flow cytometry. Cells treated with both compounds at 5 and 10 M for 24 hours were stained with annexin v and propidium iodide (PI). Early and late apoptotic cells were analyzed by FACS (*p<0.05 , **p<0.001). We also analyzed protein expression of apoptotic m arkers, to evaluate the effects on \u00b5M). Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. Interestingly, gal induced PARP and cas pase 3 cleavage in Panc-1 cells (Figure 140 A). Also, HS766T cells show increase in caspase 3 cleavage when exposed to gal or it analogs after a 24-hour treatment period (Figure.140 B). At increasing doses (5- 20 M) gal enhanced the expression of Bax in both M iaPaCa-GR and MiaPaCa-GTR cells (Figure 140 C, top and bottom panels respectively ). In MiaPaCa-GR cells, gal and VNPP433-3 profoundly depleted Bcl-2 and increased cleaved PARP expression (Figure 140 D). Dysregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 h as been implicated in PDAC resistance and metastatic progression (Bold et al, 2001). To this end, several groups are 249 investigating inhibitors to counteract the activiti es of Bcl-2 (Azmi & Mohammad, 2009; Azmi et al, 2011; Martin et al, 2009). However, sin ce it's been reported that Mnk-eIF4E axis tightly regulates Bcl-2 mRNA, it is possible t hat by depleting Mnk1/2, ARDAs may have an indirect effect on Bcl-2 protein expression (Figure 140 D). Here, we show that gal and VNPP433-3 (10 \u00b5M) caused complete depletion of Bcl-2 protein. Figure 140: Gal and its analogs induce Caspase 3 an d PARP cleavage. Quantified protein lysates were separated (50 and 1 00 g) on 10 and 12.5% tris/Glycine gels. Indicated proteins were analyzed by their respective antibodi es. Panc-1 (A) and HS766T (B), show caspase 3 cleav age. Gemcitabine resistant cells (C and D, MiaPaCa-GR and MiaPaCa-GTR ) after 24-hour treatment show an increase in PARP cleavage, decrease in Bcl-2 with a concomitant increase in Bax expression. 250 Specific Aim 4b: To determine the effects of ARDAs on up- regulated and resistance-inducing signaling pathways in PDAC cells Gal and analogs degrade Mnk1/2 and decrease eIF4E phosphorylation in PDAC cells The effect of ARDAs on Mnk1/2 protein expression w as evaluated in pancreatic cancer cells, based on the assumption that ARDAs co uld modulate this axis in all types of cancers. Hence, we screened gal and its novel analo gs to evaluate their degradative activities on Mnk1/2 and their observable effects d ownstream, in ASPC1, MiaPaCa-2 and CaPan-1 cells. From protein expression analysis, we observed that gal and its analogs depleted protein expression of Mnk1/2, with a subse quent decrease in eIF4E phosphorylation (peIF4E) (Figure 141 A and B). Figure 141: Gal and analogs deplete Mnk1/2 in PDAC cells (A and B), ASPC1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with g al, VNPT55 and VNPP433-3 show a dose dependent decrease on Ras, Mnk1 and peIF4E. (C) In CaPan-1 ce lls gal, VNPP414 VNPP433-3 decrease Mnk1/2 expression levels whereas gemcitabine exposure incr eased protein expression of Mnk1/2 in CaPan-1 cells . 251 We also observed that in addition to depletion of M nk1 and downregulation of eIF4E phosphorylation, there was a strong dose-depe ndent decrease in Ras oncogene (Figure 141 A). Ras oncogenic activation has been i mplicated in EZH2 upregulation in pancreatic cancer (Fujii et al, 2012). Although thi s is a significant target for future studies, our focus was on downstream targets of the Ras/MAPK pathway. PDAC resistance under gemcitabine treatment has imp licated the triggering of Mnk2-eIF4E axis, enhancing the translation of mRNAs involved in tumorigenesis (Adesso et al, 2013). Thus, we compared the efficacy of gem citabine to the ARDAs for their ability to deplete Mnk1/2 expression in CaPan-1 cells. We o bserved that whereas gal and its analogs decreased protein expression of Mnk1/2, gem citabine seemed to induce an increased expression of these proteins (70 and 90%, respectively) (Figure 141 C). Anti- proliferative properties of CGP-57380 analyzed in A SPC1 PDAC cells, revealed low activity of the inhibitor (Figure 142). This sugges ts that, although CGP-57380 potently inhibit Mnk kinase activity, it would possibly take higher doses of the compound to induce significant apoptosis and inhibit cell growth. Figure 142: Mnk kinase inhibitor (CGP-57380) shows low activity in Cell viability assays with CGP, after an eight-day treatment, showed GI 50 that were significantly high in comparison to gemcitabine and ARDAs (see Table 15). 252 From our studies we observed that Mnk2 expression l evel in gemcitabine-resistant (MiaPaCa-GR) cells were higher (50% higher, compari ng the controls) than what was observed in gemcitabine/erlotinib-resistant (MiaPaC a-GTR) cells (Figure 143 A and B). We found this rather intriguing, and clearly warran ts further analysis to confirm this observation. Future evaluation with elucidate the r ole erlotinib plays in Mnk2 protein expression during drug-resistance. Figure 143: Gal and analogs deplete Mnk1/2 in PDAC cells. (A) Gemcitabine/erlotinib resistant and Gemcitabine -resistant (B) cells were analyzed for Mnk2 downregulation after exposing the cells to indicate d doses of ARDAs for a 24-hour time point. Data sho ws a marked depletion of protein expression in all two c ells lines. Gal and analogs modulate and reverse EMT in Metasta tic PDAC cell lines Considering that the higher percentage of cancer m ortality results from metastatic disease, there exists the need to evaluate the agen ts' ability to induce apoptosis in metastatic cells in addition to inhibiting the progression to metastasis. Invading cells undergo EMT, which is implicated in the disease progression of a number of malignancies including pancreatic cancer (Nakajima et al, 2004; Poser et a l, 2001; Shekhar et al, 2003). Here we examined the effects of gal and its analogs on reversing EMT, by up- regulating epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and depl eting mesenchymal markers (N- 253 cadherin). Gal markedly decreased protein expressio n of N-Cadherin and increased expression of E-Cadherin in S2-013 and S2-VP10 cell s (Figure 144 A and B), implicated in the early stages of migration and metastasis of malignancies (Nakajima et al, 2004). The loss of E-Cadherin has been related to an invasive and undifferentiated phenotype in a number of malignancies (Joo et al, 2002). Invading cells possess the ability to degrade the e xtracellular matrix by secreting metalloproteinases; MMP-9 one of the two type IV co llagenases, essential in degrading the ECM has been reported to be overexpressed in pancre atic cancer (Gress et al, 1995; Harvey et al, 2003; Maatta et al, 2000). We evaluated whet her both gal and VNPP433-3 could deplete MMP-2/-9 in PDAC cells and indeed we observ ed a marked down-regulation of MMP-2 (Figure 144 C and D) in HS766T and Panc-1 cel ls. Complementarily, siRNA knockdown S2-013 eam downregulation effects on N- cadherin, MMP-2/-9 (Figure 144 E). This suggests th at, by depleting Mnk1/2, gal and analogs possibly modulate these proteins in part vi a the Mnk-eIF4E axis. Analysis of secreted MMP-1/-9 in S2-013 cells inter showed that both ARDAs and gemcitabine decreased MMP-1/-9 secretion (Figure 145 A and B). However, in MiaPaCa-2 cells treatment with gemcitabine alone increased MMP-9 secretion and co- treatment with gal or CGP-57380, significantly supp ressed this gemcitabine-induced up- regulation (Figure 145 C). Although, MMP-9 has been extensively studied in cancers, recent studies also have shown that MMP-1 expressio n in pancreatic cancer correlates with poor patient prognosis (Endo et al, 2009). Targetin g MMP-1/-2/-9 in PDAC will thus, enhance the anti-cancer activities of gal and analo gs and also strongly antagonize the invasive activities of PDAC. 254 Figure 144: Gal and analogs reverse EMT via Mnk-eIF 4E axis Protein expression of gal and analogs' treated PDAC cells showed a decrease in N-cadherin and increase in E-cadherin (A & B). Decrease in MMP-2 (B, C & D).

B, Densitometry of A. (*p<0.05, **p<0.001) Effects of gal and analogs on NF-B activation in PDAC cells NF-B pathway is implicated in cancer cell migratio n, invasion and involved in resistance in pancreatic cancer (Arlt et al, 2003; Wang et al, 1999b). NF-B activation is also implicated in the downregulation of nucleoside transporters (hCNT1) in PDAC, which results in significant decrease in gemcitabine upta ke (Skrypek et al, 2013), hence the inefficacy reported in gemcitabine therapy. Immunoblot analysis revealed phosphorylation (p-p65) in both MiaPaCa-2 and S2.01 3 cells (Figure 146 A and B) at 5- 20 M. This downregulation of p-p65 can lead to an increase in hCNT1 expression which 256 may result in increase in gemcitabine uptake. Combi ning compounds such as gal/analogs can potentially enhance the efficacy of gemcitabine in gemcitabine resistant pancreatic for the effects of gal and VNPP433- on phosphorylated levels of p65. (B) Gal and VNPT55 do wnregulate p65 phosphorylation with no effects on p52 expression. During cell migration, EMT markers such as RhoA and CDC42 (cell division cycle 42, a GTP-binding protein) are activated and involv ed in cell cytoskeletal reorganization, cell polarity, cell motility and invasion (Sahai & Marshall, 2002; Tang et al, 2008). In this study we observed significant downregulation of CDC 42 protein expression (Figure147 A and D, ASPC1 and MiaPaCa-GTR ), proposing a possible molecular mechanism for inhibition of cancer cell migration. Gal and its analog also exhibited high potency at 1 0 \u00b5M in depleting protein expression of Cox-2, Slug and Snail (Figure 147 A-D ), implicated in the cell invasion. Snail has been reported to also repress E-Cadherin both in vitro and in vivo by interacting with E-cadherin promoter region (Nieto, 2002). Snai l reportedly, also plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer disease progression and metast asis (Hotz et al, 2007; von Burstin et 257 al, 2009). Interestingly, a recent study suggested that Snail is significantly involved in the maintenance of stem cell-like characteristics in pa ncreatic cancer cells (Zhou et al, 2014). This Study revealed some very interesting findings in PDAC cells after exposure to ARDAs. In prostate cancer cells, treatment with gal and its analogs did not show any significant effect on CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine recept or type-4), however, interestingly we observed significant depletion of CXCR4 in ASPC1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells after 24-hour treatment with gal and VNPP433-3 (Figure 147 A & B ). CXCR4 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that b elongs to the super family of seven transmembrane domain heteromeric receptors . Chemokines functions as attractants that are important in cell activation, differentiation and trafficking (Mukherjee & Zhao, 2013). CXCR4 is bound by its cognate ligand CXCL12 (stromal cell derived factor-1, SDF-1) and this signaling axis has been i mplicated in the metastatic potential of a number of cancers including pancreatic cancer (Ba lkwill, 2004; Koshiba et al, 2000; Scotton et al, 2002). This observation of ARDAs in pancreatic cancer, suggests that compounds being repurposed for application in diffe rent cancer therapies, need to be extensively characterized as there may be potential additional favorable or toxic effects. 258 Figure 147: Gal and analogs deplete EMT markers in PDAC cells. (A-D) protein expression of Snail, Slug, Cox-2, CDC 42 and CXCR4 after gal and analogs treatment show decrease in protein expression. Gal and analogs inhibit PDAC cell migration and inv asion From the effects seen on proteins involved in cell migration and invasion, we went ahead to evaluate the anti-migratory and anti-invas ive properties of ARDAs by utilizing scratch wound assays and BME pre-coated 8 M pore i nserts. Migration assays were done over a time period of 12 hours whereas invasion ass ays were incubated for 24 hours. At 5 \u00b5M gal and its analogs did infact inhibit migration of Panc-1 PDAC cells significantly compared to DMSO treated controls (Figure 148, top panel ). We also observed that both gemcitabine and CGP-57380 decreased migration of Pa nc-1 cells. In metastatic cell type (S2-013), ARDAs significantly inhibited cell migrat ion in vitro (Figure 148, bottom panel ). 259 Migration assays were repeated at least 3 times and represented as barchart in Figure 149. Migration assays showed that the newer analogs of g al were more potent in inhibiting PDAC cell migration, and even more potent than gemc itabine and CGP-57380 in gem- na\u00efve Panc-1 cells (Figure 148 and 149). Figure 148: Scratch wound healing assays reveal tha t gal and analogs inhibit PDAC cell migration Panc-1 ( top panel ) S2-013 ( bottom panel ) cells seeded in 24-well plate were scratched with a 200 l pipette tip and treated with indicated compounds at 5 M for 12 hours. Wounds were measured before and after the 12-hour time point. 260 Figure 149: Distance migrated by Panc-1 and S2-013 cells after treatment. Wounds were measured before and after the 12-hour t ime point. Distance migrated were quantified by measuring the difference at time 0 and 12 hours and normalized to control. (Distance migrated = Distan ce at time 0 hour - distance at 12 hours/ Distance migrat ed by control). (*p<0.05, **p<0.001) Although gemcitabine showed significant anti-migrat ory activities in gem-na\u00efve Panc-1 cells, in vitro invasion assays, revealed that gemcitabine lacked significant anti- invasive properties, both in gemcitabine-na\u00efve (Fig ure 150) and gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cells (Figure 151 and 152), contrary to the ef fects seen with gal and its analogs. Interestingly effects of CGP-57380 which have previ ously been shown to inhibit eIF4E phosphorylation, exhibited significant inhibition o f MiaPaCa-2 invasion (Figure 150, right panel ) and also MiaPaCa-GTR cells (Figure 151, lower panel ). Protein expression of MMPs and N-Cadherin, have already been shown to be downregulated with Mnk1 knockdown (See Figure 144 E). This suggests that CG P inhibits PDAC cell migration and invasion by downregulating eIF4E phosphorylation. 261 Figure 150: Gal ) and MiaPaCa-2 ( Right cells were seeded in matrigel coated Boyden chamb ers treated with indicated compounds at 5 M for 24 hou rs with 10% FBS as chemo attractant in the bottom chamber Figure 151: Gal and analogs in gemcitabine-resistan ) were seeded in matrigel coated Boyden chambers treated with indicated compounds at 5 M f or 24 hours with 10% FBS as chemo attractant in the bottom chamber 262 Figure 152: Quantification of invaded PDAC cells Invasion assays in Figure 149 and 150 were counted. Quantified invaded cells show a significant inhibi tion of PDAC cell invasion (**p<0.001). Gal and its analogs deplete stem cell factors Recent studies on cancer stem cells and EMT-type ce lls revealed the crucial role they play in drug resistance and disease metastasis . In an effort to evaluate the possibility of gal and analogs in inhibiting the growth and pro pagation of putative cancer stem cell population, we assessed the effects on putative ste m cell factors (Nanog, BMI-1, -Catenin and Oct-4). Cancer stem cell populations have been reported to express high levels of multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) and ABGC2 (Shankar e t al, 2011). MDR1 proteins have also been reported to be expressed in a high percen tage of pancreatic carcinomas (O'Driscoll et al, 2007). Perhaps, another interest ing turn of events in the PDAC study was the observation that ARDAs, showed modest activitie s in depleting MDR1 protein expression levels (Figure 153 A & B). Previously, t his had been investigated in prostate 263 cancer, to provide a plausible explanation for ARDA s efficacy in drug-resistant cells; however, we did not observe any significant activit y on MDR protein expression. Obviously there are other mechanisms involved in mo dulating specific proteins in PDAC that enhance the activity of ARDAs. EZH2 whic h cooperate with other factors to induce resistance and PDAC cancer cell migration an d invasion (Chen et al, 2010b) was also significantly down-regulated (Figure 153 C and D). Surprisingly, gemcitabine did not affect EZH2 expression significantly (Figure 153C). EZH2 has been shown to be highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and is reporte d to silence E-Cadherin; it has also been implicated in MMP activation (Shin & Kim, 2012). A recent report also implicates EZH2 in PDAC stem cell renewal and maintenance (van Vler ken et al, 2013). In addition to contributing to chemoresistance, siRNA knockdown of EZH2 sensitizes PDAC cells to a significant re- expression of p27 (Kip1) (Ougolkov et al, 2008) . It remains an important oncotarget and significant depletion and inhibition enhances the anti-cancer and anti-invasive properti es of therapeutic agents. In the various cell lines, we observed depletion of stem cell-like factors (Nanog, BMI-1, -Catenin and Oct-4). We also observed that VNPP433-3 was more potent in depleting oncogenes than gal which was expected due to increased activities of the analogs (Figure 154 A-D). Our studies of Mnk1 EC 50 values of the analogs in prostate cancer cells in addition to GI 50 values from PDAC cells led to this conclusion Our studies also revealed that effects on stem cell-like factors were not lim ited to gemcitabine-na\u00efve cells but were also observed in gem-resistant cells. 264 Figure 153: Gal and analogs show modest effects on MDR1 and EZH2 Protein expression of MDR1 in Panc-1 (A) and MiaPaC a-2 (B) were analyzed by western blot. (C and D) In CaPan-1 and MiaPaCa-GR cells EZH2 was markedly down regulated dose dependently. Several reports have shown the important role Mnk-e IF4E axis play in cancer disease progression, resistance, migration and inva sion. Knockdown of Mnk1 or the use of CGP-57380 shows down-regulation of resistant and st em cell-like proteins. The multiple activities of ARDAs, in depleting or modulating the several oncogenes including the Mnk- eIF4E axis, makes these compounds promising anti-ca ncer agents. 265 Figure 154: Gal/VNPP433-3 decrease expression of p utative stem cell factors. Analysis of effects of gal and VNPP433-3 on stem-c ell like factors shows a marked depletion of protei n expression in gemcitabine-na\u00efve (A and B) and gemci tabine-resistant (C and D) PDAC cells. Gal/analogs synergize in colony fo rmation assays. Gal and analogs have displayed consistent anti-canc er in inhibiting proliferation of gem-na\u00efve and gem-resistant PDAC cells. This was no t limited to cells from primary localized tumors but also ascites (ASPC1) and metas tatic lesions (S2-013). As confirmation of results observed in MTT cell viabil ity and combination studies, colony formation assays with ASPC1, S2-013, MiaPaCa-2 and MiaPaCa-GTR were performed 266 with 1000 cells seeded in 6-well plates. After cell attachment, they were subsequently treated with ARDAs alone or in combination with gem citabine. Although colony forming units (CFU) analyzed in 2D does not necessarily recapitulate the stem cell-like ability of putative cancer stem cells, this was our initial studies to evaluate whether cells plated at a very low density, with resulting population arising from single cells into colonies, could be s ignificantly inhibited. Colonies from cell types derived from ascites, ASPC 1 (Figure 155 A) and S2-013 (Figure 155 B), after a 14-day period show signific ant inhibition of colonies formed. Gal and analogs exhibited similar efficacies in gemcita bine-naive MiaPaCa-2 cells (Figure 156) and gemcitabine/erlotinib-resistant MiaPaCa-GT R cells (Figure 157). Gal, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3 at 0.5 - 2.5 \u00b5M significantly inhibi ted the formation of colonies. Disappointingly, the efficacy of CGP-57380 was fair ly modest in these cell lines even at 2.5 \u00b5M. Effects of CGP-57380 in resistant cells sho wed lower activity than in the drug- naive cell lines. However, as was observed in prost ate cancer cells, CGP-57380 failed to exhibit great anti-cancer activities at low micromo lar concentrations. Figure 155: Gal/analog significantly inhibit CFU me tastatic PDAC cell lines. (A) ASPC1 and S2-013 (B) cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well and treated with compounds (M) for 14 days. Media was replaced every 72 hours. Cells were stained with 0.05% crystal violet. 267 Figure 156: VNPP414 decreased CFU of MiaPaCa-2 cell s and potentiated the effects of gemcitabine MiaPaCa-2 cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well and treated with compounds (M) for 14 days. Media was replaced every 72 hours. Cells were stained with 0. 05% crystal violet, after visible colonies could be counted or after 14days Previously, in analyzing the effects of these novel agents on collagenase activity of MMPs, we observed that gemcitabine increased MMP-9 collagenase activity in MiaPaCa- 2 cells (See Figure 145 C). In almost all PDAC cell lines screened, with the exception of MiaPaCa-2, 200 nM gemcitabine completely inhibited formation of colonies after the 14- day time point. It was very surprising that gemcita bine at 200 nM in MiaPaCa-2 cells was well tolerated by the cells and failed to inhibit c olony formation. It is reported that MiaPaCa-2 PDAC cells possess a high tendency to mig rate, invade and also exhibit resistance to extant therapy, it is possible that M iaPaCa-2 cells express factors that makes them possess innate resistance to gemcitabine thera py. Combining VNPP414 with gemcitabine showed enhanced activity compared to the single agents alone (Figure 156). Although effects of CGP-57380 alone were not profound on inhibiting colony formation, combining it with g emcitabine potentiated the effects of either agent (Figure 156 and 157). In gemcitabine/E rlotinib resistant cells (MiaPaCa-GTR), both gal and VNPP433-3, even at 0.5 \u00b5M, showed sig nificant inhibition of colonies. Combination of gemcitabine at 200 nM with CGP-57380 at 2.5 \u00b5M significantly reduced 268 colonies (Figure 157 A and B). Gal/VNPP433-3 combi ned with gemcitabine almost completely inhibited colonies of MiaPaCa-GTR cell ( Figure 157 A and B). Figure 157: Gal/VNPP433-3 synergize with gemcitabi ne in decreasing CFU. (A) MiaPaCa-GTR were seeded at 1000 cells/well and treated with compounds (M) for 14 days. Media was replaced every 72 hours. Cells were stained with 0. 05% crystal violet. (B) Colony assays were repeated three times and colonies counted in four quadrants of the wells. Results are represented as averages with S. E.M. (*p<0.5, **0.001). Colony numbers of gemcitabine/erlotinib-resistant P DAC cells were significantly decreased in combination assays. 269 Anti-tumor efficacy of gal and analogs in MiaPaCa-2 xenografts MiaPaCa-2 cells were inoculated into both flanks o f nude mice to develop tumors. After two weeks' mice bearing tumors were randomly put into five groups. Treatments were started when tumor size averaged 85 mm 3. Galeterone and VNPT55 groups received 0.26 mmol/kg twice daily, VNPP414 group received 0. 068mmol/kg twice daily, whilst VNPP433-3 group received 0.068 mmol/kg once daily. Tumor and body weight measurement were taken twice weekly. All animals we re evaluated for any toxic effects (body weight loss, activity and skin integrity). Tw o mice died in the VNPP433-3 group, otherwise no mortality was observed in any other gr oup, of the three mice remaining in that group no apparent toxicity was observed after 30 days. Our data revealed that all four compounds exhibite d PDAC anti-tumor activities (Figure 158). Although two mice died in the VNPP433 -3 group, tumor volumes showed that both VNPT55 and VNPP433-3 exhibited the highe st anti-cancer activities. Galeterone and VNPP414 exhibited similar anti-tumor activities in the PDAC xenograft. Body weight measurements showed no significant chan ge (Figure 159). All compounds showed no significant toxicities. During the course of treatment, we observed that s ome tumors in the treatment groups disappeared, especially tumors in the VNPT55 group. Tumors in the VNPP414 group significantly increased in size after 12 days ' post-treatment and increased steadily. 270 Figure 158: Gal/analogs exhibit profound anti-cance r activity in PDAC xenograft Effect of gal, and VNPP433-3 were evaluated in MiaPaCa-2 PDAC xenograft-bearing mice. Mice (n = 5) were administered with gal (0.26 mmol/kg/twice daily), VNPT55 (0.26 daily) by intraperitoneal injection, 5 days per week for 32 d ays. Tumors were measured twice a week. Figure 159: Body weights of mice Mean body weights of mice were taken twice a week f or the duration of the study. Mean body weights showed no significant toxicities to mice 271 Conclusion for Specific Aim 4 Multi-targeted single-agents and drug combinations are spearheading pancreatic cancer therapeutics to minimize resistance and enha nce efficacy. By targeting and inhibiting multiple oncogenic pathways simultaneous ly, combinations potentially may offer a major advantage over \"single-target\" drugs (Venkannagari et al, 2012). Gemcitabine, gemcitabine/erlotinib and Folfirinox a re the respective elective single-agent and drug combinations in PDAC chemotherapy. These d rugs exert only marginal survival benefits with increased toxicity, emphasizing the u rgency to identify new drugs and/or therapeutic targets. Recent studies have shown that gal and analogs have the unique ability to effectively modulate oncogenic eukaryotic protein t ranslation via depletion of Mnk1/2 and of eIF4E phosphorylation. These comp ounds also inhibit NF-B of target genes by decreasing NF-B (p65) phosphory lation. In acquired drug resistance of PDAC, these unique mechanisms of gal and its improv ed analogs may offer an advantage over currently available drugs for PDAC therapy. He rein, we show that gal and its novel analogs profoundly inhibited PDAC cell proliferatio n, colonization, migration and invasion and also induce apoptosis. The agents sens itized gem-resistant cells and synergistically enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabin e. These effects may be associated with attenuation of Mnk1/2-eIF4E pathway and metastasis markers (N-cadherin, Snail, Slug and EZH2). In this study, gal and analogs show significant ant i-proliferative activities against both gemcitabine-naive and gemcitabine-resistant PD AC cells. Gal and VNPP433-3 cells in combi nation with gemcitabine synergistically 272 inhibited gemcitabine-resistant cells with very low CI values of 0.03-0.4. Induction of apoptosis in cells isolated from primary tumors, me tastatic lesions and gemcitabine resistant cells, indicate their potential in target ing all forms and stages of PDAC Although from our combination assays we observed th at ARDAs did not exhibit significant synergy in gemcitabine-naive cells, the y did infact potentiate the effects of gemcitabine in the colony formation assays. This ma y be due to the fact that the doses used in the colony formation assays were at different ra tios and not a constant ratio of their GI 50 values. As stated earlier we did see weak synergy a t ED90 in gemcitabine-na\u00efve cells, it is also possible this is what we observed in the colon y formation assays and at higher dose combinations, ARDAs and gemcitabine may synergize. Considering that drug response during therapy, is more significant and useful at E D90, the effects observed in gemcitabine- naive cells suggests that these two classes of comp ounds can be further developed in combination strategies in gemcitabine-naive PDAC di sease. However, more rigorous evaluation of these combinations in gemcitabine-nai ve cells needs to be done to elucidate the potential doses that may result in either poten tiated or synergistic effects. Interaction between cancer cell-stroma is implicate d in the high metastatic potential characteristic of PDAC. Several reports have emphas ized the significance and pivotal role matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, which interestingly is up-regulated in invading cancer ce lls. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), implicated in cell invasion is also overexpressed i n PDAC (Okami et al, 1999; Tucker et al, 1999; Yip-Schneider et al, 2000), and studies h ave shown a strong positive correlation between MMP-9 and COX-2 expression (Bu et al, 2011) in PDAC. and VNPP433- 3's inhibitory secreted MMP-9, suggests 273 the potential anti-invasive activity of these agent s. Interestingly, gemcitabine-induced collagenase activity of MMP-9 was significantly thw arted when combined with gal in gemcitabine-resistant cells. Snail, Slug and Twist 1 have been implicated in inc reasing tumor grade of pancreatic cancer (Hotz et al, 2007). Snail has als o been reported to correlate with lymph node and distant metastases (Yin et al, 2007) and i ncreased fibrosis in vivo (Boutet et al, 2006). -Catenin and CXCR4 have been implicated in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis and CXCR4 expression has been correlated with poor survival in PDAC patients (Wang et al, 2013). These factors, interestingly, a re markedly downregulated by gal and its analogs, in the highly resistant and difficult to t reat PDAC models in vitro. In this study, there is evidence of the efficacy of ARDAs as anti-PDAC agents, these inhibitors have shown diverse activities in i nhibiting several biological functions and molecular pathways employed by PDAC to increase mor bidity. Perhaps the most important next phase of investigations for these compounds af ter in vitro studies were to ascertain whether these anti-PDAC effects would be recapitula ted in vivo. Although the pancreatic cancer in vivo study was a pilot one, observed results suggest th at gal and its analogs do indeed exhibit anti-tumor activities in PDAC xenogr afts, which forms the basis for further in-depth future studies. The idea of targeting both localized and metastatic lesions is evident here as gal and its analogs show significant efficacy in inhibi ting cell viability of cells derived from metastatic lesions and also primary localized tumor s. This in addition to the anti-migratory 274 and anti-invasive properties displayed, may provide a plausible rationale for their potential against PDAC. Future Directions Our current in vivo work was a pilot study to determine whether gal and its analogs would show potential anti-tumor activities. Future studies will focus on comparing gal and its analogs with gemcitabine alone and also in comb ination, to evaluate their potential as an improved therapeutic strategy for PDAC. We will evaluate these anti-tumor activities in both xenograft and orthotopic models. We will al so compare gal/analog-gemcitabine combination to gemcitabine-erlotinib, gal-erlotinib and gal-docetaxel combinations to determine the potential of this class of compounds in PDAC therapy. Summary and Significance of thesis findings The overall goal of this thesis was to assess the a bility of gal and novel analogs to modulate multiple oncogenes in human PC and PDAC ce lls. This study has revealed multiple effects of gal and analogs either as poten tial single agent therapy or in combination with FDA approved drugs. We observed depletion and inhibitory effects on AR/AR-V7 and AR-v567es which are currently implicated in dru g resistance in PC. We also found out that these agents, do not only affect the protein e xpression of oncogenes, but also modulate their transcriptional activities, which would sugge st several multiple mode of actions. Twist 1 transcriptional activity, which has been sh own to be overactive during docetaxel resistance, was profoundly inhibited. Twi st 1 is also known as a master regulator of EMT and by antagonizing its transcriptional acti vities may forestall disease progressing to a metastatic phase. This has strong clinical imp lications, since gal is currently in pivotal Phase III clinical development in men with metastat ic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 275 Abiraterone and enzalutamide therapy have encounter ed resistance due to the overexpression of AR and splice variant AR-Vs, and the ability of gal and analogs to deplete these receptors should garner much interest . Infact the retrospective phase II study by Tokai pharmaceuticals which formed the basis of the Phase III study design directed at PC patient with AR-V7 positive tumors, gives an ind ication of how significant this study has contributed to the development of gal. Hence, g al might fulfill an unmet need in patients who either have AR-V7 at baseline or devel oped the variant after enzalutamide or abiraterone treatment. Given the high translational significance of in vivo anti-tumor efficacy data of any drug candidate, this anti-tumor activity data for g al and VNPT55 is considered highly significant data of this thesis. We also observed t hat VNPT55 is currently the only known compound that exhibits activity on both the protein expression of splice variant AR-V7, and its mRNA level. Further studies which may sugge st that new lead ARDAs possess similar mode of action are needed and if so, then, this class of compounds could play a major role in Prostate cancer therapy. Most importa ntly, there is evidence that the effects observed in vitro were recapitulated in vivo. This suggest a high bioavailability of the compounds, as effects on EMT and putative stem cell markers were downregulated in vivo . The ability of these compounds to modulate a number of oncogenes expressed in a myriad of cancers may increase their application in these cancers. Our results also highlight the unique ability of ga l and its novel analogs to inhibit the growth, colonization and metastatic potential o f a variety of PDAC cells through modulation of several oncogenic targets. Effects of the gal and analogs on NF-B signaling and Mnk1/2-axis which are up-regulated during gemci tabine resistance in PDAC, possibly 276 enhanced the agents' activities in these resistant cells. These compounds also inhibited growth of xenograft tumors. Most importantly gal an d analogs synergized with gemcitabine in gemcitabine-resistant cells and coul d potentially become an emerging drug combination strategy in PDAC therapy. In rigorously characterizing a compound and its ana logs, we enhance their rational use in the clinic. Potential application to differe nt cancers and combination strategies are revealed due to the knowledge of their mechanism of action. Additionally, microarray analysis of the gal-resistant cell lines revealed s trong up-regulation of key transcription factors that modulate PC stem cell and drug resista nce. Typically, most agents approved for the treatment of cancers encounter resistance a t some point. It is vital to anticipate this and be proactive about counter measures. Overall, these unique agents by virtue of their mul tiple desirable anti-cancer activities may be able to overcome the \"triad of de ath\" (i.e., primary tumor growth, drug resistance and metastasis) in PC and PDAC. Conseque ntly, this would lead to better treatment outcome of men with Prostate Cancer and m en and women with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. .
