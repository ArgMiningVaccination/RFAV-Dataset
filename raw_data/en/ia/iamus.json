More about vaccine safety How well the pneumococcal vaccine works and how long it lasts Vaccination gives the best protection against pneumococcal infections. It helps protect against the most common and serious types of these infections, but there's still a chance you might get a pneumococcal infection. You usually have some protection by about 3 weeks from when you had the vaccine. Most people only need 1 dose of the vaccine for long-term protection. The protection only starts to reduce after 5 years. Page last reviewed: 26 June 2023 Next review "}
