Top 5 Nutrients to Boost Immunity Incorporating the top immune-boosting foods is the best way to get the [nutrients your body needs](https://ensosuperfoods.com/blogs/supergreens/what-vitamin-is-good-for-immune-system) to fight infections. With that said, you can still take supplements and look for products high in these nutrients: 1. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a well-known vitamin, particularly for immune system support. It is found in citrus fruits, bell peppers, and broccoli and acts as a [powerful antioxidant](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29534432/) that can boost white blood cell production. White blood cells help produce collagen for skin, bones, and connective tissue and respond to immune system compromises such as infections and diseases. Because the body cannot produce vitamin C on its own, it is critical to consume the recommended daily amounts, which range between 75 and 90 milligrams for most adults. While it is considered safe to exceed these doses, it's best to consult a doctor to determine the proper amount based on your health. 2. Vitamin D Vitamin D is derived from the sun and plays an important role in maintaining the body's immune defenses, decreasing inflammation, and supporting bone health. While excessive sun exposure is harmful, moderate exposure with sunscreen allows the body to synthesize this vitamin. Like vitamin C, it can aid in the development of white blood cells, but some evidence suggests that vitamin D can also protect against respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D can also be found in some types of fish (such as salmon or mackerel), egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. Most people only require 600 to 800 international units (IU), and taking more than the recommended amount can potentially be harmful. 3. B Vitamins B vitamins are a class of water-soluble nutrients that help maintain the immune system and overall health. Vitamins B6 and B12 are particularly [beneficial for the immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019735/) because they support regulatory T cells in the small intestine. Furthermore, B vitamins aid in cell metabolism, energy production, and DNA and RNA synthesis. Whole grains, lean meats, nuts, seeds, and legumes are high in B vitamins. They interact, so getting all eight types is necessary to reap the full range of benefits. Because most adults are deficient in B vitamins, finding the right balance is critical for immune system support. 4. Zinc Zinc is a nutrient that helps the immune system combat infections by promoting the growth of immune cells. Zinc can also help protect the body from toxins due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which prevent free-radical cell damage. Zinc provides extra protection for the body's tissue barriers, so getting the proper intake is crucial for an immune response. Whole foods are often the best sources of zinc, such as chickpeas, oysters, and pumpkin seeds. Most adults only need a mere eight to eleven milligrams daily, but the benefits of getting the right amount are evident. 5. Probiotics Probiotics are living microorganisms that promote a healthy gut microbiome, which in turn, supports the immune system and overall health. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most common kinds found in probiotic products, often fermented foods or yogurt. They are frequently used to promote digestive and gut health, but probiotics can also reduce inflammation and enhance the body's natural defenses. If you don't like yogurt, you can also find probiotics in kimchi, kefir, or sauerkraut. Or, you can get probiotics the easy way with [Ens Supergreens](https://ensosuperfoods.com/products/supergreens).
