[Read more here!](/research/covid-19/timeline/) Vienna BioCenter - Top Life Science Cluster Over the last 30 years, the Vienna BioCenter has established itself as a top biology research center in Europe, comprising six research institutions innovative research in [all areas of the life sciences](/research/research-areas/). The wide range of expertise, from biophysics and structural biology to cell biology and evolution, combined with a plethora of model systems, ensures diversity and interdisciplinarity. Purely curiosity-driven research is highly valued and encouraged, and there is also a focus on basic biomedical research and mechanisms of disease, laying the groundwork for future solutions to global health problems. Similarly, [basic research in plants](https://www.viennabiocenter.org/about/vbc-at-a-glance/who-is-here-members/gregor-mendel-institute-of-molecular-plant-biology-gmi/) is important for agriculture and may ultimately provide solutions for sustainable food and energy production. Several [key discoveries](https://www.viennabiocenter.org/research/key-discoveries/) that have brought the Vienna BioCenter international recognition illustrate the high caliber of research, both past and present. Currently, the highly interactive and collaborative community hosts 2,269 scientists (including 395 PhD students) coming from 78 countries. Research productivity is reflected in the publication rate (around 350 manuscripts a year), which is the highest of any life sciences institute in Austria (Nature Index). "}
