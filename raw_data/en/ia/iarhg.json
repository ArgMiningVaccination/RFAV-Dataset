Ronica Perez graduated summa cum laude from the National University of Health Sciences with a Master's Degree in Acupuncture. She is a diplomate of the NCCAOM (the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) and a licensed acupuncturist in the state of Illinois. She became interested in Chinese medicine when she wasn't happy with the answers she was getting from her child's pediatrician. Someone had suggested to her that she see a 'Chinese Doctor' for her concerns. Because she knew nothing about this type of medicine and had heard so many warnings about the dangers of herbal medicine, she had to do some investigating. What she found was that not only did she want to start seeing these 'Chinese Doctors' but she wanted to become one. She went to the National University of Health Sciences to hear Dr. Kwon talk about acupuncture and oriental medicine. Dr. Kwon talked about how to treat the common cold. Using Chinese medical theories, he explained how one medicine would not work on all individuals who have a cold. He pointed to the people in the lecture and said though everyone in the room had a cold, this one had a fever, this one had a sore throat, this one had a clear, runny nose, and this one had chills. Chinese medicine looks at each person and records each symptom to make a prescription and treatment plan that is unique and specific to each individual. After listening to Dr. Kwon, she had to learn more, and immediately enrolled in the Master's program for Acupuncture. Ronica also incorporates ZYTO biofeedback technology. Using this extraordinary modern technology with the wisdom of the ancient philosophies, she is able to give each patient insight as to why they are experiencing discomforts and develop a plan not only to treat the current symptoms but also to try to prevent them from occurring again. Chinese medicine requires the practitioner to be skilled at listening to patients and finding the 'root cause' of complaints. Patients are able to take more responsibility for their health and learn about the amazing healing capabilities of the human body. Instead of feeling \"Why does this type of stuff always happen to me...,\" the patient becomes empowered to change and to heal. The effects of the acupuncture treatments continue to amaze Ronica. She is constantly educating herself about this medicine that is thousands of years old and is honored to be able to share this knowledge with others. Services offered: Acupuncture: Typically, Ronica stimulates the acupuncture points with sterile needles but she can also stimulate the points using tuning forks, crystals or essential oils. She may use all techniques based on the need of the patient. Acupuncture...$80 Moxibustion: Moxibustion is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves the burning of mugwort, a small, spongy herb, to facilitate healing. The purpose of moxibustion, as with most forms of traditional Chinese medicine, is to strengthen the blood, stimulate the flow of qi, and maintain general health. In traditional Chinese medicine, moxibustion is used on people who have a cold or stagnant condition. The burning of moxa is believed to expel cold and warm the meridians, which leads to smoother flow of blood and qi. Electric Stimulation: Electro-acupuncture is a form of acupuncture where a small electric current is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles. Electro-acupuncture is considered to be especially useful for conditions in which there is an accumulation of Qi, such as in chronic pain syndromes, or in cases where the Qi is difficult to stimulate. Cupping: Cupping is an ancient Chinese method of causing local congestion. A partial vacuum is created in cups placed on the skin either by means of heat or suction. This draws up the underlying tissues. When the cup is left in place on the skin for a few minutes, blood stasis is formed and localized healing takes place. Cupping has also been found to affect the body up to four inches into the tissues, causing tissues to release toxins and activate the lymphatic system. Cupping... $35 Ronica also does the biofeedback scanning. Check the ZYTO tab for details. ***Ronica accepts insurance for the acupuncture and is in the network with most major insurance companies. We would be happy to check your benefits for you. Nikki Xicotencatl, Spiritual Medium: Visit [www.almapura.com](http://www.almapura.com) for more information about Nikki and the services she offers Spirituality has played a major role in Nikki's life since she was a small child. She knew she was different at a very young age when she could see and talk to dead people. She knew there was life after death and that spiritual energies could come back and forth from wherever they lived to guide, love and communicate with us. In November of 1998, she found out what all of this meant when she had a spiritual awakening. During this time, she was given tools to recognize the information that was flowing from her spiritual self to her human self. This \"awakening\" lasted approximately four minutes after which she cried for four hours. So many things became clear to her and so many of her questions had been answered in those four minutes. She describes this experience as devastating, exhilarating, scary, mystifying and liberating but most of all peaceful. She was provided with a different perception of current and past situations. Her new perception came from another place which she can only describe as a place of \"knowing\" but she couldn't find the words to describe this to anyone, so she prayed. She asked God to show her a way to explain what happened to her in words so that she could help people to feel the peace that she was feeling. From that point, God has orchestrated a symphony of learning experiences which have resulted in the classes and services she offers. Her hope is that you find the peace that awakens all your inner truths and enlightens you on your path. Group Events: Hello From Heaven This is a small group gathering where Nikki will connect with your friends, relatives and pets living in Heaven so they may share messages of love and validation with you.

Almapura ~ The Beginning is where these two halves intersect to create a full-spectrum understanding of life and the question \"why?\" Almapura comes from the Spanish/Latin words Alma and Pura which mean Pure Soul. Pure Soul refers to the feeling achieved when you've finished your Almapura journey. Almapura provides the knowledge that we are human and spirit and that we are all connected in ways that are not defined through human logic. Almapura ~ The Beginning is a five-week workshop series introducing clients to the distinction between their human and spiritual selves, and how the two halves complement each other to create a whole. This in-depth process takes you on a journey that will illuminate inner self-truths to the conscious mind. Understand what created your life perception, how it influences your decisions, and how those decisions sculpt each and every circumstance in your life. This layered understanding of the deeply-rooted connection between humanity and spirituality brings a sense of unequivocal peace.

I was so inspired by my practice that I wanted to share my love for yoga with the world. I completed my 200H training in 2011 with Suddha Wexler at the Chicago Yoga Center in the classical Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga and Yin styles. My classes incorporate a little bit of every style and are suited for yogis of all levels. My philosophy is that, Yoga is for everyone! In class there is many variations which suit everyone from the first time yogi to the long time practitioner. My classes flow in a controlled manner making sure everyone hits the correct posture and gets the full benefit from it. I strive to help people through their journey to nourish their body mind and soul on and off the mat.

CelestReal Sounds by Diamond Quartz Crystal Singing Bowls Meditation The aim and scope of this meditation goes beyond focused awareness, it is a transformative experience. While you are encouraged to listen and enjoy the blissful sounds and sweet melodies of the singing bowls, the focus becomes that of witnessing. Relinquish the need to judge and the mind will begin to witness. What then unfolds is a peaceful state in which you ae enveloped in the \"experience\" of Being. Our bodies, physiologically speaking, being crystalline in makeup are actually very similar to the quartz crystal. Therefore, there is an inherent natural resonance already existent. While the brain typically operates in Beta wave frequency, the bowls resonate at a much slower frequency, literally entraining our brain waves to slow down. As brain wave activity slows down the thoughts slow as well, facilitating a more peaceful mind. The body calms and continues to go into state of deep relaxation. It is not uncommon for some to go so deep that they fall asleep. Other benefits that may be experienced by the meditation include relief from aches and pains, becoming aware of resolutions to problems or challenges, and insights into creative endeavors. Many individuals report experiencing an \"ah-ha\" moment. The format of this experience begins by gently communing with the participants, a gentle guided meditation and transition into the singing bowls. The bowls will be played for about an hour until the group is brought back to the present moment for a final blessing and acknowledgement. Price for group meditation is $25 For more information visit the website at [www.celestRealsounds.com](http://www.celestRealsounds.com) Laura Ghedotte Certified Intuitive Artist - Clairvoyant Medium Laura's greatest joy is to share her passion to help others discover their inner beauty - messages of wisdom and gifts of their higher self / soul through the healing modality of Intuitive Art.

How does the Integrative Intuitive Art Sessions work? The world the client and I \"jump in\" will represent something that the client really wants more clarity about, really wants to fully experience to understand better, or something they really want to move past and heal. The drawing process of Integrative Intuitive Art Drawing is two-fold. First step: I do an interpretive Intuitive Art Drawing and \"jump in\" to the energy of my drawing to experience and obtain insight that will additionally be helpful to the client. Second step: I guide the client as they draw an Intuitive Art drawing and help the client \"jump\" into the energy of their drawing to become an active participant in a visual symbolic world. In this world, the client can actually move or walk around to experience, observe, feel, and touch. It is here that one can ask their higher-self questions and receive answers or solutions. This visual symbolic world that the client is shown and can explore is the \"language\" or way that their higher self can communicate something to them in a picture form.

Benjamin Savage - Gong Meditations Benjamin Savage is an artist and friend of the gong. He has studied Shamanism and Buddhism for over 20 years, he is a lifelong seeker and spiritually oriented being; a child of Nature. He has a strong connection to universal intuition and is motivated through that intuition in his performances and in his life. Since a child he has explored many spiritual traditions searching for the unifying elements connecting all paths; the resonating truth of love and light in all beings. This has led him to the gong, which seems to be a portal for communicating directly with the oneness that connects and permeates all things. Benjamin performs gong meditations (or gong baths) and creates artwork to facilitate reconnection with the divine in all things. Gong Meditations Looking for some relief from the obstacles in life? Gong Meditations are a powerful way to bring your body and mind into balance, combat physical pain, low energy and depression. A gong meditation can shift your being from a state of suffering into a state of healing and clarity. Even if you are healthy and feeling fine, a gong meditation or sound healing can give you a super-charged sense of well-being! What is a Gong Meditation? A Gong Meditation is a meditative experience where a practitioner utilizes a Gong and Singing Bowls (sometimes accompanied by some other instruments as well) to remove blockages, tune your cells and bring harmony and health to your body and mind. The vibrations from this remarkable instrument wash over the participants removing unwanted suffering, hence the term \"Gong Bath\" (trademarked by Richard Rudis). The vibrations shift your being into a deep meditative state that allow for a wide variety of personally beneficial experiences to occur. If you have tried meditation and been unsatisfied with your results, this may be a way to have a deep meditative state induced. During a gong meditation it is suggested that you lie down, relax your muscles, close your eyes, and attentively listen to the sounds. Comfortable clothing is suggested. Each person's experience is a little different, as the vibrations will address each individual's particular issues. Each gong meditation will yield differing results as well, so it is suggested to attend more than once. Some experiences have entailed, but are not limited to; deep meditative states, bliss, relief from physical pains, sudden insights, receiving creative ideas, out-of-body experiences, strong pervasive peace, visions, and much more. Is this for real? Sound healing has been around for hundreds to thousands of years and part of many cultures all over the world. Western science has been investigating the remarkable effects of these vibrations on the body and mind and finding that indeed positive changes are happening inside us. Some of these are: brain wave shifts from Beta (waking state) into Theta and Delta (deep meditative state), which allow the body to naturally shift from a depressive state to a more uplifted state. The vibrations can also affect the sympathetic nervous system, causing deep relaxation and minimizing the sensation of pain, as well as redistribution of the cells, removal of toxins, and release of our own beneficial chemicals. Modern science even uses sound frequency-emitting machines to break down kidney stones and gallstones. Suggestions for what to bring: A mat or pad to lay on, a warm blanket, an eye-mask, pillows for head, feet or back, wear comfortable clothing (**Natural Healing Centers provides zero-gravity chairs for your comfort!**) Do not eat immediately before the experience 1 hour session $20 if you pre-pay in advance or $25 on the day of the event.

She now feels honored to teach Reiki so more healers can bring joy to the world. She has been a Hypnotherapist for 5 years.

When you are under hypnosis you still remain completely in control. You are aware of everything around you, and are in a state of perfectly focused concentration. You will feel totally safe and comfortable. The purpose of hypnotherapy is to bring about a desired change in behavior or thought through guided imagery and visualization. Hypnosis is an effective way to manage many aspects of your life including stress reduction, smoking cessation, weight management, breaking habits and forming more healthy habits, and much more. Hypnosis empowers you to overthrow negative thinking patterns and replace them with positive healthy ones. After a hypnosis session you will feel very relaxed and rejuvenated. Most unwanted behaviors take only one session but others may take 2-3 sessions. 60 minutes for $80 Emotion Code The Emotion Code is a powerful and simple way to released trapped emotions often resulting in improved health, improved relationships, and overall well being. Trapped emotions are identified individually and released one at a time. To release the pain, each trapped emotion has to be identified as a single and separate energy. Emotions are then released using a magnet. The body needs a few days to process trapped emotions after they are released. This is a healing time where you will feel lighter and less burdened, or you may feel tired or out of sorts emotionally. This is all perfectly natural and will only last a day or 2. Depending on how many trapped emotions you have usually all of them can be released in a session, and followup sessions would be needed when you are feeling emotionally burdened. 60 minutes for $80 Guided Meditation Mindful Meditation leads to peace of mind and well being, greater focus and creativity, and better relationships. Join us as we take a journey into our minds with a beautiful Guided Meditation. 7-8:30 Open to all who want to rest and rejuvenate. Every 2nd Thursday of the month, $10.

Christie has been inspired to empower children and adults through yoga and share its gifts with everyone.
