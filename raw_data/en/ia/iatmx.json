Getting vaccinated and staying up-to-date with COVID-19 shots is especially important for [people with rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/), who may be at greater risk for [COVID-19 infection](/infectious-diseases/covid-19/) and hospitalization compared with the general population, notes the [American College of Rheumatology](https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42372). Over the summer, the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/updated-covid-19-vaccines-use-united-states-beginning-fall-2023) announced that new COVID-19 vaccines should be available this fall. This likely means that by the end of September or early October, three vaccines updated to target XBB.1.5, an omicron variant, will be ready for use. The currently available bivalent vaccines were rolled out in 2022, per the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-moderna-pfizer-biontech-bivalent-covid-19-vaccines-use). But the new shots will be formulated to provide better protection against the variants that are currently circulating. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) anticipates updating its guidance by late September. In the meantime, based on the ever-growing body of research, here are five things [people with RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/) should know about the COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 Vaccination for People With Rheumatic Disease 1. It's Crucial That People With Rheumatoid Arthritis Stay Up to Date With the COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 is a serious disease. It has killed more than a million Americans, per the [CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home), and has [left others with lingering symptoms](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/meet-the-covid-19-long-haulers/) known as [long COVID](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/what-is-long-covid-symptoms-causes-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention/), including extreme fatigue, [shortness of breath](https://www.everydayhealth.com/breathing-difficulty/guide/), and [brain fog](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/brain-fog-a-covid-symptom-that-may-linger/). Many people with RA take immune-weakening medicines and are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease, a potential [complication of RA](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/complications/). Those circumstances increase the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes if a person contracts COVID-19, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html). That's why the [American College of Rheumatology (ACR)](https://rheumatology.org/) suggests all RA patients should be vaccinated. In the latest version of [guidelines released by the ACR's North American Task Force](https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42372) \u2014 composed by 13 experts and updated several times \u2014 there was moderate consensus that there are no known RA contraindications to the COVID-19 vaccine unless someone is allergic to the vaccine's components. For autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD) patients not yet vaccinated, either of the latest vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) is recommended. Patients should receive three of the same doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). These three doses should be administered at intervals of four weeks. Taking certain [RA medications](/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/medications/) that suppress the immune system can make you moderately to severely immunocompromised. If you're in this category, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#got-original-vaccines) recommends the following: - If you only got original, monovalent COVID-19 vaccines and then one or two updated vaccines, you may get one or more additional shots. - If you got an updated vaccine following an older recommendation, you can get one or more additional updated COVID-19 vaccines. - People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have the option to receive one additional dose of the updated vaccine at least two months following the last recommended COVID-19 vaccine dose. The reason for additional shots is that people who are compromised, including from immune-suppressing medications, don't always mount a sufficiently robust immune response following two doses. An additional shot seems to make a significant difference, especially for patients on [rituximab (Rituxan)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/rituximab). A [study published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases in January 2022](https://ard.bmj.com/content/81/5/687) found that although the immunocompromised patients taking [rituximab](/drugs/rituxan) did not produce sufficient antibodies after their first two mRNA vaccines, they did get a stronger immune response after a third shot. If you recently had COVID-19, the CDC says you \"may consider delaying your vaccine by three months from when your symptoms started or, if you had no symptoms, when you received a positive test.\" According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html#novavax-booster), for people over 18 who are unable or choose not to get a [Pfizer BioNTech](/drugs/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-do-not-dilute) or Moderna vaccine, the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be taken if you completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series at least six months ago and you have not gotten any other booster dose. The ideal is for people to have their RA well controlled when they get their vaccines. But the ACR task force says everyone should be vaccinated regardless of their current disease state. The group also emphasizes that their recommendation for the vaccines includes everyone who has previously contracted COVID-19. If you don't know where you can get a vaccine, the [federal government's website](https://www.vaccines.gov/) lets you put in your ZIP code and see options near you. Even those who are homebound should get the shots. People in this situation should ask their healthcare provider or state or local health department how they can get vaccinated. If they can't help, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/How-Do-I-Get-a-COVID-19-Vaccine.html) suggests contacting groups that advocate for people at home, such as [The Aging Network](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/Index.aspx) or the [Disability Information and Access Line](https://acl.gov/DIAL). 2. Experts Worry About Vulnerability of People Who Take Some RA Drugs Reports from the [Global Rheumatology Alliance](https://rheum-covid.org/), an international registry of people with RA who develop COVID-19, point to the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations for people who are immunocompromised as a result of their RA medication, because they are at higher risk of poor outcomes from the coronavirus. Results from the experiences of some 3,700 patients from this registry, [published in January 2021 in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2021/01/26/annrheumdis-2020-219498), revealed that use of more than 10 milligrams of steroids per day with moderate to high RA disease activity leads to a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes with [COVID-19 infection](https://www.everydayhealth.com/infectious-diseases/covid-19/). Another report from the Global Rheumatology Alliance, [published in September 2021 in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases](https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/9/1137.long), based on the COVID-19 disease experience of nearly 3,000 people with RA, showed that people on rituximab or Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKs) have more severe COVID-19 disease, including hospitalization and in some cases death, than people who took other medications, especially TNF inhibitors. A [meta-analysis of research published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases in August 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10401620/) notes that \"the type of immunosuppressive therapy received can also greatly affect immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines.\" Lower responses are predicted by the use of B-cell-depleting therapies (such as rituximab); treatment with antimetabolites, [abatacept](/drugs/orencia), or Janus kinase inhibitors; and long-term use of at high doses. Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies, [mycophenolate mofetil](/drugs/cellcept), and methotrexate can also lead to lower seroconversion (the body's production of antibodies) rates. Getting vaccinated does make a difference for immunocompromised people. A [study published online in the Lancet Rheumatology in August 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9381025/) that was funded by the National Institutes of Health examined more than 5000 people taking immunosuppressants. People who had received the COVID-19 vaccines were substantially protected from needing to be hospitalized. Talk to your [rheumatologist](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/how-to-choose-rheumatologist/) about whether the drugs you take put you in the immunocompromised category. 3. Work With Your Doctor to Shift Your RA Medications Because of the possibility that certain [RA medications](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/medications/) will interfere with a person's ability to manufacture antibodies against COVID-19 after a shot, the ACR task force recommends that patients work with their doctors to consider shifting the timing of some common RA medications when feasible, in an effort to enhance this immune response. These recommendations are not intended to replace a doctor's clinical judgment. Medications include: - Methotrexate They recommend pausing for one to two weeks after each vaccine dose, as disease allows. - JAK Inhibitors Pause for one to two weeks after each dose. - Abatacept (Orencia) For subcutaneous delivery, pause for one to two weeks after each vaccine dose. For intravenous (IV) delivery, time the vaccination to occur one week prior to the next dose of abatacept. - Rituximab (Rituxan) Discuss with your [rheumatologist](/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/how-to-choose-rheumatologist/). Some practitioners measure your B cells and time the COVID-19 shot and subsequent rituximab dosing accordingly. If you don't have this information, a supplemental vaccine dose should be provided two to four weeks before your next anticipated rituximab dose. - Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Time drug administration about one week after each vaccine dose, if possible. - Belimumab Pause for one to two weeks after each dose, as disease allows. - Mycophenolate Pause for one to two week after each vaccine dose if your disease is stable. - Acetaminophen and NSAIDs Assuming the disease is stable, withhold for 24 hours prior to vaccination. (There is no restriction on post-vaccination use to treat symptoms.) There are currently no recommendations to alter drug regimens for [hydroxychloroquine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/plaquenil) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Other conventional immunosuppressive medications such as [sulfasalazine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/sulfasalazine), [leflunomide](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/leflunomide), and [azathioprine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/azathioprine) should be withheld for one to two weeks following a vaccination dose. The ACR taskforce hasn't reached a consensus when it comes to recommendations concerning TNF inhibitors, oral calcineurin inhibitors, or IL-6R, IL-1, IL-17, IL-12/23, or IL-23. 4. Don't Worry About Minor Side Effects Studies have provided reassurance about side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines for people with RA. According to a [report published in JAMA in February 2022](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2789015), data from more than 5,000 people in 30 countries with rheumatic disease has indicated minimal problems after getting the shots. (The data was drawn from a voluntary registry collected by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology.) Some 70 percent of the people in the registry received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 8 percent got the Moderna vaccine, and the rest received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not available in the United States. While many of them experienced muscle pain or fever, which is a common side effect among all people, only 4 percent experienced a flare of their rheumatic disease, with most of the flares being mild or moderate. Just 1.5 percent needed a new medicine or increased dose of their drug to treat the symptoms of the flare. And only 0.5 percent of the vaccine recipients experienced a severe adverse event. A [review of research published in July 2022 in Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9289284/) found \"current evidence does not support increased risk of disease flare\" in patients with rheumatic disease after COVID-19 vaccination, though it notes that flares may be triggered by COVID-19 vaccination, especially in patients whose disease activity is high. But most of these flares, the review notes, are mild. And when British researchers assessed a database with more than 3,000 people with [rheumatic diseases](/rheumatic-diseases/guide/), they found no increase in disease flares requiring a [corticosteroid](https://www.everydayhealth.com/corticosteroids/guide/) prescription after COVID-19 vaccinations, according to a [study published in Rheumatology in September 2022](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keac484/6682823?login=false). [Common side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) for everyone getting a COVID-19 vaccine include pain, redness, and swelling in the arm that was injected, as well as tiredness, muscle pain, headaches, chills, fever, or nausea. Anyone experiencing these bothersome side effects should speak with their doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as [ibuprofen](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/ibuprofen), [acetaminophen](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/tylenol), [antihistamines](https://www.everydayhealth.com/antihistamine/guide/), or (for those 18 and over) [aspirin](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/aspirin), the CDC says. More serious adverse reactions should be reported to your doctor as well as to the federal government's [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/). Do remember that anyone can report anything to VAERS, so unless someone's adverse reaction was vetted by scientists, you should not necessarily give credence to social media reports of side effects people have seen on VAERS. 5. Keep Up Other Measures to Protect Yourself In addition to staying up-to-date with vaccinations, people who are immunocompromised from medication should continue to take all other COVID-19 precautions, advises the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html). This protection includes improving ventilation and filtration inside (opening windows, changing filters in HVAC systems), increasing distance and space from others, washing your hands often, and [taking a COVID-19 test](https://www.everydayhealth.com/coronavirus/dont-believe-these-covid-19-testing-myths/) if you develop symptoms or suspect you may have been exposed, wearing a mask. It is especially important to follow these steps when the level of transmission of the coronavirus in your community is rated as being [substantial or high](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view). It's also helpful to protect your respiratory system from being weakened by other respiratory diseases. The ACR released an [updated summary](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltee37abb6b278ab2c/bltee2557e046e57761/vaccinations-guideline-summary-2022.pdf), in February 2023, of new vaccination recommendations for flu, pneumococcal [pneumonia](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pneumonia/guide/) and other illnesses for people with rheumatic diseases. If you do contract COVID-19 and you're at a greater risk of getting severely sick, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html) urges you to contact your healthcare provider for antiviral treatment \u2014 [nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/paxlovid), [remdesivir (Veklury)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/remdesivir), or [molnupiravir (Lagevrio)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/lagevrio) "}
