BENEFITS OF CARE After completing a Forensic Anthropology Masters Degree, Dr. Sutphin was hit by a car while riding a bicycle. After a trip to the ER, she suffered through pain that was not relieved by the standard pain medication. After experiencing Chiropractic Care and getting immediate pain relief and release, she was inspired to change her career and focus on holistic healing. While in Chiropractic School, Acupuncture treatments provided her significant improvement with stress, fatigue, and PMS, Dr. Sutphin was inspired to blend Chiropractic with Acupuncture in care plans for faster results and benefits. The rest is history.

How long do I have to come in for care? **Based on your New Patient Exam, Dr. Sutphin will propose a customized Care Plan that may include: Chiropractic Care, Acupuncture, Manual Therapy, Dry Needling, Nutritional Supplement Consultation. Expect to come into the office 1-2 times a week for care. If 30% improvement does not occur within 5 appointments, Dr. Sutphin may propose outside help/referral for your care. This type of care is not just a 1 session deal...it takes time and repeat care in order for the body to heal and inflammation to go down. The first treatment session will establish the 'foundation' that continued care will build upon. This triggers a 'cumulative effect' where you will feel better after the follow up appointments.
