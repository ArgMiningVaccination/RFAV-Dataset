With more and more vaccinations happening every day, the concept of COVID-19 vaccine \"breakthrough\" cases \u2014 infections that occur despite vaccination \u2014 is becoming a more prominent part of the pandemic-era lexicon. Experts say serious post-vaccination coronavirus infections remain exceedingly rare. And now, many health agencies nationally will focus on breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization and death, rather than overall infections that include mild and asymptomatic cases, [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html). \"The goal is to figure out why, after being fully vaccinated, would someone get sick enough to be hospitalized or die,\" CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in a statement last week. \"This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance,\" she added. Among the CDC findings so far: - An estimated 1,359 COVID vaccine breakthrough infections resulted in hospitalization or death as of May 10. - The infections were reported by 46 states and territories, representing a fraction of more than 115 million Americans fully vaccinated at the time. - 1,080 of the serious breakthrough cases struck people ages 65 and older. - A total of 223 cases resulted in deaths, including 42 reported as asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19. The development came as many health officials defended [the CDC's new guidance allowing fully vaccinated people to stop wearing face coverings](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/05/17/new-york-lifting-mask-mandate-fully-vaccinated-questions/5130921001/) in most situations, which New York also adopted Wednesday.. \"The science is clear: If you are vaccinated against COVID-19, you are safe,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated Monday on social media. \"You can take off your mask (and) are not at risk of severe disease or hospitalization,\" [she wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1394346871900999697). The concept of breakthrough cases drew renewed interest in the sports world recently as the New York Yankees dealt with the infection of vaccinated players and coaches. The tally of [Yankees and staff members infected with COVID-19 increased to nine on Sunday](https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2021/05/16/new-york-yankees-covid-issues-aaron-hicks-il-giancarlo-stanton/5119817001/), fueling questions about how coronavirus infiltrated a marquee MLB franchise with robust vaccination rates. Further, it remains unclear how many vaccine breakthrough cases have been reported by each state to the CDC, which makes it difficult to evaluate aspects of the federal agency's analysis of the risk across the country. The rapidly evolving situation unfolded amid [heated debates among experts over loosening mask mandates](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/health/2021/05/14/cdc-mask-guidelines-vaccinated-people-confusing-message/5079359001/), as only about 40% of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated and coronavirus posed a continued threat. How many COVID vaccine breakthrough cases [Under the initial CDC system](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/past-breakthrough-data.html), 46 states and territories reported 9,254 COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases between January and April 26, representing a fraction of the more than 95 million people in the U.S. who had been fully vaccinated at the time. But federal officials have declined to provide the state-by-state breakdown of cases, making it difficult to determine how the CDC monitored the issue nationally. Masks: [What are the new rules for masks in New York? Your questions answered](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/05/17/new-york-lifting-mask-mandate-fully-vaccinated-questions/5130921001/) COVID: [NJ COVID capacity restrictions end, but indoor mask mandate remains](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/coronavirus/2021/05/18/nj-mask-mandate-covid-restrictions-capacity/5142294001/) For example, New York health officials this week reported 5,832 COVID vaccine breakthrough cases to date in the state, excluding New York City. The disclosure suggested the Empire State accounts for an abnormally large share of the cases analyzed by the CDC. But the CDC breakthrough infection numbers were likely an undercount because the system relied on voluntary reporting from state health departments, which may not be complete, according to the federal agency's website. Some real-world breakthrough cases were also missed because of the lack of testing, especially among asymptomatic or mild illness, the agency noted. Federal health officials did not immediately respond to questions about the issue, and the USA TODAY Network New York has filed a public-records request seeking the number of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough cases reported to CDC by each state. Of the more than 9,200 breakthrough infections reported nationally in late April, 835 cases resulted in hospitalizations, or 9%. And just 1%, or 132 cases, resulted in death, including 20 cases reported as asymptomatic or unrelated to COVID-19. The real-world results in part reinforced large trials last year showing the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 95% and 94.5% effective, respectively, for people who received two doses. The one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine reported better than 72% efficacy in large trials, which were conducted at a different time and potentially skewed comparisons to Pfizer and Moderna. CDC described its initial analysis of breakthrough cases as a snapshot intended to monitor vaccine breakthrough cases to identify any issues. No unexpected patterns have been identified in the case demographics or vaccine characteristics reported thus far, the agency noted. The federal agency officially transitioned to the new method of tracking and reporting breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization and death effective May 1, [according to its website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html). Studies underway at multiple U.S. sites will also continue to track all breakthrough infections to supplement the CDC's national surveillance, the website noted but didn't provide further details. What health officials say about Yankees' COVID outbreak The COVID-19 outbreak among Yankees [unfolded the week of May 9 during the team's trip to Florida](https://www.lohud.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2021/05/13/gleyber-torres-yankees-covid-injured-list/5080169001/), beginning with a handful of fully vaccinated coaches and support staff testing positive. Yankees shortstop Gleyber Torres on May 13 became the first fully vaccinated player on the team to test positive. His case proved unique because he previously contracted COVID-19 in December, joining the limited number of coronavirus reinfections reported nationally. Most of the Yankees staff and players have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the organization reported, adding it is consulting with state and federal health officials to respond to the outbreak that caused mild symptoms in at least one person. \"The incident with the Yankees is an example of the vaccines at work, with the vast majority impacted completely asymptomatic,\" New York state Department of Health spokeswoman Jill Montag said in a statement Monday. Amid the outbreak, Montag noted the team strictly followed \"public health protocols, including testing and contact tracing, to identify and contain the spread.\" The situation, Montag added, underscored the need for everyone ages 12 and older \"to get vaccinated to prevent spread completely and ensure that when an outbreak does occur, it does not lead to serious outcomes.\" Pete Caldera, USA TODAY Network MLB Writer, contributed to this report.
