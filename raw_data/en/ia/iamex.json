Native Americans have participated in clinical trials to ensure each vaccine is safe for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and other Indigenous peoples.9 IHS is just one federal agency providing vaccines to Native Americans. To find a location anywhere in the U.S., the CDC provides a website link for VaccineFinder, a free, online service where users can search for pharmacies and providers that offer vaccination for COVID-19 (https://vaccinefinder.org/search/).10 The American Lung Association developed this guide that will help clarify scientific facts, answer key questions about vaccines, and help Native Americans make well-informed decisions about staying healthy. 9 Indian Health Service 2021 Linkedin 1\u00b0 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021 Vaccine Finder The chart on the following page describes three types of vaccines that are either being researched or distributed throughout the U.S. Currently, the Pfizer vaccine is approved by the FDA and all three vaccines are recommended by the FDA: Pfizer-BioNTech (Comirnaty), Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer-BioNTech's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines are made with messenger RNA (mRNA) instead of weakened or inactivated virus. The mRNA provides our immune system cells with a map or instructions on how to make a \"spiked protein.\" This harmless protein is found on the surface of COVID-19 viruses, but it does not cause disease. In short, the vaccine teaches our immune system to make the \"spiked protein,\" which in turn triggers the response to produce antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. 36 Spiked protein These two vaccines do not contain live or weakened virus and they do not interact with your body's DNA (genetic material). Also, neither vaccine contains preservatives, eggs, or latex. Their inactive ingredients are oil, sugar, and salt. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots: the first shot starts to build protection, and the second shot that is given a few weeks later is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer. 37 Johnson & Johnson/Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine is the third vaccine recommended for use by the FDA. Johnson & Johnson uses a harmless modified version of a different virus, also known as a viral vector. A small piece of the genetic instructions with coronavirus genes for the SARS- COV-2 spike protein is added to the vector. After vaccination, the modified virus enters a person's cells which read and follow the genetic instructions needed to make the spike protein on their own surface. The immune system takes notice of these foreign proteins and makes antibodies against them that will protect you, if they are ever exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in the future.38 All three of these vaccines are safe and available for the public. You can find a vaccine location anywhere in the U.S. through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website link for VaccineFinder, a free, online service where users can search for pharmacies and providers that offer vaccination for COVID-19 (https://vaccinefinder.org/search/).39 36 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 Understanding ... 37 1bid. 38 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 Understanding ... 39 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021 COV/D-19 ...Before the COVID-19 vaccines, the fastest vaccine ever developed was for mumps and took 4 years. This has given some people pause about the rapid production of the COVID-19 vaccines. Fortunately, the methods for the vaccines' speedy development were scientific and ethical. The shaded area below explains how FDA accelerated the approval process. Strong Head Start It's important to understand that since COVID-19 is a member of the coronavirus family, scientists benefited from existing data and years of vaccine research that began with SARS (2002) and MERS (2012). These viruses laid the groundwork so that the scientists didn't have to start from scratch to develop a vaccine. Additionally, researchers advanced mRNA technology which had already been studied for decades. This technology does not involve a live virus and is easier to manufacture. Global Cooperation The speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccines was accomplished through worldwide cooperation and data-sharing among international researchers, scientists, and government agencies. Chinese researchers shared the needed viral genome sequence with 20 institutions in January of 2020, and the World Health Organization combined the work of 300 scientists to make important assessments about the virus. Plus, because scientists utilized mRNA technology, they were able to start testing within months. Unprecedented Investment Developing a vaccine under normal circumstances requires researchers to spend time raising millions of dollars. That's why the U.S. Congress, through the CARES Act, dedicated $10 billion to the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine research and development. These financial commitments took years off of the usual process. Working in Parallel Vaccine development is usually done in a step\u00ad by-step order. To expedite the COVID-19 vaccine, many processes were done simultaneously instead. Manufacturing of potential vaccines began before they were proven to work so that they could be sent out soon after approval. Likewise, instead of waiting for the final vaccine, The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices held early meetings to prioritize the distribution of the vaccine before it was even developed. Efficient Clinical Trial Processes While experts agree that rigorous safety testing, patient enrollment and clinical trial phases were not \"fast-tracked,\" the paperwork for regulatory approval was accelerated. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration shortened its approval timeline from 10 months to 3 weeks and offered emergency use authorization. And because of the large number of testing sites and increased volunteer interest, trial participation quickly reached tens of thousands. Phase 2 and 3 of clinical trials were combined (a common practice), and that helped to ethically speed the process along. CLINICAL TRIALS About Clinical Trials Human clinical trials are tests done in a clinical research setting to observe the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. All clinical trials include a series of mandatory phases that must be completed before a vaccine can be approved for dissemination. Many Native Americans are concerned that the clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine were rushed. This is not the case. Take a look at how classical trials compare to COVID-i9 trials in the graphic below. Preclinical Stage: Scientists test a new vaccine on cells and then on animals to see if the vaccine triggers an immune response. Phase 1 Safety Trials: Scientists give the vaccine to 30-100 people to test for safety, dosage, and confirm immune response. Phase 2 Expanded Trials: Scientists give the vaccine to several hundred people who are divided into target populations and demographics to test if the vaccine acts differently in them. Phase 3 Efficacy Trials: Scientists give the vaccine to 20,000 to 30,000 people and wait to see how many become infected compared to participants who receive a placebo. This phase is large enough to reveal evidence of rare side effects. Native Americans participated in the Phase 3 Trials for the COVID-i9 vaccines. 42 Phase 4 Post Marketing Surveillance: Scientists observe the vaccine in the general population with attention to long-term effects. 42 Center for American Indian Health 2021 Understandin g ... 43 Calina 2020 Where can I get the vaccine for me and my family? The IHS gave the tribes the option to either receive vaccines from the IHS or from the state in which the tribe was located. Each IHS or tribal clinic has its own plan for vaccination. Contact your local IHS clinic or hospital or tribal clinic to find out the dates and places for vaccination. If you are not close to a IHS clinic or tribal clinic, contact your county regional health district or your state health department to find out where and when the COVID-19 vaccine will be available. 45 The goal is for everyone eligible to be able to get a COVID-19 vaccination as soon as large quantities of vaccine are available. 46 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021 Frequently ... 46 lbid. 47 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021 When ...What are the most common side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine? After getting vaccinated, you may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. The most common side effects are pain and swelling in the arm where you received the shot. In addition, you may have fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. 46 What can I do differently once I am vaccinated? CDC has come out with new guidelines for when you have been fully vaccinated. When you are 2 weeks out from your final dose, you can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask. You can also gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household without masks as long as they are not at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.47 0 BEING A VACCINE AMBASSADOR: SOCIAL MEDIA Inspire your social networks to get the answers they need to make a solid vaccine decision by sharing this guide.
