Homeopathy is a medical art and science. It is a truly holistic approach to health as it emphasizes people rather than disease. Homeopathy is based on the principle that \"Like Cures Like\". Give the body what it is suffering with or from and the body will naturally realign itself to a state of health. Founded in the 1700's by the German Physician and Chemist Samuel Hahnemann, homeopathy continues, two hundred years later, to treat and prevent illness. Homeopathic medicines are among the safest known: non-allergenic, non-toxic, free of side effects and have no known drug interactions. They are prepared from herbal, mineral and animal substances and made in accordance with the HPUS (Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States) and regulated by the FDA. Homeopathic remedies act curatively and preventively by raising your general level of health by strengthening your own internal defense mechanism or immune system. What can Homeopathy Treat? What can Homeopathy Treat? Homeopathy treats all illnesses whether they are of a general medical, pediatric, gynecological or psychological nature. The homeopath sees each patient as a unique individual with a unique personality and unique set of symptoms. This means that six persons with the same illness might each get a different homeopathic remedy. Because homeopathy treats the individual and not just the disease, it has been proven very effective in treating mental and emotional conditions as well as long standing chronic illness. Many cases of the following have successfully been resolved using homeopathy: - Depression - Chronic Fatigue - ADD - Menstrual pain - Arthritis - Menopause Symptoms - Fibroids - Chronic Pain - Migranes - PMS Children can benefit greatly from homeopathic care. Physical ailments such as: - Chronic ear infections - Sore throats - Colds - Asthma can be successfully treated. Even children diagnosed with ADD, Developmental delays and other behavioral problems have experienced dramatic improvements. The Role of your Naturopathic Specialist. The Role of your Naturopathic Specialist. Because Naturopathic treatment and homeopathy involves treating the whole patient, the initial homeopathic interview is detail oriented and complete in scope. Your Naturopathic Physician takes a careful health history and performs a physical examination when necessary. The Physician listens to all of your symptoms, then uses them to select a homeopathic remedy. The more individualized and unusual your symptoms are, the easier it is to find a homeopathic medicine that uniquely matches you. Classical homeopathic practitioners only prescribe one remedy at a time, based on the Law of Similars or \"let like treat like\". Your Naturopathic Physician will spend time learning about you as a whole individual, not just a set of symptoms. Look at your relationship with your Naturopath as a health partnership.
