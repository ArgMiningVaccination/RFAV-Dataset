This can upset the planning quite a bit. To give an example, the current higher education costs for an MBA at a premier institute in India stands at Rs. 2,892,000. Let's say, you have a newborn in your family. Factoring in inflation at a rate of 5%, by the time your child reaches 21 years, the cost of the MBA degree would have shot up to Rs. 9,326,989, nearly 3.5x times the current fees.

Once you have an idea of how much it costs start saving and investing for your child's future. With the right financial planning, you can enjoy the joys of parenting without continually being overshadowed by financial worries. Key Takeaways - A child definitely brings immense joy, but along with it is an additional financial responsibility for which you need to pre-plan accordingly. - Right from the time a baby is born to a phase of adulthood, the cost of raising a child only increases. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have everything covered. - In short, you have to take into account every cost to be incurred at all life stages of your child. This includes prenatal care, delivery charges, infant, toddler, school expenses, college fees, and post-graduation expenses. These can be categorized into standard needs. - Apart from these, you may have to fulfill demands like an expensive gadget, clothes, trips with friends, etc. While doing cost analysis, parents should factor in the cost of inflation so that their efforts do not go haywire.
