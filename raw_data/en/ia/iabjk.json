Oats made history when they became the first food with a Food and Drug Administration health claim label in 1997. The health claim was related to heart health and showed intake of whole oat products decreased blood cholesterol levels. Oats contain a type of soluble fiber, called beta glucan, which lowers blood glucose and cholesterol levels, thus reducing risk of heart disease and diabetes. Beta glucan also promotes healthy gut bacteria and intestinal health. Eating oatmeal regularly can have weight management benefits as a half-cup of rolled oats cooked in a cup of water has 165 calories, 4 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein. The fiber and protein content contribute to feeling full longer and a slower blood glucose release. Oats also are an excellent source of many vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, copper, thiamine and zinc. You may see a few different kinds of oats in the grocery store, including steel-cut, rolled, quick or instant. Steel-cut oats, also called Irish oatmeal, are the whole oat kernel that has been cut into two or three pieces using steel disks. This type of oats contains the highest amount of fiber, as it is least processed. Steel-cut oats take a little longer to cook, and result in a creamy and chewy porridge. Steel-cut oats can be made in a slow cooker, making the process less hands-on. Rolled oats, or regular oats, are rolled flat to make them easier to cook. Most of the bran is removed, so they have slightly less fiber than steel-cut oats, but they take less time to cook. Quick oats are rolled oats that have been rolled thinner and cut into small pieces, so they cook even faster. Instant oats come in single-serve packets that are typically flavored, and can be added to hot water or cooked in the microwave in minutes. While instant oats cook the fastest, they usually have quite a bit of added sugar and less fiber than other types of oats. Oats have a nice flavor on their own, but if you're tired of plain oatmeal here are a few ideas to try: - Baked oatmeal results in an oat cakelike texture and is a great way to take care of a week's worth of breakfasts at once. - Overnight oats usually mean mixing rolled or quick oats with some type of milk and yogurt, and leaving in the fridge overnight. This results in a creamy refreshing oatmeal mixture. - Oats are also a good way to make your morning smoothie more filling. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup rolled oats to your blender first and grind until fine. Then add the rest of your smoothie ingredients as usual. It produces a thicker smoothie that has the staying power of oatmeal. With these preparation methods, you have many options to play with the flavor. Fruit, raisins and nuts are popular. Here are some other ideas to play with: - For flavor and texture, try unsweetened coconut, chopped cashews or sliced almonds. - For natural sweetness, add chopped dates, dried cranberries or applesauce. - Increase the protein with pumpkin seeds, a swirl of nut butter or a dollop of Greek yogurt. - Up the soluble fiber even more with chia seeds or ground flax. - Instead of plain cinnamon, add a couple pinches of pumpkin pie spice. - If you're feeling indulgent, add a couple drops of vanilla extract and peanut butter for a peanut butter cookie flavor, or vanilla extract, cocoa powder and a ripe banana for chocolate oatmeal.
