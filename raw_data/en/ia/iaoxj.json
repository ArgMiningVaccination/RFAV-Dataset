The following provides an update of recent health-related initiatives of the School. BIOMOLECULAR SCIENCES INSTITUTE (BSI) Director: Dr. Yuk-Ching Tse-Dinh A Biomolecular Sciences Institute investigator te am of experts in cancer biology, DNA repair, and drug screening has been awarded $75,000 by the Community Foundation of Broward to continue the project \"Investigation of Novel Tr eatment for Advanced Prostate Cancer.\" During the first year, a new screening method to identify DNA repair inhibitors was developed. During the second year, this screening method will be utilized to identify FDA-approved drugs that are the most effective at inhibiti ng DNA repair in prostate cancer cells. The strongest inhibitors will be tested in androgen -dependent and treatment-resistant cell lines for their ability to synergistically impair prostate cancer cells when combined with castration therapy. The effects of castration therapy wi ll be reproduced in cell cultures either by androgen deprivation or by anti-androgen treatm ent. The results are expected to increase the likelihood of developing effective treatments for recurrent cancers that have been resistant to prior therapy. CENTER FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (CCF) Director: Dr. William Pelham The Center for Children and Families (CCF) is a multidisciplinary team of researchers and service providers committed to improving the liv es of children with mental health problems and their families. The CCF is the leading prov ider of evidence-based services for children with ADHD in Miami, and since its establishm ent in 2010, it has served approximately 10,000 families across clinical and research programs. The renowned Summer Treatment Program (STP) (summer 2016) served 264 children, and was expanded to include other mental health conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disord er and Selective Mutism. A new Pre-K STP was developed in Little Haiti at Thena Crowder Elementary School. The CCF Summer Reading Explorers Program, an intervention designed to improve literacy skills in young children, (summer 2016) served 1659 children. Throughout the last academic year (2015-16), the CCF has hosted talks by 22 mental health experts, an d attendance of the center's Speaker Series and free Community Workshop events reached ov er 1000 individuals. More than 2000 online workshops and keynotes have been viewed thro ugh the CCF online evidence-based training website, http://effectivechildtherapy.fiu.edu/ . 24FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Update September 1, 2016 Page 2 In addition to the 23 million in research support leveraged by state funding during the fall of 2015, CCF faculty obtained an additional th ree awards amounting to $973,287 in the third quarter of 2015-2016. In the 4th quarter, the CCF began implementation of four Children's Trust funded summer programs that applied award winning behavioral interventions for children ranging from pre-school age through middle school spanning Miami-Dade County. Also in that period, CCF faculty obtained new NIMH and IES fundi ng totaling $475K. In recognition of its accomplishments, the CCF and it s faculty have been the recipient of multiple awards, including the 2016 Miami Beacon Counc il Life Sciences and Healthcare Award in recognition of the importance and quality of CCF work in the arena of clinical services. COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE A ND IMAGING CENTER (CNIC) Director: Dr. Angela Laird The Cognitive Neuroscience and Imaging Center is a multidisciplinary group of faculty focusing on understanding mental processes in the healthy and diseased human brain across the lifespan. The FIU Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) and CNIC have acquired a 3.0 Tesla Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma to support magnetic resonance imaging research at FIU. This MRI was installed in the reno vated health clinic area of PG-5 in August of 2016, and is expected to be operational for research studies by October 2016. The instrument will be used to acquire functional and structural neuroimaging data for the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (PIs: Raul Gonzalez and Angela Laird) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health at $12.7M over five years. It will also provide liver elastography data for the Miami Adult Studie s on HIV (MASH) Study (PI Marianna Baum), and data for multiple other pilot imaging proj ects by CNIC members and their collaborators. 25 Report to the Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee September 2016 College of Medicine spearheads partnership to create FIU-FAST Team If ever disaster strikes, the FIU-Florida Ad vanced Surgical Transport team (FIU-FAST) is trained, ready, and equipped to treat and evacuate critical care patients. Under the leadership of Founding Dean and Sr. VP fo r Health Affairs John A. Rock, the already established FAST Team partnered with th e Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine (HWCOM), and the FIU Department of Emergency Management to enhance the only civilian team of its kind in the nation, that can supplement local hospital critical care and ICU capabilities following a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other major incident. The FIU-FAST team has the ability an d training to set up a ten-bed intensive care unit to perform life-saving surgical procedures and critical care, as well as transport critical care patients to and fr om hospitals in civilia n or military planes. The new FIU-FAST team is supported by community partners that include Baptist Health South Florida, the Batchelor Founda tion, Florida Blue, Leon Medical Centers, and Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Our Students Launch the Florida Medical Student Research Journal The inaugural Florida Medical Student Resear ch Journal (FMSRJ) was founded by two third-year medical students: Co-editors in Chief, Emily S. Andersen and Roy Lipworth. FMSRJ \"allows students the unique opportunity to prepare for a future in academic medicine,\" and aims to \"bridge the gap duri ng those early years of medical students' careers when unfamiliarity with publishing and peer-review are most prevalent.\" There are just a handful of similar student initiatives across the country. 2016 Sapphire Celebration Gala raised over $1 million In celebration of the 10th anniversary of its founding, HWCOM held its third Sapphire Celebration Gala on Saturday, April 9, at the InterContinental Miami. The event brought together more than 500 of South Flor ida's medical, business, philanthropic, and civic leaders for an exclusive evening featurin g a luxury silent auction, dinner, music, dancing, award presentation, and a drawing for a 2016 Red Corvette Stingray. The gala raised over $1 million for student scholarsh ips, medical education, and training programs. 26FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Update September 1, 2016 Page 2 Match Day The Class of 2016 students matched into 17 di fferent specialties in 26 states and the District of Columbia, and its 98% placement rate surpassed the national average of 95%. More than half of the class (58%) is pursuing specialties in primary care where there is a critical shortage of physicians nationwide. A dozen of the recent graduates have chosen to remain in South Florida to care for our local population. Graduation/Patient Receives Teaching Award On Saturday, May 7, HWCOM awarded 108 medical degrees as well as a medal to a patient who, despite having no medical training, is helping to teach medicine. The Green Family Foundation Community Teac hing Award was designed to recognize that the people who allow our students into their communities and homes to learn first- hand about the social determinants of he alth are in essence an extension of our instructional faculty. The inaugural award re cipient is Manolina Sosa, one of the first household members recruited into the NeighborhoodHELP program. Awards and Recognitions John A.

Additionally, the Challenge supports the rigorous scientific review pr ocess for all Foundation grants and scholarships. Since its inception in 1989, 264 schools have participated in raising over $3.3 million for physical therapy research. Alumni Spotlight The Kansas City Chiefs recently hired Tiffany Morton as their newest athletic trainer, the team's first female to fill this role. Mo rton is from Miami, Fla., where she completed the Athletic Training Program (AT) at the FIU-NWCNHS . The National Athletic Trainers Association said that in recent years it has seen a significant rise in the percentage of female members in the male-dominated organization. As a trailblazer, Morton is leading the way, however, the public should expect to see more women trainers working with professional and college teams. FIU- NWCNHS administration, faculty and staff work diligently to ensure all of its programs provide an aggregate of courses and field expe riences that enriches its students overall academic experiences. The AT program has demonstrated that with great precedence of a rigorous curriculum, its students can an d will continue to blaze trails in practice and research within their respective fields. 33 This page intentionally left blank STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS Health Initiatives Committee June 23 , 2016 SUBJECT: Minutes of January 21, 2016 Committee Meeting and February 11, 2016 Committee Workshop PROPOSED COMMITTEE ACTION Approval of the minutes of the following two meeting s: Committee Meeting held on January 21, 2016, at Florida State University Committee Workshop held on February 11 , 2016, at the University of South Florida AUTHORITY FOR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ACTION Article IX, Section 7, Florida Constitution BACKGROUND INFORMATION Committee members will review and approve the minutes of the meeting s held on January 21, 2016, and February 11, 2016. Supporting Documentation Included: Minutes, January 21, 2016 Minutes, February 11, 2016 Facilitators/Presenters: Governor Ed Morton 341 MINUTES STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS HEALTH INITIATIVES COMMITTEE FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY TALLAHASSEE, FL ORIDA JANUARY 21, 2016 Video or audio archives of the meetings of the Board of Governors and its Committees are accessible at http://www.flbog.edu 1. Call to Order Chair Ed Morton convened the meeting at 11:07 a.m. on January 21, 2016 with the following members present and answering roll call: Governor Beard, Governor Doyle , Governor Levine , and Governor Valverde . Governor Morton gave a general introduction to the draft Strategic Plan for Health and the need for the Committee's feedback during the meeting. He discussed how the Committee's work fit with wider conversations about ensuring that the state university graduates have degrees that align with employer needs, particularly within the health care sector. 2. Meeting Minutes Governor Valverde moved that the Committee approve the minutes of the September 2 , 2015 meeting, as presented. Governor Doyle seconded the motion and members concurred. 3. Update on the Health Initiatives Strategic Plan Ms. Amy Beaven, Director of STEM and Health Initiatives with the Board of Governors office, presented an update on the Strategic Planning process, including the identification of short -term and long -term priorities from the Committee's environmental scan findings and discussions with key constituency groups in each of the goal areas. She then dis cussed the goals, priorities, and strategies in the Committee's draft Strategic Plan. Ms. Beaven presented the first goal of meeting the health workforce needs in Florida and identified two priority areas (the need for more physician residencies and the need for more nursing faculty) and three strategies. She then presented the second goal of increasing the competitiveness of health -related research across the State University System. Three health- related research priorities have been identified in the ne ar-term: to 352 build data -sharing and \"big data\" infrastructure, to invest in strategic research facilities, and to incentivize research collaboration and commercialization. Ms. Beaven welcomed any questions or direction from the Committee on the goals and pr iorities in the draft. She noted that the Committee would have a February workshop to gather additional information on specific actions and estimated costs associated with the Strategic Plan strategies from system experts and members of the Health Initiatives Advisory Group . After the presentation, several members made comments about the quantity and quality of graduate medical education (GME) in Florida. Governors Valverde, Levine, and Morton each emphasized the need for additional residency positions to strategically fill current gaps . Governor Valverde noted that in Florida 55% of doctors are over age 50 and only 10% are under 35, making a doctor shortage very likely in the future . He noted the annual cost of a residency position is between $80,000 and $100,000. When the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services funded graduate medical education more readily, these programs were attractive to hospitals . Limited federal funding means that hospitals have less incentives to create new GME programs . Other entities, such as the SUS institutions, will need to play a more active role in establishing the GME programs needed to meet the state's needs. Any request for state funding should target unmet demand for specific physician specialties and regions of the s tate. Governors Tripp and Frost discussed the quality of residencies, their competiveness, and the ability to retain and/or attract top medical school graduates for Florida residency programs. Governor Levine noted that residency programs will have to mee t quality standards to be accredited and the greater issue is identifying where Florida needs new or expanded programs and matching resources to those needs. He noted that enhancing research would build quality as well. He then motioned for the Committee t o approve the Strategic Plan for Health as presented. Governor Doyle seconded the motion and the Committee voted for approval. 4. Closing Remarks and Adjournment Chair Morton closed the meeting by suggesting that Florida can have the best in health care and research if there are bold goals, a shared vision , and commitment of resources to achieve them . He adjourned the meeting at 11:34 a.m. Ed Morton , Chair Amy Beaven , Director, STEM and Health Initiatives 361 MINUTES STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS HEALTH INITIATIVES COMMITTEE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA TAMPA , FLORIDA FEBRUARY 11, 2016 Video or audio archives of the meetings of the Board of Governors and its Committees are accessible at http://www.flbog.edu 1. Call to Order Chair Ed Morton convened the meeting at 1:00 p .m. on February 11, 2016, with the following members present and answering roll call: Governor Beard, Governor Valverde , and Governor Robinson (by phone). Also participating in the workshop from the Health Initiatives Advisory Committee were Celeste Philip from the Department of Health, John Mines from the Florida Hospital Association (substituting for Bruce Rueben), Mary Lou Brunell from the Florida Center for Nursing, and Andres Gil from the SUS Vice Presidents for Research. Amy Beaven, Christy England -Siegerdt, and Vikki Shirley were present as staff of the Board of Governors. Governor Morton op ened by stating that the purpose of the workshop was to ask questions and to get ideas on strategies that advance the goals set out in the Health Strategic Plan . He emphasized the importance of the Committee's efforts in looking at gaps in the health workf orce and the healthcare sector's large contribution to jobs, economic development, and cutting- edge research in Florida. 2. Review Strategic Plan for Health Ms. Beaven gave a brief history on the Committee's environmental scan process, noting that the Committee took a S ystem -wide look at Florida's health workforce, health care delivery, and health -related research and drew comparisons to national trends . The findings from the environmental scan were used to inform a Health Strategic Plan with two goals and five priorities. The focus of the presentations for the workshop would be two potential grant programs to advance the first goal of meeting the workforce needs of Florida, and one grant program to advance the second goal of increasing the competitiveness of h ealth -related research for the S ystem. Each of the initial strategies were chosen among the strategic plan priorities because they are actionable within the next year and could be potentially supported through grant funding similar to the Board's successful TEAm grant model . 372 3. Critical Area: Physician Residencies Ms. Beaven introduced Dean Michael Good from the University of Florida 's College of Medicine as the first presenter. Dr. Good noted that he was speaking on behalf of the Council of Florida Medical School Deans as he presented a background on graduate medical education (GME) for Florida and made recommendations for a competitiv e grant program for GME expansion. Dean Good 's presentation addressed the critical role that GME plays in educating the physician workforce. He noted the fundamental problem of not having enough residency positions in the state to ensure that there will b e enough physicians to meet near -term health needs in Florida. Without an expansion of medical residency positions, the state will fall further behind in the training and recruitment of physicians. He estimated that Florida needs to create between 500- 800 new first -year positions to keep up with the pace of growth in the medical schools and approximately 3,400 overall residency slots ( representing multiple years of the 3 -6 year residencies ) to bring Florida up to the national average for number of residents per 100,000 population. Based on growth in Florida's population and the unique demographics of the state, just coming up to the national ave rage may be a conservative measure of the need . Dean Good addressed several issues: the long pipeline of education and training for a physician, medical school growth in recent years, physician retention trends for those educated in Florida, funding trends for GME (sources and shares of the funding), costs of GME to institutional providers and sponsors, and recent initiatives to expand GME in Florida. He noted that Florida currently has 51 sponsors for 161 residency programs, with roughly 54% of the 3,800 current residency positions sponsored by an SU S medical school. Dean Good noted the attractiveness of a competitive grant program to fund innovative strategies to start- up and/or expand residency programs around the state. The nine medical schools in Florida are already a source of leadership and coordination for GME programs and a dedicated funding source for that work could directly increase GME in the state. He emphasized the need for plans that would maintain the financial stability of the programs after t he grant period ends. He suggested a role for the Physician Workforce Advisory Group in establishing where GME data collection and coordination happens in the state. He concluded that Florida has about 3,800 residents currently in training and need s anothe r 3,400 just to come up to the national average based on population . Governor Valverde calculated the cost for an additional 3,400 positions to be about $350 million dollars and noted that , even with recent state efforts , Florida is far under budget to ac hieve this number of positions. He questioned whether savings from Medicaid's transition to managed care could be re -directed from the state's general fund back to the 383 Agency for Healthcare Administration (AHCA) for GME. However, John Mines with the Florid a Hospital Association suggested that the state has not actually realized the projected savings and the actual costs of managed care have been higher than anticipated, leaving no recoverable funds for GME. Governor Beard noted that an appropriate first go al may be the creation of 500 first year positions to mirror the recent growth in the number of medical school graduates. Dean Good explained that the 500 post -graduate year one ( PGY -1) positions would be a start but there would need to be funding for each year of the 3- 6 year residency programs, essentially multiplying the number of first year positions by the length of the program to get to the full program capacity figures. Governor Morton expressed the need to ge t people's attention on the consequences and economic impact of not having an adequate supply of physicians. He asked about making the economic case for expanding GME and being able to tell the story of the return on investment of expansion and the costs to the state and to quality of care if we don't expand it. There was conversation about comparing patient outcomes in Florida to other states that have more medical residents and physicians on a per population basis. The group discussed Robert Wood Johnson county health rankings and Dartmouth Atlas as data sources, and the need to include socioeconomic status (SES) in the consideration of health outcomes (medical care only contributes about 20% to health outcomes) . Celeste Philip noted current funding opport unities through Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to gauge how clinical systems impact SES determinants of health. 4. Critical Area: Nurse Faculty Pipeline Ms. Beaven introduced Dean Dianne Morrison -Beedy from the University of South Florida's College of Nursing to provide a present ation on nursing faculty shortages. Dr. Morrison -Beedy noted that she was presenting on successful innovations based on input from all of the SUS nursing school deans and directors. She also stated that any or all of the strategies could be funded by a grant in the short -term. She described the national shortage of nursing faculty as a big challenge and said any plans for the SUS would need to be bold in decision -making, intentional in its strategies, and genuine in what's best for residents of Florida. She noted an increase in the demand for nurses with advanced education, such as the Bachelor of Scie nce in Nursing (BSN); recent increases in employer vacancies for RNs; preference in hiring nurses with a BSN; high stud ent demand for SUS nursing programs; and better patient outcomes linked to the higher education of nurses. High quality nurses are coming out of the SUS programs. There was discussion on the number of nurses graduating from SUS programs compared to other sectors of education in Florida. Mary Lou Brunell from the Florida Center for Nursing noted that when one consider s both ASN and BSN programs, the 394 SUS is gr aduating 10- 15% of Florida's registered nursing graduates. She also noted that there has not been a significant increase in the number of pre -licensure BSN nursing graduates recently, whereas there have been large increases of ASN and RN -BSN graduates. Dean Morrison -Beedy noted that expansion in the SUS is constrained by the number of faculty. Dean Morrison -Beedy demonstrated the exponential impact between one educator, the 12,000 students he/she trains, and the 23 million patients the students in turn c are for over a 40- year faculty career. She then described the high number of faculty due to retire soon ; the burdensome professional requirements (especially for maintaining the nursing license) ; and the rigors of balancing research , clinical assessments of students, classroom teaching loads , and clinical practice. She noted that most nurses do no t choose to teach because the compensation and workload for nursing faculty is not as appealing as private sector practice. The pipeline of PhD students is also not adequate to meet future faculty vacancies. Dr. Morrison -Beedy then described several short -term innovations that could target recruitment and retention of nursing faculty. She described USF's successful INFORM program and noted that either the entire program or selected components could be implemented by the other SUS nursing programs. Govern or Morton expressed the need for strategic direction in increasing the number of nurses coming out of the SUS BSN programs. He asked whether expanding these programs and securing the resources to do so was seen as a priority by the institutions and by the System. He stressed that the System needs to look at faculty salaries in addition to qualitative elements. Ms. Beaven noted that the focus of the workshop was short -term elements that could be funded with a grant program and that the nursing deans had also offered written recommendations on long- term strategies, including salary issues. Ms. Brunell suggested that the institutions and Committee consider the mix of faculty required to teach in the BSN programs versus the graduate programs. She noted there is a need to educate PhD students to teach in the graduate programs but she asked how many faculty, and at what level, would be needed to double the number of BSN graduates. The salary differences may not be as large between early -career private practice and teaching if administrators are able to hire younger, junior faculty. She noted the faculty recruitment and retention strategies may be different depending on the end goals and the programs that need to be expand ed. Governor Robinson noted tuition waivers for SUS employees as one strategy to support the train ing of future faculty. Governor Morton concluded that expanding the nursing program capacity in the SUS is a priority and we need the experts to take on the lon g-term strategies to fix the problem. Governor Valverde asked why so many students choose private nursing programs and Dr. Morrison -Beedy noted that the SUS programs are limited access programs. Many of 405 those students would choose the SUS schools if there was infrastructure and resources to expand capacity. 5. Critical Area: Building Upon Federal SBIR/STTR Awards Ms. Beaven introduced Dr. MJ Soileau, Vice President for Research and Commercialization at the University of Central Florida to present a matching grant program for federal SBIR/STTR awards. He noted that with state funds for a matching grant program the SUS would be able to enhance research, increase collaboration between Florida industry and university research, promote \"born here, grow here\" companies, provide opportunities to students, and build from a proven model. Dr. Soileau described the federal SBIR/STTR program and noted that 3% of federal agency budgets are set aside to fund small business innovation grants under this program. He desc ribed the current Florida High T ech Corridor program , which match es federal SBIR/STTR awards for businesses partnering with UCF, USF and UF. In some cases, the businesses that apply for the federal awards are members of the universities ' business incubator programs. The SBIR/STTR award is a means for Florida companies to tap into early stage capital. The matching program is a way to encourage small businesses to partner with and pay SUS researchers for their expertise and use of specialized equipment . In turn, a company is more likely to be successful because it does not have to fully fund its own research and development (R&D) at such an early business stage. Dr. Soileau noted that a Phase I award for Proof of Concept is for 6 -12 months and is not a lot of money (up to $150K), but is a way to get started. The Phase II awards are for a full R&D effort and provide up to $1M which is attractive, especially if matched. Phase III is the commercialization stage and has no federal funds. Dr. Soileau no ted that through the Florida High Tech Corridor Program, UCF has s een an increase in f aculty and student engagement with private companies and significant multipliers of economic impact from the original investment. He noted that other states have matchin g programs and Florida currently gets about half of what other successful states with matching programs are getting from the NIH SBIR/STTR program. He then discussed ideas for pairing research expertise across the System using available data and data min ing software. For health -related research there could be benefit to connecting medical faculty with other researchers in the university(s) through the posting/advertisement for a needed expertise or specific technology challenge. Governor Morton asked if the multiplier effect from matching the SBIR/STTR awards is well understood by the local economic development groups around the state. He also asked if more SUS institutions should be going after SBIR/STTR funds. Dr. Soileau confir med that the economic development groups have made some efforts to bring in 416 this federal money and our universities currently work with those groups to do more. Dr. Good noted that the multiplier effect of these funds hasn't always been well understood, bu t for good research teams there are multiples of $4 -11 for every dollar invested. Dr. Gil suggested a growing awareness and growing need to partner with industry in light of the shrinking federal budget for research. He said FIU has increased its efforts through the incubator program to go after SBIR/STTR awards and to increase technology transfer . He also noted that the program is a good way to maximize a university's core facilities, by allowing companies to pay for use of the specialized equipment. Gove rnor Morton and Governor Valverde thought expanding the Florida High Tech Corridor model to more SUS schools through a state matching grant program was a good strategy. 6. Closing Remarks and Adjournment Governor Beard suggested the Committee set goals for each of the topics presented in the workshop. Chair Morton agreed and adjourned the meeting at 4:00 p .m. Ed Morton , Chair Amy Beaven , Director, STEM and Health Initiatives 42STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF FLORIDA BOARD OF GOVERNORS Health Initiatives Committee June 23 , 2016 SUBJECT: Update on Strategic Plan Priorities: Request for Proposals and LBR Process PROPOSED COMMITTEE ACTION For i nformation AUTHORITY FOR BOARD OF GOVERNORS ACTION Article IX, Section 7, Florida Constitution BACKGROUND INFORMATION Earlier this year, the Health Initiatives Committee approved a Health Strategic Plan that includes goals, priorit ies, and strategies to meet the most pressing needs identified in the Committee's environmental scan. The Committee also convened a workshop in February to gather additional information on specific actions and estimated costs associated with the Strategic Pla n strategies. At the workshop, the Committee heard presentations from Dr. Michael Good representing the Council of Florida Medical School Deans, Dr. Dianne Morrison -Beedy representing the SUS Nursing School Deans and Directors, and Dr. M.J. Soileau represe nting the SUS Vice Presidents for Research. The Committee will receive an update on three proposed grant programs that align with the workforce and research goals of the Health Strategic Plan .
