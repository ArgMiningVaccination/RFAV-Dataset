[] General Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) The non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies with differing patterns of behavior and responses to treatment.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s1.1)] Like Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. NHL, however, is much less predictable than Hodgkin lymphoma and has a far greater predilection to disseminate to extranodal sites. The prognosis depends on the histological type, stage, and treatment. Incidence and Mortality Estimated new cases and deaths from NHL in the United States in 2023:[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s1.2)] - New cases: 80,550. - Deaths: 20,180. Anatomy NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues. Anatomy of the lymph system. Prognosis and Survival NHL can be divided into two prognostic groups: the indolent lymphomas and the aggressive lymphomas. Indolent NHL types have a relatively good prognosis, with a median survival as long as 20 years, but they usually are not curable in advanced clinical stages.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s1.3)] Early-stage (stage I and stage II) indolent NHL can be effectively treated with radiation therapy alone. Most of the indolent types are nodular (or follicular) in morphology. The aggressive type of NHL has a shorter natural history, but a significant number of these patients can be cured with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens. In general, with modern treatment of patients with NHL, the overall survival rate at 5 years is over 60%. More than 50% of patients with aggressive NHL can be cured. Most relapses occur in the first 2 years after therapy. The risk of late relapse is higher in patients who manifest both indolent and aggressive histologies.[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s1.4)] While indolent NHL is responsive to immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, a continuous rate of relapse is usually seen in advanced stages. However, patients can often be re-treated with considerable success if the disease histology remains low grade. Patients who present with or convert to aggressive forms of NHL may have sustained complete remissions with combination chemotherapy regimens or aggressive consolidation with marrow or stem cell support.[ 848-57, 2012. - American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2023.

[] Late Effects of Treatment of NHL Late effects of treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) have been observed. Impaired fertility may occur after exposure to alkylating agents.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.1)] For as many as three decades after diagnosis, patients are at a significantly elevated risk of developing second primary cancers, especially the following:[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.2), [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.3), [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.4), [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.5)] - Lung cancer. - Brain cancer. - Kidney cancer. - Bladder cancer. - Melanoma. - Hodgkin lymphoma. - Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Left ventricular dysfunction was a significant late effect in long-term survivors of high-grade NHL who received more than 200 mg/m\u00b2 of doxorubicin.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.1), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.6)] Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia are late complications of myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support, as well as show clonal hematopoiesis even before the transplantation, suggesting that the hematologic injury usually occurs during induction or marrow transplantation (BMT) with conditioning using cyclophosphamide and total-body radiation therapy, the incidence of a second malignancy was 21% in a series of 605 patients, and 10% of those were solid tumors.[ [17](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.17)] Successful pregnancies with children born free of congenital abnormalities have been reported in young women after autologous BMT.[ [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.18)] BMT.[ [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.19)] Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21,690 survivors of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia (10.8-fold), meningitis (5.3-fold), immunoglobulin deficiency (17.6-fold), Similarly, there are impaired humoral responses to COVID-19 virus vaccination in patients with lymphoma who receive B-cell-directed therapies.[ [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.21), [22](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.22)] Some patients have osteopenia or osteoporosis at the start of therapy; bone density may worsen after therapy for lymphoma.[ [23](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s2.23)] - Haddy TB, Adde MA, McCalla non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.

[] Cellular Classification of NHL A pathologist should be considered for consultation before a biopsy because some studies require special preparation of tissue (e.g., frozen tissue). Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant from reactive cells. Since the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient to allow diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology is preferred.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.1), [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.2)] Historical Classification Systems Historically, uniform treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has been hampered by the lack of a uniform classification system. In 1982, results of a consensus study were published as the Working Formulation.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.3)] The Working Formulation combined results from six major classification systems into one classification. This allowed comparison of studies from different institutions and countries. The Rappaport classification, which also follows, is no longer in common use. |Working Formulation[ | Current Classification Systems As the understanding of NHL has improved and as the histopathological diagnosis of NHL has become more sophisticated with the use of immunologic and genetic techniques, a number of new pathological entities have been described.[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.4)] In addition, the understanding and treatment of many of the previously described pathological subtypes have changed. As a result, the Working Formulation has become outdated and less useful to clinicians and pathologists. Thus, European and American pathologists have proposed a new classification, the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.5), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.6), [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.7), [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.8)] Since 1995, members of the European and American Hematopathology societies have been collaborating on a new World Health Organization (WHO) classification, which represents an updated version of the REAL system.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.9), [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.10)] The WHO modification of the REAL classification recognizes three major categories of lymphoid malignancies based on and lymphoid leukemias are included in this classification because both solid and circulating phases are present in many lymphoid neoplasms and distinction between them is artificial. For example, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma are simply different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas and acute lymphocytic leukemias. Within the B-cell and T-cell categories, two subdivisions are recognized: precursor neoplasms, which correspond to the earliest stages of differentiation, and more mature differentiated neoplasms.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.9), [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s3.10)] Updated zone Hairy cell - (including S\u00e9zary syndrome). Anaplastic large lymphoma, primary systemic type. - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous type. - Aggressive HL. The REAL classification encompasses all the lymphoproliferative neoplasms.

[] Indolent NHL Indolent lymphoma (NHL) lymphoma of all NHL and as many as 70% of the indolent lymphomas reported in American and European clinical trials.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.1), [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.2), [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.3)] Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older and present with widespread disease at diagnosis. Nodal involvement is most common and is often accompanied by splenic and bone marrow disease. Rearrangement of the BCL2 gene is present in more than 90% of patients with follicular lymphoma; overexpression of the BCL2 protein is associated with the inability to eradicate the lymphoma by inhibiting apoptosis.[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.4)] Prognosis Despite the advanced stage, the median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years, leading to the designation of being indolent.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.5), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.6), [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.7)] Patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma are not cured with current therapeutic options. The rate of relapse is fairly consistent over time, even in patients who have achieved complete responses to treatment.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.8)] Watchful waiting, i.e., the deferring of treatment until the patient becomes symptomatic, is an option for patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.9), [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.10)] [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.12), [13](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.13)] five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS): - Age (60 years vs. >60 years). - Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal vs. elevated). - Stage (stage I or stage II vs. stage III or stage IV). - Hemoglobin level (120 g/L vs. <120 g/L). - Number of nodal areas (4 vs. >4). Patients with one risk factor or none have an 85% 10-year survival rate, and three or more risk factors confer a 40% 10-year survival rate.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.11)] In a revised FLIPI-2, an elevated beta-2-microglobulin and lymph node size of more than 6 cm are proposed prognostic factors instead of serum LDH and the areas.[ and FLIPI-2 indices can predict progression-free survival (PFS) and OS, the scores cannot be used to establish the need for therapy, nor can they be used to predict response to therapy.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.11), [14](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.14)] The primary use of FLIPI or FLIPI-2 is to assure a balance of prognostic factors or to define entry requirements in randomized clinical trials. Individuals with an adverse FLIPI score may well benefit from watchful waiting or may respond well to initial therapy. An alternative prognostic index using only beta-2-microglobulin and initial bone marrow involvement (PRIMA-PI) has the disadvantage of requiring an invasive test not usually required outside the context of a clinical trial.[ [15](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.15)] An alternative prognostic index using only noninvasive clinical variables outperformed FLIPI, FLIPI-2, and PRIMA-PI, using data from immunochemotherapy trials.[ [16](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.16)] Three retrospective analyses, including one pooled analysis of 5,225 patients in 13 randomized clinical trials, identified a high-risk group that had a 50% OS rate at 5 years when relapses occurred within 24 months of induction chemoimmunotherapy.[ [17](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.17), [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.18), [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.19)] A fourth retrospective analysis of 296 patients who received bendamustine-rituximab found a 2-year OS rate of 38% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20%55%) among those with progression of disease before 24 months (POD24). Most of these patients (76%) had transformed disease (histological progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]).[ [20](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.20)] These higher-risk POD24 patients represent for clinical trials. Follicular, small-cleaved cell lymphoma and follicular mixed small-cleaved and large cell lymphoma do not have reproducibly different disease-free survival or OS. Therapeutic approaches Because of the often-indolent clinical course and the lack of symptoms in some patients with follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting remains a standard of care during the initial encounter and for patients with slow asymptomatic relapsing disease. When therapy is required, numerous therapeutic options may be employed in varying sequences with an OS equivalence at 5 to 10 years.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.9), [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.21), [22](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.22), [23](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.23)] Rituximab can be given combination with various chemotherapy options.[ [23](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.23), [24](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.24)] Rituximab can also be combined with the immunomodulating-agent lenalidomide to avoid the short- and chemotherapy.[ [28](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.28)] Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are also with relapsed or refractory disease.[ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.29)] CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells may be used In patients who have disease progression after two or more prior lines of therapy.[ [30](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.30)] Mosunetuzumab, a bispecific CD20-directed used in this setting.[ [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.31)] Consolidation therapy for relapsed disease after reinduction therapy using autologous stem cell transplant can follicular lymphoma of the duodenum are particularly indolent variants that rarely progress and so-called and rarely recurs; adult patients with this histological variant are characterized by a lack of BCL2 rearrangement in conjunction with a Ki-67 proliferation index greater than 30% and a localized stage I presentation.[ [35](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.35)] Patients with indolent lymphoma may experience a relapse with a more aggressive histology. If the clinical pattern of relapse suggests that the disease is behaving in a more aggressive manner, a biopsy can be performed, if feasible.[ [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.36)] Documentation of conversion to a more aggressive histology requires an appropriate change to a therapy applicable to that histological type.[ [37](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.37)] Rapid growth or discordant growth between various disease sites may indicate a histological conversion.[ [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.36)] The risk of histological transformation was 30% by 10 years in a retrospective review of 325 patients from diagnosis between 1972 and 1999.[ [38](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.38)] In this series, high-risk factors for subsequent histological transformation were advanced stage, high-risk FLIPI, and expectant management (as opposed to treatment being initiated at diagnosis). The 5-year OS rate was more than 50% for patients who had biopsy-proven, aggressive-histology transformation in several multicenter cohort studies employing rituximab plus anthracycline or platinum-based chemotherapy, or similar autologous allogeneic SCT.[ [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.36), [39](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.39), [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.40)] In a prospective nonrandomized study, at a median follow-up of 6.8 years, 379 (14%) of 2,652 patients subsequently transformed to a more aggressive histology after an initial diagnosis of follicular lymphoma.[ [41](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.41)][Level of evidence C3] The median OS after subsequent transformation was 5 years; however, among 47 patients with evidence of transformation in conjunction with follicular lymphoma at the time of initial diagnosis, the OS was no worse than that of the other nontransformed patients (5-year immunoglobulin M (IgM) type (Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia).[ [42](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.42)] Most patients have bone marrow, lymph node, and splenic involvement, and some patients may develop hyperviscosity syndrome. Most patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia carry the MYD88 mutation, which some pathologists consider pathognomonic for the disease.[ [43](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.43)] Other lymphomas may be associated with serum paraproteins. Patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be checked for associated hepatitis C virus infection. Asymptomatic patients can be monitored for evidence of disease progression without immediate need for chemotherapy.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.9), [44](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.44), [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.45)] Prognostic factors associated with symptoms requiring therapy include the following: - Age 70 years or older. - Beta-2-microglobulin of 3 mg/dL or more. - Increased serum LDH.[ [44](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.44)] Therapeutic approaches The management of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is similar to that of other If the viscosity relative to water is greater than four, the patient may have manifestations of hyperviscosity. Plasmapheresis is useful for temporary, acute symptoms such as retinopathy, congestive heart failure, and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction but can be combined with chemotherapy for prolonged disease control. Symptomatic patients with a serum viscosity of four or lower are usually started directly on chemoimmunotherapy or biologically directed therapies. Therapy may be required to correct hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic cold agglutinin disease; rituximab, bendamustine, and steroids are often used.[ [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.45)] Occasionally, a heated room is required for patients whose cold agglutinins become activated by even minor chilling. Sutimlimab, an immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the complement pathway at C15, can reduce hemolysis when therapies directed at alkylating agents, either as single agents or part of combination chemotherapy.[ [50](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.50), [51](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.51), [52](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.52), [53](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.53), [54](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.54)] In a randomized prospective trial, 150 symptomatic patients (including previously untreated and relapsing patients) received either ibrutinib and rituximab or rituximab and a placebo. With a median follow-up of 50 months, the 4.5 year PFS rate favored the ibrutinib-and-rituximab arm (68%; 95% 0.25; 95% CI, 0.15-0.42; P < .0001), and the OS rate at 30 months was no different in the two arms (92%-94%).[ [54](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.54)][Level of evidence B1] Zanubrutinib, another BTK inhibitor, was compared with ibrutinib in a randomized prospective clinical trial of 164 patients with relapsed disease and 38 previously untreated patients.[ [55](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.55)] With a median follow-up of 18 months, the PFS rate was the same in both groups at 84%. The zanubrutinib group had fewer cases of atrial fibrillation (11 vs. 1) and 50% fewer cases of hypertension (statistics not provided).[ [55](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.55)][Level of evidence C3] BTK inhibition with ibrutinib allowed 13 patients with cold-antibody-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia and acrocyanosis to attain clinical remission regardless of underlying pathology or MYD88 status.[ [56](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.56)][Level of evidence C3] Previously untreated patients who received rituximab had response rates of 60% to 80%, but close monitoring of the serum IgM is required because of a sudden rise in this paraprotein at the start of therapy.[ [50](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.50), [57](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.57), [58](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.58)][Level of evidence C3] The rise of IgM after rituximab can be avoided with the concomitant use of an alkylating agent, such as cyclophosphamide dexamethasone, and rituximab has been used with avoidance of an IgM rebound.[ [62](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.62), [63](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.63), [64](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.64)] Previously untreated the nucleoside analogues bortezomib, venetoclax, and combination chemotherapy with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma involving the CNS (Bing-Neel syndrome), ibrutinib resulted in an 85% response rate in an anecdotal series of 28 patients.[ [72](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.72)][Level of evidence C3] Myeloablative therapy with autologous or under clinical evaluation.[ [73](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.73), [74](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.74), [75](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.75), [76](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.76)] Candidates for this approach should long-term use of alkylating agents or purine nucleoside analogues, which can deplete hematopoietic stem cells or predispose patients to myelodysplasia or acute leukemia.[ [50](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.50), [77](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.77)] After relapse from alkylating-agent therapy, 92 patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma were randomly assigned to either fludarabine or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone. Although relapse-free survival favored fludarabine (median duration of 19 months vs. 3 months, P < .01), no difference was observed in OS.[ [78](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.78)][Level of evidence B1] Marginal Zone Lymphoma When marginal zone lymphomas involve the nodes, they are called monocytoid B-cell lymphomas or nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and when they involve extranodal sites (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, lung, breast, orbit, and skin), they are called mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) lymphomas.[ [79](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.79), [80](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.80)] Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a distinct clinical entity that usually presents with massive splenomegaly. A variant form of MALT lymphoma is known as immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID).[ [80](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.80)] A prognostic index for all of the marginal zone lymphomas has three adverse prognostic factors: age 70 years or older, stage III or stage IV disease, and high LDH level.[ [81](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.81)] Fewer than 10% of patients transform to a higher-grade lymphoma; risk factors in one retrospective review included elevated LDH, more than four nodal sites at the time of initial diagnosis of marginal zone lymphoma, and failure to achieve complete response after initial treatment.[ [82](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.82)] Gastric MALT Many patients have a history of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, or of Helicobacter gastritis. Most patients present with stage I or stage II extranodal disease, which is most often in the stomach. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection may resolve most cases of localized gastric involvement.[ [83](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.83), [84](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.84)] After standard antibiotic regimens, 50% of patients show resolution of gastric MALT by endoscopy after 3 months. Other patients may show resolution after 12 to 18 months of observation. Of the patients who attain complete remission, 30% demonstrate monoclonality by immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement on stomach biopsies with a 5-year median follow-up.[ [85](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.85)] The clinical implication of this finding is unknown. Translocation t(11;18) in patients with gastric MALT predicts for poor response to antibiotic therapy, for H. pylori -negative testing, and for poor response to oral alkylator chemotherapy.[ [86](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.86), [87](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.87), [88](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.88)] Stable asymptomatic patients with persistently positive biopsies have been successfully followed on a watchful waiting approach until disease progression.[ [84](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.84)] Patients who progress are endoscopic ultrasonography may help clinicians to follow responses in these patients.[ [98](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.98)] Four case series encompassing more than 100 patients with stage IE or IIE DLBCL with or without associated MALT (but H. pylori -positive) reported durable complete remissions in more than 50% of the patients after treatment of H. pylori.[ [99](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.99), [100](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.100), [101](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.101), [102](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.102)] Extragastric MALT Localized involvement of other sites can be treated with radiation or surgery.[ have a higher relapse rate than patients with gastric MALT lymphoma in some series, with relapses many years and even decades later.[ [107](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.107)] Many of these recurrences involve different MALT sites than the original location.[ [108](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.108)] When disseminated to lymph nodes, bone marrow, or blood, this entity behaves like other low-grade lymphomas.[ [109](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.109), [110](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.110)] A prospective, randomized trial of 401 with nongastric, extranodal MALT compared alone versus rituximab rituximab alone.[ [111](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.111)] With a median follow-up of 7.4 years, the event-free survival was better for the rituximab-plus-chlorambucil arm (68%) than for the rituximab-alone arm (51%) and for the chlorambucil-alone arm (50%) (P = .0009). However, the 5-year OS rate was 90% in all arms.[ [111](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.111)] For patients with ocular adnexal MALT, antibiotic therapy using doxycycline that targeted Chlamydia psittaci resulted in durable remissions for almost half of the patients in a review of the literature that included 131 patients.[ [112](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.112)][Level of evidence C3] These responses to doxycycline are mainly seen in Italian trials and less often in trials conducted in other geographic sites.[ [113](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.113)] Large B-cell lymphomas of MALT sites are classified and treated as diffuse large cell lymphomas.[ [114](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.114)] A large, retrospective review of primary ocular adnexal MALT found that after 10 years of follow-up, 4% of stage I patients treated with radiation therapy transformed to DLBCL, and 3% of them developed CNS involvement.[ [115](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.115)] lymphoma (monocytoid B-cell lymphoma) are treated with the same paradigm of watchful waiting or therapies as described for follicular lymphoma.[ [116](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.116)] Similar to follicular lymphoma, patients with POD24 who required initiation of therapy had a worse prognosis (53% 3-year OS rate) than did the patients without POD24 (95% 3-year OS rate).[ [117](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.117)] Among patients with concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 40% to 60% attained a complete or partial remission after loss of detectable HCV RNA with antiviral treatment.[ [118](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.118), [119](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.119)][Level of evidence C3] Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma The disease variously known as Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma, heavy-chain disease, or IPSID, which occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries, is another version of MALT lymphoma, which responds to antibiotics in its early stages.[ [120](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.120)]Campylobacter jejuni has been identified as one of the bacterial species associated with IPSID, and antibiotic therapy may result in remission of the disease.[ [121](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.121)] Splenic marginal zone lymphoma Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma that is marked by massive splenomegaly and peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement, usually without adenopathy.[ [122](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.122), [123](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.123)] This type of lymphoma splenic lymphoma with may result in prolonged remission.[ [124](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.124), [125](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.125)] Management is similar to that of other low-grade lymphomas and usually involves rituximab alone or Splenic marginal zone lymphoma responds less well to chemotherapy, which would ordinarily be effective for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[ [122](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.122), [126](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.126), [127](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.127)] Among small zone lymphoma (splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes) and infection with HCV, most attained a complete or partial remission after loss of detectable HCV RNA with treatment using interferon-alpha with or without ribavirin.[ [118](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.118), [128](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.128)]; [ [129](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.129)][Level of evidence C3] In contrast, no responses to interferon were seen in six HCV-negative patients. Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma presents in the skin only with no preexisting lymphoproliferative disease and no extracutaneous sites of involvement.[ [130](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.130), [131](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.131), [132](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.132)] Patients with this type of lymphoma encompass a spectrum ranging from clinically benign lymphomatoid papulosis, marked by localized nodules that may regress spontaneously, to a progressive and systemic disease requiring aggressive doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy. This spectrum has been called the primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with localized disease usually undergo radiation therapy. With more disseminated involvement, watchful waiting or doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy is applied.[ [130](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.130), [131](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.131), [132](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s4.132)] For more see Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment, Mycosis Fungoides (Including S\u00e9zary Syndrome) Treatment, Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment, and Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment.

[] NHL Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) includes the following subtypes: - Diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL and comprises 30% of newly diagnosed cases.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.1)] Most patients present with rapidly enlarging masses, often with both local and systemic symptoms (designated B symptoms with fever, recurrent night sweats, or weight loss). For more information about weight loss, see Nutrition in Cancer Care. Some cases of large B-cell lymphoma have a prominent background of reactive T cells and often of histiocytes, so-called T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. This subtype of large cell lymphoma has frequent liver, spleen, and bone marrow involvement; however, the outcome is equivalent to that of similarly staged patients with DLBCL.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.2), [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.3), [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.4)] Some patients with DLBCL at diagnosis have a concomitant indolent small B-cell component; while overall survival (OS) appears similar after multidrug chemotherapy, there is a higher risk of indolent relapse.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.5)] Prognosis Most patients with localized disease are curable with combined-modality therapy or combination chemotherapy alone.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.6)] Among patients with advanced-stage disease, 50% are cured with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of OS and their associated risk scores:[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.10)] - Age. - <40 years: 0. - - >75 years: 3. - Stage III/IV: Performance 1. - Serum lactate (LDH). - >3x: 2. - Number of extranodal sites 2: 1. Risk scores: - Low (0 or 1): 5-year OS rate, 96%; progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 91%. intermediate 3): 5-year OS rate, 82%; PFS rate, 74%. - or 5): rate, 64%; PFS Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.11)] Shorter intervals of time between diagnosis and treatment appear to be a surrogate for poor prognostic biological factors.[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.12)] The BCL2 gene and rearrangement of the MYC gene or dual overexpression of the MYC gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[ [13](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.13), [14](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.14), [15](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.15)] Dose-intensive therapies, infusional therapies, and stem cell transplantation (SCT) consolidation are being explored in this high-risk group.[ [16](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.16), [17](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.17)] A retrospective review evaluated 159 patients with previously untreated DLBCL who underwent double-hit genetic testing by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and achieved complete response (CR).[ [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.18)] The induction therapy did not alter 3-year relapse-free survival or OS when autologous SCT was employed. In a retrospective review of 117 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who underwent autologous SCT, the 4-year and MYC), 61% double-expressor (no rearrangement, but increased expression of BCL2 and MYC), and 70% for patients without these features.[ [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.19)] Patients at high risk of relapse may be considered for clinical trials.[ [20](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.20)] Molecular profiles of gene expression using DNA microarrays may help to stratify patients in the future for therapies directed at specific targets and to better predict survival after standard chemotherapy.[ [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.21)] For example, true anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large B-cell lymphomas are extremely rare, and they do not respond well to conventional R-CHOP therapy. Anecdotal responses to ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib or alectinib have been reported.[ [22](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.22)][Level of evidence C3] who have DLBCL with coexpression of CD20 and CD30 may define a subgroup with a unique molecular signature, a more favorable prognosis, and possible therapeutic implication for the use of anti-CD30-specific therapy, such as brentuximab vedotin.[ [23](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.23)] Patients with DLBCL who are event-free after 2 years have a subsequent OS equivalent to that of the age- and sex-matched general population.[ [24](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.24)] Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis The CNS-IPI tool predicts which patients have a CNS relapse risk exceeding 10%. It was developed by the German Lymphoma Study Group and validated by the British Columbia Cancer Agency database. The presence of four to six of the CNS-IPI risk factors (age >60 years, performance status 2, elevated LDH, stage III or IV disease, >1 extranodal site, or involvement of the kidneys or adrenal glands) was used to define a high-risk group for CNS recurrence (a 12% risk of CNS involvement by 2 years).[ [25](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.25)] CNS prophylaxis (usually with four to six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) is often recommended for patients with testicular involvement.[ [26](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.26), [27](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.27), [28](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.28)][Level of evidence C3] A of the German RICOVER studies compared intrathecal methotrexate with no prophylaxis in patients with DLBCL. This study was completed during the R-CHOP treatment era. With the possible exception of patients with testicular involvement, the analysis showed that intrathecal methotrexate did not reduce the risk of CNS disease.[ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.29)][Level of evidence C3] Some clinicians employ high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate (usually four doses) as an alternative to intrathecal therapy because drug delivery is improved and patient morbidity is decreased.[ [30](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.30)] A retrospective study evaluated 1,162 patients from 21 U.S. academic centers where 77% received intrathecal methotrexate, 20% received high-dose sequentially (because of toxicity).[ [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.31)] There was no difference in CNS relapse rates between patients who received intrathecal methotrexate or IV methotrexate (5.4% Testicular involvement, nongerminal subtype, and high extranodal involvement predicted increased CNS relapse regardless of the route of prophylaxis.[ [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.31)] Two retrospective studies evaluating high-dose methotrexate in patients with high-risk DLBCL also showed no in CNS relapse rate.[ [32](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.32), [33](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.33)][Level of evidence C3] Patients deemed at high risk for CNS relapse (e.g., patients with four to six CNS-IPI risk factors) often receive intrathecal methotrexate or high-dose IV methotrexate, but the lack of confirmatory randomized studies calls this standard into question and shows an urgent need for better therapeutics verified in clinical trials. Patients with testicular involvement are an exception, as they show benefit from intrathecal or high-dose IV methotrexate.[ [26](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.26), [27](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.27), vincristine, in retrospective analyses.[ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.29), [34](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.34)][Level of evidence C3] Patients with CNS dissemination at diagnosis or at relapse usually receive rituximab and high doses of methotrexate and/or cytarabine followed by autologous SCT, but this approach has not been assessed in randomized trials.[ [35](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.35), [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.36)][Level subset of DLBCL with molecular characteristics that are most similar to nodular-sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).[ [37](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.37)] Patients are usually female and young (median age, 30-40 years). Patients present with a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass that may cause respiratory symptoms or superior vena cava syndrome. Prognosis and therapy are the same as for other comparably staged patients with DLBCL. Uncontrolled, phase II studies employing suggest that patients who receive R-CHOP-based regimens may avoid the serious long-term complications of radiation therapy when given with chemotherapy. Posttreatment fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans are controversial; it remains unclear if PET scans can reliably identify patients who can take or omit radiation therapy consolidation.[ [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.40), [46](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.46), [47](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.47), [48](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.48)] A retrospective review of 109 patients with PMBCL showed that 63% had a negative end-of-treatment PET-CT (EOT-PET-CT) (Deauville score 1-3).[ No radiation therapy offered and the 5-year time-to-progression rate (similar to disease-free survival, but restricted to lymphoma relapse) was 90%, and the 5-year OS rate was 97%.[ [49](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.49)][Level of evidence C3] Patients with a positive EOT-PET-CT received radiation therapy consolidation. It is unclear from this study whether those patients might have done just as well without radiation therapy. Clinicians may follow improvement over time for Deauville 4 scores on EOT-PET-CT scans as an alternative to radiation therapy, but this has not been studied in a clinical trial. In situations where mediastinal radiation therapy would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce radiation dose to organs at risk.[ [50](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.50)] For more information, see the Superior Vena Cava Syndrome section in Cardiopulmonary Syndromes. Because PMBCL is characterized by high expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and variable expression of CD30, a phase II study evaluated nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin in 30 patients with relapsed disease. With a median follow-up of 11.1 months, the objective response rate was 73% (95% CI, 54%88%).[ [51](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.51)][Level of evidence C3] Similarly, phase I and II trials of pembrolizumab in 74 patients with relapsed or refractory disease showed an objective response rate of 45% to 48%. The median duration of response was not reached for the 21 patients with a median follow-up of 29 months or for the 53 patients with a median follow-up of 12.5 months.[ [52](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.52)][Level of evidence C3] Among those who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half of patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had disease response.[ [53](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.53)][Level of evidence C3] Follicular Large Cell Lymphoma Prognosis The natural history of follicular large cell lymphoma remains controversial.[ [54](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.54)] While there is agreement about the significant number of long-term disease-free survivors with early-stage disease, the curability of patients with advanced disease (stage III or stage IV) remains uncertain. Some groups report a continuous relapse rate similar to the other follicular lymphomas (a pattern of indolent lymphoma).[ [55](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.55)] Other investigators report a plateau in freedom from progression at levels expected for an aggressive lymphoma (40% at 10 years).[ [56](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.56), [57](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.57)] This discrepancy may be caused by variations in histological classification between institutions and the rarity of patients with follicular large cell lymphoma. A retrospective review of 252 patients, all treated with anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy, showed that patients with more than 50% diffuse components on biopsy had a worse OS than other patients with follicular large cell lymphoma.[ [58](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.58)] Therapeutic approaches Treatment of follicular large cell lymphoma is more similar to treatment of aggressive NHL than it is to the treatment of indolent NHL. In support of this approach, treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic peripheral SCT shows the same curative potential in patients with follicular large cell lymphoma who relapse as it does in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma who relapse.[ [59](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.59)][Level of evidence C1] Among those who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half of patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had disease T-cell lymphoma associated with the CD30 antigen. The translocation of chromosomes 2 and 5 creates a unique fusion protein with a nucleophosmin-ALK.[ [60](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.60), [61](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.61)] Patients whose lymphomas express ALK by immunohistochemistry are usually younger and may have systemic symptoms, extranodal disease, and advanced-stage disease. However, they have a more favorable survival rate than ALK-negative patients.[ [62](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.62), [63](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.63)] A prospective 48% ALK-negative patients). The trial compared the previously used standard regimen, CHOP, with brentuximab vedotin (an anti-CD30 monoclonal and prednisone.[ [64](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.64)] With a median follow-up of 35 months, the 3-year OS rate was 77% in the brentuximab vedotin arm and 68% in the CHOP arm (hazard [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P vedotin plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone as a new for patients with ALCL and other CD30-positive T-cell and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. For patients with relapsed disease, anecdotal responses have been reported for a phase II study (NCT00866047), 66% of 58 patients attained a complete response with brentuximab vedotin. At a median follow-up of 58 months, the 5-year PFS rate was 57% (95% CI, 41%-74%), OS rate was 79% (95% CI, 65%-92%). Of the patients achieving a complete response, 42% underwent hematopoietic SCT.[ [68](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.68)][Level of evidence C3] In a retrospective review, 39 patients with relapsed disease had a 3-year PFS rate of 50% after autologous or allogeneic SCT.[ [71](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.71)][Level of evidence C2] A retrospective review of 84 patients with ALK-negative ALCL suggested a survival benefit with autologous SCT. This hypothesis requires confirmation in a randomized prospective trial.[ [72](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.72)] ALCL in children is usually characterized by systemic and cutaneous disease and has high response rates and good OS with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.[ [73](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.73)] Patients with breast implant-associated ALCL may do well without chemotherapy after capsulectomy and implant removal if the disease is confined to the fibrous capsule, and no associated mass or lymphadenopathy is present.[ [75](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.75), [76](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.76), [77](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.77)] Most patients implant-associated ALCL have a characteristic deletion at 20Q13.13 that may help diagnostically to distinguish it from cutaneous or systemic ALCL.[ [78](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.78)] Primary cutaneous ALCL is a distinct entity that is typically ALK-negative and has a very indolent/low-grade clinical course. Extranodal (NK)-/T-cell Lymphoma Extranodal (NK)-/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type) is an aggressive lymphoma marked by extensive necrosis and angioinvasion, most often presenting in extranodal sites, in particular the nasal or paranasal sinus region.[ [79](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.79)] Other extranodal sites include the palate, trachea, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Hemophagocytic syndrome may occur; historically, these tumors were considered part of lethal midline granuloma.[ [80](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.80)] In most cases, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes are detectable in the tumor cells and immunophenotyping shows CD56 positivity. Cases with blood and marrow involvement are considered NK-cell leukemia. The increased risk of CNS involvement and of local recurrence has led to recommendations for radiation therapy locally, concurrently, before the start of chemotherapy or between cycle two and three of chemotherapy, and for intrathecal early-stage patients stratified them into a low-risk group and high-risk group using stage, age, LDH, performance status, and primary tumor invasion.

A prospective randomized trial of 487 median follow-up of 82 months, the median OS was longer for VR-CAP (90.7 months) compared with R-CHOP (55.7 months) (HR, 0.66; CI, 0.510.85; P = .001).[ [217](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.217)][Level of evidence A1] A prospective randomized trial of 497 patients younger than 65 years compared six cycles of R-CHOP with six cycles of alternating R-CHOP and R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, [218](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.218), [219](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.219)][Level of evidence B1] With a median of 10.6 years, the 10-year PFS rate was 73% for patients who received R-DHAP and 57% for patients who received R-CHOP (HR, 0.56; P = .038), but there was no difference in the 10-year OS rates (60% [R-DHAP] B1] This is the randomized trial referenced by all subsequent articles establishing a role for cytarabine in induction therapy; the ultimate lack of survival advantage casts doubt on this assertion. Randomized trials have not confirmed an OS benefit in patients who receive consolidation therapy with trial (NCT00921414) of 299 patients who were previously untreated for MCL, 257 responders received four courses of R-DHAP and autologous SCT. The patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab maintenance therapy for 3 years versus no maintenance therapy. After randomization, a median follow-up at 50.2 months showed the rate of PFS at 4-years favored the rituximab-maintenance arm at 83% the no-maintenance arm at 64% (95% CI, 55%-73%; P < .001). The 4-year OS rate also favored the rituximab-maintenance arm at 89% (95% CI, 81%-94%) versus the = of evidence A1] Lenalidomide with or without rituximab also shows response rates of around 50% in relapsed patients, with even higher response rates for previously untreated patients.[ [205](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.205), [208](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.208), Bruton tyrosine kinase [BTK] pathway) was studied in 124 patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.[ [230](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.230)] In a phase II study, there was an 81% overall response rate, 40% CR rate, and 67% inhibitor zanubrutinib was evaluated in a phase II study of 86 patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.[ [231](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.231)] After a median follow-up of 35.3 months, the overall response rate was 84%, the CR rate was 78%, and the median PFS was 33.0 months.[ [231](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.231)][Level of evidence C3] Patients with relapsed or refractory MCL whose disease did not respond to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib were enrolled in a phase II trial using brexucabtagene autoleucel, an anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.[ [232](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.232)] With a median follow-up of 36 months, 74 patients had an objective response rate of 91% (95% CI, 82%97%) and a CR rate of 68% (95% CI, 55%78%).[ [232](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.232)][Level of evidence C3] Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome occurred in 15% of patients, and neurological events occurred in 31% of patients. In summary, the optimal sequencing of these various therapies is unclear and is the subject of an ongoing Intergroup clinical trial. Rituximab, lenalidomide, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, venetoclax, and zanubrutinib represent directed biological agents that may lead to chemotherapy-free treatment strategies for patients with MCL.[ [233](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.233)] Routine administration of CNS prophylaxis in high-risk MCL has never been studied in a prospective randomized trial. The use of intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate or the use of systemic therapies with CNS penetration like ibrutinib, high-dose cytarabine, or venetoclax, have not been studied and proven efficacious in this situation.[ [196](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.196)] Posttransplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder Patients who undergo transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas usually require lifelong immunosuppression. This may result in posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in 1% to 3% of recipients, which appears as an aggressive lymphoma.[ [234](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.234)] Pathologists can lymphoma; both are almost always associated with EBV.[ [235](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.235)] Prognosis Poor performance status, grafted organ involvement, high IPI, elevated LDH, and multiple sites of disease are poor prognostic factors for PTLD.[ [236](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.236), [237](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.237)] Therapeutic options In some cases, withdrawal of immunosuppression results in eradication of the lymphoma.[ [238](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.238), [239](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.239)] When this is unsuccessful or not feasible, a course of rituximab may be considered, because it has shown durable remissions in approximately 60% of patients and a favorable toxicity profile.[ [238](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.238), [240](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.240), [241](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.241)] If these measures fail, doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy (R-CHOP) is recommended, although some patients can avoid cytotoxic therapy.[ [241](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.241), [242](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.242)] Localized presentations can be controlled with surgery or radiation therapy alone. These localized mass lesions, which may grow over a period of months, are often phenotypically polyclonal and tend to occur within weeks or a few months after transplantation.[ [235](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.235)] Multifocal, rapidly progressive disease occurs late after transplantation (>1 year) and is usually phenotypically monoclonal and associated with EBV.[ [243](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.243)] These patients may have durable remissions using standard chemotherapy regimens for aggressive lymphoma.[ [243](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.243), [244](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.244), [245](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.245)] Instances of EBV-negative PTLD occur even later (median, 5 years posttransplant) and have a worse prognosis; R-CHOP chemotherapy can be applied directly in this circumstance.[ [246](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.246)] A sustained clinical response after failure from chemotherapy was attained using an immunotoxin (anti-CD22 B-cell surface antigen antibody linked with ricin, a plant toxin).[ [247](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.247)] An anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal True Histiocytic Lymphoma True histiocytic lymphomas are very rare tumors that show histiocytic differentiation and express histiocytic markers in the or T-cell lineage-specific markers.[ [249](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.249), [250](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.250)] tests to exclude ALCL or hemophagocytic syndromes caused by viral infections, especially EBV. Therapeutic options Therapy is modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas, but the optimal approach remains to be defined. Primary Effusion Lymphoma Primary effusion lymphoma presents exclusively or mainly in the pleural, pericardial, or abdominal cavities in the absence of an identifiable tumor mass.[ [251](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.251)] Patients are usually HIV seropositive, and the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus/human of primary effusion lymphoma is extremely poor. Therapeutic approaches Therapy is usually modeled after the treatment of comparably staged diffuse large cell lymphomas. Plasmablastic Lymphoma Plasmablastic lymphoma is most often seen in patients with HIV infection and is characterized by CD20-negative large B cells with plasmacytic features. This type of lymphoma has a very aggressive clinical course, including poor responses and short remissions with standard chemotherapy.[ [253](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s5.253)] Anecdotal reports suggest using aggressive chemotherapy for Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma, followed by SCT lymphomas and classical diffuse large B-cell lymphomas have similar outcome after chemotherapy: a matched-control Clin Oncol 21 (7): 1271-7, H, Berger F, Felman P, et al.: Clinicopathologic characteristics and outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas presenting with an associated low-grade component at diagnosis.

[] Stage Information for NHL Stage is important in selecting a treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are usually part of the staging evaluation for all lymphoma patients. The staging system is similar to the staging system used for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Common among patients with NHL is involvement of the following: - Noncontiguous lymph nodes. - Waldeyer ring. - Epitrochlear nodes. - Gastrointestinal tract. - Extranodal presentations. (A single extranodal site is occasionally the only site of involvement in patients with diffuse lymphoma.) - Bone marrow. - Liver (especially common in patients with low-grade lymphomas). Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid may be positive in patients with aggressive NHL. Involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is less common than in HL. Mediastinal adenopathy, however, is a prominent feature of lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, entities primarily found in young adults. Most patients with NHL present with advanced (stage III or stage IV) disease that can often be identified with limited staging procedures such as CT scanning and biopsies of the bone marrow and other accessible sites of involvement. In a retrospective review of over 32,000 cases of lymphoma in France, up to 40% of diagnoses were made by core needle biopsy, and 60% were made by excisional biopsy.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.1)] After expert review, core needle biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 92.3% of cases, but it was less conclusive than excisional biopsy, which provided a definite diagnosis in 98.1% of cases (P < .0001). Laparoscopic biopsy or laparotomy is not required for staging but rarely may be necessary to establish a diagnosis or histological type.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.2)] Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose can be used for initial staging and for follow-up after therapy as a supplement to CT scanning.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.3)] Interim PET scans after two to four cycles of therapy did not provide reliable prognostic information because of problems of interobserver reproducibility in a large cooperative group trial (ECOG-E344 [NCT00274924]) and lack of difference in outcome between PET-negative and PET-positive/biopsy-negative patients in two prospective trials [ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.4), [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.5), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.6)] and in a meta-analysis.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.7)] For patients with follicular lymphoma, a positive PET result after therapy has a worse prognosis; however, it is unclear whether a positive PET result is predictive when further or different therapy is implemented.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.8)] In a retrospective study of 130 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PET scanning identified all clinically important marrow involvement from lymphoma, and bone marrow biopsy did not upstage any patient's lymphoma.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.9)] A retrospective study of 580 patients with follicular lymphoma from seven National Cancer Institute-sponsored trials showed no improvement in assessing response to therapy when bone marrow biopsy was added to radiological imaging.[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.10)] The workup of NHL should include bone marrow biopsy when management would change (e.g., determining limited stage vs. advanced stage) or when evaluating cytopenias. Staging Subclassification System Lugano Classification The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate and stage lymphoma.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.11)] The Lugano classification system replaces the Ann Arbor classification system, which was adopted in 1971 at the Ann Arbor Conference,[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.12)] with some modifications 18 years SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.:AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 937-58.| |b Stage II bulky may be considered either early or advanced stage based on lymphoma histology and prognostic factors.| |c The definition of disease bulk varies according to lymphoma histology. In the Lugano classification, bulk ln Hodgkin lymphoma is defined as a mass greater than one-third of the thoracic diameter on CT of the chest or a mass >10 cm. For NHL, the recommended definitions of bulk vary by lymphoma histology. In follicular lymphoma, 6 cm has been suggested based on the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 and its validation. In DLBCL, cutoffs ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm have been used, although 10 cm is recommended.| |Limited stage| |I||Involvement of a single ring, thymus, or spleen).|| | |IE||Single extralymphatic site in the absence of nodal involvement (rare in Hodgkin lymphoma).| |II||Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.|| | |IIE||Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.|| | |II bulkyb||Stage II with disease bulk.c| |Advanced stage| |III||Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.|| | |IV||Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or noncontiguous extralymphatic organ involvement in conjunction with nodal stage II disease; or any extralymphatic organ involvement in nodal stage III disease. Stage IV includes any involvement of the CSF, bone marrow, liver, or multiple lung lesions (other than by direct extension in stage IIE disease).|| | |Note: Hodgkin lymphoma uses A or B designation with stage group. A/B is no longer used in NHL.| Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used. The physician should be aware of the system used in a specific report. The E designation is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates. Stage IV refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such as the liver. If pathological proof of involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by a plus sign (+), is listed. |N = nodes||H = liver||L = lung||M = pleura||O = bone||D = skin| Current practice assigns a clinical stage based on the findings of the clinical evaluation and a pathological stage based on the findings made as a result of invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy. For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might have involvement of the liver and bone marrow. The precise stage of such a patient would be clinical stage IIA, pathological stage IVA(H+)(M+). Several other factors that are not included in the above staging system are important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL. These factors include the following: - Age. - Performance status (PS). - Tumor size. - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values. - The number of extranodal sites. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS) and their associated risk scores:[ [15](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.15)] - Age. - <40 years: 0. - - >75 years: 3. - Stage III/IV: - PS 2/3/4: 1. - Serum LDH. - Normalized: 0. - >1x-3x: 1. - >3x: 2. - Number of extranodal sites 2: 1. Risk scores: - Low (0 or 1): 5-year OS rate, 96%; progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 91%. intermediate 3): 5-year OS rate, 82%; PFS rate, 74%. - or 5): rate, 64%; PFS Age-adjusted and stage-adjusted modifications of this IPI are used for younger patients with localized disease.[ [16](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.16)] Shorter intervals of time between diagnosis and treatment appear to be a surrogate for poor prognostic biological factors.[ [17](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.17)] The BCL2 gene and rearrangement of the MYC gene or dual overexpression of the MYC gene, or both, confer a particularly poor prognosis.[ [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.18), [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.19)] Patients at high risk of relapse may benefit from consolidation therapy or other approaches under clinical evaluation.[ [20](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.20)] Molecular profiles of gene expression using DNA microarrays may help to stratify patients in the future for therapies directed at specific targets and to better predict survival after standard chemotherapy.[ [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s6.21)] References: - Syrykh C, Chaouat C, Poullot al.: Lymph node excisions provide more precise lymphoma diagnoses than core biopsies: a French Lymphopath network survey.

Many of the improvements in survival have been made using clinical trials (experimental therapy) that have attempted to improve on the best available accepted therapy (conventional or standard therapy). In asymptomatic patients with indolent forms of advanced NHL, treatment may be deferred until the patient becomes symptomatic as the disease progresses. When treatment is deferred, the clinical course of patients with indolent NHL varies; frequent and careful observation is required so that effective treatment can be initiated when the clinical course of the disease accelerates. Some patients have a prolonged indolent course, but others have disease that rapidly evolves into more aggressive types of NHL that require immediate treatment. Radiation techniques differ somewhat from those used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. The dose of radiation therapy usually varies from 25 Gy to 50 Gy and is dependent on factors that include the histological type of lymphoma, the patient's stage and overall condition, the goal of treatment (curative or palliative), the proximity of sensitive surrounding organs, and whether the patient is being treated with radiation therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Given the patterns of disease presentations and relapse, treatment may need to include unusual sites such as Waldeyer ring, epitrochlear nodes, or mesenteric nodes. The associated morbidity of the treatment must be considered carefully. Most patients who receive radiation are treated on only one side of the diaphragm. Localized presentations of extranodal NHL may be treated with involved-field techniques with significant (>50%) success. |Stage||Treatment Options| |BMT marrow transplantation; cell I and Indolent, Contiguous Stage II |Rituximab with or without chemotherapy| |Watchful therapy| |Lenalidomide and |Obinutuzumab or high-dose radioimmunotherapy followed by autologous or peripheral SCT (under clinical evaluation)| |Phase III clinical trials comparing chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy followed by anti-idiotype vaccine| |Extended-field radiation therapy (stage III patients only) evaluation)| |Ofatumumab (under clinical evaluation)| |Short-course low-dose, clinical evaluation)| |Indolent, Recurrent NHL||Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy| |Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with Stage II NHL||R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT| Even though existing treatments cure a significant fraction of patients with lymphoma, numerous clinical trials that explore treatment improvements are in progress. If possible, patients can be included in these studies. Standardized guidelines for response assessment have been suggested for use in clinical trials.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.1)] Several retrospective reviews suggest that routine surveillance scans offer little to no value in patients with diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have attained a clinical complete remission after induction therapy. Prognostic value is also difficult to identify for an interim positron emission tomography-computed tomography Aggressive lymphomas are increasingly seen in HIV-positive patients. Treatment of these patients requires special consideration. For more information, see AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment. In addition to screening for HIV among patients with aggressive lymphomas, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C can be assessed before treatment with rituximab and/or chemotherapy.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.6), [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.7)] Patients with detectable hepatitis B viral loads benefit from prophylaxis with entecavir in the context of rituximab therapy.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.8), [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.9)] Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% 2.1% a retrospective patients.[ Similarly, for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone are usually applied with rituximab with or without combination chemotherapy. Long-term impaired immune health was evaluated in a retrospective cohort study of 21,690 survivors of DLBCL from the California Cancer Registry. Elevated incidence rate ratios were found up to 10 years later for pneumonia (10.8-fold), meningitis (5.3-fold), immunoglobulin deficiency (17.6-fold), and autoimmune cytopenias (12-fold).[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.11)] Among 2,508 patients in a Danish registry, the incidence of doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure increased for 115 NHL survivors with a history of cardiac disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.156.36) and/or factors (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.565.23).[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.12)] Several unusual presentations of lymphoma occur that often require somewhat modified approaches to staging and therapy. The reader is referred to reviews for a more detailed description of extranodal presentations CNS Lymphoma Treatment. Castleman Disease A biopsy of localized or multifocal collections of lymph nodes may lead to a diagnosis of Castleman disease (CD), although it is an uncommon diagnosis. Strictly speaking, this is not a lymphoma, nor is it even a malignancy. Yet, many patients with CD may be seen and treated by hematologists or oncologists. Localized or unicentric CD is usually asymptomatic and occurs in the mediastinum, which is the most common presentation for CD.[ [49](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.49)] Watchful waiting, surgery, or radiation therapy can be used for this indolent form. Multicentric CD (30% of CD patients) presents with lymphadenopathy in multiple sites; symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue; and laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, low albumin, elevated C-reactive protein, and high fibrinogen.[ [49](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.49)] is subdivided into human herpes virus-8-associated MCD (usually with HIV or with severe immunocompromise) or idiopathic MCD. Cytopenias and cytokine storm are attributed to interleukin-6 (IL-6) overproduction. MCD is feature seen in POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), nonrandomized series.[ [53](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.53), [54](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.54), [55](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.55), [56](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s7.56)] Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

[] Treatment of Indolent Stage I and Indolent, Contiguous Stage II NHL Although localized presentations are uncommon in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the goal of treatment is to cure the disease in patients who are shown to have truly localized occurrence after undergoing appropriate staging. Treatment Options for Indolent Stage I and Indolent, Contiguous Stage II NHL Treatment options for indolent stage I and indolent, contiguous stage II NHL include the following: - Radiation therapy. - Rituximab with or without chemotherapy. - Watchful waiting. - Other therapies as designated for patients with advanced-stage disease. In a prospective randomized trial, 150 patients with stage I or stage II follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to 30 Gy of involved-field radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy plus six cycles of R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone). With a the 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate combined-modality confidence interval [CI], 46%-74%) versus 41% for radiation therapy alone (95% CI, 30%-57%) (P = .033). There was no difference in overall survival (OS) (87% and 95%, P = .40).[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.1)][Level of evidence B1] The National Lymphocare Study identified 471 patients with stage I follicular lymphoma. Of those patients, 206 were rigorously staged with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and (13%), and rituximab alone (12%), although more than one-third of the patients started with expectant therapy. With a median follow-up of 57 months, PFS favored R-chemotherapy or R-chemotherapy plus radiation therapy, but OS was nearly identical, all over 90%.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.2)][Level of evidence C2] Clinical trials are required to answer questions such as the following:[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.3)] - If the PET-CT scan is clear after excisional biopsy, is watchful waiting or radiation therapy preferred? - Should rituximab be added to radiation therapy for stage I follicular lymphoma? - Is there any role for R-chemotherapy plus radiation therapy? Radiation therapy Long-term disease control within radiation fields can be achieved in a significant number of patients with indolent stage I or stage II NHL by using dosages of radiation that usually range from 25 Gy to 40 Gy to involved sites or to extended fields that cover adjacent nodal sites.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.1), [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.4), [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.5), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.6)] Almost half of all patients treated with radiation therapy alone will relapse out-of-field within 10 years.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.1), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.6), [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.7)] A retrospective review of 512 patients from an international consortium evaluated patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma who received at least 24 Gy of localized radiation therapy at initial presentation. With a median follow-up of 52 months, 29.1% of patients developed recurrent lymphoma at a median of 23 months (range, 1143 months).[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.8)] With a median follow-up of 33 months after relapse, the 3-year OS rate was 91.4% after patients received subsequent systemic chemotherapy that involved rituximab, usually with chemotherapy.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.8)] Very low-dose radiation therapy with 4 Gy (2 Gy \u00d7 2 fractions) can result in 50% remission rates for patients who cannot tolerate higher doses.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.9)] In a multicenter, randomized, prospective trial, 548 patients with follicular or marginal zone lymphoma received radiation therapy, either 4 Gy in 2 fractions or 24 Gy in 12 fractions.[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.10)] - At a median follow-up of 73.8 months, the 5-year local complete response rate was 89.9% (85.5%-93.1%) after 24 and 2.25-5.33, P < .0001).[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.10)] - Although durable local control was superior for patients who received 24 Gy in 12 fractions, the 4 Gy (2 Gy x 2 fractions) regimen was nearly comparable with less radiation exposure, less time undergoing therapy, and less cost. In situations in which mediastinal radiation would encompass the left side of the heart or would increase breast cancer risk in young female patients, proton therapy may be considered to reduce the radiation dose to organs at risk.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.11)] Rituximab with or without chemotherapy For symptomatic patients who require therapy, when radiation therapy is contraindicated, or when an alternative treatment is preferred, rituximab with or without chemotherapy can be used (as outlined below for more advanced-stage patients). The value of adjuvant treatment with radiation to decrease relapse, plus rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, has been extrapolated from trials of patients with advanced-stage disease and has not been confirmed.[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.12), [13](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.13)] Watchful waiting Watchful waiting can be considered for asymptomatic patients.[ [14](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.14)] Watchful waiting has never been compared with up-front radiation therapy in a prospective randomized trial; a retrospective analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program database over 30 years showed improved outcomes for up-front radiation therapy.[ [15](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s8.15)] Other therapies as designated for patients with advanced-stage disease Patients with involvement that is not able to be encompassed by radiation therapy are treated as outlined for patients with stage III or stage IV low-grade lymphoma.

[] Treatment of Indolent, Noncontiguous Stage II / III / IV NHL Optimal treatment of advanced stages of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is controversial because of low cure rates with the current therapeutic options. Numerous clinical trials are in progress to evaluate treatment issues, and patients are urged to participate. The rate of relapse is fairly constant over time, even in patients who have achieved complete response to treatment. Indeed, relapse may occur many years after treatment. Currently, no randomized trials provide guidance to clinicians about the initial choice of watchful waiting, rituximab, nucleoside analogues, alkylating agents, combination chemotherapy, radiolabeled of these options.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.1)]; [ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.2)][Level of evidence B1] For patients with indolent, noncontiguous stage II and stage III NHL, central lymphatic radiation therapy has been proposed but is not usually recommended as a form of treatment.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.3), [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.4)] Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% 2.1% in a retrospective study of 326 patients.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.5)] Treatment Options for Indolent, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Treatment options for indolent, noncontiguous stage II/III/IV NHL include the following: - Watchful waiting for asymptomatic patients. - Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy. - Lenalidomide and rituximab. - Maintenance rituximab. - Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy. anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. - Intensive therapy with chemotherapy with or without total-body irradiation or high-dose radioimmunotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell III clinical trials comparing chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy followed by anti-idiotype vaccine.[ [16](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.16), [17](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.17), [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.18)] - Extended-field radiation therapy (under clinical evaluation).[ [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.19)] - Ofatumumab\u2014human (under clinical evaluation).[ [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.21), [22](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.22)] Because none of the therapies listed above are curative for advanced-stage disease, innovative approaches are under clinical evaluation. Watchful waiting for asymptomatic patients The rate of relapse is fairly constant over time, even in patients who have achieved complete responses (CR) to treatment. Indeed, relapse may occur many years after treatment. In this category, deferred treatment (i.e., watchful waiting until the patient becomes symptomatic before initiating treatment) can be considered.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.2), revised FLIPI-2 can predict progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), but the scores cannot be used to establish the need for therapy in asymptomatic patients.[ [26](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.26), [27](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.27)] Evidence (watchful waiting): - Three watchful waiting with immediate chemotherapy.[ [24](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.24), [28](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.28)]; [ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.29)][Level of evidence A1] - All three trials showed no difference in cause-specific or OS. - For patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting, the median time to require therapy was 2 to 3 years and one-third of patients receiving watchful waiting never required treatment with watchful waiting (half died of other causes and half remained progression free after 10 years). - A selected group of 107 patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma were managed with initial watchful waiting; with a median delay of 55 months, subsequent therapy resulted in equivalent freedom from treatment failure and OS compared with a similar cohort treated immediately with rituximab.[ [30](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.30)][Level of evidence C2] This implies that watchful waiting remains a relevant approach even in the rituximab era. Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Standard therapy includes rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, either alone, as was trial (NCT00075946),[ [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.31), as fludarabine or cladribine, alkylating agents (with or without steroids), or combination chemotherapy. Rituximab may be considered as first-line therapy, either alone or in combination with other agents. Rituximab may be given intravenously or subcutaneously, and biosimilar versions, such as CT-P10 and have shown equivalent efficacy and safety.[ any OS benefit of adding doxorubicin to chemotherapy regimens with rituximab or to chemotherapy with or without chemotherapy): - A prospective, randomized trial of 534 patients with previously untreated, advanced-stage follicular lymphoma compared R-CHOP, R-FM, and R-CVP.[ [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.45)] - With a median follow-up of 84 months, there was no difference in OS (8-year OS rate, 83%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 79%-87%), regimens = .037).[ [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.45)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 84 months, there was no difference in OS (8-year OS rate, 83%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 79%-87%), three regimens = .037).[ - Four randomized prospective studies of previously untreated patients (involving more than 1,300 patients) and one Cochrane meta-analysis that included both untreated and previously treated patients (involving almost 1,000 patients) have compared rituximab plus combination chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone.[ [44](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.44), [54](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.54), [55](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.55)][Level of evidence A1] Rituximab plus chemotherapy was superior in terms of event-free survival (EFS) or PFS (ranging from 2-3 years) in all of the studies and in terms of OS in all but one study (absolute benefit ranging from 6%-13% at 4 years, P < .04 and hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63 [0.51-0.79] for the meta-analysis). - All of these trials were performed in symptomatic patients who required therapy. These results do not negate watchful waiting when appropriate. - Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) scan status at the completion of rituximab plus chemotherapy induction therapy is strongly predictive of outcome. It is not yet known whether acting on the results of the scans translates into better outcomes.[ [56](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.56), [57](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.57)] - In a prospective randomized trial (NCT00991211), 527 patients with indolent and mantle cell lymphoma were randomly assigned to a bendamustine-and-rituximab arm versus an R-CHOP arm.[ [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.40)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 45 months, the median PFS favored the bendamustine arm (69 months vs. 31 months [HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.74; P < .0001]) but with no difference in OS. - The bendamustine arm was associated with significantly lower rates of alopecia, hematologic toxicity, stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and infections than was the R-CHOP arm. - In a similar prospective randomized trial, 447 patients with indolent and mantle cell lymphoma were assigned to bendamustine and rituximab versus R-CHOP or R-CVP.[ [41](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.41)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 65 months, the 5-year PFS rate 95% CI, 0.45-0.85; P = .0025), but with no difference in OS. - Increased deaths in the bendamustine-and-rituximab arm from cardiovascular causes (seven versus one) and from secondary malignancies other than lymphoma (five versus three) may have contributed to the lack of OS advantage. Lenalidomide and rituximab The combination of the immunomodulating agent lenalidomide with rituximab (the so-called R2 regimen) has been proposed as an alternative regimen to combinations involving cytotoxic agents and their subsequent short- and long-term toxicities. Evidence (lenalidomide and rituximab): - In a randomized prospective trial (RELEVANCE) of 1,030 patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, rituximab plus lenalidomide for 18 months was compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy (usually R-CHOP).[ [58](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.58), [59](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.59)] All patients received rituximab maintenance for up to 2 years. - With a median follow-up of 72 months, the 6-year PFS (60% and 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84-1.27; P = .78 for PFS) (HR for OS was not reported).[ [58](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.58), [59](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.59)][Level of evidence A1] - This trial established that the R2 regimen is as effective as rituximab plus cytotoxic chemotherapy options. The transformation rate to aggressive lymphoma per year was 0.68% in the R2 group and 0.45% in the R-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of 72 months, there were no new safety signals.[ [59](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.59)] - With a median follow-up of 72 months, 6-year PFS (60% and 1.03; 95% CI, 0.84-1.27; P = .78 for PFS) (HR for OS was not reported).[ - In a randomized prospective trial of 358 patients with resistant/refractory indolent lymphoma (usually follicular lymphoma), the R2 regimen was compared with rituximab alone.[ [60](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.60)] - With a median follow-up of 28 months, the median PFS was 39.4 months for R2 and 14.1 months for rituximab alone (P < .0001), with no difference in OS.[ [60](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.60)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 28 months, the median PFS was 39.4 months for R2 and 14.1 months for rituximab alone (P < .0001), with no difference in OS.[ Maintenance rituximab After induction therapy with rituximab only or with rituximab plus chemotherapy, rituximab can be used once every 2 to 3 months. Several studies have evaluated this approach. Evidence (maintenance rituximab for previously untreated patients): - In the PRIMA study (NCT00140582), 1,018 high-risk, previously untreated, symptomatic patients achieved CR or partial response (PR) after induction therapy with immunochemotherapy (usually R-CHOP) and were then randomly assigned to 2 years of maintenance rituximab versus no maintenance.[ [61](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.61)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 9.0 years, median PFS favored rituximab maintenance (10.5 years) compared with observation (4.1 years) (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.520.73; P < .001), but with no difference in OS. - In the United Kingdom/International Study (NCT00112931), 379 previously untreated patients with asymptomatic, low-burden disease were randomly assigned to watchful waiting versus rituximab induction only versus rituximab induction followed by 2 years of rituximab maintenance.[ [62](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.62)][Level of evidence A3] - Although OS and histological transformation rates were no different at 3 years, maintenance rituximab was favored based on quality-of-life (QOL) studies (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale P = .0004 at 7 months; Illness Coping Score P = .0012 at 7 months) and time-to-initiation of new treatment by 3 years (54% for watchful waiting vs. 12% for rituximab .0001]).[ [62](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.62)][Level of evidence A3] - This study suggested that for some patients, watch and wait resulted in watch and worry.[ [63](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.63)] However, from the perspective of OS and histological transformation rates, no benefit could be seen with rituximab maintenance. - Although OS and histological transformation rates were no different at 3 years, maintenance rituximab was favored based on quality-of-life (QOL) studies (Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale P = .0004 at 7 months; Illness Coping Score P = .0012 at 7 months) and time-to-initiation of new treatment by 3 years (54% for watchful waiting vs. 12% for rituximab maintenance [HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.14-0.31; .0001]).[ - In the RESORT study (NCT00075946), 289 previously untreated patients with asymptomatic, low-burden disease were randomly assigned to rituximab induction alone, with a re-treatment strategy that used rituximab at relapse, or rituximab induction plus maintenance rituximab every 13 weeks until treatment failure.[ [34](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.34)][Level of evidence A3] - With a median follow-up of 4.5 years, there was no difference in median time-to-treatment failure (defined as failing rituximab alone) or in health-related QOL. A re-treatment strategy achieved comparable disease control using significantly fewer doses of rituximab. These three randomized trials in previously untreated patients show no advantage for the use of rituximab maintenance versus observation and reinduction of therapy at the time of relapse. The trials suggest a benefit for maintenance rituximab after reinduction for relapsed disease. Many questions remain about rituximab maintenance, particularly about truncating therapy at 2 years and long-term safety and efficacy. A trial extending rituximab maintenance to 5 years showed similar EFS or OS versus 1 year of maintenance after induction therapy with rituximab in previously untreated patients.[ [64](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.64)][Level of evidence A1] - The FOLL12 study (NCT02063685) included 807 patients with previously untreated high-tumor burden follicular lymphoma. Patients received rituximab plus chemotherapy induction and were randomly assigned to either standard rituximab maintenance (every 8 weeks for 2 years) or to postinduction treatment (monitoring, rituximab maintenance, or radioimmunotherapy) based on their complete metabolic response and measurable residual disease-negative status.[ [65](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.65)] - With a median follow-up of 53 months, the 3-year PFS rate was 86% for patients who received standard maintenance and 72% for patients who received response-based treatment (P < .001). The 3-year OS was the same in both groups (98% vs. 97%; P = .238).[ [65](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.65)][Level of evidence B1] - This trial does not support the use of an end-of-treatment PET-CT scan to guide the use of maintenance rituximab. - With a median follow-up of 53 months, the 3-year PFS rate was 86% for patients who received standard maintenance and 72% for patients who received response-based treatment (P < .001). The 3-year OS was the same in both groups (98% vs. 97%; P = .238).[ For previously untreated patients, all of the studies showed improvement of PFS, with no change in OS. Evidence (maintenance rituximab for previously treated patients): - In a prospective randomized trial of 465 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma, responders to R-CHOP or CHOP were further randomly assigned to receive rituximab maintenance (1 dose every 3 months for 2 years) or no maintenance.[ [66](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.66)][Level of evidence B1] - At a median follow-up of 6 years, rituximab maintenance was better for median PFS (44 months vs. 16 months, P < .001) and borderline for 5-year OS (74% vs. 64%, P = .07). - This benefit for maintenance was evident even for patients who received rituximab during induction therapy. Most patients in both arms received extensive rituximab during postprotocol salvage treatment. - In a prospective randomized trial of 280 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma, responders to chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation consolidation were randomly assigned to receive four doses of rituximab maintenance or no maintenance.[ [67](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.67)][Level of evidence B1] - With an 8.3-year median CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .012]), but there was no difference in OS. - A meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical trials with a total of 2,586 patients with follicular lymphoma, most of whom had relapsed disease, compared rituximab maintenance with no maintenance and showed improved OS for rituximab maintenance in previously treated patients (HRdeath, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57-0.91).[ [68](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.68)][Level of evidence A1] For previously treated patients, there is more evidence to suggest an OS advantage with the use of rituximab maintenance. Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Obinutuzumab is a glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal with greater antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity than rituximab. (obinutuzumab): - A prospective randomized trial (NCT01332968) of 1,202 patients with previously untreated rituximab same chemotherapy regimens (based on investigator choice).[ [69](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.69)] After six cycles of combination therapy, patients had 2 years of maintenance therapy, receiving the same antibody every 2 months. - With a median follow-up of 34.5 months, the 3-year PFS rate was 80% in the obinutuzumab group and in the rituximab (HR, 0.66; CI, 0.51-0.85, P = .001).[ [69](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.69)][Level of evidence B1] - There was no difference in OS. - There was a high rate of toxic deaths among patients using bendamustine in the obinutuzumab arm (5.6%) and in the rituximab arm (4.4%) compared with what has been seen historically. For patients with indolent low-grade lymphoma, with median survivals exceeding 15 years, the number of toxic deaths during first-line therapy seems excessive. By comparison, the toxic death rate was 1% to 2% when either antibody was combined with CHOP or CVP. Several issues have been raised about this study: - The side effects were significantly higher with obinutuzumab in terms of infusion reactions and subsequent adverse events. - Obinutuzumab costs significantly more than rituximab. In summary, in the absence of any change in OS, switching from rituximab to obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma is a difficult choice. The PFS differences may be attributable to the imbalance in monoclonal antibody dosing, and the increased side effects and costs are mitigating factors. In this trial, bendamustine combined with either antibody led to unacceptable rates of toxic death. - With a median follow-up of 34.5 months, the 3-year PFS rate was 80% in the obinutuzumab group and in the rituximab assigned 307 patients with recurrent indolent lymphoma to copanlisib plus rituximab and 151 patients to placebo plus rituximab (2:1 randomization).[ [70](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.70)] - With a median follow-up of 19.2 months, the median PFS was 21.5 months for patients in the copanlisib-plus-rituximab arm (95% CI, 17.8-33.0) versus 13.8 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.5) for patients in the placebo-plus-rituximab arm (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.69; P < .0001).[ [70](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s9.70)][Level of evidence B1] - Hyperglycemia and hypertension were the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events, occurring in half of the patients who received copanlisib. - With a median follow-up of 19.2 months, the median PFS was 21.5 months for patients in the copanlisib-plus-rituximab arm (95% CI, 17.8-33.0) versus 13.8 months (95% CI, 10.2-17.5) for patients in the placebo-plus-rituximab arm (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.39-0.69; P < .0001).[ The PI3K inhibitors have significant adverse effects, including pneumonitis, colitis, transaminitis, hypertension, hyperglycemia, rash, and increased risk of infections.

[] Treatment of Indolent, Recurrent NHL In general, treatment with standard agents rarely produces a cure in patients whose disease has relapsed. Sustained remissions after relapse can often be obtained in patients with indolent lymphomas, but relapse will usually ensue. Favorable survival after relapse has been associated with an age younger than 60 years, complete remission rather than partial remission, and duration of response longer than 2 years.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.1)] Even the most favorable subset, however, has a tenfold greater mortality compared with age-adjusted U.S. population rates.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.2)] Patients who experience a relapse with indolent lymphoma can often have their disease controlled with single agent or combination chemotherapy, rituximab (an Long-term freedom from second relapse, however, is uncommon and multiple relapses will usually occur. Patients with indolent lymphoma may experience a relapse with a more aggressive histology. If the clinical pattern of relapse suggests that the disease is behaving in a more aggressive manner, a biopsy can be performed. Documentation of conversion to a more aggressive histology requires an appropriate change to therapy applicable to that histological type.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.5)] Rapid growth or discordant growth between various disease sites may indicate a histological conversion. In a retrospective review of 325 patients between 1972 and 1999, the risk of histological transformation was 30% by 10 years from diagnosis.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.6)] In this series, high-risk factors for subsequent histological transformation were advanced stage, high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index, and expectant management. The median survival after transformation was 1 to 2 years, with 25% of patients alive at 5 years and with approximately 10% to 20% of patients alive 10 years after re-treatment.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.7)] A prospective trial of 631 patients with follicular lymphoma and with a median follow-up of 60 months in the rituximab era (2002-2009) found a 5-year transformation rate (11%) to a higher-grade histology.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.8)] The median overall survival (OS) after transformation was 50 months, and the 5-year OS rate was 66%, if the transformation occurred more than 18 months after a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. This series describes a better prognosis for patients with transformation than was experienced by patients in the prerituximab era. For descriptions of the regimens used to treat histological conversions, see the Treatment of Aggressive, Recurrent NHL section. The durability of the second remission may be short, and clinical trials can be considered. Treatment Options for Indolent, Recurrent NHL Treatment options for indolent, recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include the following: - Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy. - Obinutuzumab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy. - Palliative radiation therapy. Chemotherapy (single agent or combination). - Radiolabeled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. - receptor (CAR) T-cell Bispecific T-cell engagers. - Stem cell transplantation (SCT). Rituximab alone or in combination with cytotoxic agents used in front-line therapy Rituximab results in a 40% to 50% response rate in patients who [14](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.14), [15](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s10.15)] Evidence (rituximab): - In three randomized, prospective studies involving previously treated patients with relapsed indolent lymphoma, patients were randomly assigned to rituximab maintenance after re-treatment with combination chemotherapy (with or rituximab alone.[ used in front-line therapy Obinutuzumab is a CD20-binding monoclonal antibody with alternative epitope binding.

[] Treatment of Aggressive Stage I and Aggressive, Contiguous Stage II NHL Patients with aggressive stage I or aggressive, contiguous stage II diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are candidates for combination chemotherapy with or without involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT). Patients with a resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% 2.1% in a retrospective study of 326 patients.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.1)] Treatment Options for Aggressive Stage I and Aggressive, Contiguous Stage II NHL Treatment options for aggressive stage I and aggressive, contiguous stage II non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include IF-XRT The confirmation of efficacy for rituximab in advanced-stage disease has suggested the use of R-CHOP with or without radiation therapy but its use is only supported by retrospective comparisons.[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.4)][Level of evidence C2] - R-CHOP (four to six cycles). - R-CHOP (three to six cycles) + IF-XRT. Evidence (R-CHOP with or without IF-XRT): - In a randomized prospective trial of 334 patients with nonbulky (7 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, after receiving four to six cycles of R-CHOP-14 (R-CHOP delivered every 2 weeks), patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive 40 Gy of radiation therapy.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.5)] - After a median follow-up of 64 months, the 5-year event-free survival (89%-92%, P = .18) and 5-year overall survival (OS) (92%-96%, P = .32) were the same.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.5)][Level of evidence A1] Similar to the results of randomized studies of radiation therapy in the prerituximab era, radiation therapy can be deferred in nonbulky early-stage patients. For patients unable to tolerate prolonged-course chemotherapy, three cycles of R-CHOP plus radiation therapy has produced equivalent results based on single-arm retrospective trials.[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.4)] - After a median follow-up of 64 months, the 5-year event-free survival (89%-92%, P = .18) and 5-year overall survival (OS) (92%-96%, P = .32) were the same.[ - In a randomized prospective trial (NCT00278421) of 592 patients younger than 60 years with nonbulky (<7.5 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, patients were randomly assigned to receive either four or six cycles of R-CHOP (with an extra two cycles of rituximab after four cycles).[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.6)] - With a median follow-up of 66 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96% (95% CI, 94%99%)for patients who received four cycles of R-CHOP, which was 3% better (lower limit of one-sided 95% CI was zero) than the PFS rate for patients who received six cycles, establishing noninferiority for the four-cycle regimen.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.6)][Level of evidence B1] - With a median follow-up of 66 months, the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 96% (95% CI, 94%99%)for patients who received four cycles of R-CHOP, which was 3% better (lower limit of one-sided 95% CI was zero) than the PFS rate for patients who received six cycles, establishing noninferiority for the four-cycle regimen.[ - A retrospective analysis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2001 and 2015 included 341 patients with stage I disease. The analysis found that 66% of patients had an extranodal presentation. After R-CHOP (or a similar regimen), with or without radiation therapy, the 5-year disease-free survival rate was 77%, and the 5-year OS rate was 94%.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.7)][Level of evidence C3] A multivariate analysis suggested that radiation therapy may improve outcomes for patients with extranodal disease that is positron emission tomography (PET)-positive at the end of therapy. This hypothesis needs confirmation in a prospective randomized trial.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s11.7)] In summary, for patients with favorable prognosis nonbulky (<7 cm) stage I or stage II DLBCL, four cycles of R-CHOP is sufficient. For patients with unfavorable prognosis, six cycles of R-CHOP or three cycles of R-CHOP and 40 Gy of radiation therapy can be used. Early-stage patients with bulky disease (>7.5 cm) have not been studied in randomized trials; combined-modality therapy with R-CHOP for four to six cycles plus radiation therapy is usually chosen. Although a retrospective study suggested that patients with stage I extranodal disease and a positive PET scan at the end of therapy may benefit from radiation therapy, this hypothesis must be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial.

R-CHOP The following studies established R-CHOP as the standard regimen for newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.2)] Dose intensification of R-CHOP by a 14-day versus a 21-day cycle did not result in improved outcomes.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.3)] Evidence (R-CHOP): - R-CHOP showed improvement in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) alone in 399 advanced-stage patients with DLBCL older than 60 years (EFS rate, 57% vs. 38%; P = .002, and OS rate, 70% vs. 57%; P = .007 at 2 years).[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.4)][Level of evidence A1] At a median follow-up of 10 years, the OS rate of patients who received R-CHOP compared with patients who received CHOP was 44% versus 28% (P < .0001).[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.5)] - Similarly, for 326 evaluable patients younger than 61 years, R-CHOP showed improvement in EFS and OS compared with CHOP alone (EFS rate, 79% vs. 59%, P = .001, and OS rate, 93% vs. 84%, P = .001 at 3 years).[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.6)][Level of evidence A1] - A randomized study (DSHNHL-1999-1A [NCT00052936]) of 1,222 patients older than 60 years compared R-CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles with CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.7)] With a median follow-up of 72 months, the EFS favored R-CHOP given every 2 weeks for six or eight cycles (EFS rate at 6 years, 74% vs. 56%; P < .0001). The OS favored R-CHOP for only six cycles because of increased toxicity in the eight-cycle arm (OS rate at 6 years, 90% vs. 80%; P = .0004).[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.7)][Level of evidence A1] There was no comparison with standard R-CHOP or CHOP given every 3 weeks. - A trial (NCT00140595) of 380 patients younger than 60 years with DLBCL and an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI) rating of 1 randomly assigned treatment of patients to ACVBP and R-ACVBP plus consolidation with methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and versus CHOP and rituximab.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.8)] With a median follow-up of 44 months, 3-year OS rates favored R-ACVBP (92% evidence A1] The significantly worse toxicities with R-ACVBP, the narrow target population (<60 years with either elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or stage III-stage IV disease, but not both), and the lack of a confirmatory trial may inhibit adoption of R-ACVBP as a new standard of care.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.9)] Modifications to R-CHOP to achieve improved efficacy continue to be explored in clinical trials.

Nonetheless, physician advisory panels are considering whether this represents a new standard regimen to replace R-CHOP. The new regimen is more than twice the cost of R-CHOP using acquisition prices in 2022. There is no validated trial for interim positron emission tomography-based treatment intensification.[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.12)] R-CHOP has curative potential even in patients older than 80 years who are frail and require reduced dosage of R-CHOP components.

It was developed by the German Lymphoma Study Group and validated by the British Columbia Cancer Agency database. The presence of four to six of the CNS-IPI risk factors (age >60 years, performance status 2, elevated LDH, stage III or IV disease, >1 extranodal site, or involvement of the kidneys or adrenal glands) was used to define a high-risk group for CNS recurrence (a 12% risk of CNS involvement by 2 years).[ [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.31)] CNS prophylaxis (usually with four to six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) is often recommended for patients with testicular involvement.[ [32](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.32), [33](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.33), [34](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.34)][Level of evidence C3] A of the German RICOVER studies compared intrathecal methotrexate with no prophylaxis in patients with DLBCL. This study was completed during the R-CHOP treatment era. With the possible exception of patients with testicular involvement, the analysis showed that intrathecal methotrexate did not reduce the risk of CNS disease.[ [35](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.35)][Level of evidence C3] Some clinicians employ high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate (usually four doses) as an alternative to intrathecal therapy because drug delivery is improved and patient morbidity is decreased.[ [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.36)] Five retrospective studies and one network meta-analysis evaluating high-dose methotrexate alone in patients with high-risk DLBCL at high risk for CNS relapse (e.g., patients with four to six CNS-IPI risk factors) may receive intrathecal methotrexate or high-dose IV methotrexate, but the lack of confirmatory randomized studies calls this standard into question and shows an urgent need for better therapeutics verified in clinical trials. Although patients with testicular involvement or kidney/adrenal involvement are considered an exception, there is only anecdotal benefit from intrathecal or high-dose IV methotrexate rituximab to CHOP-based regimens has significantly reduced the risk of relapse in retrospective analyses.[ [35](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.35), [43](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.43)][Level of evidence C3] Patients with CNS dissemination at diagnosis or at relapse usually receive rituximab and high doses of methotrexate and/or cytarabine followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), but this approach has not been assessed in randomized trials.[ [44](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.44), [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.45)][Level of evidence C3] BMT or trials evaluated the role of autologous BMT or SCT consolidation versus chemotherapy alone in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma A1] Although some of these trials demonstrated significant increases in EFS (by 10% to 20%) among patients who received high-dose therapy, significant differences in OS could not be demonstrated prospectively in any of the series. Retrospective analyses of high-intermediate (two risk factors) or high-risk (more than three risk factors) patients as defined by IPI suggest improved survival with BMT in two of the trials.[ [47](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.47), [53](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.53)] These studies do not establish that high-dose consolidation is of value to patients with aggressive lymphoma who are truly at high risk of relapse, and they also demonstrate that EFS may be a poor surrogate for OS for these patients.[ [57](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.57)] Radiation therapy consolidation to sites of bulky disease After R-CHOP induction chemotherapy (or similar regimens), the addition of involved-field radiation therapy to sites of initial bulky disease (5-10 cm) or to extralymphatic sites remains controversial.[ [58](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.58), [59](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.59), [60](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s12.60)] Increased risks, such as long-term toxicities (e.g., second malignancies), must be considered.

[] Treatment of Aggressive, Recurrent NHL Treatment Options for Aggressive, Recurrent NHL In a retrospective review of multiple international trials, 636 patients were identified as having refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which was defined as progression or stable disease during or just at completion of full-course chemotherapy or relapse within 1 year after autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT).[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.1)] With subsequent therapy the objective response rate was 26%, complete response (CR) rate was 7%, median overall survival (OS) was 6.3 months, and only 20% of patients were alive at 2 years. Even with reinduction chemotherapy with planned autologous SCT, outcomes remain poor.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.2)] Treatment options for aggressive, recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) include the following: - Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for primary refractory disease or relapse within one year. - Bone marrow transplantation (BMT)/SCT consolidation. - CAR T-cell therapy for relapse after T-cell therapy for primary refractory disease or relapse within one year Patients with DLBCL who relapse during or within 2 months of receiving R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy have primary refractory disease. Any patient with disease relapse within 1 year of R-CHOP chemotherapy or with primary refractory disease has a poor prognosis even with reinduction using chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.1), [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.2)] Patients who received T-cell a 40% to 50% 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate with follow-up, a autologous SCT with CAR T-cell therapy with or without bridging chemoimmunotherapy for patients with high-risk relapsed disease defined as primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP therapy. Evidence (CAR T-cell therapy): - A prospective randomized trial included 359 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel with only a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 40.5% for patients who received axicabtagene ciloleucel and 16.3% for patients who received ratio < .0001).[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.7)][Level of evidence B1] - The OS was not significantly better at 2 years, with an HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.53-1.01; P = .027). - On the chemoimmunotherapy arm of the study, 64% of patients never received autologous SCT because of inadequate response, progression, or death. - Clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences in quality of life were obtained in the CAR T-cell arm at day 100 and day 150, compared with the standard of care.[ [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.8)][Level of evidence A2] - Grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 6% of patients and grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity occurred in 21% of patients. - With a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 40.5% for patients who received axicabtagene ciloleucel and 16.3% for patients who received ratio P < .0001).[ - A prospective randomized trial included 184 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy lisocabtagene maraleucel, with 63% of patients receiving or second-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.9)] - With a median follow-up of 6.2 months, the median PFS was 14.8 months for patients who received lisocabtagene maraleucel and 5.7 months for patients who received chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT (HR, 0.41; P = .001).[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.9)][Level of evidence B1] - On the chemoimmunotherapy arm of the study, 53% of patients never received autologous SCT because of inadequate response, progression, or death.[ [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.9)] - Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 1% of patients, and grade 3 neurotoxicity occurred in 4% of patients. There were no grade 4 or 5 occurrences. - With a median follow-up of 6.2 months, the median PFS was 14.8 months for patients who received lisocabtagene maraleucel and 5.7 months for patients who received chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT (HR, 0.41; P = .001).[ - A prospective randomized trial included 322 patients with primary refractory disease or relapse within 12 months of initial R-CHOP chemotherapy. Patients received the CAR T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel, with most patients receiving bridging therapy to achieve response, or second-line chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT.[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.10)] - There was no difference in EFS for patients in either arm (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82-1.40; P = .69).[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.10)][Level of evidence B1] - In the CAR T-cell therapy arm, 48% of patients received two or more cycles of chemoimmunotherapy as part of bridging therapy. This approach to bridging therapy may have led to an unacceptable number of cases of progressive disease. - There was no difference in EFS for patients in either arm (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.82-1.40; P = .69).[ In summary: - For patients with high-risk relapsing DLBCL with primary refractory disease or relapse within of R-CHOP-based ciloleucel and cisplatin). - The interval until patients receive CAR T cells must be minimized, optimally by using only steroids, eliminating bridging chemoimmunotherapy, and infusing the CAR T-cell product as quickly as possible. - The preference for CAR T-cell therapy over chemoimmunotherapy followed by autologous SCT does not apply to patients who relapse more than 12 months after R-CHOP therapy. - The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has compiled guidelines for the management of adverse events in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.11)] Bone marrow/stem cell transplantation consolidation BMT consolidation is a treatment for patients whose lymphoma has relapsed.[ [12](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.12)] Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 20% to 40% of patients will have a long-term disease-free status, but the precise percentage depends on patient selection and the specific treatment used. Preparative drug regimens have varied; some investigators also use total-body irradiation. Similar success has been achieved using autologous marrow, with or without marrow purging, [14](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.14), prospective randomized study, (EORTC-PARMA), 215 patients in first or second relapse of aggressive lymphoma, younger than 60 years, and with no bone marrow or central nervous system involvement, were given two cycles of intensive combination chemotherapy. The 109 patients who responded were randomly assigned to receive four more cycles of chemotherapy and involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT) versus autologous BMT followed by IF-XRT. With a 5-year median follow-up, the EFS rate was significantly improved with transplantation (46% vs. 12%). The OS rate was also significantly better with transplantation (53% vs. 32%).[ [18](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.18)][Level of evidence A1] Salvage BMT was unsuccessful for patients on the nontransplant arm whose disease relapsed. In general, patients who responded to initial therapy and who responded to conventional therapy for relapse before the BMT have had the best results.[ [19](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.19)] - In a prospective trial, patients who relapsed late (>12 months after diagnosis) had better OS than patients who relapsed earlier (the 8-year survival rate was 29% vs. 13%, P = .001).[ [20](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.20)][Level of evidence C1] Peripheral SCT yielded results equivalent to standard autologous SCT.[ [21](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.21), [22](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.22)] Even patients who never experienced complete remission with conventional chemotherapy may have prolonged PFS (31% at 5 years) after high-dose chemotherapy and if they retain chemosensitivity to therapy.[ [23](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.23)][Level of evidence C2] Some patients who relapse after a previous autologous SCT fludarabine plus or fludarabine or Gy of total-body irradiation.[ [27](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.27)] Evidence (peripheral SCT): - In a randomized prospective trial, 396 patients with DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory to first-line therapy received either R-ICE or R-DHAP followed by autologous SCT.[ [28](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.28)] - There was no difference in 3-year EFS or OS.[ [28](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.28)][Level of evidence A1] - There was no difference in 3-year EFS or OS.[ - In a randomized prospective trial, 619 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive lymphoma received either R-DHAP or R-GDP followed by autologous SCT.[ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.29)] - At a median follow-up of 53 months, there was no difference in EFS or OS, but patients who received R-GDP reported less toxicity.[ [29](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.29)][Level of evidence A3] - At a median follow-up of 53 months, there was no difference in EFS or OS, but patients who received R-GDP reported less toxicity.[ CAR T-cell therapy for relapse after autologous SCT In the event of disease relapse after autologous SCT, many patients receive consolidation with CAR T-cell therapy. Multiple trials describe patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an infusion of T cells that were engineered to express a CAR to target the CD19 antigen expressed on the malignant B cells using three reported CR rate of 50% to 60% and a 2-year OS rate of 40% to 50%, but the long-term durability of response has yet to be determined in these highly-selected patients.[ [30](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.30), [31](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.31), [32](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.32)][Level of evidence C3] This therapy is an option for patients with otherwise refractory or resistant disease. These results have been verified off-study in two reports that included 397 patients treated after U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.[ [35](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.35), [36](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.36)][Level of evidence C3] The highest risk patients who respond adequately may receive a subsequent allogeneic SCT consolidation in some cases if eligible. ASCO has compiled guidelines for the management of adverse events in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.11)] Tafasitamab plus lenalidomide Evidence (tafasitamab plus lenalidomide): - In a phase II study, 80 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated with tafasitamab, a CD19-directed humanized monoclonal antibody combined with lenalidomide.[ [37](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.37)] - The CR rate was 43% and the objective response rate was 60%. The FDA approved the combination of tafasitamab and lenalidomide for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.[ [37](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.37)][Level of evidence C3] It is unclear if using this CD19-directed therapy would interfere with consolidation using CD19-CAR T cells. Rituximab plus lenalidomide Evidence (rituximab plus lenalidomide): - In two phase II trials, 49 patients showed a 19% to 35% overall response rate to bendamustine): - In a randomized, prospective trial, 80 patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL were treated with either polatuzumab vedotin combined with bendamustine and rituximab (BR) or BR alone, with a primary end point of complete response.[ [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.40)] - The CR rate by positron emission tomographycomputed tomography scan was 40% for the polatuzumab vedotin-BR combination, compared with 18% for BR alone (P = .026).[ [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.40)] - Similarly, the median PFS was higher for patients who received the polatuzumab vedotin combination (9.5 months) than for the patients who received BR alone (3.7 months) (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.210.63; P < .001); the OS was 12.4 months for patients who received the polatuzumab vedotin combination versus 4.7 months for the patients who received BR alone (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.240.75; P = .002).[ [40](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.40)][Level of evidence - The CR rate by positron emission tomographycomputed tomography scan was 40% for the polatuzumab vedotin-BR combination, compared with 18% for BR alone (P = .026).[ The FDA approved the combination of polatuzumab vedotin and BR for patients with relapsed tesirine (loncastuximab tesirine): - A phase I and subsequent phase II trial included 184 patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Bispecific and to CD3 to direct T cells to eliminate malignant B cells.[ [44](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.44)] As with CAR T-cell therapy, almost one-half of patients who receive this therapy experience cytokine release syndrome. Palliative radiation therapy In general, patients with aggressive lymphoma who relapse with indolent histology will benefit from palliative therapy.[ [45](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.45)] may be achieved with very low-dose (4 Gy) IF-XRT for patients with indolent and aggressive relapsed disease.[ [46](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s13.46)] Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Eur J Cancer 41 (12): 1724-30, [] Treatment of Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL) / Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) LBL is a very aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which often occurs in young patients but not exclusively. LBL is the lymphomatous manifestation of ALL. The treatment paradigms are based on trials for ALL because LBL and ALL are considered different manifestations of the same biological disease. LBL is commonly associated with large mediastinal masses and has a high predilection for disseminating to bone marrow and the central nervous system (CNS). Intensive combination chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis is the standard treatment of this aggressive histological type of NHL. Radiation therapy is sometimes given to areas of bulky tumor masses. Because these forms of NHL tend to progress quickly, combination chemotherapy is instituted rapidly once the diagnosis has been confirmed. For more information, see Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. The most important aspects of the pretreatment staging workup include careful review of the following pathological specimens: - Bone marrow aspirate. - Biopsy specimen. - Cerebrospinal fluid cytology. - Lymphocyte marker. Treatment Options for LBL/ALL Treatment options for LBL include the following: - Intensive therapy. - Radiation therapy. New treatment approaches are being developed by the national cooperative groups. Other approaches include the use of bone marrow transplantation for consolidation. For more information, see Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. Intensive therapy Standard treatment is intensive combination chemotherapy with CNS prophylaxis. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy is sometimes given to areas of bulky tumor masses. Current Clinical Trials Use our advanced clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. General information about clinical trials is also available. [] Treatment of Diffuse, Small Noncleaved-Cell / Burkitt Lymphoma Diffuse, small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma typically involves younger patients and represents the most common type of pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).[ blastoid morphology without with germinal center B-cell phenotype.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.3)] Up to one-half of patients have a single MYC rearrangement. Optimal treatment is poorly defined because the diagnosis is rare. Burkitt lymphoma regimens with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis are chosen.[ [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.3)] Treatment Options for Diffuse, Small Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma Treatment options for diffuse, small, noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma Treatment small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma is usually an aggressive multidrug regimen similar to those used for the advanced-stage aggressive lymphomas (such as diffuse large cell).[ [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.4), [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.5), [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.6)] Adverse prognostic factors include 40 years, high serum lactate dehydrogenase (>3 times normal), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or greater, and CNS involvement.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.2)] A retrospective review of 641 adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma from 30 U.S. cancer centers found a 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 64%. Nineteen percent of patients had CNS involvement, 14% had primary refractory disease, and the treatment-related mortality rate was 10%.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.2)] Evidence (aggressive multidrug regimens): - Aggressive combination chemotherapy patterned after that used in childhood Burkitt lymphoma has been very successful for adult patients. More than 60% of advanced-stage patients were free of disease at 5 years.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.6), [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.7), [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.8), [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.9)] - Rituximab has been aggressive combination chemotherapy regimens. A nonrandomized, single-arm, prospective, multicenter trial of 363 patients, aged 16 years to 85 years, showed a 5-year PFS rate of 71% and a 5-year overall of 80%.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.5)][Level of evidence C1] CNS prophylaxis Patients noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma have to 30% lifetime risk of CNS involvement. CNS prophylaxis with methotrexate is recommended for all patients, usually given as four to six intrathecal injections.[ [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.10)] For more information, see Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment. Evidence (CNS prophylaxis): - In a series of 41 patients treated with systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, 44% of those who presented with CNS disease and 13% of those who relapsed with CNS involvement became long-term disease-free survivors.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s15.11)] CNS relapse patterns were similar whether or not patients received radiation therapy, but increased neurological deficits were noted among those patients who received radiation therapy.

[] Treatment of NHL During Pregnancy General Information About NHL During Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) occur more frequently than Hodgkin lymphoma in an older population. This age difference may account for fewer reports of NHL in pregnant patients.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.1)] Stage Information for NHL During Pregnancy To avoid exposure to ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred tool for staging evaluation.[ [2](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.2)] For more information, see the Stage Information for NHL section. Treatment Option Overview for NHL During Pregnancy |Stage||Treatment Options| |Indolent NHL During Pregnancy||Delay delivery, when feasible| |Termination of pregnancy| Indolent NHL During Pregnancy Treatment may be delayed for those women with an indolent NHL. Aggressive NHL During Pregnancy Immediate therapy According to anecdotal case series, most NHLs in pregnant patients are aggressive, and delay of therapy until after delivery appears to have poor outcomes.[ [1](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.1), [3](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.3), [4](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.4), [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.5)] Consequently, some investigators favor immediate therapy, even during pregnancy.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.5)] In a review of 121 patient case reports from 74 papers, one-half of the patients had very aggressive lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, and one-half of the patients had involvement of the breast, ovaries, uterus, or placenta.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.6)] One-half of the patients received therapy antepartum, and the 6-month survival rate was reported at 53%, with a live-birth rate of 83%.[ [6](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.6)][Level of evidence C3] A multicenter retrospective analysis of 50 patients described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to postpartum in 15 patients (median 30 weeks gestation), and antenatal therapy applied to the remaining 32 patients (median 21 weeks gestation, all done after the first trimester).[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.7)] With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 53%, and the overall survival was 82%, using R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, of this regimen.[ [7](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.7)][Level of evidence C3] Early delivery when feasible For some women, early delivery, when feasible, may minimize or avoid exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Termination of pregnancy Termination of pregnancy in the first trimester may be an option that allows immediate therapy for women with aggressive NHL. Evidence (treatment effect on children exposed in utero): - With follow-up ranging from several months to 11 years, children who were exposed to high-dose doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy in utero (especially during the second and third trimester) had normal growth and no evidence of congenital malformations.[ [5](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.5), [8](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.8), [9](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.9), [10](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.10)] For most of the chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of NHL, there are no data regarding long-term effects on children exposed in utero. - In one anecdotal case, a newborn exposed to a rituximab-containing regimen in utero was born with no circulating B lymphocytes. The newborn was otherwise healthy and recovered the circulating B lymphocytes by age 6 months with no unusual or persisting intercurrent infections.[ [11](/medical-topics/id/ncicdr0000062707#s16.11)] References: - Ward 16 (5): 397-409, 1989. - Nicklas AH, Baker ME: Imaging strategies in the pregnant cancer patient.

[] Changes to This Summary (05 / 18 / 2023) The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available. This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL} Added text to state that CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells may be used in patients who have disease progression after two or more prior lines of therapy (cited Jacobson et al. as reference 30). Also added text to state that mosunetuzumab may also be used in this setting (cited Bartlett et al. as reference 31). Added Gertz as reference 48. Also revised text to state that symptomatic patients with a serum viscosity of four or lower are usually started directly on chemoimmunotherapy or biologically directed therapies. Therapy may be required to correct hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic cold agglutinin disease; rituximab, bendamustine, and steroids are often used. Sutimlimab can reduce hemolysis when therapies directed at the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma prove ineffective (cited R\u00f6th et al. as reference 49). Added text to state that splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a distinct clinical entity that usually presents with massive splenomegaly. A variant form of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue lymphoma is known as immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (cited Rossi et al. as reference 80). Revised text to state that among patients with concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 40% to 60% attained a complete or partial remission after loss of detectable HCV RNA with antiviral treatment (cited Merli et al. as reference 119). Aggressive NHL Revised text to state that, among patients with advanced-stage disease, 50% are cured with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy typically R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive large B-cell lymphomas are extremely rare, and they do not respond well to conventional R-CHOP therapy. Anecdotal responses to ALK inhibitors like lorlatinib or alectinib have been reported (cited Soumerai et al. as reference 22 and level of evidence C3). Added Savage as reference 37. Added text to state that among patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half of patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had disease response (cited Abramson et al. as reference 53 and level of evidence C3). Added text to state that among patients with follicular large cell lymphoma who had received two prior lines of therapy, more than one-half of patients who received CAR T-cell therapy with lisocabtagene maraleucel had disease response. Added text to state that a retrospective review of 84 patients with ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) suggested a survival benefit with autologous stem cell transplantation. This hypothesis requires confirmation in a randomized prospective trial (cited Brink et al. as reference 72). Added text to state that primary cutaneous ALCL is a distinct entity that is typically ALK-negative and has a very indolent/low-grade clinical course. Added text about a phase II trial of 131 previously untreated patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) aged 65 years or younger. One year of ibrutinib plus 4 weeks of rituximab resulted in a complete response (CR) rate of 89% prior to any chemotherapy consolidation (cited 2022 Wang et al. as reference 210 and level of evidence C3). Another phase II trial using ibrutinib plus rituximab included asymptomatic patients with previously untreated MCL; the CR rate was 87% (cited Gin\u00e9 et al. as reference 211 and level of evidence C3). Added Hermine et al. as reference 220. Revised text about the results of phase II trial of brexucabtagene autoleucel in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL whose disease did not respond to ibrutinib or acalabrutinib (cited 2023 Wang et al. as reference 232). Stage Information for NHL Added text to state that in a retrospective review of over 32,000 cases of lymphoma, up to 40% of diagnoses were made by core needle biopsy, and 60% were made by excisional biopsy (cited Syrykh et al. as reference 1). Core needle biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 92.3% of cases, and excisional biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 98.1% of cases. Added text about retrospective study of 580 patients with follicular lymphoma that showed no improvement in assessing response to therapy when bone marrow biopsy was added to radiological imaging (cited Rutherford et al. as reference 10). Treatment of Indolent, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Added Morschhauser et al. as reference 59. Revised text about the results of the RELEVANCE trial, which included 1,030 patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma who were treated with rituximab plus lenalidomide for 18 months or rituximab plus chemotherapy (usually R-CHOP). Treatment of Indolent, Recurrent NHL Revised the list of treatment options for indolent, recurrent NHL to include bispecific T-cell engagers. Revised text to state that for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. Revised results of a phase II trial of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Added text about a phase II trial of 98 patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy who received anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy with tisagenlecleucel (cited Fowler et al. as reference 33 and level of evidence C3). Added Bispecific T-cell engagers as a new subsection. Treatment of Aggressive Stage I and Aggressive, Contiguous Stage II NHL Added text about a retrospective analysis of 341 patients with stage I disease who received R-CHOP (or a similar regimen) with or without radiation therapy (cited Bobillo et al. as reference 7 and level of evidence C3). Added text to state that although a retrospective study suggested that patients with stage I extranodal disease and a positive positron emission tomography scan at the end of therapy may benefit from radiation therapy, this hypothesis must be confirmed in a prospective randomized trial. Treatment of Aggressive, Noncontiguous Stage II/III/IV NHL Added Nowakowski et al. as reference 10. Treatment of Aggressive, Recurrent NHL Revised the list of treatment options for aggressive, recurrent NHL to include bispecific T-cell engagers and palliative radiation therapy. Revised text about the results of a prospective randomized trial of CAR T-cell therapy to state that clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences in quality of life were obtained in the CAR T-cell arm at day 100 and day 150, compared with the standard of care (cited Elsawy et al. as reference 8 and level of evidence A2). Revised text about the results of another prospective randomized trial of CAR T-cell therapy to state that grade 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 1% of patients, and grade 3 neurotoxicity occurred in 4% of patients. Added Calabretta et al. as reference 41. Added Bispecific T-cell engagers as a new subsection. Treatment of Diffuse, Noncleaved-Cell/Burkitt Lymphoma Added text to describe high-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (cited Evens et al as reference 2 and Olszewski et al. as reference 3). Added text about adverse prognostic factors for diffuse, small noncleaved-cell/Burkitt lymphoma and about the results of a retrospective review of 641 adult patients with Burkitt lymphoma.
