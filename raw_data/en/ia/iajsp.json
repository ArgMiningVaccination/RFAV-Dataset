I was inspired by the level of commitment to education and the contagious culture. I saw the attendings' treatment of their patients and it was exactly the relationship I wanted to model. Along the interview trail, I of course was impressed by the excellence displayed by other programs, but no other program better matched my own goals. Of course, it helped that there is a plethora of opportunity in the sects of Emergency Medicine I am interested in: Pediatrics and EMS, along with others. The final seal was the dedication to the surrounding community of Orlando, with a beautiful balance of a county, community, and academic environment. Hobbies & Interests: You can find me on a basketball court playing pick-up 3-4 times a week, no matter how busy I am. My wife and I really enjoy going outdoors and exploring the different springs in the surrounding areas to go tubing, kayaking, and canoeing. "}
