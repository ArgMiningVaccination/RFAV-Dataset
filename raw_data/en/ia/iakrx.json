Feel free to customize your treatments to meet your specific needs. [Book your treatment here now!](https://booknow.appointment-plus.com/4bh76r1k/) Traditional Ayurvedic Treatments Shirodhara Shirodhara is the application of a warm medicated oil streamed continuously over the Third-Eye or Ajna (6th) Chakra. The technique of Shirodhara soothes, nourishes, and calms the senses as well as the mind and is recommended for chronic headaches, insomnia, anxiety, and nervousness. This is especially indicated for those experiencing high and chronic stress and who have difficulty slowing down. Shirodhara is an effective treatment for relaxation, improving memory, and nourishing the hair and scalp. It assists in providing sound sleep and calms the body and mind. It's wonderful for reducing stress and nervous tension. This deeply healing treatment, which uses the [ShiroBliss system](https://www.shirobliss.com/), drops you into a deep altered state where your mind and body can relax and reorganize itself. The treatment begins with a head, neck, and face massage, including the application of Marma Therapy, and ends with massaging the feet. As with any deeply sedating therapy or practice, we recommend you refrain from any and all unnecessary media after the treatment and engage only in life-affirming activities; in other words, if you can, please take the rest of the day off and relax! 1 hour - $167* *If oil can be reused for next appointment, 10% discount is given. Netra Basti - Eye Treatment A gift for your tired eyes. We bathe your eyes in ghee to promote the relaxation of the muscles and clarity of vision. It sounds odd, but feels amazing! We invite you to give this treatment a try if you spend hours on a computer or simply have tired or strained eyes. 1 hour - $157 Kati Basti - Low Back Treatment Your lower back never had it so good! Kati Basti is a special treatment to relieve pain in the lower lumbar region. Warm, medicated oils designed to reduce inflammation and promote circulation are bathed over the affected area and held in place by a dam. During the treatment, Marma points (energy centers) on the back are massaged to support full healing of the back. Afterward, a full back massage is done and warm towels are applied to bring warmth and support for the oils to go even deeper. 1 hour - $167 Nabhi Basti - Navel Treatment/Supports Belly & Digestion This is an amazing healing treatment that nurtures the Nabhi, a central Marma point (subtle energy point) where all of the pathways of the body (called Nadi's, which are the subtle energy channels, think meridians) converge. This is a very important center point, it's the center of us and resides between our 2nd and 3rd chakras. Warm medicated oils are held in a dough dam, which helps strengthen digestion and absorption and supports the release of deep-seated emotions stored in this area. It helps relieve digestive disturbances such as IBS, flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and anorexia. 1 hour - $157 Hrid Basti - Heart Chakra Treatment This nurturing treatment supports the healing of both the physical and emotional/energetic heart. A warm medicated milk bathes the center of your chest, around the heart and heart chakra, and allows for the release of deep-seated emotions and trauma. Because of this, I usually recommend working with me first, so I can assess the right timing to receive this powerful treatment. 1 hour - $167 Nasya Treatment - Sinus/Nasal Passage Treatment This therapeutic treatment clears and nourishes the sinuses and can help reverse deep and chronic dryness that is the root of many respiratory, central nervous system, and allergic conditions. This treatment is recommended for anyone suffering from allergies, snoring, sinusitis, tinnitus, sleep apnea, headaches, and ear aches. It can also bring relief to tension in the head, neck, and shoulders as well as bring calm, clarity, and focus to the mind. 45 min. - $127 Karna Purana - Ear Oiling + Ear Candling Ear oiling is an ancient Ayurvedic practice of applying warm oil, often medicated with herbs, to the ear canal. It's a very soothing experience and excellent for our modern times with the use of mobile phones and those exposed to loud noises and/or consistent noise pollution in their daily life. Oiling the ears can reduce dryness and itching, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and has been shown to support the reduction of cognitive decline as we age. It also supports the loosening and reduction of built-up earwax. If ear wax build-up is a reason for seeking out this treatment, we recommend 2 candles per ear to receive the most benefit. Ear candling has supported the healing of vertigo. 45 min. - $89 for Ear Oiling + Candling; $20/additional candle All treatments below are for clients who've completed an Initial Consultation. Traditional Ayurvedic Body Therapies Abhyanga Massage It's ALL about the Oil... ahhhh. In Sanskrit, the word for oiling the body is Snehana, which means \"To Love, To Be Nurtured.\" This is a far cry from your typical massage! It focuses on applying warm, herbal medicated oils to the body with long strokes, which creates deep relaxation. It also encourages lymphatic drainage, improves circulation, stimulates the immune system, and eliminates toxins. It's grounding and pacifying to the nervous system, moisturizing and nurturing, not just the skin, but All tissues in the body. Lipid soluble oils are used so the body can take them in through the skin like a nutritious meal. While the muscles get some yummy relaxation, the focus of this massage is to integrate the whole body/mind, move the lymph and relax the nervous system. We have chosen to offer a 2-hour version only as we've found it to be the most beneficial for deep relaxation, which is what this treatment is all about! Single Therapist: 2 hours $298 Note: Abhyanga was often traditionally performed with two therapists for the greatest benefit, however, it's not always possible to provide this version of the service. The single therapist version is quite lovely and makes it practical for our clients to receive it regularly. When available, we do offer the traditional 4-handed service. Ushma Swedana - Herbal Steam** This service is a special herbal fomentation, or steam canopy therapy, which can be applied following an Abhyanga, as an add-on service, to aid in the absorption and assimilation of the medicated oils as well as the elimination of toxins through sweat. Traditional Ayurvedic texts suggest that steam therapy should be performed with the patient lying down comfortably, with the head and neck exposed, rather than in the tent. This prevents overheating and allows for thorough detoxification and absorption. Herbs and aromatherapy oils are selected per the client's needs. This treatment leaves you smelling and feeling great! **Contraindicated for pregnant and menstruating women and people with high heat conditions** Add on to Abhyanga or Abhyanga/Shirodhara combination (not available as a stand-alone treatment). Add-on treatment with Abhyanga only. Ayurvedic Body Therapy Combos (two or more therapies combined) Abhy-Shiro Combo This service is a classic single therapist Abhyanga (warm Ayurvedic oil massage) with herbal oils specific to you, followed by a blissful 30-minute Shirodhara (warm oil streamed on the forehead), designed to ease your tension and headaches, help you sleep and relieve your anxiety. 2 hour Abhyanga + Shiro (2.5 hrs. total) - $387 Abhy-Herbal Steam Combo This service is a classic single therapist Abhyanga (warm Ayurvedic oil massage) with herbal oils specific to you, followed by an herbal 30-minute Steam to aid in the absorption and assimilation of the medicated oils as well as elimination of toxins through sweat. 2 hour Abhyanga + Herbal Steam (2.5 hrs. total) - $337 Ayurvedic Bliss Therapy This is the famous Ayurvedic trifecta of Abhyanga, Shirodhara, and Swedana. These therapies are recommended to calm your nerves, clear your head and remove harmful toxins from your body in a gentle and blissful way. This is not your average \"spa\" treatment. You don't just leave relaxed; you leave more balanced!
