The classic Eastern explanation for how acupuncture works is that channels of energy or Qi (pronounced 'chee') run in regular patterns through the body and over it's surface. These channels or meridians are like rivers flowing through the body to nourish the tissues. There are 14 major acupuncture meridians and each of these is believed to be associated with a particular part of the body. An obstruction or blockage in the movement of Qi creates imbalance and/or pain in the body and can lead to disease. By manipulating the needles in a certain way, the practitioner is able to bring energy to areas that are lacking or create flow in areas that are blocked, bringing a sense of balance back to the body. Most people feel very relaxed during and after the treatment. Naturopathic Medicine [Read More](5-description) According to the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct primary health care system that blends modern scientific knowledge with traditional and natural forms of medicine. The naturopathic philosophy is to stimulate the healing power of the body and treat the underlying cause of disease. Symptoms of disease are seen as warning signals of improper functioning of the body, and unfavourable lifestyle habits. Naturopathic Medicine emphasizes disease as a process rather than as an entity. Treating both acute and chronic conditions, naturopathic treatments are chosen based on the individual patient - their physiological, structural, psychological, social, spiritual, environment and lifestyle factors. In addition to diet and lifestyle changes, natural therapies including botanical medicine, clinical nutrition, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, naturopathic manipulation and traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, may also be used during treatments.

Scientific Hand Analysis is a tool for self-discovery and the modern form of the ancient art of palmistry. Through a hand reading, we can reveal your life purpose and help you get on track if you are not already on the path to your highest expression. Your fingerprints are completely formed by the 16th week of fetal development in utero and do not change over the span of your lifetime. This is why fingerprints are used as a method of identification. The lines on the palm however, will change and evolve over time and can give us great insight into the experience you have in life. The lines in your hands mimic the neural pathways in your brain. Scientific hand analysis provides an extremely eye-opening way to understand yourself, figure out your purpose, learn about your gifts, manage your challenges and blindspots, and utilize your hands as a blueprint to your soul. By taking a look at your hands and handprints, an assessment about your reason for being, your potential in this lifetime, the way you love, the way you think, and the way you live can all be explored and delved into further. Discover your purpose now, you deserve to know and be able to carry it out fully in this lifetime! Chiropractic Care & Network Spinal Analysis [Read More](12-description) Chiropractic is an effective system of holistic healing which literally means practice done by hand (Greek: Chiro-hand, Practikos-practice). Specific adjustments are made to the spine in order to create proper alignment and posture. This in turn facilitates optimal functioning of your nervous system. When the body is exposed to stressors from everyday life, it may cause spinal and muscular imbalances to develop which create tension and dysfunction in your body. With chiropractic care, the joints and muscles are released and realigned so that integrity in movement and mobility is restored. The body has an innate and intrinsic ability to heal itself, but sometimes it needs a little help, especially with all the external factors we have in modern living. When there is interference to the body's nervous system (brain and spinal column), improper signalling occurs and can show up as dysfunction and dis-ease. With regular chiropractic care, your spine is maintained in good alignment and positioning and allows the system to function at its maximal potential. Network Spinal Analysis (NSA) is an extremely gentle, low force chiropractic technique using breath and body awareness. Soft, precise, light touch to your spine helps cue the brain to unwind spinal cord tension and create new wellness promoting strategies. The result is improved movement of the breath and decreased overall tension in the muscles and spinal vertebrae. With traditional manual chiropractic care, the tension that gets built up is released with an adjustment (like when you crack your knuckles). However, in NSA, the tension is used as fuel to shift patterns and provide lasting changes in the nervous system. This reorganizational healing technique is revolutionary and actually creates new strategies in the nervous system so that your body is able to adapt and manage all the stress that it encounters daily. Nutrition Holistic and customized Nutrition uses food and supplements to address your health conditions, concerns and wellness goals. Meal plans, recipe recommendations and specific food suggestions are made to fit your unique health history, lifestyle, dietary restrictions and food preferences. All dietary recommendations are evidence-based and catered to your needs. Ayurveda & Yoga [Read More](13-description) Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term, made up of the words 'ayus,' meaning life and 'veda,'meaning knowledge. Literally, Ayurveda means 'the knowledge of life.' It is regarded as one of the oldest forms of healthcare in the world and originated in India over five thousand years ago. The aim of this healing system is to prevent illness, protect health and prolong life. It is also the sister science to yoga. Ayurveda is based on the principle that the universe is made up of five elements: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. These elements are represented in us by three doshas, which are bio-energies or body constitutions, namely: Vata (air and ether), Pitta (fire and water) and Kapha (water and earth). When any of the doshas accumulate in the body beyond the desirable limit, the body becomes imbalanced. Each of us has a distinctly unique balance, and our health and wellbeing depend on this state of harmony. Ayurveda uses the elements to keep the doshas in check and bring them back to balance. Integrating ayurvedic lifestyle modifications is a great way to understand your true nature and how to live simply in harmony with your environment. Yoga is an ancient meditative and movement practice that originated in India thousands of years ago. It is the union of body and breath. Yoga links physical postures with breathwork to provide balance to your body, mind and spirit. Yoga has become well known as a form of physical exercise, however, it has a meditative and spiritual foundation. Using yoga postures in our everyday life helps to bring presence, a relaxed state of mind, awareness and ease to the body. Incorporating yoga into your visit helps to unwind tension in the muscles and joints, releases the spine, helps the breath flow and promotes gentle healing.
