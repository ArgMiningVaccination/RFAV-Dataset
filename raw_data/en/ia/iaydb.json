Be Transcendent will: *Set the mood for your session. *Encourage insight and clarity of thought, as well as self-reflection *Deepen concentration and improve focus *When paired with your practice Be Transcendent can be used throughout the day to bring you back to that relaxed and centered feeling immediately! The scent of Be Transcendent is light and slightly fruity, with deep earthy undertones from the myrrh and an evergreen finish. It is perfect for Men and Women! Essential oils that I have included: Frankincense: has been used in religious ceremonies for centuries to encourage insight:. Rosewood: relaxing and grounding Spruce: fresh and evergreen- energizes and cleanses the mind Juniper: encourages self esteem and spiritual enlightenment- helps eliminate that which is false or negative Myrrh: deeply grounding Blue Tansy: relaxing Be Transcendent isblue due to the azulene that is a natural constituent of Blue Tansy Essential Oil. I use only pure essential oils and botanical extracts in my Perfumes, Mists, and Roll Ons - there are no fragrance oils, as even \"natural\" fragrance oils can contain parabens as preservatives as well as other adulterants. --------------------------------------------------------- The statements in this listing have not been evaluated by the FDA and this product is not intended to prevent, treat, or cure any disease.
