Use CBD oils, gummies or creams CBD, also known as cannabidiol, is derived from hemp plants. CBD is a [safe and effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28861514/) [treatment for insomnia](https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-treatments/cbd/) that contains almost no THC, the substance in marijuana that alters one's mental state. Many studies suggest that CBD is very [effective in promoting sleep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32774241/) and [decreasing anxiety](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26341731/). It comes in many forms, such as oils and lotions. Use before bed to promote sleepiness and relaxation. Brew a hot cup of herbal tea Brewing tea is an ancient practice. [Chamomile](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30000867/), [valerian root](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Valerian-HealthProfessional/) and [magnolia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5365644/) tea are all natural remedies for anxiety, stress and insomnia.

Drink tart cherry juice Sour cherry juice from tart cherries can [increase melatonin production](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22038497/) in those who consume it before bedtime. In the same study, the group who drank the cherry juice spent more time in bed, asleep and achieved higher overall sleep efficiency. This suggests that tart cherry juice has potential to aid insomnia. Try dried passionflower or extract oil Not to be confused with passionfruit -- passionflower is a fast-growing vine that produces vibrant flowers. Not only is the plant beautiful, it can even help you fall asleep either by herbal tea or extract oil. A recent study concluded that passionflower has [the potential to treat insomnia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31714321/). However, it is not recommended for those who are pregnant.
