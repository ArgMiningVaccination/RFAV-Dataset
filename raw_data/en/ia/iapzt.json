By providing child care to essential workers and first responders, feeding families facing food insecurity, connecting with seniors who are isolated, housing people who are homeless and supporting children learning virtually, the Y has worked to make sure everyone in our communities has access to the resources they need. Now the Y is working to ensure that everyone has equitable access to accurate information about the COVID-19 vaccines and to the vaccines themselves, especially Black and Brown communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the health and economic impacts of the virus. Ys across the country are committed to providing vaccine education, and many have offered to serve as vaccine distribution sites. YMCA of the USA is supporting these efforts and joining several national health and community-serving organizations in distributing accurate information to our communities and calling for equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. Below are links to expert, science-backed information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. We encourage you to direct your family, friends and neighbors to these information sources. We will update this page as additional resources are published.
