Review scope This rapid review examined papers supporting the recovery of adults experiencing mental illne ss. The researchers sought evidence to supp ort the review in three stages: The first sta ge consisted of a systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cochran e Library and CINAHL databases The second stage focused on searches of the five databases for each of the following concepts: e - Health; telehealth; online; smartphone; acute/ crisis care ; and community care The third stage involved a search of articles identified from reference lists and grey literature. The researchers presented the initial analysis of the data to a group of stakeholders that asked for papers on the following topics to be included in the review as they were not included in the initial search. They included third wave therapies, recovery colleges, eating disorder community care, family sensitive practice, co-design and the open dialogue approach. The researchers applied t he additional search terms to the same databases. The researchers excluded articles that focused on child or adolescent mental health, older persons' mental health, inpatient or residential treatment, housing and accommodation assistance, and non - clinical NGO services. The researchers also excluded those studies that examined models that had not been evaluated although some were subsequently included for background literature. The researchers included a total of 171 papers in the review. Review questions What models of care for mental health services for adults with mental health conditions in the community have been implemented and evaluated? Of the models identified, which of these have shown to deliver positive outcomes for consumers and families/carers ? Which have no evidence of positive outcomes? Results summary This rapid review of care coordination models shows that most existing models can, if adapted to be delivered in a recovery -oriented fashion, have good outcomes for consumers. Recovery -oriente d care coordination models which bring together a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including peer -support workers, are effective in delivering care. A range of 'add -on' services for care -coordination allow for basic models to be used to target specif ic needs. Effective add -ons include Illness Management and Recovery, Individualised Placement and Support RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 7 for employment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions, Wellness Recovery Action Planning, Wellness Enhancement Recovery Programs, and peer support add -ins such as Self -Help Agencies and Friends Connection. These programs can be added to as usual care with little additional resource implications to increase the effectiveness of standard programs for target groups of consumers. Of those 'thir d wave' therapies analysed, the framework with the clearest positive outcomes for consumers was Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. The Open Dialogue approach, while showing some very significant benefits in small Finnish studies, needs more large scale evalu ation before it is implemented in Australia. The only model specifically developed as a recovery -oriented model was the Open Doors to Recovery Program, which showed positive outcomes for consumers. Recovery orientation of existing models is possible, altho ugh large projects (e.g. REFOCUS) which sought to provide recovery oriented service development showed little effective change in practice. This was attributed to a lack of organisational commitment and stability. This factor was seen to be a contributor t o intervention failure in multiple recovery -oriented projects. This rapid review also found that peer worker inclusion in case management teams improved their recovery orientation and recovery outcomes for consumers. e-Health interventions are effective tr eatments for individuals with a wide range of diagnoses. They are mostly delivered via 1) web -based platforms for treatment; 2) tools for prompting health -related behaviours; and 3) online therapy. Web -based treatment platforms are used as stand -alone inte rventions or blended treatments with either a program -specific therapist or the consumer's own clinician involved. Several programs are already available for free or at low cost in Australia, including ThisWayUp, MoodGYM, GetReal and Mindspot. Online CBT p rograms are shown to be as effective as face -to-face counselling. Blended programs can also be used as transition support programs for individuals leaving inpatient care. eHealth programs are appropriate to rural and regional settings where internet access is available, and most can be delivered via both mobile technology and computers. Any implementation of e -Health initiatives should be done with a full understanding of the digital divide, which means that some groups may have more difficulty accessing th ese technologies than others. This is particularly significant because there is a lower use of internet -based technologies amongst those groups which often already have poorer mental health, including those in remote regions and some groups of indigenous, and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Australians. High -quality evidence for interventions appropriate to Indigenous communities are missing but those that do exist show that they are short -term, localised and delivered by Indigenous people. Pr inciples of service provision should be flexibility, reciprocity, cultural -specificity and involvement. There is a lack of evidence for models which specifically target people from CALD communities. However, the programs included here show that they are mo re successful at engaging with CALD communities when staffed with culturally -specific staff and peer -support workers. Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) includes urban centres, regional and rural areas, and one remote area. For rural and regional ar eas, localised programs which are devised with local collaboration of consumers, staff and other community members should be developed to ensure that programs meet local needs. None of the papers offered a sophisticated cost -benefit analysis. Several pape rs reported that the programs evaluated were cost -effective. However, they adopted varying definitions of cost -effectiveness, which limited comparison. E -health programs can be implemented in a very cost -effective way for services and provide a us This rap id review of care coordination models shows that most existing models can, if adapted to be delivered in a recovery -oriented fashion, have good outcomes for consumers.

RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 9 2 Background This review was commissioned by the Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) and the Agency for Clinical Innovation (ACI) to identify evidence about providin g mental health support for adults who are living in the community. The focus of this review is on recovery -oriented models of care and interventions. Consumer self - determination and wellbeing are promoted under this recovery -oriented approach to mental health car e.1 The aim o f this evidence check is to communicate a detailed understanding of the models of care and their capacity to maximise mental health outcomes for adults in the community. This understanding can then be used to practically inform MLHD's development of eviden ce-based Service Delivery Guidelines. While this context provides the background to the review purpose, the findings are also applicable to other NSW LHDs and service settings across Australia. Review questions What models of care for mental health servi ces for adults with mental health conditions in the community have been implemented and evaluated? Of the models identified, which of these have shown to deliver positive outcomes for consumers and families/carers? Which have no evidence of positive outco mes? Scope and definitions: \"Models of care\" include services or interventions delivered together as a whole service Models are included that provide services from acute through to long term care for people in the community \"In the community\" means people who are living outside of an inpatient or other residential setting. Services are not delivered in a hospital setting, but may include the interface between inpatient and community in care planning and transfer of care planning Studies are only included w here components of the model under examination were well described (e.g. referral process to the service including : types of conditions or other criteria used; types of treatments or interventions; staff type and mix; length of service/numbers of visits; l inks with other services such as housing, employment , discharge criteria , and links between inpatient and community services ) Where described the underlying values and principles of the model of care were included Models of care which do not offer a recov ery-oriented approach were not included Interventions of interest include d but were not limited to: on -line therapeutic programs and smartphone applications; emerging e -health services; therapeutic/psychosocial interventions; acute and crisis interventions ; case management; extended care in the community; use of telehealth for clinical service delivery. There was a particular focus on services or interventions that provide targeted equitable access (e.g. people living in rural and remote areas ) There is particular interest in services where consumers and families or carers were involved in the design of interventions \"Positive outcomes\" include but were not limited to: consumer satisfaction with the service; better consumer understanding of a condition and how to manage it; reduced unplanned hospitalisations and 10 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE potentially avoidable deaths; improved functioning within the community; maintaining tenancy; and improved participation in education and employment. Studies should also be flagged which: Include i nformation on resources or costs required to deliver service Describe services for Aboriginal people or people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. The Evidence Check's commissioners subsequently identified several further areas about which they required information which were not picked up in the initial search. The following areas were thus added to the review: Recovery Colleges Community -based eating disorder programs Family sensitive approach Open dialogue approach Co-designe d community based mental health treatment Third -wave therapies: specifically acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavioural therapy and mindfulness. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 11 3 Search methods The researchers conducted their search strategy over three stages. Stage one consisted of a systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases. Box 1 below shows the initial search terms relating to community mental health. Box 1: Search terms for initial search for community based mental health services Exp: Community mental health services/ OR Community based OR Outpatient service* AND Mental OR Psych* AND Service OR Intervention OR Model OR Program OR Model of care or trial AND Recovery OR Person cent* OR Individuali* AND limit to (abstracts and English language and yr=\"2006 - Current\") Truncation was applied to locate variations of particular words. Terms were mapped to subject headings and 'exploded' to include associated concepts wherever possible. Exhaustive searches were conducted on multiple fields. Results were limited to abstracts, publications in English language and publication year between 2006 and 2016. The following search results That gave a total of 1143 results. Stage two applied focused searches to the five databases for each of the following concepts: e smartphone; acute/crisis care; and community care. Appendix 1 shows examples of focused search terms adapted to the different databases. Appendix 2 provides a PRISMA flowchart of the search. Focused searches provided an extra 4611 results. The systematic and focused searches produced a total of 5754 results which were downloaded into EndNote for assessment. Foll owing a removal of duplicates, the revised total was 3538. We excluded papers that focused on: Child, adolescent mental health Older persons' mental health Inpatient or residential treatment Housing/accommodation assistance Non-clinical NGO services; or A primary illness which was not related to mental ill -health. 12 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Articles were excluded on occasions where they were not recovery -oriented . We also excluded papers that spoke about models in general terms without describing them in detail. Two researchers tes ted exclusion criteria against a sample of abstracts with filtering consistency negotiated between them. After applying the rules to all abstracts, a total of 600 possibly relevant articles remained. Full -texts were downloaded and after applying the exclu sion rules to the 600 full -texts, the researchers identified a total of 100 relevant articles for review. Stage three involved a search of articles identified from reference lists and grey literature obtained from Google via the open search term 'communi ty models care mental health services pdf'. This stage produced an additional 15 documents giving a total of 115 relevant papers. The researchers conducted a subsequent search to locate further articles focussing on key areas not picked up in the initial search via the same databases. The more widely focused search was for papers on: recovery colleges; open dialogue approach; eating disorder community treatment; sensitive mindfulness dialectical behavioural therapy; and accep tance and commitment therapy. A group of stakeholders from MLHD, the Sax Institute and the ACI identified these areas of focus. As a result, 56 additional papers were added to the search bringing the total number of papers to relevant to the review to 171 (see Appendix 2 - PRISMA flowchart). RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 13 4 Results Background Components of a mental health system in a high -resource setting It is hard to start thinking about what interventions should and can be provided within a community mental health system without an overall sense of what a mental health system should look like. Graham Thornicroft and Michelle Tansella2, 3 developed a study which sought to map out the key components of different types of mental health systems - those with low, medium and high levels of resources. The components were developed via a process involving a systematic review of existing literature, and surveys of international experts in mental health policy and systems development from 31 nations .4 Australia has a high level of resources available to the government to fund mental health care. Table 1 below sets out those elements that should be included in a mental health system within a high -resource setting. Table 1: Components of a mental health system in a high -resource setting developed by Thornicroft and Tansella3 Primary care and mental health General adult mental health services Specialised adu lt mental health services Case findings and assessment Talking and psycho - social treatment Pharmacological treatments Out-patient/ambulatory clinics Community mental health teams Acute in -patient care Long -term community -based residential care Work and oc cupation Out-patient/ambulatory clinics Community mental health teams Acute in -patient care Long -term community -based residential care Work and occupation As the table shows, a mental health system should include in -patient care and long -term residential care (not included in this review) along with a variety of community -based services ranging from low -intensity to high-intensity and delivered within general primary care and more specialised mental health services. The scope of our review covers most of these elements, although we do not cover pharmacological treatments and assessment at the primary care levels. Recovery -oriented services The concept of recovery has become a guiding principle for the development and implementation of mental health service s in Australia and is identified as such within our main mental health policy and implementation documents. The Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC) officially endorsed the National framework for recovery -oriented mental health services in July, 2013.1 Beyond A ustralia recovery is also a goal of international mental health and is included as a Goal of the WHO Mental Health Action Plan (2013 -2020) which aims to: \"promote mental well -being, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human ri ghts and reduce the mortality, morbidity and disability for persons with mental disorders.\" The same document describes recovery thus: \"From the perspective of the individual with mental illness, recovery means gaining and retaining hope, understanding 14 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE of one's abilities and disabilities, engagement in an active life, personal autonomy, social identity, meaning and purpose in life and a positive sense of self. Recovery is not synonymous with cure.\" The focus of recovery is therefore on the individual and re covery -oriented services should be person - centred. Key to this is the creation of 'recovery oriented services' which promote the concept of recovery to individuals through any care that is provided. Results structure The results of our rapid review are str uctured into four sections which were developed in line with the main findings and review goals. The first section highlights the case -management models identified in the literature, including those case management models which were marked by 'add -on' prog rams that specialised in the care provided. Most of these models fit within levels two and three of Thornicroft and Tansella's mental health system structure outlined above.3 The report then highlighted other community - based interventions which were not aligned with a particular case -management model or ser vice structure. Many of these interventions fit within level one of Thornicroft and Tansella's schema.3 The next section of the report focused in on e -Health and m -Health interventions. The final section of the report reflects on studies which have been found helpful for rural, regional and remote populatio ns. When discussing the interventions identified we highlight key papers that describe a particular intervention, focusing in on the elements of the program, the target population (including illness type and severity level), staff mix and findings. We foc us on whether the outcomes for services and clients were positive, negative, neutral or mixed. Case m anagement Key findings Effective recovery -oriented case management models identified included, the Open Door s to Recovery (ODR) program, recovery -oriented Intensive Case Management and ACT -IMR (an Illness Management and Recovery add -on to Assertive Community Treatment) All programs researchers reviewed that related to case -management were delivered for people with severe or complex mental ill -health The onl y model specifically developed as a recovery -oriented model was the ODR program, which showed positive outcomes for consumers With active recovery orientation methods in place standard case management models can be delivered with a focus on recovery Peer w orker inclusion in case management teams improves their recovery orientation and recovery outcomes for consumers Case management add -ons increase the relevance of programs and their recovery orientation Consumer -run peer -support add -ons and consumer deriv ed case management tools increase the effectiveness of community mental health services Consultation with consumers, carers and staff and adaptation to local contexts make generic models more effective in practice Programs are more successful at engaging CALD communities when operated with culturally specific staff and peer -support workers Case management programs may be relevant for implementation in larger regional towns, but the extensive resources and staff mix necessary for the program delivery may ma ke them ineffective in many rural areas RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 15 The Care Planning Approach is not currently an appropriate model There were no programs specifically relevant to indigenous communities or rural and remote communities There were no cost -effectiveness evaluations co nducted of the programs Organisational commitment to implementation and recovery -orientation was cited as key to program success or failure in several studies. Introduction A Cochrane Review of randomised controlled multi -morbidity interventions found a h igh level of evidence to support the use of care coordination or case management for improving mental health (specifically depression).5 However, case -management comes in different forms and many are not specifically recovery oriented. The most frequently practiced forms of case management are6: clinical case management \u2014 where the case manager is also a clinician and may also provide clinical support recovery -oriented case management \u2014 based on a strengths or other recovery -oriented model the brokerage model of case management \u2014 where the case manager is not generally a clinician and does not provide clinical support and only links together re levant services. Our review found multiple case management models with the most frequently cited being Intensive Case Management (ICM), Open Doors to Recovery (ODR), the Care Program Approach (CPA) and Assert ive Community Treatment (ACT). These are discuss ed here before describing a series of add -ons that are frequently used with standard case management to meet the needs of specific groups of consumers. These add-ons include peer -support programs, employment interventions, CBT and programs specific to ethn ic communities. Intensive Case Management ICM has shown mixed success in improving consumer outcomes. Evaluations of ICM in different contexts have reported mixed success with Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) in the UK, for example, showing little posit ive impact over other methods of case management .7, 8 However, evaluations of Irish and US programs have shown more significant positive impacts on functioning and symptomology.9, 10 This is likely to do with the local context in which the program is implemented with those that are more successful being implemented in settings that are more prepared for it. An Irish RCT investigated a recovery -oriented ICM program which invo lved (at least) weekly meetings with consumers over a nine -month period .10 Consumers had significant levels of mental ill -health with the main diagnoses being schizophrenia, other psychotic illnesses and bipolar di sorder. Staff and consumers collaborated to develop detailed plans meeting individual client needs, crisis planning, goal setting, vocatio nal support and social support .10 This was backed up by the creation of form al plans by multidisciplinary teams. In doing so it drew from elements of already established programs including ACT (discussed below) and other forms of ICM, but did so in a way that was tailored to the local context. There were low staff -client ratios of less than 1:5 and the program did not draw on an additional workforce, but was created to work with existing resources.10 The program's developers created it through consultation with a multidisciplinary team of p ractitioners, and patients and carers provided input into its design which was underpinned by a strong focus on the philosophy and practice of recovery. This consultation ensured the program was locally relevant. When compared to treatment -as-usual the int ervention group had significantly improved symptoms and functioning, including in interpersonal relationships an d cognition .10 16 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Opening Doors to Recovery The US -based recovery -focused ODR program was the focus of t hree qualitative and quantitativ e studies .11-13 The program aims to reduce readmission rates amongst individuals with severe mental ill -health who have a recent history of inpatient admission and is underpinned by the values of recovery, person - centred care and peer support. The focus of the intervention is on community connections and meeting consumer needs to allow them to have a stable place in the community. The intervention is run by a mobile multidisciplinary team comprising of three 'Community Navigation Specialists' (CNS) \u2014 a clinician, a peer -worker and a carer/family member .11, 12 The team works with a client based on their needs and have flexibility in the types o f support offered. They generally meet at least once a week with the client, and link them up with services and community supports to meet their needs. The program relies on formal and informal close connections and partnerships with other service provide rs and community organisations (including police) and this is a key part of the role of the CNS \u2014 called \"collaborative fusion\" by Compton et al .12 The program was evaluated both qualitatively13 and quantitatively12 and showed positive impacts in both. The program led to improved recovery for consumers and significantly reduced levels of hospitalisation and recidivism, for clients i n contact with the criminal justice system.12 Care Programme Approach The CPA is used within the NHS to offer case management or care coordination to people with severe mental ill -health. CPA is usually offered in a non -person-centred way with standardis ed care pla ns offered .14 However, two studies included in this review put in place recovery oriented pla nning processes. Farrelly et al14 reviewed CPA planning for people with psychosis after the implementation of Joint Crisis Plans (JCPs) which were developed as part of a more individualised approach to CPA. However, they found that there was no improvement in individualisation of pl ans following the implementation of JCPs. In a qualitative study by Rogers et al15 a CPA was developed for people with Borderline Personality Disorder in a personality disorder specific service. The care coordinat or worked with the consumer to identify their needs and develop a person -centred plan for addressing their needs. The consumer is empowered to put the plan in place and the coordinator works with t hem to do so .15 This process was found to be helpful when implemented in a collaborative manner but unhelpful when consumers felt that planning was being conducted without their input.15 Based on these findings there is currently n o evidence to support the implementation of a CPA approach. Assertive Community Treatment models The most commonly referenced discrete care management model was Assertive Community Treatment (ACT). While ACT is a very frequently used intervention in commun ity mental health, the researchers conducting this rapid review could only identify a small number of eligible studies, likely to be a result of using 'recovery' or 'person -centred' as a search limiter. ACT as it was developed does not have an explicit recovery orientation. However, all of the studies included here worked from a recovery oriented perspective. A sub -table summarising the ACT studies is provided in Table 2 below. ACT is at its core a community based case management rehabilitation model which targets individuals with more severe mental ill -health. It was developed by Leonard Stein, Mary Ann Test and others in the 1970s to support de institutionalisation in the US .16, 17 From there it was widely introduc ed in the UK, Australia and other countries as deinstitutionalisation progressed. ACT has been evaluated extensively and found to have largely positive outcomes for consumers including in housing, recovery, rate of hospital isation and employment .18, 19 Previous meta -analyses of ACT interventions have found that it has significant impact on RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 17 hospitalisations, particularly among those who are high users of hospital services and is cost -effective when comp ared to regula r hospitalisation .20 It has therefore been a treatment model supported by government, including endorsement as an effective evidence -based practice by the US Government Department of Health and Human Services. In A ustralia ACT has been an intervention of choice by many local health districts and the second national survey of Psychotic Illness in Australia from 2010 showed that around 9% of people with psychosis received home visits from ACT services over the prior 1 2 mon ths.21 ACT is a clinica l model of case management where case managers are a team of clinicians who directly manage the consumer's needs as much as possible without calling on external services. Client visits take place in the consumer's home or another community setting rather t han in the clinic. ACT staff are clinicians and teams will generally have a range of competencies including nursing, social work and those of mental health professionals. The overall aim is to meet a client's psychosocial needs before they reach a crisis situation thereby allowing them to live in the community. ACT targets consumers who have high -service needs and has been successful in allowing these consumers to live a relatively stable life in the community and is viewed as cost -effective because it redu ces hospitalisation, including within Austral ian-based RCTs .17, 22 Rosen et al22 describe the main facets of ACT as it operates in Australia. These are described in Box 2 below. Box 2: Main components of ACT Main components of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) in Australia (a dapted from Rosen et al22): Clinical case management Cost effective (compared to frequent hospitalisation of this group) Multi -disciplinary teams Mobile care in the community 24-hour crisis back up Open -ended (offered for no fixed time period) Available all week (day and night) Personalised to meet consumers' needs Low case -loads for staff (1:10). One critique of ACT h as been that it is not genuinely person -centred or recovery oriented. While it may work with a consumer's needs it is not designed to do this in a recovery -oriented way which looks holistically at the consumer's needs in relation to their overall recovery journey (which may differ from their clinica l journey and clinical needs).23 24 Other critiques have stated that ACT is actively coercive, which goes against the need for recovery to be focused on the individu al's own definition of recovery .25 Table 2: ACT -related interventions Authors Population Elements Outcomes Morrissey et al20 450 US ACT users (substance use disorder, schizophrenia or severe affective disorder) with history of hospitalisation.

The studies that this review recovered were largely those attempting to address the cri tiques about the lack of recovery orientation within the ACT model by adding in components which made them more recovery oriented. Three studies led by Michelle Salyers23, 26, 27 implemented a modified form of ACT: ACT-IMR, which added the Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) program (explained in further detail below) to standard ACT. In one pilot study of ACT -IMR, the IMR component of ACT -IMR was implemented by peer -support workers.26 The implementation of the program in this context showed improved understanding of recovery by both consumers and staff. The program also showed improved recovery scores on self -rated quantitative recovery measures. The results are encouragin g, however, as this was only a pilot study its results cannot be generalised. Malm et al28 reported a RCT of another variation of ACT which includes a form of Integrated Care (IC), ACT - IC. In this approach ACT is informed by a 'clinical microsystem' resource group who meet quarterly over a two-year period to provide guidance on the consumer's treatment. The group includes the patient, health professionals and carers, and their role is \"problem solving, communicatio n and planning\". The program is also supported by psycho -education for all group members through a structured workbook. This five -year trial showed positive benefits to consumers, finding that ACT -IC improved social functioning, lower symptomology and lowe r rates of hospitalisation .28 A study by Morrissey et al20 also found lower rates of hospitalisation for 450 clients with substance abuse, schizophrenia and affective diso rders who were high users of services (mean 113 days' hospitalisation over 24 months) and were enrolled in their recovery -oriented ACT model. This model combines a standard form of ACT related intervention, but provides 'intensive' education in recovery an d person -centred care for practitioners implementing it. The education focused on \"strengths -based assessment, individualized and person -centered planning processes, promotion of a culture of recovery within ACT...use of peers as recovery mentors [and develo ping] consumer choice and independence while avoiding coercivenes s\".20 Reduction in hospitalisation equated to approximately 32 days per person per year. Largely because of the reduced hospitalisation, the program had a cost benefit of a reduction in expenditure of approx. US$11,257 per participant per year .20 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 21 ACT was used for early intervention in psychosis in a UK study which compared the use of ACT with standard care .19 They found that use of ACT was associated with larger social networks and better clinical outcomes in the long term (18 -month follow -up), but not immediately. ACT will generally include an element of vocational sup port and employment has been highlighted through the explicit addition of Individualised Placem ent and Support (IPS) add -ons (t he IPS method is di scussed below) .35 ACT IPS has led to improved rates of employment in those with seve re mental ill -health .29 Proactive staff training in vocational support and the importance of employment for mental health outcomes led to significant outcomes in a US -based trial .18 This program was developed because staff attitudes and expectations were limiting ACT teams from offering vocational support, an issue that has been highlighted els ewhere .36 Gao and Dolce18 report an increase in employment from 5% to 24% over a 12 - month period in those receiving this employment -oriented ACT. Employment outcomes for ACT are significant because of the low rate of employment in this gr oup and the significant benefits of employment on mental health and social functioning. ACT has been less successful in creating employment outcomes when not teamed with IPS or vocational training is not specifically highlighted.36, 37 Flexible or Function ACT Flexible or Function ACT, or FACT, is a derivation of the ACT program f rom the Netherlands .35 It is a flexible approach to ACT where individuals who are significantly unstable are offered standard ACT comprising \"shared case management and assertive outreach\" where other long -term consumers who are more stable are moved to \"individualised case management by a multi -disciplin ary team\" .34 In the latter group services are offered by the same ACT team who meet them on a less intensive basis (2 -4 times per month). The team \"consists of 7 -8 FTE case managers (psychiatric nurs es, psychiatric community nurses, social workers, substance abuse counsellors), .8 psychiatrist, .6 psychologist and .5 Supported Employment Worker\" along with a peer support worker34 and have a case load of 1:20. This is significantly higher than the 1:10 cited by Rosen et al22 as standard in Australia and the 1:15 in the UK .35 The program as implemented in Hong Kong had even higher case -loads at 1:5035, which was due to resourcing issues in this context. A staff -oriented evaluation of the Hong Kong FACT Personalised Care Program revealed a recovery oriented care planning program in which individualised plans are created and key partnerships with services made to meet client needs. The Hong Kong program provides different levels of care according to need (low, medium, high) but all work inc ludes the individual's own recovery goals in their plans .35 All plans list consumer goals, strategies for meeting these goals and identified service partners, and are considered separately by a multidisciplinary te am. Case managers are clinicians or others with qualifications in mental health (e.g. social workers) who have expertise in \"medication management, motivational interviewing, cognitive behaviour therapy for psychotic symptoms, and family interve ntion\" .35 Substance misuse is specifically tackled as part of the program. IPS (discussed above) is used to support employment. The Hong Kong -based program has not yet been evaluated from the client's perspective but staff ha ve found it to be effective in meeting its goals. FACT as implemented in the Netherlands has shown significantly higher rates of symptom recovery than treatment prior to the implementation of FACT (from 19% to 31%) .34 Consumer involvement in care None of the ACT programs had been co -designed with consumers but several involved consumers as peer - support wor kers.26, 30 , 31 A Dutch study of the use of peer -support workers (called \"consumer -providers\") in teams implementing ACT found that those consumers whose ACT teams included these workers had improved measures of recovery and their needs were better met .31 However, days spent in hospital appeared to increase when consumer -providers were used. It was unclear as to why this was the case. 22 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Inclusion criteria and discharge criteria For all the studies the researchers included for analysis severe and persist ent mental illness was the only general inclusion criteria for ACT programs. Beyond describing the general characteristics of the participants and their level of ill -health and complexity none of the studies discussed referral into the program. None of t he studies that the researchers included discussed discharge criteria for exiting case management programs. This is significant as programs such as ACT have been previously critiqued for encouraging ongoing dependency on the program. However other studies have provided criteria for those who can safely exit the program. For example, Cuddeback et al38 provided the following criteria for ACT consumers transitioning out of the program: \"those who have exhibited indepen dent living skills, self -advocacy skills, and who can ask questions about their care needs\". Applicability While none of the studies included in this review took place in an Australian context, implementation of ACT in an Australian setting has also been e valuat ed positively .22 For example, a study of the implementation of ACT in the Nepean Blue Mountains Local Health District (LHD) showed that their ACT intervention led to a significant reduction of inpatient 'bed days' f rom 3022 to 569 over 12 months from the time of implementation and inpatient admissions were halved .32 The ACT program implemented in the Nepean Blue Mountains LHD included the following key facets: Specific clinical lead for the team \"Team management of consumers (distinct from normal case management as consumers have a primary clinician and significant team input utilising skills of multiple staff and promotin g continuity of care when staff are on leave )\" Daily meetings with all team members \"Interactive case reviews with reflection on collaborative care planning\" Active networking by staff to make connections with community -based resources to support specific client needs Active liaison with other sections of community mental health to meet client needs. In addition to the decrease in hospitalisations the program showed high staff and stakeholder satisfaction including from police who stated that they had les s interactions with frequent contacts.32 Partners in Recovery Articles on Partners in Recovery (PIR) did not appear in the review, however PIR is included here because it is a significant Australian care coordination approach. PIR is a program which has been implemented across Australia to provide care coordination for individuals with severe and complex mental ill -health. The program is implemented in 42 local areas by consortia made up of local NGO services and Primary Healt h Networks .39 PIR's approach is for support facilitators meet with a client to understand their needs and then connect the system for the clie nt to meet thes e needs .40 They can also spend flexible funding to buy in needs that are not otherwise available via the public system. The program has also been implemented in rural and remote regions but there are no publish ed evaluations of the program. Case management add -ons A wide variety of studies reported case management add -ons, which were designed to be implemented alongside or within standard case management. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 23 The populations targeted in the case management 'add -on' models were generally those with psychosis or mental illness classed as 'severe' or 'serious'. Two studies also specifically focused on consumers experiencing mental ill -health along with comorbid physical conditions, including heart disease and Cardio - Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).5, 41 Illness Management and Recovery Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) is a widely -promoted form of recovery oriented psycho -social education model used internationally in m ultiple cultural contexts (e.g. US Departme nt of Health and Human Services42). In the studies that researchers identified f or this review it was trialled in community based settings with people experiencing severe or complex mental ill -health in the US27, 43, 44, Japan45 and Israel.46 The aim of IMR is to provide consumers with self -help skills that they can use to manage their ill -health and move towards recovery. It is offered through a set curriculum which includes the following: \"recovery, mental illness, stress -vulnerability, social support, medicat ion management, relapse prevention, coping with stress, coping with problems and symptoms, getting needs met in the mental health system, and drug and alcohol use.\"27 The program can be offered to individuals or in group settings .42, 43 It can be offered as an add-on to both mental health programs and more general community based rehabilitation programs, thereby making it useful for implementation in settings where services are offered more generically. The program has been positively evaluated in multiple settings. It has been successful in demonstrating improved consumer knowledge of mental ill -health and goal attai nment .46 The Salyers et al26 study found good outcomes for consumers who were more confident in managing their illness after completion of the program. In the Japanese trial it was found to improve social functioning and social relationships, quality of life and s elf-efficacy .45 However, the case -managers who implemented the program found that it was difficult to implement as part of their day -to-day work and was deprioritised in favour of a client's more urgent needs. The study by Whitley et al44 found that successful implementation was predicated by well - prepared and trained field staff with strong leaders, staff commitment and a progressive organisational culture. A retrospective cohort study foun d that those consumers that had been involved in ACT -IMR (an add-on to Assertive Community Treatment) had less hospitalisations and visits to emergency departments than those receivi ng just ACT .23 Mueser et al 's review17 of psychosis interventions found that IMR was successful in improving self -efficacy, management and social functioning. While these evaluations were largely positive, a recent RCT of the use of IMR alone fo r American war veterans (outside of the ACT setting) conducted by Sa lyers et al43 found no benefit over the control group who were offered another form of facilitated group -based problem solving. They found low eng agement with both groups when offered in this setting and, while both groups improved, IMR offered no additional benefit. Other programs have used IMR as a base on which to then add further case management add - ons.47, 48 These are discussed in further detail below. Consumer driven or derived case-management add-ons This review identified three case management add -ons which had been developed by consumers or collaboratively between consumers and staff. Several of the se add -ons offered structured peer -support alongside regular case management. The other add -ons were specific tools which could be used as part of case management to increase the recovery -orientation of the services provided. Peer-support programs Self-Help Agencies (SHA) allow consumers to drop -in and receive services when needed and participate in the running of the organisation, which is entirely peer -run as a \"participa tory democracy\" of peer workers .49 24 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE They of fer \"social support, material assistance and vocational opportunities\" within the organisation and clients are free to choose the extent to which they engage with t hese services .49 SHAs were provided as an add -on to community mental health services (CMHS) in a RCT of SHA+CMHS vs CMHS alone .49 Participants had diagnoses of major depression (75%), schizophrenia (9%) and substance dependency (60%). The intervention was found to effectively support key areas of a consumer's recovery compared to CMHS alone. The study authors noted that previous studies of SHAs have shown less positive feedback, but that this program differed in that the SHAs were totally self -run by consumers .49 The Friends Connection offers peer -support for consumers involved in an ICM program (d iscussed above) .50 Consumers are paired with peers who are further along in their reco very journey and involvement in community -focused social activities such as self -help groups and recreation activities. Peer support workers share their own experiences and discuss helpful strategies for goal fulfilment. A mixed methods evaluation of the p rogram implemented with people who had been hospitalised for mental ill -health in the previous 24 months (67% with schizophrenia related disorders, 23% with affective disorders) showed reduced rehospitalisation rates compared to those ICM clients not enrol led in the program .50 A multi -site study investigated consumer empowerment through involvement in consumer operated service programs offering \"drop -in, peer support and mentoring, and education a nd advocacy\" .51 Consumers in the study had significant mental ill -health, including 50% with schizop hrenia and psychosis. The study showed that while there was a negligible in crease in empowerment over all sites, empowerment was significantly increased in some programs but n ot in others .51 The organisational setting therefore make s a significant difference in consumer outcomes, even within consumer -run services. Wellness Recovery Action Planning Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) was originally developed by Mary Ellen Copeland, a mental health consumer, and has been implement ed in multiple service contexts in the US , the UK, Australia and Asia.6, 52 WRAP involves education about mental health and recovery and the development of a structured wellness plan with the support of a peer work er. They are created in group settings or in individual meetings. Two separate RCTs of WRAP with large numbers of participants were included in the review's research literature. In Cook et al52 eight 2.5 hour sessi ons of WRAP were delivered in a group setting over eight weeks with two peer support workers facilitating. Consumers had diagnoses of schizophrenic related disorders (22%), bipolar disorder (38%) and depressive disorder (25%). In Cook et al53 nine of the same sessions were delivered to consumers (schizophrenia -related disorders 26%, bipolar (31%), depressive disorders 27%). Both studies showed lower levels of service utilisation and need compared to control, while improving an individual's recovery and lessening symptoms .52, 53 Wellness Enhancement and Recovery Program Developed collaboratively in a local setting by consumers and staff, the Wellness Enhancement and Recovery Program (WERP) program for people with serious mental ill -health builds on the IMR content in a context -speci fic way .48 The focus is on functional recovery, social responsibility and hope .48 The program is delivered by clinician case -managers and a peer worker, and delivered in a group setting. At the time of the group session clients are also seen by a psychiatrist and mental health nurse. Multiple groups are held throughou t the week and the program runs for three years. Transport is provided for consumers who need assistance to attend. An evaluation of WERP conducted with people with severe mental ill -health (62% with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, 13% bipolar, 21% major depression) found high program satisfaction, however its reliability was reduced because of a lack of control with which to compare outcomes .48 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 25 Recovery Workbook Barbie et al30 conducted a small RCT on a group -based recovery training add -on to ACT in which consumers with serious mental ill -health (82% schizophrenia and related disorders, 18% bipolar) worked through a Recovery Workbook over 12 weekly group discussi on sessions. The program provided information on community services, recovery, stress management and goal setting. Peer support workers were involved in the implementation of the program. While overall quality of life was not improved in the intervention g roup the program did find improvements in \"personal confidence and hope, empowerment, goal and succe ss orientation, and recovery.\"30 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy -based add -ons Several papers described intervention s in which CBT was added on to v arious forms of case management.54-57 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is an evidence -based practice that can easily be attached to practice as usual, with only small amounts of additional resources, and can be readily adapted to different cultural contexts and min ority groups .57 A review of community -based interventions for schizophrenia Mueser et al17 found that CBT is successful when provided for psychosis. Two papers by Turkington et al55, 56 described a CBT add -on to case management for psychosis involving training a mental health nurse or case manager to provide basic CBT to consumers experiencing psychosis. The nurse -administered intervention was run for six sessions over 2 -3 months and found significant improvement in some of the areas tested. The review found that most improvement was detected in ins ight and reduction in negative symptoms .55 The case -manager led intervention involved 12 sessions with 38 clients and showed a \"medium to large\" improvement in symptoms of psychosis and depression in 23 of the 38 c onsumers. For only one consumer was the intervention unhelpful.56 Perry et al58 reported on an Australian -based CBT program for early psychosis in which participants were offered 20 individual sessions of CBT. The program focused on stress and mood management, anxiety, dealing with psychotic symptoms, sleep, improving con fidence and social behaviours .58 It was found to have positive impacts on psychosis symptoms and improve recovery. One study investigated a 21 -week CBT program designed to offer support for post -traumatic stress dis order (PTSD) .57 Consumers were taught cognitive restructuring, educated about the nature of PTSD and its impact, and provided tools for addressing the ongoing impact of the trauma. Those who completed the program showed improvements in PTSD an d depression .57 Stirman et al54 describe a Philadelphia, US -based CBT add -on in which mental health care providers who are not specialists in CBT are trained through a series of context -specific training sessions to be able to provide basic CBT fo r a variety of common issues. The trainers then provide ongoing support to the clinicians providing the service and ongoing development and clinicians must complete 80% of ongoing training to stay accredited .54 The program has not been evaluated for impact on clients. Culturally specific add -ons Ethnic minorities and immigrant communities often have poorer mental health than the rest of the community but are less engaged with services and have less understanding of recovery and person -centred care approaches to mental health.47 A US -based RCT added two types of culturally -specific person -centred care for Latinos and African - Americans to community treatment -as-usual and IMR (discussed above) for people with a diagnosis o f psychosis .47 One group of participants received peer -supported person -centred care where the culturally - specific peer worker cooperated with the consumer and clinici an in planning meetings to develop a network 26 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE of support, and develop an individual's strengths and understanding of recovery. The second group received all elements offered to the first group and control, and received community inclusion activities conduct ed weekly in a group setting over six months. Groups were facilitated by culturally -specific peer workers and progressively worked towards greater autonomy for p articipants .47 Chao et al59 found that matching consumers and care providers on an ethnic basis provided better recovery outcomes for consumers. Early p sychosis add -ons An early psychosis add -on to case -management, the Graduated Recovery Intervention Program (GRIP), was described in one study and shown to have positive outcomes in terms of consumer goal attainment and decreased hospitalisation com pared to treatment -as-usual .60 The program was provided by two social workers an d a psychologist, and consumers were supported by a friend or carer with whom the clinicians were also in contact. A program made up of up to 36 sessions conducted weekly with the first 12 sessions focusing on wellness, goal setting and functional recovery , substance use and dealing with symptoms. Progress is reviewed at 12 weeks and consumer and clinician work out a plan for the remaining sessions and what trea tments are needed .60 REFOCUS REFOCUS was an intervent ion conducted in two English National Health Service (NHS) sites that sought to orient case management staff towards recovery to improve recovery in peop le who use the services .61-64 The program starts from the pre mise that relationships underpin recovery experiences for most consumers and that the relationship between consumers and workers is an important one. Therefore, it is important that mental health worker practice is recovery -oriented. The program sets out a structured process for developing a recovery orientation amongst staff64 (the manual for the intervention is available online via this link: http://www.mhpf.org.uk/resources/research/refocus -promoting -recov ery-in-community interve ntion are64: 1. \"Understanding values and treatment preferences 2. Assessing strengths 3. Supporting goal striving\". The process for implementation involves team -based and individual recovery training and coaching, including team leade r peer support .64 The REFOCUS intervention was evaluated through a RCT and process evaluation. The program was impleme nted in a range of settings: \"recovery teams providing long -term support to patients with complex health and social needs\", forensic teams, teams specialising in support for psychosis, and one team for consumers with low needs .61 The process evaluation, conducted through qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups with staff, showed that organisational commitment was important and noted that the implementation of the program was stymied by organisational res tructuring in one of the organisations .63 The program's use of role -playing, rather than just statements of intent , was viewed as effective in transmitting the concept of recovery. Interviews and focus groups with consumers showed that for many the program created a more \"open and collaborative\" environment within the service that allowed them to relate more freely w ith staff.62 Quantitative analysis of the RCT data showed that there was no significant im provement in recovery amongst consumers receiving support from services where REFOCUS was implemented and the only significantly positive change over control was i n functioning .61 There was also only limited improv ement in the recovery orientation of staff, although change was more marked where more members of the RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 27 organisation participated in the intervention .61 Reasons for the lack of change in key indicators was attributed to ineffective organisational implementation of the innovation, as noted in Wallace et al .62 Community -based non -case management interventions Key findings Consumer -led or co -led programs are effective in meeting consumer needs and with outcomes comparable to practitioner -led programs The Clubhouse model is an effective community mental health program which promotes recovery and can adapt to local settings Community -based, recovery -oriented mental health crisis su pport is an effective alternative to emergency departments Successful recovery -oriented programs were all individualised and localised, meaning that they were tailored both to the individual who was benefiting the services, and the communities in which th ey were being implemented Internet -based, clinician and peer -led transition support programs are effective in reducing rehospital isation and supporting recovery, including for those with eating disorders Individualised Placement and Support is an effectiv e vocational support program which also improves a participant's mental health and is cost-effective Social enterprises are effective in providing vocational support , increasing participation in employment and improving recovery and wellbeing Dialectical Behavioural Therapy is effective at treating people at high risk of self -harm or suicide There are mixed findings about the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment therapy compared to CBT. Given that CBT -trained therapists are widely available addition al investment in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is therefore likely unnecessary Recovery Colleges are important forums for educating and enabling consumers to understand and enact the concepts of recovery Community -based eating disorder programs have been shown to be effective alternatives to in -patient care for those who are significantly unwell. They may act as a step -down program or help to avoid in - patient care. The challenge is to implement these programs within a recovery -oriented setting as the compulsory practices in some programs may conflict with recovery values. The programs mentioned here largely fit into level one of Thornicroft and Tansella's3 schema of mental health care in high -resource settings, although some, particularly the eating -disorder related programs, are in levels 2 or 3. Cons umer -led programs As evidence d in the discussion of consumer -led programs as case -management add -ons, peer -led services are becoming more common in community mental health care and treatment programs. Davidson et al65 reviewed four RCTs which showed that peer -led services for those with serious mental ill - health were just as effective as those delivered by non -peers. Confirming this, Sells et al66 conducted an RCT which sho wed that when peer support workers are used early in treatment programs this increased later treatment adherence amongst those with severe and complex mental ill -health. Peer providers worked alongside regular case managers to provide case management in a community mental health team but with half the case -load of other providers. Peer providers were given training and supervision designed to provide them with skills in engagement, ethics, resources available, con fidentiality and record keeping.66 28 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Training also focused on their own peer -related skills to focus on \"individual areas of strength and ... past experiences with recovery as a tool for understanding, role modeling, and hope building for oth ers\".66 The study was conducted over a 6 or 12 -month period and showed that consumers with peer -providers were more connected to treatment in initial stages and felt \"more liked, understood, and accepted by their provi ders\" .66 Doughty and Tse67 conducted a review of Consumer Led Health Services (CLHS) to determine their effectiveness over standard services. They found that these services were similarly effective and had the bonus of providing vocational experience for consumers and providing good mental health and social functioning outcomes for consumers involved in providing the service .67 Examples of consumer -led and co - produced services are also cited elsewhere in this review and include self -help agencies, the Clubhouse model, Friends Connection, Recovery Colleges, the Living Room and Prosper. Clubhouse model A prominent consumer -led community mental health model is the Clubhouse model. Clubhouses are \"intentional recovery communities\" and focus on psychosocial rehabilitation in a peer support envir onment .68 The mechanism for change is social functioning through engag ement in socialisation and individualised skill development in line with the consum er's choice .69 Consumers (with any type or severity of diagnosis) and staff members (referred to as 'partners') are considered to be equals and they carry out the tasks of runnin g the clubhouse working collaboratively in both management and on day -to-day tasks. Clubhouses must be certified to a set of standards and have been used extensively around the world, currently operating in 29 countrie s.70 The Clubhouse model is also seen as a prevocational program as it offers work experience through running th e Clubhouse .71 The Clubhouse model is popular with consumers and has good outcomes from small lo calised studies .68, 70 However, it has been found to be less successful as an employment intervention than other programs such as IPS di scussed above .71 The program is difficult to evaluate as a concrete model because its functioning is dependent on how it has been devised in local contexts and therefore depends on local organisational and community commitment .71 Recovery College s Only originating in the UK in 200972, Recovery Colleges have been developed in many community mental health care settings across Australia, e.g. South Eastern Sydney Recovery College (http://www.seslhd.health.nsw.gov.a u/Recovery_College/), Central Coast Recovery College (http://www.ycentral.com.au/mental -health/central -coast -recovery -college/) and MIND recovery college (http://recoverycollege.org.au/). Recovery colleges put together classes in relevant topics which will assist a consumer's recovery. Oh72 lists the following typical topics for classes: \"maintaining residency, dealing with debt, living with bipolar, understanding psychosis and schizophrenia\". Recovery colleges are st ructured organisations with a core focus on co -production where consumers take on all facets of running the college and designing courses, with the support of some paid staff and, in some cases, clinicians .73-75 Recovery colleges include the following key elements and principles75: 1. \"Co-production between people with personal and p rofessional experience of mental health problems 2. There is a physical base (building) with classrooms and a library where people can do their own research 3. It operates on College principles (it is not a day centre) 4. It is for everyone 5. There is a Personal Tuto r (or equivalent) who offers information, advice and guidance 6. The College is not a substitute for traditional assessment and treatment RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 29 7. It is not a substitute for mainstream colleges 8. It must reflect recovery principles in all aspects of its culture and oper ation\" . Of the five papers on recovery colleges included in this review which evaluated their operation most were limited in scope and/or methodology. McGregor et al76 evaluated the Nottingham (UK) Recovery College but the analysis was unclear and it is difficult to know how data was selected for inclusion in the paper. The paper presents a de scriptive account of their recovery college which offers 94 different courses to over 800 students who have any type of mental i ll-health .76 They are supported by 1.2 paid members of staff and a building housing, a library, four class rooms and kitchen facilities. The college offers courses are around the themes \"understanding mental health is sues and treatment\", developing practical skills, self -development programs called \"building your life\" (e.g. WRAP, discussed above), \"physical health and wellbeing\", and \"getting involved\", which teaches advocacy and consumer involvement skills .76 Their evaluation found that the program was developing with high fidelity to the recovery colleg e model as defined by Perkins et al .75 Newman -Taylor et al77 carried out a qualitative evaluation of a recovery college in southern England run by the local NHS Trust. This college ran 28 classes whose conte nt was collaboratively developed by consumers and clin icians. Classes lasted between two hours and a day and examples of course content given were: \"Values -based goal setting,\" \"Managing crisis\" and \"From application to interview \u2014 gaining the job that you w ant\".77 Semi -structured interviews with 11 participants showed that the recovery college a llowed students to move out of the patient -practitioner mode of learning and take on their own learning, drawing on peer -relationships to discover new possibilities for moving forward in managing their lives and ill - health.77 A focus group evaluation of the Recovery Academy in Manchester mirrored t hese findings .78 Participants see recovery colleges as valuable. The Meddings et al73 evaluation was conducted very early in the operation of their recovery college, but showed that of the 134 s tudents enrolled in the first six courses 71% were people who currently use mental health services and 13% were carers. The attendance rate of courses was 67%. Of those, 97% reported that they would recommend the recovery college to others with 82% stating that they had learned useful information and 68% stating that the course was helpful for their daily lives .73 A further eval uation by Meddings et al74 showed that the program went on to enrol 300 students aged from their 20s to their 80s, with the most popular courses being \"Using the Arts to Aid Recovery; Coping with Depression/Anxiety; Happiness; Mindful ness; Coping Strategies and Problem Solving; Improving your Sleep and Understanding a Diagnosis of Psychosis/Mood Disorder s\".74 The further evaluation confirmed the findings of the first in terms of helpfulness and student satisfaction. While most recovery colleges, including most of the Australian examples provided above, are located within health organisations they can also be in education facilities .79 McGaig et al79 describe a recovery college which was developed at the University of the West of Scotland. The authors describe the importance of early stakeholder engagement and learning from the needs of the community. Those involved in the recovery college are not classified as either teachers or students but as active and equal parts of the college: \"peopl e attending are not \"taught\", or treated as passive recipients of service interventions, but rather \"learn\" together, through a process of co -production.\" There is one employed administrator to bring the program together and a part -time project worker supp orts the peer workers who deliver and devel op programs .79 Examples of courses provided are: Write to Recovery; Crea ting Positive Relationships; Finding Reliable Health Information on the Internet; Managing Your Mood; Mental Ill -Health and the Family - How to Survive It. Because it is not directly tied to a health service their recovery college is open to everyone wheth er they have been receiving serv ices or not .79 30 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Prosper Barrett et al80 describe a-consumer led 'social movement' or network called 'Prosper' based in a part of London which has a diverse population with diverse needs. The network is funded by the local health district and is self -led, creating its own projects and self -running them by drawing on the skills of its collective membership. The core themes to the work of prosper are \"create\" and \"collaborate\" and the key organising tool is a monthly 'Open Forum'. At this forum consumers (who self -identify, with any diagnosis or severity of mental ill -health) meet, speak about the skills they have, connect with others and identify their skills, and develop projects to take forward over the ne xt month.80 Prosper works in with already established consumer organ isations in the area and develops courses in collaboration with local recovery colleges. Carer and family -focused programs Family -based interventions assist families or carers with supporting individuals who have serious diagnoses to manage their illnesse s and crisi s situations .22 Family sensitive practice is an approach that focuses on the role of an individual with mental ill -health in their family, particularly as a parent. Other programs do not specifically focus on t he family member or carer but actively include them as partners in the consumer's recovery journey. Family sensitive practice Cowling and Garrett81 describe family sensitive practice in a large community mental health service in NSW. The program creates an environment where the child's needs are highlighted as part of a \"narrative\" of the family in relation to the person experiencing mental ill -health to build family resilience .81 The reasoning is that this will help both the recovery of the person experiencing mental ill -health and create a more stable family environment for the other members of the family. Treatment sessions are first conducted with the family group, then with individual family members and then again with the family group. The conditions for dialogue are that the members of the family are able to communicate ope nly with empathy and positivity .81 Within family group meetings the most difficult aspect of the meetings is in mediating existing power dynamics which may mean that some members dominate or are silenced. One US -based study implemented an Intensive Family Support Service to carers and family members to assist them to support an individual experiencing mental ill -health.82 Supports were flexible and developed in line with the carer's needs, but generally offered education about mental ill -health, instr uctions about personal coping strategies and communication such as that offered in family behavioural ther apy.82 Professional guidance and peer support from other carers was offered alongside referral to carer advo cacy organisations. The program was offered to any individual supporting a family member with a mental illness (rather than being attached to a particular service) and was offered in group or individual settings. Family support workers are employed to supp ort the intervent ion.82 The program received very high (95% agreement) satisfaction scores when evaluated. An Australian study examined practitioner -identified barriers to uptake of family sensitiv e practice .83 Practitioners felt unable to act on the complexity of needs of families against a background of a fragmented and complex service system. Given the heavy workloads facing practitioners, these factors meant that family -sensitive practice was deprioritised in favour of other work. Rather than continuously working with family practitioners felt that there were key times when families should be brought into treatment, including during initial meetings and crisis times where they could provide context to help with the individual's treat ment .83 Mueser et al17's review of interventions for psychosis found that family based psychoeducation was successful in improving psychosocial functioning and reducing hospitalisation amon gst consumers. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 31 Open Dialogue Approach The Open Dialogue Approach has a strong focus on the family as a core part of therapeutic treatment. The approach originated in Finland around 30 years ago as a treatment for psychosis and is now the main approach to psychosis treatment in Finland .84 It has not been wi dely used elsewhere but its influence outside Scandinavia, including Australia, is growing and it is currently being tested in a multi -centre RCT within the NHS in England .84-86 Open Dialogue takes a dialogical ap proach to mental ill -health where the consumer along with their family and friends are fully included in treatment. It starts from the idea that psychosis might be a medical problem but that difficulties related to functioning are lar gely social problems .84 Dialogue -focused therapeutic meetings are developed as soon as an individual comes into treatment to work out an approach to treatment which makes sense for the individual and meets their needs in the context of their lives .87 Seven principles underpin the Open Dia logue Approach: \"(1) immediate support, (2) the social networks' perspective, (3) flexibility and mobility, (4) responsibility, (5) psychological continuity, (6) tolerance of uncertainty, and ( 7) dialogism\" . 87 Dialogue teams with a variety of expertise in clinical and social fields are selected in lin e with consumer need .88 Seikkula who developed the Open Dialogue approach, describes the work of clinicians thus: \"The aim for the p rofessionals is to carry out their work in network meetings on an equal basis and in the presence of and together with the help -seeker and private network and to adjust their professional roles and tasks according to the particular help -seeker's need.\"89 Holmesland et al89 conducted focus groups with Open Dialogue practitioners and observed Open Dialogue meetings. Challenges to Open Dialogue were found to come from existing power differentials amongst clinicians, and between clinicians and consumers, lack of skills, including active listening and use of silence, and a lack of understanding about just what Open Dia logue is .89 Lakeman90 notes that a barrier to the implementation of Open Dialogue in non -Scandinavian settings may be the lack of effectively trained practitioners as the program necessitates that staff have three years of training as either Open Dialogue practitioners or family therapists. Very few e valuation studies of the Open Dialogue Approach appeared in our search results. Ulland et al87 reflect on the adaptation of the Open Dialogue Approach to the local conditions of Norway and while they found that the programs involving this approach were implemented successfully there were no studies that compared the program to care as usual. Seikkula et al88 looked at the benefits of a fully developed Open Dialogue program compared to a shorter version of the program, which demonstrated a very significant reduction in hospitalisation for those involved in the full Open Dialogue program. Of consumers in the Open Dialogue group 82% no longer had symptoms of psychosis five years after their involvement in t he program .88 A review of Open Dialogue Approach studies conducted by Lakeman90 found that the approach resulted in a significant decrease in the duration of untreated psychosis in participants. However, all existing evaluation studies are limited by methodology and lack of matched control. The current NHS RCT may provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of Open Dialogue and applicabili ty within a non -Scandinavian service system. Transition support programs Discharge from inpatient care is a time of vulnerability for consumers. Our review however identified very few recovery -oriented transition support programs. 32 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE The American Association for Community Psychiatry has developed principles for successful transition. Velligan et al91 investigated a model developed and implemented in Texas to put these principles in place. The model has the following components: In reach by community care into the hospital while the consumer is still an inpatient; group intake where the consumer or several consumers are supported by clinicians and a social worker who encourage shared decision making and peer -support, and; family psychoeducation to support th e consum er.91 The program has not yet been evaluated. A German program used an internet -based program to continue 'maintenance' treatment for consumers (54% mood disorder, 46% anxiety related disorder) after discharge from an acute inpa tient setting .92 The treatment involved consumers identifying through an initial plan helpful behaviours and strategies for implementing these into their lives. They then fill in a web diary each week where they evaluate their progress and think about their next week. They participate in an only peer -support group which includes small groups of up to six participants. The final element is communication with a therapist who supports them in t heir progress .92 In a RCT of the program participants were shown to have greater recovery and symptom management than controls. Transition support programs for eating disorders, discussed below, had mixed success .93, 94 Employm ent-related programs Employment programs are included here because of the considerable need identified amongst those receiving community mental health services for employment39 and the mental health significa nt benefits known to flow fro m employment .17 Individualised Placement and Support Individualised Placement and Support (IPS) is a program which offers supported employment for people with serious mental ill -healt h. It is underpinned by the following six principles: \"everyone has the right and responsibility to work; everyone has the right to support when motivated to work; work enhances self - esteem and societal inclusion; work is purposeful activity that is centra l to our lives; work is part of recovery and; all have the right to make their own choice s and are valuable to society.\"95 Implementation involves working with the client to understand their job preferences, \"rapid job placement\", collaboration with psycho -social rehabilitation supports and ongoing support as needed (not a ti me-limited intervention ).95, 96 Evaluations of IPS have shown the program to be cost -effective and s uccessful in increasing long -term employment for people with mental ill -health and to be a superior intervention in co mparison to other programs .96, 97 The IPS program also assisted with the client's social functio ning and recovery and was a vehicle for staff to better unders tand recovery .95 Mueser et al17 report that 15 RCTs have supported the use of IPS for improving employment for people with schizophrenia. Social enterprises Social firms or social enterprises are organisations which are set up to provide employment opportunities for people with mental ill -health or another disability. They are a method which may have utility for o ffering supported employment for people in rural and regional areas. Fieldhouse et al98 describe a not -for-profit horticultural company created to offer supported employment in a rural setting in the UK. The program was supported by the local National Health Service (NHS). The company trained consumers (no details of mental ill-health levels or diagnoses were provided in the paper) in horticulture while they were working as a paid employee for the company. Consumers could move on from the coun try and gain paid employment with 10 out of the 16 trainees in paid employment as a result of the program. The program was supported by a one - year grant but continued after the gran t ceased .98 Social firms are suitable to an Australian rural or regional RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 33 setting with several operating currently in the disability sector, for example, Huntley Berry Farm in Orange (http://www.huntleyberryfarm.com.au/). The Creative Recov ery project in place in remote I ndigenous communities (discussed below) is a good example of a remote, I ndigenous -focused mental health recovery social enterprise .99 In Australia 60% of disability enterprises operate in rural and regional areas .100 A qualitative study with consumers involved in social enterprises f ound that they support consumer recovery and promote empowerment \"belonging, success, competence and indi viduality\" .101 Community based recovery oriented crisis support Crisis Resolution/Home Care (CR/HC) teams deliver crisis support services in a community s etting, which is usually a client's home. They have been used in Australian settings since the 1980s and offer 24 -hour support in the community to avoid consumers moving into i npatient care .22 The program has also been instituted in multiple settings inte rnationally .102 Winness et al102 conducted a review of existing studies and attempted to understand the experience of CR/HC from a consum er's perspective. The crisis services reviewed helped consumers to stay at home in a crisis situation rather than going into an inpatient setting. Successful programs worked with the consumer's own understanding of their immediate needs and where possible involved family members. Programs were more successful from a consumer's perspective when they were available around the clock and where support was available immediately .102 Well-planned discharge including crisis planning was important to consumers. Overall, the review found found that consumers prefer CR/HC to inpatient care. In home crisis care was seen to be preferable because it did not overly medicalise their issues and allowed them to address their problems in the situation where they occurred, rather than the artificial environment of t he hospital .102 The Living Room is a crisis support service developed from a recovery basis and responding to calls from within the c onsumer movement to develop psychiatric crisis care that is not centred on the emergency department .103 It is a voluntary non -residential program, and employs two clinicians and three peer support workers who work with consumers who are in a crisis situation. It is housed in the community mental health service, but has a separate entry and is open in the evenings five days a week. It is open to people with a wide range of diagnoses. A small qualitative study which i nterviewed 18 Living Room 'guests' and staff showed very positive outcomes for guests who compared the program very favourably to previous encounters with emergency departments during crisis situations .103 Creati vity-based programs The review identified seven programs which used art or, in one case, music therapy to promote recovery mainly for people with serious mental ill -health, although one study did not specify part icipant needs .104-106 Programs were generally localised and short -term (up to 13 months in length) and focused on creating an environment where individuals learned skills to be able to express themselves and discuss ideas of recovery and wellbeing .105 Two small -scale Australian art -therapy programs had positive impacts on the recovery journeys of participants .107, 108 An Australian -based review of music therapy programs showed therapeutic effectiveness in people with menta l ill-health .109 In Au stralia the Creative Recovery program has worked successfully to promote mental wellbeing in remote Indigenous communities (discu ssed above) .99 Primary care interventions In this rapid review researchers did not find any General Practice -based (GP) models of ment al health services which were recovery oriented. However, they are an important aspect of community -based mental 34 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE health treatment as indicated in the Thornicroft and Tansella3 framework. The review by Pilbeam et al110 highlights a primary care -based rural mental health model that is most practical for very rural or remote communities and shows that building competency amongst generic health care workers in mental health interventions has positive impacts on care. However, its limitations relate to GP interest in mental health and limited time available for a dditional services in p rimary care .110 Community -based eating disorder programs Most of the eating -disorder programs described in the literature are based in inpatient settings. A small number of community -based programs were identified and are discussed h ere. One paper described an Australia -based intensive program in the community for individuals with Anorexia Nervosa which was developed in response to a lack of outpatient services in Victoria .111 The program, Body Image, Eating Disorders Treatment and Recovery Service (BETRS), has four components: 1. Group pro gram targeting a) family members and carers and b) consumers \u2014 motivational interviewing, education, severe anorexia nervosa 2. Individualised structured therapy and CBT -E (Enhanced CBT) 3. Family therapy providing skills to family members 4. Day program: o Consume r Day Program over six hours a day for three days per week o Family and carer day program to provide skills in meal support o Outreach into home to provide meal support. Involvement in these components is planned and individualised (Newton et al 2013).111 The program showed improvements in mental health and eating disorder symptoms and qua lity of life . The Scottish Anorexia Nervosa Intensive Treatment Team (ANITT) program sits within a suite of interventions designed to meet the needs of people who require different levels of treatment in line with their needs. The overall program includes four levels ranging from (1) inpatient care for the most seriously unwell through to (2) the ANITT program of intensive outpatient care, (3) outpatient \"group and individual therapy, dietetic and psychiatric treatment\" and (4) \"gu ided self -help\" through iCBT (internet based CBT discussed below), and 'bibliotheraphy' (use of sel f-help books) .94 ANITT parti cipants are of very low BMI (less than 13 for women or 14 for men). The first 2 -12 weeks of the program is designed around developing trust between the clinicians and consumer and increasing BMI to create a stable, safe weight upon which the next stage of therapy can start.94 The ANITT program is then offered over an 18 -month period with reviews conducted every six months. This i nvolves therapy twice a week alongside meal support from other staff 2 -10 times a week, dependent on individual need. Consumers are gradually moved to less intensive support. Consumers can refuse dietician involvement, thereby upholding their individual tr eatment choices but must accept \"medical risk monito ring\" .94 The 35 patients in the program are supported by one psychiatrist, seven psychologists of varying experience, two dieticians and an administrator .94 Meetings with consumers take place either in their home or an outpatient clinic attached to a hospital. The program was found to be very cost effective compared to the previous program which focused more on inpatient care. Consumer satisfaction surveys have found high levels of satisfaction (4 on a 5 -point scale). Fairburn et al93 describe a program for individuals with eating disorders who were not significantly underweight (all had a BMI over 17.5 \u2014 so excluded those with Anorexia Nervosa). GPs and other cli nicians gave 154 particip ants referred into the program one of two forms of CBT: CBT -Ef or CBT -Eb (both of which are forms of CBT for adults with an eating disorder). CBT -Ef focuses solely on addressing eating disorders, whereas CBT -Eb addresses both eatin g disorders and \"mood intolerance, clinical perfectionism, low self - RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 35 esteem, or interpersonal difficulties, as indicated i n the individual patient\" .93 The treatments were run across 20 sessions of 50 minutes' durati on over 28 weeks. The program was staffed by four psychologists and a mental health nurse who had received six months training in the treatments .93 Clinical outcomes for both intervention groups were improved over waitlist control with over 50% of participants having a level of eating disorder not more than \"one standard deviation above the community mean\". 93 The Community Outreach Partnership Program targets individuals wi th eating disorders for whom other treatments do not work because of low engagement by consumers with the treatme nt program .112 The program does not focus on a reduction of symptoms (recovery understood as cure) bu t on \"increasing quality of life, reducing distress and increasing hope for the future\" (recovery as a meaningful life) .112 The program is run by 'outreach counsellors' who have training in social work, psychology or nursing. They meet with consumers weekly in the community (in line with the consumer's needs) and broker other services as needed (dietician, psychiatrist, therapist etc.). Staff ratio is 20:1. The intervention is individualised, supporting the consumer with their own needs, for example \"nutritional goals on a practical level by providing assistance with grocery shopping, meal support, menu planning, meal preparation, problem solving and supportive counsell ing\".112 Consumers were in the program for an average of 25 months (range 5 -53). An evaluation of the program showed improvements in scores of hopelessness and distress, and improvements in eating disorder symptom s and BMI .112 Two other programs had low acceptability to the individuals targeted by the interventions. Lowe et al113 attempted to implement a CBT -oriented transition support Intensive Outpatient Program termed \"Normali sation of eating\" for women leaving eating disorder inpatient care. The program was structured around group sessions twice a week which offered psychotherapy or psychoeducation alongside a supervised meal. Each consumer also had individualised support from a case manager and dietician and their involvement was overseen by a psychiatrist .113 The case manager worked with family members when needed. All staff had masters' level degrees, however they did not necessarily have a background in CBT or related therapies. The program was found to be limited by a lack of structured processes for involving key program administrators who could advocate for the program, and competing demands which meant that a lack of time was set aside for CBT. The program was also limited by patient \"ambivalence\" and concerns that the program was not relevant to their needs .113 This is a significant limitation from a recovery and person - centred care persp ective. A text -messaging based intervention attempted to address the high levels of ongoing morbidity amongst eating disorder patients with a BMI of over 17.5 (thereby excluding Anorexia Nervosa) transitioning out of outpatient treatmen t programs .114 The intervention involved participants sending weekly text messages describing their progress and being provided with a pre -programmed response in return, which was checked by a staff member for \"plausibility and to pr event repetitio n\".114 An example of the message sent is: \"Try distracting yourself from troublesome thoughts about your weight/appearance by meeting with people you like and going out togethe r\".114 The program was found to be acceptable to participants with an average rating of \"good\" overall on a four -scale measure (excellent, good, poor, very poor), however most participants stated that they would not participate in the pr ogram again or refer a friend to it .114 Half the participants reported that they did not like the automated program and preferred contact with a person. Participants were meant to send texts weekly, but did so an a verage of only 13 times (range 3 -23).114 Based on this low acceptability this program should not be implemented. Third Wave therapies Third wave therapies include mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and dialectical behavioural therapy. They follow the 'first wave' of behavioural therapies developed in the 1950s and the second wave, 36 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE CBT developed in the 1970s .115 A me ta-analysis of third wave therapies conducted by Ost 115 identified 'moderate' effect sizes for both ACT and DBT, with a large effect for ACT compared to waitlist. The y could not calculate an effect for Mindfulness. Mindfulness Mindfulness -based interventions have a focus on 'mindful' practice where an individual engages in meditation which aims to bring their mind to the presen t moment .116 Mindfulness has been described as \"a form of mental training in non -judgemental observation of current conditions such as autonomic arousal, muscle tension, habitual thought patterns and cogniti ve activity\" .117 Several different forms of Mindfulness - Based ther apies have been developed. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy have been used in a variety of mental health interventions and have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, and to assist in treating depression, though st udy results have been mixed .117, 118 It has been used in Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with a current RCT testin g its utility for women with PTSD from intimate part ner violence .119 A small study of an approach to mindfulness meditation called iRest showed benefits in emotional regulation and mental health for combat vete rans with PTSD .120 Paulik et al117 report on a very small study based in Eastern Sydney which provided a MBSR prog ram to a group of 12 people with a variety of diagnoses using community mental health services. The program ran over 12 weeks of 2 -hour themed group classes facilitated by an Occupational Therapist and Psychologist. All classes included a period of mindful ness followed by group discussion of topics related to mindfulness and stress reduction .117 Most participants showed significant improvement in their mental health and coping as a result of their involvement in the program, and this continued after the program finished when participants were followed up at 12 months. One study compared automated telephone prompts for mindfulness, mastery and health behaviours within a Spanish and English speaking community -based sa mple of middle -aged people with depression (who were not receiving treatment from mental health services). An initial in -home visit was conducted where individuals were introduced to basic mindfulness concepts including breath meditation and v isualisation .121 They then received a daily phone call which guided them through a simple meditation on a particular topic or mindfulness skill.121 This group was compared to groups who received Mastery Control (self -efficacy) prompts or general Health Tips. Participants reported on their physical and mental health using an online form each night. The program found the most significant positive effects across the program from the group receiving the mindfulness tips but that mindfulness and mastery control prompts had similar impacts on m ental heal th.121 The program could be run with a landline and computer or smartphone which can access the internet. Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) is the third wave therapy which has been the subject of most research. It mainly targets people with borderline personality disorder and those who exhibit suicidal behaviours. It has been recommended for use in conjunction with Assertive Community Treatment .122 It involves the following five components123: 1. \"Increasing behavioral capabilities 2. Improving motivation for skillful behavior (through contingency management and reduction of Interfering emotions and cognitions) 3. Assuring generalization of gains to the natu ral environment 4. Structuring the treatment environment so that it reinforces functional rather than dysfunctional behaviors, and 5. Enhancing therapist capabilities and motivation to treat patients effectively\". RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 37 Treatment focuses on developing skills in mindf ulness, behavioural ch ange and problem -solving .124 It is carried out by DBT -trained therapists and involves weekly individual therapy and group skills development (2\u00bd hours per week), telephone support with the the rapist and therapist team.123 Treatment usually lasts one year, although shorter programs have been trialled, tw o of which are discussed below .115 DBT training is provided to staff from a range of therape utic environments through a 45 -hour training course and supervision .123 Four papers investigated DBT for consumers at risk of self -harm or suicide .123-126 The papers by Nea csiu et al126, Linehan et al123 and Harned et al125, which all drew on the same study, compared DBT to 'expert psychotherapy' in the treatment of women at high risk of self -harm and suicide. The women in the study had made at least two suicide attempts in the previous five years , including one att empt in the eight weeks prior to the study, and women with a diagnosis of psychosis, schizophrenia or bipola r disorder were excluded .123, 125 DBT was offered by DBT -trained therapists over a 12 -month period at the intervals and intensity described by Linehan et al123 above. DBT was found to be twice as successful in preventing suicidal behaviour than standard ps ychotherapy .123 DBT wa s also superior in treating women who also had comorbid drug dependency .125 Neacsiu et al126 found that DBT \"decreased experiential avoidance and expressed anger\" which are significant problems in Borderline Personality Disorder. Hawton et al124 conducted a systematic review of interventions for self-harm and found that DBT impacted to reduce self -harm, though they noted that the quality of the interventions was low. They found mixed findings of a secondary effect for DBT in depression (some studies found no effect, others signific ant effect) .124 DBT has also been used for mixed populations receiving intensive outreach support. Ritschel et al127 evaluated the use of DBT with 56 people whose main diagnoses were depression (50%), bipolar disorder (20%) and anxiety disorders (23%). Of those, 65% had comorbid conditions, including 20% with a substance or alcohol use disorder. The prog ram of DBT was compressed into six months rather than the standard 12 months and group therap y was provided daily over five weeks instead of weekly over the length of the program. They received standard weekly individual therapy and 24 -hour pho ne support .127 Depression and anxiety improved over the program but skills in mindfulness did not increase as expected. DBT has been offered in an intensive form, iDBT, in a course lasting four weeks .128 The program was run with a mixed population of 447 outpatients who showed decreasing levels of hopelessness and depression .128 The effect increased over time and a quarter of the participants completed a second course, indicating that DBT is more effective when available over a longer period. DBT has been evaluated from the consumer perspective through qualitat ive interviews, and was shown to increase consumer understanding of coping and skills in mindfulness.129 This finding on mindfulnes s conflicts with the findi ngs in the Ritschel et al127 study cited above. Training in DBT was found to improve understanding and respect towards consumers with borderline personality disorders by practi tioners .130 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Acceptance and Commitment Therapy has been developed for use with both physical and mental health problems. It aims to teach consumers how to accept (rather than resist) their feelings, choose a path forward and act to ta ke that path .131 Johns et al132 state that in doing so Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is compatible with recovery. One study trialled Acceptance and Commitment Therapy wi th consumers with psychosis .132 The program was run by a therapist and assistant and involved four weekly two -hour group sessions (The program is av ailable here: https://contextualscience.org/quotact_for_lifequot_group_intervention_for_psycho). A specific Acceptance 38 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE and Commitment Therapy manual for psychosis was developed by the research team. Each session involved activities centred around mindfulne ss, coping strategies, defusion (letting go of troubling thoughts) and \"values c larification\" .132 Small positive changes in functioning and mood were noted, however only 42% of participants attended all fou r sessio ns.132 A meta -analysis comparing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to CBT found small positive effect sizes for the former in comparison to CBT, but on the whole no difference bet ween the two .131 This contradi cts earlier studies which have shown Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to be sup erior to CBT .131 eHealth and Telehealth interventions Key findings eHealth interventions are low-cost and appropriate for rural and regional areas with good internet access Several free or low -cost evaluated eHealth programs are already available for mental health treatment in Australia There is good evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions which can be adapted for a wide range of diagnoses and situations Blended eHealth interventions are more effective than standalone web -based interventions CBT conducted online is as effective as that conducted in person Smartphone apps which prompt specific health behaviours are effective in engaging consumers in healt h and wellbeing activities There is some evidence from an Australian intervention that a disproportionate number of participants in eHealth interventions are located outside of urban areas. This may mean that regional populations are already seeking and ch oosing to use these technologies at a higher rate than those in urban areas. Introduction eHealth interventions to improve psycho -social functioning in the community have significant relevance to communities where access to the internet is reliable. mHealt h interventions involving mobile phone technology are also discussed in the literature, however these are less useful for those in rural and regional areas where mobile phone r eception is very limited .133, 134 The populations targeted in the self -help eHealth and mHealth interventions were those with both higher prevalence of disorders such as anxiety or depression, and lower prevalence disorders such as bipolar disorder, psychosis and eating disorders. The Naslund et al134 review focused eHealth and mHealth for severe mental ill -health and identified four types of programs developed specifically for this group. They classified interventions into: 1. \"Illness self -management an d relapse prevention\" \u2014 included programs which provided automated messaging prompts to consumers about self -management 2. \"Promoting adherence to medications and/or treatment\" \u2014 technologies were used to deliver prompts about treatment and appointments via S MS messaging 3. \"Psychoeducation, supporting recovery, and promoting health and wellness\" \u2014 web-based tools used for education and iCBT (see below) or peer -support 4. Symptom monitoring \u2014 apps were used which asked clients to report symptoms at various times throughout the day. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 39 They found that the programs they reviewed were generally successful at engaging this population in behaviours that either improved their mental health or facilitated more effective u se of services .134 One recent study of a mobile phone intervention to support recovery -oriented shared decision making in mental health found that while these technologies were promising, technological difficulties made implementation difficult for consu mers .135 The digital literacy of consumers must therefore be understood before a decision is made to rely on any specific technology. An Australian -based review of existing depression eHealth and their applica bility to the Australian context was con ducted by Batterham et al .136 They categorised eHealth interventions into those that were self -led, those that were provided by a health service, those which were provided by a private provider and guided interventions in which a clinician is involved in the administration of the program to the consumer. Existing interventions reviewed were found to be effective and cost -effective and appropriate to an Australia n context .136 The review by Parikh and Huniewicz137 of eHealth for mood disorders also supported the efficacy of the technologies for a wide audience. They cited the cost -effectiveness and accessibility of the interventions, which are open 24 hours a day and not restricted by lo cation. Despite these positive evaluations of mental eHealth applications some caution should be used and their implementation must be done with an eye to the 'digital divide'. This divide can mean that some parts of the community are more able to access t hese programs and the technologies that they use. Overall, Indigenous Australians have less access to these types of services. This may be caused by many factors including the larger proportion of I ndigenous Australians living in remote regions, and higher rates of unemployment and low income, which make enabling technologies more difficult to purchase .138 Specific programs Most of the programs identified in our review were based on intern et-based CBT methods (iCBT) .139-142 One program showed increased skills confiden ce after participation in an online virtual reality program which trained individuals in job int erview skills .143 The eH ealth programs identified here are only those that have been written up and were identified in the literature review. However, there are many more that are in existence, including the following Australian -based programs: PTSD Coach \u2014 A smart phone app designed for veterans with PTSD to help them manage their symptoms. http://at -ease.dva.gov.au/veterans/resources/mobile -apps/ptsd -coach/ MyCompass \u2014 Provides information on good mental health and management of symptoms. Can be accessed via computer and mobile device s. https://www.mycompass.org.au/ eCentreClinic \u2014 Offer free access to courses being trialled. Developing an Arabic Wellbeing course. https://www.ecentreclinic.or g/ Mental Health Online \u2014 Offers online therapy and information. https://www.mentalhealthonline.org.au/ eCouch \u2014 Interactive self -directed programs for depression, anxiety, relationship problems and grief. https://www.mentalhealthonline.org.au/ Mindspot (https://mindspot.org.au/ ) is an Australian internet -based CBT (iCBT) intervention. Individuals self-refer to the Mindspot website where they fill out either an online assessment questionnaire or telephone assessment and are then referred to a re levant course .140 They may be 40 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE referred to alternative treatment if they are not deemed eligible for the course, such as where they are suicidal or are involved in psychotherapy already. Four courses were offered: 1) 'Wellbeing' for adults aged 18 -60 with anxiety or depression, 2) 'Wellbeing plus' for those with the sa me needs aged over 60, 3) an OCD course, and 4) a PTSD course. The courses contained 4 -6 lessons of text, images and cases, and were completed over an eight -week period. Participants completed the lessons online via a computer and were then provided with ' homework' to do between lessons. Of those who went on to complete the program, 51% were not from a major city, making it likely that this format appeals to those in regional or rural areas. For all but those enrolled in the OCD course there was very signif icant improvement in symptomology where up to 50% of those enrolled no lon ger met the criteria for depress ion or anxiety .140 Get Real (https://www.ontrack.org.au/web/ontrack/programs/get -real) is another Australian -based eHealth program and targets early psychosis or \"psychotic -like experiences\" (PLEs) amongst yo ung people .144 Program content is base d on the self -help book Think You're Crazy? Think Again by Morrison et al145 and has four modules which are completed online over two sessions. The program assesses participants and educates them about normal feelings, risk factors for psychosis, CBT techniques for addressing unhelpful thought pat terns and where to seek help .144 The program trial found that for 83% of participants (n=12) the program was helpful and half found that they were more able to cope with PLEs. The program can work on computers or m obile devices which have ac cess to the internet, flash player software and a pdf document reader. HORYZONS is an Australian online early intervention prog ram for first episode psychosis .146, 147 The program adopt s a strengths based approach compatible with recovery. It involves interactive modules of psychosocial education over four weeks and online peer support through 'the caf\u00e9' where participants can communicate with each other about their experiences, with new areas opening as the participant completes a module. The program is moderated by clinical psychologists and 'vocational workers' who contribute as needed to for ums.146 A trial of the program showed that 60% comple ted the four-week program. The program had a significant impact on depression symptoms amongst participants. One study evaluated clinical and security risks to participants involved in the program and found none .147 Blended iCBT programs MoodGYM is an Australian iCBT intervention offered without cost online over five sessions of interactive exercises. The program focuses on identifying thoughts, emotions and positive relationships and introducing relaxation te chniqu es.148 A small Norwegian study evaluated a blended treatment program involving MoodGYM and in -person consultations with a therapist for people with mild -moderate depression. Participants completed the five MoodGYM sessions and met with a clinician in between online sessions. Clinical sessions focused on the previous MoodGYM session, symptoms, content of the next session and motivation to complete the next session. The blended treatment had a high completion rate of 11/14 participants and qualitative data showed that the program was most useful when consumers identified with the program and had a good connection with their t herapist .148 ThisWayUp (https://thiswayup.org.au/ ) is available through either self -referral or clinician referral so consumers may work through the program themselves or supported by a clini cian.149 It offers courses in Sadness, Worry, Worry and Sadness (mixed depression and anxiety), Worry and Sadness (mindfulness based course), Shyness, Panic, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Stress, Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder and Health Anxiety. When referred as a clinical intervention ThisWayUp allows the clinician to login and check on RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 41 consumer progress. The courses have shown improvement in 80% of course completers and 20% of non - completers, bu t aro und 50% do not complete .149 It is available via mobile devices such as tablets and smart phones, and computers. Living with Bip olar is a UK -based program developed as a self -management resource for people with bipolar disorder. Consumers were consulted extensively in the program's development. The program was recovery focused and over ten sessions sought to educate about bipolar, increase self -esteem and self - mastery in relation to symptoms, introduce skills for crisis management and develop goals which would help them on their re covery journey .150 A RCT showed improvement in the interventi on group in all outcome areas. MyRecoveryPlan is another US -based resource developed for bipolar disorder. While the program had low levels of involvement overall (only 9%) Simon et al151 found that the program was more successful when online peer coaching was used to support involvement (continuation increased to 38%). An individualised Australian -based program, ORBIT, provides similar online modules for bipolar disorder over four modules and is provided over a thr ee-week period .152 The program has shown improvement in quality of life over the control group, however depression and anxiety scores were not improved. Barnes et al153 described an Australian online psycho -social education program developed for bipolar and delivered over 23 sessions, first weekly then monthly over a 12 -month period. Consumers also received feedback from therapists on sessional reports on their mood. This pr ogram was not evaluated in its final form, but initial evaluations at six months showed e ffectiveness .153 Two quantitative Dutch studies investigated a generic iCBT intervention for anxiety, depression and work - related stress .139, 154 Participants were individuals on a wait -list for in -person treatment, for which there is a long delay in treatment in the Netherlands. Participants accessed a web site which led them through f our weekly sessions involving identifying meaning, defining problems, and creating plans to address these problems. They were emailed exercises and wrote down their responses to the exercises. Psychology Masters students were employed to comment on their a nswers and assist them with identifying strategies, but did not offer therapeutic support .139 The program requires internet access via a computer. The program showed significant benefit for those experiencing depre ssion and anxiety, but less for work stress .154 This program has subsequently been adapted for other groups, including Dutch Turkish immigrants experiencing depression .141 While the Turkish immigrant program showed good outcomes for the participants who completed it, there was a high dropout rate of 42%. Overcoming Bulimia Online is a web -based CBT program for eati ng disorders .155 The program was provided over eight sessions which focused on education about bulimia, strategies for change, problem solving and future planning. This program implemented with the aid of a support worker who was not a clinician but communicated with consumers in line with their needs with some opting for phone contact and others for email -based support. T hey completed exercises in between sessions and provided data on their symptoms at the start of each session, which was mapped in a graph so that they could map their progress. A small qualitative study evaluated the program from a consumer perspective and found that participants were positive about the intervention, which they liked because of its anonymity and convenience .155 Two other studies of a separate online program for eating disorders showed positive impacts for this group, however the intervention was not described in enough detail in the study for full insight into what was involved .156, 157 Online mental health therapy Two quantitative studies158, 159 reflected on online mental health therapy in which a therapist communi cates with the consumer via a web -based interface where they write messages to each other. 42 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE Ruwaard et al158 reported on a large study of a Dutch online mental health clinic comprising of online \"therapist -assisted CBT\". Participants had depression, panic disorder, PTSD or burnout. The program begins with an assessment interview conducted via telephone and therapy is then conducted via a web -based interface. The therapist leads the discussion based on a manual which sets out treatment for one of several types of disorder and provides exercises for the consumer to do. Standard motivational feedback is provided, although it is tailored to the consumer .158 Programs last between f ive and 16 weeks depending on topic. Of those enrolled in the program, 71% completed it. Among those that completed the program 72% saw significant improvement .158 Kessler et al159 reported a randomised controlled trial of a similar intervention which provided 10 sessions of 55 minutes of CBT online via a web -page. This program, however, did not rely on a manual and provided CBT in the same manner as it would take place in a face-to- face session. This program also showed positive outcomes for clients .159 A Cochrane review of therapist -supported anxiety -specific iCBT160 found no diff erences in outcomes between therapist supported iCBT and face -to-face CBT sessions. This supports previous research which has shown the guided self -help CBT is as effective as that conducted face -to-face.161 A Swedish randomised comparison of eight weeks of iCBT vs eight weeks of personalised email -based CBT provided by a therapist both programs found that both programs were successful .162 With little gain from personalised interventions, iCBT would seem to be more cost -effective than CBT provided by a therapist online, however research comparing the two modalities is limited .160 Co-designed e -health interventions One study163 focused on the 'Common Ground' web application and service design. This was developed by consumer researcher and advocate Patricia Deegan163 to facilitate better conversations about medication between consumers and psychiatrists to ensure that consumer needs were met and recovery promoted in these encounters. The Common Ground web application is delivered in a s etting called a 'Decision Support Centre' where peer workers are core to the organisation of the visit by welcoming the consumer and assisting them with the use of a computer which they can use to access the Common Ground App. The consumers record their tr eatment and recovery goals on the application, which they can then discuss with a practitioner. This app can also be used by the client at home and accessed by seve ral practitioners .163 It is used in multiple treat ment settings in the US, including within ACT programs. It has shown improvements in recovery, health functioning, understanding of medication side effects and health impacts164, but has not shown improved adherenc e with psychotropic treat ment regimens .165 This tool has very strong recovery and person -centred care values underpinning its development and use. Mobile phone related technologies SMS text message based programs p rompting mental health behaviours for those transitioning from healthcare services have been found to have limited effect. A study by van den Berg166 introduced smart - phone communication for mental health in the fo rm of telephone calls and text messaging as ongoing treatments after discharge from a community based day care facility. Participants were provided with either telephone calls or telephone calls and text messages provided by nurses. The content of the tele phone calls was based on goals set by consumers when they left the facility with nurses questioning them about their progress. They were called an average of 12 times (total average duration: 57 minutes). The program was shown to decrease anxiety in partic ipants but not depression .166 The eating disorder treatment transition support program described by Robinson et al114, discussed above \u2014 which used automated SMSs to suppor t people with ongoing eating disorder recovery \u2014 was found to have only limited success with this population. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 43 Macias et al133 described a study where a smartphone application WellWave was used to improve mental health and wellbeing for people with serious mental health problems. The application promotes physical exercise and other behaviours by delivering \"a daily menu\" of activities to an individual's phone. The participants can use the application to report on the ir activities and these can be monitored by clinicians. The application is backed up by a library of resources (videos, documents etc.) which can be accessed by participants. The application has been very successful in engaging with participants with 94% o f people using the application daily and 73% responding to prompts and engaging in exercise .133 The Zautra et al121 study, discussed above in as a third wave therapy, also used telephone prompting of health -related behaviours, and this could be carried out with either a mobile phone or fixed line phone. Discussion of mobile phone or smartphone technolog ies also overlaps with the discussion of eHealth above as telehealth is merging with eHealth due to advances in mobile technologies. Programs relevant to the rural and regional Australian context Key findings Different levels of programs should be consi dered for rural and regional contexts depending on population size and level of resources available None of the recovery -oriented case management programs were appropriate for rural or regional settings outside of major regional towns Localised interventio ns which were made specific to the community in which they were set up were most useful in smaller rural and regional settings Indigenous -focused interventions should have a strong community connection and work in with existing community structures and tra ditions eHealth interventions (discussed in the section above) are useful for delivering mental health interventions in rural and regional Australia. Introduction People in rural and remote communities are more likely to experience mental ill -health, rece ive less help for it than other Australians and compl ete suicide more often .167 A recent Austr alian -based review of rural mental health service models by Pilbeam et al110 promote s locally derived, context specific programs based on core elements. For those communities with low populations and limited resources they prescribe a primary care based se rvice which provides basic services including assessment, basic CBT and counselling, medication and liaison with specialist services. For those communities with a higher level of resources they suggest mental health specific inpatient and outpatient servic es, community based care -coordination services, and specialist employment and housi ng services .110 For those areas with the highest level of resources, such as large regional towns, more highly sophisticated programs relying on a wide range of staff compet encies and service connections are appropriate. For many of the more complex case management programs introduced above this highest level is where the programs are most able to be delivered. eHealth and mHealth Telehealth programs (including skype or othe r forms of video -conferencing) allowing practitioners and specialists to communicate with and monitor the health of patients who are geographically isolated has become standard in rural and regional area. However, with the growth in availability of reliabl e internet brought about by the NBN eHealth technologies will become more useful in these settings. The programs discussed in the previous section will be most useful when they can be used with a range of simple 44 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE technologies (both computer and mobile devic e) to meet the needs of different consumer groups. Lack of mobile coverage in rural and regional areas render mHealth and smartphone related technologies less useful in these settings. Online forums where those experiencing mental ill -health can share thei r experiences also offer hope to rural, remote and regional consumers where internet access is available. A study of the rural, remote and regional users of the Australian -based SANE forums by Baylosis168 found that online interactions via support forums ful filled a need for this group not met in their communities. Individuals in rural, remote and regional communities felt isolated and unable to connect with those in their place -based communities about mental health. Involvement in the forums therefore allowe d them to communicate their experiences in ways that were not oth erwise available .168 Current rural and remote programs None of the case management or ACT -related studies were highly applicable to rural or remote populations as all had been conducted in urba n settings. As ACT relies on intensive support from a team of clinicians it is difficult to administer within a rural or regiona l setting .34 While none a ppeared in our review other studies that are not explicitly recovery -oriented have trialled ACT models in rural settings and these have had mixed results. A RCT of an ACT supported employment program, ACT -IPS, (Individualised, Placement and Support)29 found that this model of ACT \u2014 which had high -fidelity with both the ACT model and the IPS program \u2014 could be successfully implemented in a rural setting which had high levels of social disadvantage. The ACT -IPS progra m had a staff profile of a psychiatrist, two nurses, two case managers, a senior clinician, a social worker and two employme nt specialists .29 Staff patient ratio was 1:10. Those in the ACT -IPS program had better em ployment outcomes compared to those in a standard vocational program, with 64% holding competitive jobs compared to 24% in the control group .29 Another study comparing the implementation of ACT in an urban and a rural setting found significant difficulties in implementation in the rural setting.33 These related to distances needed to travel to see clients, lower numbers of qualified staff and poorer quality program management. A review of ACT in rural settings revealed di fficulties in implementation resulting in \"smaller teams, less comprehensive staff, and less intensive servi ces\".169 The authors stated that Intensive Case Management (discussed above) was more appropriate in rural settings because it \"emphasizes individual caseloads, fewer staff, less intensive contacts, and brokered services\" .169 This is also a hallmark of the current PIR program implemented across Australia (also discussed above). A US -based study evaluated the Clubhouse model (d iscussed abo ve) for use in a rural setting .68 The Clubhouse model was found to work well in this context with positive outcomes for consumers. Many of the programs that were successfully implemented in rural and re gional areas were localised, adapted to community needs and short -term. 'The Station' is a consumer -driven rural service that has been operating in the Upper Yorke Peninsula and lower Mid -North in South Australia for o ver 10 years .170 It is a recovery focused service open to consumers and their families who come to the centre for peer support, formal and informal activities. It is run by two part-time coordinators and open three days a week .170 A realist evaluation found that the service was nurturing and empowering for consumers, and that its success was context driven and relying on strong support from the local mental health system. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 45 One small -scale study evaluated a comm unity centred church -based quilting project run in rura l New South Wales .171 The program aimed to decrease community stigma and improve recovery by providing an activity where mental health could be spoken about bu t was not a core focus. Led by a mental health nurse a team of 16 quilters within the community worked together over eight weeks to create a quilt which was given to a young person in the community who was experiencing mental ill -health. The program provid ed the opportunity for those making the quilt to speak about mental ill -health in a low -stigma environment while producing something of value. Those involved in the project reported greater levels of understanding and interest in helping people who experie nce mental ill -health, thereby decreasing stigma .171 Programs for Australian Indigenous communitie s A recent report for the Federal Government on improving Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders' access to mental health services could be improved with the following strategies: providing services locally, flexible appointment times, supported transport to appointments, home visitation, services that do not involve out - of-pocket costs, providing service choices, indi genous -delivered services and services provided in non - medic al service settings .172 Services should also focus on a holistic approach to health and wellbeing, and be delivered w ith an ethic of tr ust and reciprocity .172 Nagel and Thompson173 developed a culturally specific care planning approach for use with I ndigenous Australians in remote or rural settings to promote self -manag ement of mental ill -health. The study took place in remote communities in the Northern Territory and worked with Aboriginal Mental Health Workers to provide a brief intervention of two sessions 2 -6 weeks apart which focused on \"problem solving, motivationa l therapy and self -manage ment\" .173 The program also centred around goal setting and achievement. Compared to treatment as usual qualitative and quantitative measures showed that participants were highly engaged in the program and could set and achieve their goals. The Creative Reco very project is part of the Arts in Health model and has been developed to provide weekly workshops to I ndigenous participants in remote communities (Lockhart River, Aurukun, Morningt on Island) .99 The program takes a different, context -driven form in each locatio n, but generally focuses on creative skill building to allow participants \"to express themselves and share thoughts, feelings and experiences wit h others.\"99 Participants are supported by 'Artist Mentors' from their own community arts centres, and their work is e xhibited and sold, thereby functioning as a social enterprise for participants to make money from their art. The program is designed to work in with existing community organisations and practices and give something back to the community. 46 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 5 Conclusions This rapid review of care coordination models shows that most existing models can be adapted to be delivered in a recovery -oriented fashion and that this has good outcomes for consumers. Recovery -oriented care coordination models which bring together a mult idisciplinary team of specialists including peer - support workers are effective in delivering care. A range of add -on services for care -coordination allow basic models to be used to target specific needs. Effective 'add -ons' are Illness Management and Recov ery, Individualised Placement and Support, CBT interventions, Wellness Recovery Action Planning, Wellness Enhancement Recovery Program, peer support add-ins such as Self -Help Agencies and Friends Connection. These programs can be added to care -as-usual with little additional resource implications to increase the effectiveness of standard programs for target groups of consumers. Of the third wave therapies analysed in this review the framework with the clearest positive outcomes for consumers was Dialectica l Behavioural Therapy . The Open Dialogue approach, while showing some very significant benefits in small Finnish studies, needs more large scale evaluation before it is implemented in Australia. Recovery orientation of existing models is possible, although large projects (e.g. REFOCUS) which seek to provide recovery oriented service development , have shown little effective change in practice. This has been attributed to a lack of organisational commitment and stability. This factor was seen to be a contribu tor to intervention failure in multiple recovery -oriented projects. eHealth interventions are effective treatments for individuals with a wide range of diagnoses. The main uses are for 1) web -based platforms for treatment, 2) tools for prompting health -related behaviours and 3) online therapy. Web -based treatment platforms are used either stand -alone or as blended treatments with either a program -specific therapist or the consumer's own clinician involved. Several programs are already available for free or at low cost in Australia, including ThisWayUp, MoodGYM, GetReal and Mindspot. Online therapy programs are shown to be as effective as face -to-face counselling. Blended programs can also be used as transition support programs for individuals leaving inpatie nt care. eHealth programs are appropriate to rural and regional settings where internet access is available, and most can be delivered via both mobile technology and computers. Any implementation of eHealth initiatives should be done with a full understand ing of the digital divide, which means that some groups may have more difficulty accessing these technologies than others. This is particularly important to understand the lower use of internet -based technologies amongst those in remote regions and some gr oups of indigenous and CALD Australians. High quality evidence fo r interventions appropriate to I ndigenous communities are missing but those that do exist show that they are short -term, localised and delivered by indigenous people. Principles of service provision within indigenous communities are flexibility, reciprocity, cultural -specificity and involvement. There is a lack of evidence for models which specifically target people from CALD communities. However, the programs included here show that they are more successful at engaging with CALD communities when staffed with culturally specific staff and peer -support workers. RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTA L HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 47 Murrumbidgee LHD includes urban centres, regional and rural areas, and one remote area. For rural and regional areas, localised program s which are devised with local collaboration of consumers, staff and other community members should be developed to ensure that programs meet local needs. None of the papers included in this review offered sophisticated cost -benefit analyses, however seve ral papers reported that the programs they evaluated were cost -effective. Limitations These findings should be considered in the light of the search strategy used, which focused only on papers that referred to interventions with a specific recovery or per son-centred orientation. There may be interventions that are applicable which do not explicitly state that they are recovery -oriented but are nevertheless delivered within this framework. However, test searches that included literature without the recovery and person -centred search terms returned a high number of irrelevant papers. This limitation was in part addressed using an expert reference group that reviewed the included papers and suggested other areas for inclusion. This resulted in the secondary s earches taking place around areas of key interest for Murrumbidgee LHD or the Agency for Clinical Innovation. Subsequent searches did not include the recovery criteria so additional papers could be included. The limitation of papers from 2006 onwards also limits the discussion of Assertive Community Treatment, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy or studies of the Clubhouse model published prior to that year. It should also be remembered that publication bias means that negative or neutral results are sometimes not published, which means that available studies are more likely to present a positive base of evidence. A focus only on interventions and models that have been fully evaluated also meant that some relevant and existing models have not been included. Fo r example, no papers were found which discussed Partners in Recovery or the Personal Helpers and Mentors Service (PHAMS) interventions which are implemented throughout Australia. 48 RECOVERY -ORIENTED COMMUNITY M ENTAL HEALTH MODELS | SAX INSTITUTE 6 References 1.
