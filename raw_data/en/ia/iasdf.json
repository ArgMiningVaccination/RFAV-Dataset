It focuses on the whole person-- mind, body, and spirit--with a strong emphasis on the physician-patient partnership. Integrative holistic medicine is based on the following principles: Health is more than the absence of disease. A person is more than his/her symptoms, and healing requires a whole-person approach. Empowered patients make long-term and lasting changes that sup- port healing and optimal health. Research has demonstrated that nearly one in three Americans seek out complementary and alternative medicine to supplement conven-tional care. Patients are now asking their physicians about the medical value of these therapies. Since these approaches have not become routinely incorporated into most medical school curricula, health care providers are seeking trusted sources for learning about these techniques. The course was created with these needs in mind, and sets reasonable standards for the application of integrative holistic medicine. Educational Objectives After attending this activity, participants should be able to: Discuss the importance of treating the whole person, mind-body-spirit; Assess the value of a physician/patient partnership in improving health; Evaluate the role of evidence-based integrative holistic medicine in the treatment and prevention of common medical conditions and chronic illnesses; Incorporate integrative holistic medicine treatments into patient care, referring to specialists as necessary; Utilize tools and resources provided to incorporate integrative holistic medicine into their practices/organizations; and Establish a network of like-minded practitioners from various disciplines and geographic areas.
