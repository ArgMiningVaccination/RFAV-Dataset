Introduction The history of the homeopathic management of epidemic diseases dates back to the battle of Leipzig in 1813 whenSamuel Hahnemann treated an outbreak of typhus. He treated 180 patients (losing only two) and published his results the following year in Allegemeine Anzeiger der Deutschen . 1 Hahnemann 's guidance for treating an epidemic disease appears in the Organon (par. 100 -102).2He advised the following: (a) assume everyepidemic to be newand unknown;(b) examine it thoroughly in all its details; (c) the totality of the signs and symptoms is revealed only after several cases are observed, never from any one patient; (d) the ordinary symp-toms and the more unusual symptoms constitute the charac- teristic picture of the disease; (e) all patients who catch the epidemic are suffering from the same disease; (f) in subsequentcases the appropriateness of the remedy will be corroborated or a more appropriate one will be revealed. In 1900, Kent echoedHahnemann 's instructions in thethird chapter of his Lectures on Homeopathic Philosophy 3but noted that there might be a group of a six to seven possible epidemic remedies which must be studied carefully before a prescription can be made. Every winter presents an opportunity to apply the prin- ciples of homeopathy to the treatment of epidemics. Starting in late December 2019, a flu-like illness made its appearance in the New York City area. It was characterized by a low- grade fever, dull headache, body aches (muscles, not joints or bones), and mild pharyngitis with sub-mandibular adeno-pathy. Mental dullness and fatigue seemed to be the symp- toms that were outstanding for most patients. The other feature was duration \u2014the symptoms seemed to last for 2 or 3 weeks despite improvement with Gelsemium . The behavior of the illness itself resembled Gelsemium : slowness, apathy, listlessness, languor and torpor \u2014it just seemed to drag on and on. Relapses were common and changes in the potency of Gelsemium were required.Keywords Gelsemium polymerase chain reaction assay Genus Epidemicus coronavirusAbstract This article provides a view of homeopathic clinical practice in the New York City area in the rst few months of 2020 as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began to evolve in the United States. Key symptoms used to generate a short list of potentially curative remedies are given, and the pandemic syndrome is viewed as appearing in stages or as having various clinical manifestations each with its own main remedy. The severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is brie fly described, as are the preliminary presenting signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Several clinicalexamples are given, some with positive laboratory con rmation. received May 6, 2020accepted after revision May 20, 2020 published online July 14, 2020Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Faculty of HomeopathyDOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0040-1714052.ISSN 1475-4916.Commentary 163 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Published online: 2020-07-14As is frequently the case with in fluenza, some patients make a partial recovery and are troubled by a persistentsymptom or two. The most common post- Gelsemium symp- tom this year was a chronic cough. Next in frequency was a sore throat and profuse nasal discharge, sometimes thickand sometimes accompanied by paroxysmal sneezing. One patient presented with blepharitis as her chief complaint. Over the years in these viral post-treatment scenarios, I haveoften availed myself of an invaluable small rubric from Boericke 'sMateria Medica with Repertory. 4It can be found under Respiratory System: Cough: Cause: In Statistically, the most frequently used remedies from this rubric by far have been Kali-bi ,Sanguinaria and Senega. Evolution of a Genus Epidemicus By early February 2020, it became clear that this illness was not in fluenza but perhaps early cases of the novel corona- virus. After seeing several post- Gelsemium cases and nding that many of their symptoms were covered by Senega ,t h a t remedy was added to the list of those needed. By late February, a pattern emerged which indicated that this epi-demic might have at least three phases or facets to it: the rst phase is represented by Gelsemium. In the second phase, Senega was needed when some or all of the following symptoms made their appearance: cough, shortness of breath, persistent headache, chest pain, chest heaviness, sore throat, dif cult expectoration, rattling mu- cus, and persistent fever. Several days of b.i.d. dosing of Senega were required to make the turn back to health. The last symptom to resolve is the patient 's energy level which can take another week. Senega is especially needed for respiratory conditions in the elderly. I have not yet seenthe more unusual Senega symptoms such as the feeling that the chest is too narrow or coughing that ends in a sneeze. During this second phase a few other remedies have been needed to complete the treatment: Eupatorium perfoliatum (persistent headaches, worse from moving the eyes), Phos- phorus for a vague 'spacey 'dizziness, Sulfur (which follows Senega well) to get back to a sense of normal and clean up minor symptoms, and Kali-bi for residual headache at the center of the forehead or bridge of the nose, for throat andnasal dryness with anosmia and ageusia. Senega does have distortion of the sense of taste but it typically will not completely treat the anosmia. Kent 's chapter on Senega 5is most informative. Although only partially proved, Senega is clearly a lung remedy with an afnity for the mucus membranes of the air passages. Kent tells us that it is deeper than Bryonia , and that it is often overlooked in favor of Bryonia . The chest rattling resembles Antimonium tartaricum and the stringy, tenacious mucus resembles Kali-bi . remedies in differential in- clude Phosphorus ,Arsenicum album ,Lachesis ,Spongia ,a n d Rumex .Many of the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be found in the Senega chapter of Kent 'sLectures on Homeopathic Materia Medica5and in of Practical Mater- ia Medica .6These include headache (forehead and orbits), swelling of the eyelids, photophobia, frequent and violent sneezing, dryness of the nasal passages, dryness of the mouth with a metallic taste, dry, sore and burning throat,copious and tenacious mucus in the throat, rattling of mucus in the chest which is dif cult to expectorate, chest pains worse at rest, asthmatic troubles made worse byascending the stairs, incessant cough made worse by mo- tion, shortness of breath while climbing the stairs, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and great weakness with physical andemotional depression. The third phase of this disease may be represented by the remedy Antimonium ars .T h i si sm yl e a s td e ned remedy for this condition because it is based on only two clinical cases, which were managed remotely. One case was that of a 77-year-old female, with a past history of chronic conjunc-tivitis, chronic blepharitis, seasonal and environmental allergies, pruritus senilis, lumbago and chronic insomnia, who had done quite well under my homeopathic andosteopathic care. She initially responded well to Gelsemium but required a dose of Natrum sal. to restore her mood and energy level. However, 2 weeks later she again relapsed andshe felt that she had yet another bad cold with much sneezing, sinus congestion, egg-white nasal discharge and fatigue. Senega was prescribed which helped the symptoms for 2 to 3 days but a week later she called with the following symptoms: a dull, heavy frontal headache above the eyes, fever ranging from 99.2 to 100.5, itching in the throat andtrachea with a persistent cough. She felt like she was 'drowning in her secretions 'but she could not expectorate. She was extremely cold and could not get warm despite being under the covers with a hot-water bottle. The symp- toms were repertorized using RadarOpus software, with theanalysis set to 'small remedies '. Because of the intensity with which the patient described her chilliness, Antimonium ars. 200c was selected and mailed to the patient, to be takenmixed in water b.i.d. Two days after taking the remedy, the fever broke, the cough improved, and her energy level returned to normal. She had 2 days of frequent, soft,paste-like stool which was most likely viral shedding. It then seemed that when Senega fails to bring about a cure and the patient is still febrile with extreme chilliness, hassigns of bronchitis or an incipient pneumonia, Antimonium ars.can rally the patient. Antimonium ars. is a rare or small remedy with little more than a paragraph of description in standard homeopathic references. Volume I, No. 1 of the Homeopathic Recorder , published in January 1886 (pp. 10 to 12), contains a briefmention of Dr. Mattes who summarized four cases of Stibium (Antimonium )Arsenicosum which he quotes from Allg. Hom. Zeit, Nos. 2, 5, and 8 from 1885. Reading these cases, it is easy to see the amount of lung and other pathology that was cured in children and the elderly with this remedy.

Based on the description of the signs and symptoms, patients were cyanotic, febrile, diaphoretic,tachypneic, with consolidation involving most of the lung elds. These were cases of post-measles and post-in rapidly cured with low potency Anti- monium ars. Although highly speculative at this point, this small remedy may be useful for hospitalized patients or home-bound patients in danger of imminent hospitalization. COVID-19 Con rmation Up to this point, patients with a flu-like disorder were responding well to homeopathy; however, without labora- tory con rmation it was impossible to know if they were suffering from COVID-19 infection. Con rmation was re- ceived by mid-March when prescribing for a new patient with a complex medical history. The patient was a 35-year-old man with a 17-year history of allergies, asthma and eczema, previously treated unsuccessfully with a variety of homeopathic remedies prescribed by several homeopaths.His current medications were the anti-histamine levocetir- izine, the anti-depressant fluoxetine, and the biologic The patient was told to take Psorinum 30c mixed in water on March 17 and was instructed to call the of ce on March 24. He was told not to change any of his current orthodox medication. He was also treated with osteopathicmanipulation to the cranium and cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral areas. On March 24, 2020, the patient called the of ce and reported that after the Psorinum 30c his sleep was better and he felt that his skin seemed more 'stable '.H ea l s o reported that at the beginning of March 22 he began toexperience flu-like symptoms: low-grade fever, aching muscles and fatigue. He was instructed to take the highest potency of Gelsemium that he could obtain and to repeat it once a day. He managed to get Gelsemium 30c and took a dose the same day (March 24): he experienced a spike in histemperature and profuse sweats later that night. On March 29, he called again to report that despite several more doses of Gelsemium 30c the tiredness and aching muscles continued and on March 26 chest and nasal congest- ion had started. This was accompanied by a hacking cough which was worse at night. By March 28 he began to wheezeand still had the cough and fatigue. On March 29, his breathing became more dif cult with shortness of breath, dry hacking cough and wheezing, but he was afebrile. He alsobegan to lose the sense of taste and smell. He was advised to take a dose of Senega 200c and to repeat it once a day by mixing it in water and shaking or stirring the solution. Any possible confusion about the signi cance of the symptoms that appeared after Psorinum 30c was clari ed when he called again on April 7 and mentioned that he hadtested positive for the COVID-19 virus on March 30, one day after having taken Senega 200c. A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on a swab of hisnasopharyngeal secretions was performed by Bio Reference Labs. He also said that after the rst dose of Senega 200c on March 29, the wheezing and shortness of breath improvedwithin a few hours. From March 31 to April 6, his symptoms were mainly a mild dry cough, a feeling of chest heaviness/tightness, mild wheezing and fatigue. On April 7, he began to feel like 'his normal self 'again. Approximately 4 weeks later, IgG antibodies to the COVID-19 virus were detected. Subsequently, two more patients treated successfully with Senega have tested positive for IgG antibodies to COVID-19. In addition, a 2-year-old child, who was given adose of Senega 200c every 2 weeks as a preventative and who was asymptomatic, also tested positive for IgG antibodies. Eleven weeks after the 77-year-old patient recovered fromher illness using Arsenicum-ars. , she too tested positive for IgG antibodies to COVID-19. Discussion The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) has been identi ed as the cause of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. First cases were identi ed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This global syndrome has sincespread exponentially and the World Health Organization declared the disease a pandemic in March 2020. The coronaviruses ( Coronaviridae ) were rst discovered in the1960s. They are a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, some of which are pathogenic. The alpha-corona- virus and the beta-coronavirus strains are thought to ). 7The clinical sequelae are wide-ranging, from mild cold symptoms to respiratory failure and death. MERS-CoV (Middle East respi-ratory syndrome coronavirus), SARS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 are beta-coronavirus strains and are known to cause respi- ratory symptoms, respiratory distress and death. 7 Direct transmission of the virus is via respiratory droplets spread by coughing and sneezing and via contact with fomites in the immediate environment of infected persons.8 The SARS-CoV viruses enter the cells via an endocytosispathway using a spike protein to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. 9 Symptomatic patients who test positive (via RT-PCR assay) may display a wide range of signs (99%), either or ground glass opacities in the lung elds. 10The severity of symptoms seems to vary, affecting a disproportionally high number of older patientswith pre-existing medical conditions. There are no known de nitive conventional therapies for the disease and there are currently no vaccines available.Conventional management is supportive care alone but there are several studies underway that aim to identify safe and effective orthodox drug therapies. Without de nitive conven- tional medicines available, homeopathy provides an alter- native treatment for those COVID-19 positive patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are recovering at home,potentially sparing them the need for hospitalization. Such treatment is consistent with the historical use of homeopathic interventions during epidemics.

Conclusion There are various lists of COVID-19 homeopathic remedies making the rounds on the internet these days. Some lists have more than 20 remedies on them and it is unlikely thatthey can all be the Genus Epidemicus . Other contributors have declared that they have discovered one single simillimum for this pandemic. Still others have declared that a remedy cannotbe used prophylactically during a pandemic, seeming to ignore Hahnemann 's scarlet fever experience, Boericke 'sl i s to fp r o - phylactics in the Generalities section of his repertory, andClarke 's experience with prevention and nosode use during influenza epidemics, as noted in the In fluenza section of The Prescriber . 11 It is important to realize that there are no physicians alive today, homeopathic or otherwise, with any real-world exper- ience of treating a pandemic like this one. Therefore, thereare no COVID-19 pandemic experts, no 'modern masters 'as it were; we are all learning as we go. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 lasted about 2 years and attacked in three wavesbefore it departed. However, before it did, homeopaths were able to apply the principles of homeopathy and save many lives. We can learn from an article entitled, Homeopathy in Influenza\u2014A Chorus of Fifty in Harmony , by W.A. Dewey, MD, from the University of Michigan. It appeared in The Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy , in May 1921. In the article we can get a glimpse of the distribution and devasta- tion of the pandemic, the lower mortality rate among homeopathy patients, and the chief remedies used fortreatment. We are at the very beginning of this pandemic and there will no doubt be changes in the expression of this virus andmuch to learn about individual susceptibility to it. Hopefully, we can develop a short list, a constellation of several 'stars 'to combat this miasm. My observations on Gelsemium ,Senega and Antimonium ars. are based on my initial experience treating this pandemic in New York City, one of the globalepicenters of the disease. Most of the approximately 30 cases treated were in person and some by phone or video session. As antibody testing becomes more available, it is incumbentupon all of us to test our cured patients and document the efcacy of our treatments. If this pandemic is anything like the Spanish Flu, we may be treating the after-effects of thisdisease for years to come. Twenty years after the end of the Spanish Flu pandemic, an article by Guy Beckley Stearns, MD, entitled, Influenzins , was published in The HomeopathicRecorder (Vol. LIII, No. 10, November 1938). In it, he docu- mented some chronic manifestations of what could be calledthe in fluenza miasm. Stearns argued that in fluenza had altered the expression of other infectious diseases and documented the use of in fluenza nosodes in the treatment of dif cult chronic cases. Only time will tell if there will be a chronic COVID-19 miasm and a viable COVID-19 nosode. Conflict of Interest None declared. Acknowledgement My thanks to all homeopathic patients worldwide for their continued con dence in and support of this healing method and to their homeopathic physicians who are now assembling various databases of cured COVID-19 cases for future research and archival purposes. I want to especiallythank each of my patients mentioned in this article for providing their informed consent for relevant case details and testing results to be used anonymously for academicpurposes.
