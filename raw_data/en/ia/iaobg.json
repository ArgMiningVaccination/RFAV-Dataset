Community Health Profile - 2009 Health Profile of New York's Capital District, 2009 In 1997, the counties of Albany, Rensselaer, an d Schenectady implemented a joint project to engage health providers and community members in a regional health assessment and prioritization process. This was the first major collaborative ve nture undertaken by the three local governments, health care providers, insurers, other community or ganizations and residents to assess health status, identify health priorities and develop plans to im prove the health status in and for the Capital District. It has been an exciting journey. As a result of th e first health profile provided to the sponsors and community in 1997, community members from across the region and across interest groups have joined together to develop initia tives for focused action. These initia tives have directly resulted in improved access to needed health services for ove r 46,000 residents in the Capital District. This report follows the 2002 Health Profile: Re port to the Capital District Community and Sponsors, as the third data analysis of the h ealth needs in the region. It expands upon the predominantly mortality driven analysis of its predecessor to include hospitalization analyses, prevention quality indicators, and health behaviors. The structure of this report is founded upon the Prevention Agenda of New York State. Utilizing th is framework and these statistical lenses, we will be able to track the need and impact of collective efforts to improve health far before the results are terminal. This analysis is not completely comprehensive of every health condition or public health issue. Individuals working on, or experiencing first hand, a particular health issue will undoubtedly have valuable knowledge to contribute beyond the data available. The analysis completed was chosen based upon the availability of reliable, comparable data and the delineated priority health areas of the New York State Department of Health. The results should provide a clear and fundamental description of the prevalence and concentration of each health indicator included. Elaboration on the included material may transpire as new data becomes available. This document would not be possible without th e labor, input and support of our sponsors and members of the community. It is the result of over a year of meetings with member organizations and community input through our public television program, \"How Healthy is the Capital District? A Community Health Forum,\" and our survey of ov er 800 residents of the Capital District. Their collaboration was invaluable. As a result of these effo rts, two priority areas for the Capital District were identified to focus our co llective efforts in the coming years: improving access to care and prevention of chronic diseases.

Introduction The purpose of this report is to summarize common health indicators that exist in public health databases. These indicators provide a broad array of health information th at may be useful in determining and monitoring health promotion priorities for the community. Selection of Indicators The health indicators selected for this report were based on a review of available public health data, national priorities identified in the Healthy People 2010 report and New York State priorities promulgated through the Prevention Agenda for a Healthier New York . Upon examination of these key resources, identification of additional indicators of importance with data available and discussion with public health as well as health care professionals in the Capital District, it was decided th at following the Prevention Ag enda would provide: (a) a generally comprehensive analysis, (b) on indicators that are key markers of public hea lth, (c ) supported currently and most likely will continue to be supported with both reliable and compar able data, (d) with measures that examine health conditions early enough to be potentially influenced in the short-term , and (e) on issues likely to be supported by the State Health Depa rtment through grant funded initiatives. The databases selected for use include birth, death, and hos pitalizations records. It is important to note that inclusion or exclusion of indicators from this report does not convey any a priori prioritization of health conditions. Selection of Priorities Selection of the top health priorities for the region was the conclusion of a year-long process building our knowledge of current public health conditions, identif ying an optimal process for selecting priorities and implementing that process. Data for health indicator topics were identified by ex amining the scope of health conditions required to be addressed in local Community Health Assessment and Comm unity Service Plans, exploration of New York State Department of Health statistical resources and consulta tion with New York State Health Department health information experts. Once the set of indicators we would examine were selected, a data request was made to New York State Department of Health to provide the b asis of 2001-2005 trend analy ses of Vital Statistics and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPA RCS) data. Each Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) member organization then volunteered to search out additional resources on less readily available data. From these various sources, draft indicator summaries were prepared. Our Health Profile work group then divided into two wo rk groups, one focusing on community engagement and the other on the production of the Health Profile. Each HC DI member organization in the Health Profile work group completed a review of several health indicators. Par ticipants who viewed the data on their health indicator compelling were asked to present on why their topic should be a priority for the Capital District. The reasons provided for prioritizing these topics as a commonly agreed upon priority were enumerated. The list of priority rationales was reduced by iden tifying common themes and important differences in the criterion used. The resulting criterion to be applied to a ll health indicators anew were: (1) prevalence in the general population - by number of people impacted or percentage, (2) prevalence in any sub-population, (3) severity - years of potential life lost or quality of life, (4) preventable, (5) root cause of other negative health conditions, and (6) cost of care. With this agreed upon basis for evaluation, each indicator was then reassessed by assi gning a score of 1 to 5 on each of the six evaluation criterion, with one being nomina lly applies to 5 representing hi ghly applicable to this indicator. Again, participants were asked to present thei r scoring and rationale for each indicator so that others could offer information or ideas that might cause the group to raise or lower the assigned score. Community Health Profile - 2009 2 After the scores were tallied, it was cl ear that access to care and chronic disease s impacted the most people in the most significant ways, both directly and indirectly thr ough their influence on other health conditions, were largely preventable and contributed most significantly to the cost of health care. Member organizations tested our findings by discussing our priority selection back in their host organizations and returned with feedback about additional or alternative pr iority areas of concern for th eir institution. Our priority selections were then put to the test by presenting them to the public for their input through a televised community health forum and through a survey available in paper and online. Capital District hospitals and county public health departments integrated the information garnered from the collaborative prioritization process, th is document and community input wi th internal needs assessment and capacity analysis into the articulation of their organizati ons' top community health prio rities. These priorities will drive the development of institutional services and joint initiatives to address pressing health needs in the region. Collaboration and Comm unity Engagement On June 23, 2009, WMHT-TV, in collaboration with the H ealthy Capital District Initiative, produced a televised Community Health Forum to provide citizen input to th e state-mandated Community H ealth Assessment. This assessment, including data from local health departments, hospitals and care givers, combined with anecdotal contributions from patients and their families was designe d to provide a full perspective on local health care needs, which will aid hospitals in developing a Comm unity Service Plan and contribute to local health departments' Community Health Assessments. The one-hour program featured a studio audience of about 80 public health experts and stakeholders as well as a broad range of consumers from the three counties. Call-in questions and comments from viewers were broadcasted live from the WMHT studios. The forum was moderated by Ms. Benita Zahn, WNYT Health Reporter, Anchor and Host of WMHT's Health Link . On the show, Ms. Benita Zahn presented a brief introduc tion to the program and l ead-in to a pre-recorded message from Richard Daines, MD, Commissioner of Hea lth for New York State. Dr. Daines introduced the State's Prevention Agenda and encouraged each community to collaboratively develop local responses to the health issues they find in their comm unity. Dr. Kevin Jobin-Davis, Executive Director of HCDI, summarized the process of collecting health data for the three coun ties and the process and criteria for selecting community priorities. Throughout the program, audience members (both in th e studio and by telephone) were encouraged to ask questions and offer their own personal experiences of seek ing and receiving health care in the Capital District. The discussions and question periods throughout the program were divided into 2 major regional health issues that have been identified through the data of the 2009 Assessment. The two major issues discussed were access to health care and the impact of chronic disease in our communities. Each of these topics and the following discussion was introduced by short video segments of persons that framed the individual issue. At the close of the show, the moderator summarized the t opics raised in the studio and call-in audiences. Access to care was the most pervasive topic. Access is negatively im pacted by tedious public h ealth insurance application paperwork, the limited availability of primary care physi cians and the resulting over-utilization of the emergency room for non-urgent care, particularly by the urban poor . The quality of care concerns voiced by the public were focused on the receipt of more preventative services, rather than disease management, and more culturally sensitive health services. The entire show was re-broadcasted on WM HT for those viewers who were unable to watch the original airing. In addition the HCDI web site has made the WMHT program available to others that may want to view it. Community Health Survey In order to understand the health issues and needs of the Capital District's population, the Healthy Capital District Initiative conducted an online survey How Healthy is the Capital District . The Community Health Survey was Healthy Capital District Initiative 3 promoted during an hour long public television forum in which the health needs of audience members was discussed in the context of the comm unity health planning process underway. The survey was available during the program and for 6 weeks thereafter through a web-based su rvey instrument that could be accessed on the WMHT website, HCDI website and sites of ot her member health organizations. The survey addressed issues of insurance coverage, ac cess to care, individual needs and barriers to care, community needs, chronic care experience, health services deficits, emergency room u tilization, health education from insurers and providers, and community health prior ities. Over 1,100 residents of the Capital District completed surveys. Most respondents were residing in Schenectady County (41.6%), but there were several hundred respondents from Albany C ounty (24.9%) and the Renssel aer County (20.6%) as well. The majority of survey respondents were employed for wages (73.9%), white female (67.4%), although responses were also received by 149 minority residents, and had priv ate health insurance (71.5%). This is representative of the region, the uninsured in the sample for example w as 12% and 28% for non-whites, except for a somewhat under-sampling of minorities. Access to Care The barriers to insurance coverage were primarily cost (28%), losing a job or changing employers (22%), and working part-time (11%) without be nefits. Losing Medicaid due to elig ibility was the reason for 4% of respondents and due to problems with Me dicaid recertification for another 4%. The majority of respondents (48%) have not had problems accessing health care, but almost the same number of respondents (43%) didn't seek care because either their wo rk and medical office availability conflicted (22%), the wait to get an appointment (12%) or the wait at the time of an appointment was too long (9%). Not having health insurance or the cost of hea lth services not covered by their insurance prevented 23%, nearly half of non- whites, of respondents from seeki ng care when they needed it. Service Needs Individuals with chronic care conditions also frequently (43%) experienced barriers to accessing care. Two thirds of the respondents had a person in their household with a chronic disease. When respondents listed all the chronic conditions present, high blood pressure was the most prevalen t (57.1%), followed by arthritis or other bone/joint diseases (34%), mental health (31%), asthma (29%), diabetes (25%), heart disease (17%) and cancer (10%). Asthma (43%) and diabetes (37%) were more prevalent in the non-white respondents. The barriers for those with chronic conditions were simila r to the general population such as cost issues for those with or without insurance, the availability of doctors wh en desired, particularly the availability of specialists. When asked which needed health ser vices were not available in their community, 17% of respondents said specialists - particularly reproductive health and dermat ology, 10% indicated services for the uninsured, followed closely by oral health (9%), mental health (9%) and primary care (8%). Health Priorities A majority of respondents (81%) recognized their persona l role in improving their health, whether it were exercise (26%), losing weight (22% ), quitting smoking (8%), better nutriti on (9%), or better personal choices (7%). But there were also systemic needs identified such as better access to health care (10%) and affordable health insurance (7%). A majority of residents (87.7%) agreed that the top priorities for the Capital District are access to care and services for addressing chronic diseases. Other important h ealth service needs included obesity/nutrition/physical exercise (25%), addressing insurance/ cost/access (20%), mental health (16%), prevention and screening (14%), and oral health services (6%). Community Health Profile - 2009 4 II. Summary of Data Public health in the Capital District is generally cons istent with other New York counties outside of New York City. Many trends are positive. Coronary heart disease mo rtality, stroke, colorectal cancer, births to teenage mothers and children's asthma have all decreased si nce 1990. Most recently, drug related hospitalizations, pedestrian injury hospitalizations and newly diagnosed HIV cases were all well below the New York State averages and Prevention Agenda goals for the state. It is not all good news, however, particularly in lowe r income, inner-city zip codes. Smoking and the related health consequences, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are generally well above state averages and objectives, even with lung cancer rat es trending downward. The prevalence of gonorrhea in the Capital District, particularly in Albany and Schenectady counties, stand out as some of the highest county rates in New York State. Similarly, the incidence of Lyme di sease in Albany and Rensselaer counties are several times higher than the rest of New York State. Chronic diseases and access to care are th e largest health barriers and opportunities in the Capital District. Chronic diseases comprise four of the five leading causes of death for persons 45 and older and they are largely preventable with healthy lifestyle choices around diet, ex ercise, smoking and regular health screenings. Diabetes, is particularly problematic, since it is an underlying c ondition in so many hospital visits - 4 times more than coronary heart disease which is the leading cause of death. Chronic diseases are more prevalent in older adults, which are the fastest growing segment of the population, and minorities. They are persistent and severe; account for a large portion of the cost of health care, while also increasing labor costs and diminishing the quality of life. The negative impact of chronic diseases, and all health conditions, are more severe for those who do not have access to care either because of a lack of insurance or the availab ility of health professionals accepting their insurance. With over 10% of the population in the region uninsured, there is a large portion of the population who will delay, forego, or not follow through on needed hea lth and prescriptions due to cost. This increases the severity of health conditions when full y treated and increases the risk of prem ature death. While the uninsured pay about 40% of their medical costs, hospitals still expe nd over $20 billion nationally each year on care for the uninsured. Many issues of access are also preventable th rough full utilization of public health insurance, free screenings and health services offered on a sliding fee scale. Counties Rensselaer County typifies this pattern for the Capital Distri ct of a low incidence of risky behavior related health outcomes, yet relatively high smoking related health issu es. COPD mortality is 50% above the state excluding New York City (NYC) rate. Lung cancer and adult smoking are well above regional and New York State averages, as well as Prevention Agenda goals for the state. On the other hand, pedestrian injuries, teenage births, drug hospitalizations and new HIV cases are well below st ate averages. Rensselaer County, like Albany County, has experienced dramatic increases in Lyme disease in the past eight years. Albany County similarly has a very low rate of new HI V cases, but has a HIV mortality rate twice the non-NYC State rate. Coronary heart disease mortality rates in Albany County are also above the rest of the State and region, yet hospitalizations for coronary heart disease are much lower than these comparison points. Tooth decay in 3rd grade children in Albany County was found to be below the rest of the region, state rates and objectives. Asthma hospitalization rates for children are quite good for Albany and Schenectady counties. Schenectady County residents, like the rest of the Capital District, are most likely to die from and receive hospital services for coronary heart disease, COPD and stroke; w ith diabetes being a root cause of an extraordinary number of hospitalizations. The mortality and hospitaliza tion rates for these conditions in the county, however, are at or below the New York State rates excluding NYC. Unlike the rest of the Capital District, Schenectady County has not seen an uptick in Lyme disease, but h as had higher than average homicide and suicide rates between 2001 and 2005. Healthy Capital District Initiative 5 Gender It appears that women live longer than men for good r eason. They are more likely to have a primary care physician and receive preventive medical services and less likely to be overweight in the Capital District. The leading cause of death for women between ages 20 and 74 is cancer. Women are twice as likely to die from cancer during this time as from diseases of the heart. After age 75, diseases of the heart are by the far the most prevalent cause of death, 2.5 times the mortality rate of cancer. Brea st cancer in the region had declined considerably over the past 15 years, but remains above the Prevention Agenda objective. Women are most likely to use the hospital for unintentiona l injuries, falls, COPD, coronary heart disease and then stroke. Women in the Capital District are about 25% more likely than New York State women, excluding NYC, to be hospitalized or die from COPD. Women in the Capital Di strict are also 25% more likely than Capital District men to be hospitalized or die from COPD. The difference by gender of COPD mortality does disappear when age adjusted compared to the United States population, but cl early women in the region are at risk of developing COPD. In addition to their weight issues and less frequent u se of medical professionals, men experience health problems disproportionately due to aggressive behavior. Men had triple the assault hospitalizations and double the homicide mortality of women. Motor vehicle accidents are a major risk factor for young people and men ages 4 to 34 had hospitalization rates 50% higher than women. Men were less likely than women to be hospitalized for self- inflicted injuries, yet men were 5 times as likely to di e from suicide between 2001 and 2005. Men were even more likely to die from falls, while being hospitalized less fre quently than women. Overall though, just over 50% of men and women die from comparable rates of diseases of the heart and cancer. Ethnicity For the major cause of death between 2001 and 2005, black s had about twice the hospitalization rate of whites, while whites died from COPD 50% more often than blacks. Interestingly, blacks had twice the hospitalization rate for COPD as whites for the period. Mo rtality rates for coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death, were comparable to each other and state rates, yet hospitalizati on rates for this condition were 40% below the state rates for both ethnic groups. For less frequent causes of death, AIDS mortality rates were 20 times higher for blacks than whites, with whites 25% below the state rates and blacks above. Violent crimes of assault and homicide were 7 and 8 times higher for blacks respectively, although suicide for whites was 1/3 hi gher than for blacks. Motor vehicle accident mortality in the region was less than half the st ate rate for blacks, resulting in the rate for whites being twice that of blacks. Hospitalization for diabetes and COPD for blacks was twice the rate of whites, while asthma hospitalizations were about 3\u00bd times and assault about 7 times higher than hosp italization rates for whites. While concerning, these differences are consistent with statewide patterns. Bl acks sought hospital treatment for falls about 30% less frequently than whites. The relatively small number of non-white, non-black residents in the Capital District cautions interpretation based on rates, but there was a disproportionate pattern of diabetes incidence in this population. Structure of this Report: Health Indicators Every year, the New York State Department of Health provides information on major health indicators for each county. To supplement available information, this repor t focuses on more detailed in formation, such as disease rates by zip code areas, by gender and by race, and provi ding summary information over the past decade. In order to present meaningful information for smaller areas or subgroups, data for several years were combined. Thus, most information presented is based on three or five y ears of combined data. Still, some areas had too few cases to estimate rates accurately. After presenting information on demographics and causes of death for the Capital District, a summary of each disease indicator is presented. Generally, these summaries cont ain a brief synopsis defining the condition, why it Community Health Profile - 2009 6 is of concern, some national and state descriptive statistics, New York State objectives - or the national standard of Healthy People 2010 if New York has not articulated an objective; comparisons of local data with state data; a description of significant gender, race, and age dynamics as is available; and disease rates by zip code areas. When possible, typically limited to mortality rates, an alyses include a retrospective look of any trends in the growth or recession of the indicator over the past 15 y ears we have monitored. A presentation of county and national rates, along with the objectives, is provided in order to put the local hea lth status in perspective. The rates presented are age-adjusted so that comparisons of c ounty data to state and national objectives can be made. National rates are usually based on experiences of one year because similarly adjusted rates for the time periods provided for counties are not readily available. An explanation of age-adjusted rates can be found at the end of this section. Zip codes groups were chosen as a small-area breakdown because there was insufficien t data for the primary alternative, census tracts. The groups were selected based on a minimum of 6,000 residents and meaningful groupings generally following municipa l or multiple municipal boundaries. Detailed tables are available in the appendixes for County Mortality Rates, Zip Code Neighborhood Grouping Maps by County, Mortality Rates by Disease Category, County Hospitalization Rates , Hospitalization Rates by Disease Category, Capital District Leading Causes of Death, 2003-2007, Prevention Quality Indicators, Birth Indicators by Capital District Community, and tabular results for the Community Health Survey - 2009. Rates For most indicators, age-adjusted rates are presented in the tables. Age-adjustment considers the differing age distributions within popula tions to calculate rates that can be u sed for comparison purposes. There are two common ways to adjust for age: direct standardizati on and indirect standardization. We used direct standardization. The advantage of this method is that comparison of Capital District data with Prevention Agenda and Healthy People 2013 objectives can be made for most indicators. Also, comparisons can be made between zip code areas and between groups (e.g ., counties, genders). Two important disadvantages exist. First, direct standardization is best when many events (e.g., deaths, hospitalizations) occur in every group. If there are few events then these rates can be unstable, that is, they may overestimate or underestimate the true rate. Thus, for zip code groups, rates are estimated in areas with three or more events, although usually the number was much higher. Also, the data were carefully reviewed to assess the likelihood that unstable estimates would mislead readers. Second, age-adjusted rates can not be inte rpreted in isolation. The actual number provides some important meaning. It is not, however, a meaningful point of comparison, making age adjusted rates the most useful measure of the data for purposes of comparison. Prevention Agenda and Healthy People 2013 objectives have been age-standardized to the United States 2000 popul ation, thus age-adjusted rates presented in this report are standardized similarly.

In fact, deaths of young people carry considerable weight in these age-adjusted death rates. When comparing overall age-adjusted death rates in the Capital District from 1991-1995 and 1996-2000, there is a decline in all three counties. However, in the 2000 to 2005 period there is increase in the mortality rate for all three counties; especially Schenectady County. The total age- adjusted death rate in the Cap ital District remains higher than the rate in Upstate New York as whole. The age-adjusted death rate is higher among males than females and higher among blacks than whites in most age groups. These differences are consistent with upstate mortality patterns.

Access to Care Adult Health Care Coverage The uninsured are at risk of catastrophic financial and health consequences. Having no health coverage is the cause of death of about 18,000 - 22,000 Americans each year . Uninsured children and adults receive about half as much care, have worse health and have a greater risk of dying in the hospital or shortly after discharge than people with insurance. Premature death is 25 percen t greater among uninsured adults compare to insured individuals. Having no insurance affects both preventive and chronic com ponents of care. It is the most significant barrier to accessing primary care, which is the prime opportunity for prevention education, early detection, early treatment and referral to other needed health and social services. Uninsured adults are less likely to receive, or receive in a timely manner, recommended preventive and screening services than insured adults; both of which reduces the probability of survival. Lack of health insurance is strongly associated with poverty. Half of all bankruptcies have high medical bills as a significant factor. Health care costs for uninsured low-income famili es can be financially catastrophic. Even though uninsured families are often poor, they pay, on average, up to 40% of their medical costs by themselves. Every year, the U.S. Census Bureau, in its Current Popul ation Survey (CPS), reports the number of people who are uninsured. This widely quoted numbe r is intended to offer an estimate of how many people did not have any type of health insurance for the entire previous cale ndar year. The 2007 Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) estimates of uninsured children under age 19 we re allocated based on each county's share of the uninsured children under age 18 in the Census Bureau's sm all-area health insurance estimates (SAHIE) model for 2005. Data from this estimate is presented below. According to this model, the prevalence of uninsured children under 19 years of age is somewhat higher in Schenectady County compared to Albany and Rensselaer counties. While the prevalence of uninsured children under 19 years of age for the Capital District is lower th an the statewide rate, based on this estimation model, there are over 11,200 children remaining without insurance in the region. The Census Bureau estimates the prevalence of uninsured adults 19-64 is highest in Rensselaer County, although all of the Capital District counties fall well below the statewide uninsured rate. Prevalence of uninsured population under 65 years of age is highest in Rensselaer County and the Capital District counties have the lower rate for this age group compare to the statewide rate. The Expanded BRFSS phone survey of approximately 300 residents from each county was not particularly consistent with the CPS estimates. The e-BRFSS results were above and below the CPS rates, Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, increase the percentage of adult New Yorkers with health care coverage to 100% Estimates of Uninsured for Children under 19 Years of Age* New York 9.20% Albany 7.00% Rensselaer 7.30% Schenectady 8.10% * 2007 Current Population Survey Estimates of Uninsured for Adults 19 to 64* New York 17.2% Albany 11.9 % Rensselaer 13.0% Schenectady 10.6% * 2007 Current Population Survey Community Health Profile - 2009 14 suggesting that the sampling has to be completed to ge t more reliable results. The e-BRFSS and CPS did find, consistent with national trends, that men were much more likely to be uni nsured, similar to younger people and those with a lower income. The likelihood of having insurance coverage is directly related to annual income. Persons earning less than $25,000 were more than twice as likely as the average person to be uninsured, while those earning over $75,000 were less than half as likely to be uninsured. Although the proportion of Capital District adult reside nts with health insurance exceeds the New York State average, an estimated 34,336 adults in the tri-county ar ea self-report not having health insurance (Albany County - 13,416; Rensselaer County - 10,452; Schenectady Count y -10,468). Many of these residents are eligible for Medicaid Managed Care but not enrolled. For the years 2003-2007, on average, 32% of eligible Albany residents were not enrolled in Medicaid Manage d Care, 25% of eligible Rensselaer residents and 56% of Schenectady residents. Schenectady's rate is sk ewed due to residents having the opti on of enrolling in a non-Managed Care Medicaid coverage. They became a mandatory Medi caid Managed Care County in 2007 and by 2008 their enrollment was comparable to Albany County with 32% of eligible residents not enrolled. This means that an average of over 19,000 adult residents in the Capital Di strict each year are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled. The disparities in health care coverage among ethni c groups are a serious problem. According to BRFSS 2003- 2005, approximately 35% of New York State Hispanics had no health insurance coverage. This is more than three times the proportion of white non-Hispanic New Yorkers wit hout coverage (10.4%) and significantly higher than all other race/ethnic categories. Ra tes of no coverage for Asian non-Hi spanic and black non-Hispanic New Yorkers were 21.6% and 17.1% respectiv ely. In each racial/ethnic group, those without insurance are more likely to use the emergency department as a regular source of care; white adults are least likely to use the emergency department for routine care, regardless of insurance status.

Uninsured and Dying Because of It A Shared Destiny: Effects of Uninsurance on Individuals, Families, and Communities Health Care Access Among Adults in New York City Cover the Uninsured Healthy Capital District Initiative 15 Adults with Regular Health Care Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 Increase the percentage of adult New Yo rkers who have a regular health care provider to 96% More than 1.6 million adults in New York, or 15%, lack a regular care provider. A lack of access to a primary care provider results in negative health outcomes. Pr imary care, including prenatal care, provides a prime opportunity for prevention education, early detection, early treatment, and referral to other needed health and social services. Sustained contact with a primary care provider improves the consistency and efficacy of treatment for long-term chronic care patients. Health care coverage and re gular care providers, both are essential in making health care accessible. Approximately 90% of Capital District adult residents have a primary care physician, clinic, health center, or other place where they usually go to seek health care or health-related advice, which exceeds the New York State average. Women are more likely to have a usual source of ongoing primary care than men. In the Capital District, Rensselaer County has the highest rate of adults who self-reported having a regular health care provider. While more Capital District residents have a regular health care provider, compare to the rest of the state, both the Capital District and state rates fall below Prevention Agenda goals. No direct relationship was evident between having a re gular health care provider and visiting a doctor for a routine checkup within the past year. More Schenectady County residents visited a doctor for routine checkup in the last year (79.1%) than Albany (69.4%) and Rensselaer (71.3%) counties. Capital District residents are equally likely to see a doctor in the past year or two for a routine checkup as residents throughout the rest of the state. Regular health exams and tests can identify problems before they advance. Early detection of health problems improves the chances of successful treatment. Receiving the right health services, screenings and treatment increases the chances of living a longer, healthy and productive life. While men were much less likely to have had a routin e checkup than women, no relationship was found between age, education or income and chances of having a routine ch eckup in the past year or 2 years. While this may just reflect an insufficient number of particip ants in the survey thus far, it may also suggest other barriers to accessing care, such as time constraints due to employment, count eract any possible greater inclination to have routine checkups by people with the experience, knowledge and means to do so. Structural, financial, and personal barriers can limit access to health care. Structural barriers include transportation, the distance to providers, insurance polic y regulations, the lack of health care facilities, primary care providers, medical specialists, or other health care pr ofessionals to meet the public's needs. In addition to not having health insurance, financial barriers can also include not having the financial capacity to cover the cost of services or co-pays in accordance with health plan guide lines. Personal barriers include cultural or spiritual Adults with Regular Health Care Provider 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives* 96.0% * NYS Department of Health Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Adults Who Visited a Doctor for a Routine Checkup* Within the Past 1 Year Within the Past 2 Years New York 75.4% 86.6% Albany Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Community Health Profile - 2009 16 differences, language barriers, not knowing what to do or when to seek care, or concerns about confidentiality. When these barriers exist, care is often not well coordinated or as effective as it should be. Delays in seeking treatment or not receiving appropriate screenings reduce overall health care quality. Having insurance reduces the likelihood of adults not seeking medical care due to cost and receiving regular care in the Emergency Department. Compared to insured adults, the uninsured are about 4 times more likely to not seek medical care for a health problem due to cost (41% vs. 11%) and about twice as likely to not fill prescriptions (24% vs. 14%). Insurance and a regular provider each improve access to preventive care; adults with both receive the most screenings. An estimated 33,177 adults in the tri-county area have difficulty in accessing needed care due to financial constraints (Albany County - 14,9 94; Rensselaer - 10,416; Schenectady - 7,707). There were, however, no consistent patterns of residents not seeking treatment b ecause of costs and age, gender, education or income.

The most fruitful of these strategies has been the Facilitated Enrollment Program. The Facilitated Enrollment Program was established in June of 2000 by a grant from the New York State Health Department. The program enables staff from HCDI to raise awareness of government health insurance programs - Family Health Plus (FHP) and Child Health Plus A (CHP A), also known as Medicaid, and Child Health Plus B (CHP B) - and assist interested residents of Albany, Schenectady and Rensselaer counties in the co mpletion of the application requirements. Facilitated Enrollers from HCDI are available to applican ts days, evenings and weekends at convenient sites within the neighborhoods of the residents we serve. Since June 2000, HCDI co mpleted and submitted 20,384 applications for 35,315 children and adults. These appli cations resulted in 24,502 i ndividuals becoming enrolled in public health insurance through the Facilita ted Enrollment Program through June 1, 2009. HCDI partners also assist residents with applications for government health in surance programs. Currently Fidelis, CDPHP and Wellcare help i ndividuals apply for FHP, CHP A or CHP B in Albany and Rensselaer Counties, while GHI also supports FHP and CHP B, and Empire offers CHP B only. In Schenectady County, Empire supports CHP B only, while Fi delis, CDPHP and GHI help individuals apply for FHP, CHP A or CHP B. The County Departments of Social Services assist applicants with CHP A and FHP applications. Although the change in the proportion of uninsured in th e region is not known without regular, reliable surveys, the onset of facilitated enrollment clearly and dramatica lly increased the number of persons who are enrolled in CHP A or FHP by 2004. The total enrollment rate has b asically been sustained since, although each county has seen an increase in over 1,000 children enrolled in CHP B, which means that there was a slight drop in Medicaid enrollment. While HCDI has been most e ffective impacting issues of access, continued effort is being devoted to the structural and personal barriers to care. Reduction of structural barriers is being pursued by increasing consumer awareness of the importance of using a primary care physician and emergency rooms only when appropriate. HCDI is also working to reduce personal barriers to care by collaborating with the University at Albany on their EXPORT Center grant. This is a multi-year initiative to research and redress barriers to care for members of minority groups.

Poor oral health negatively impacts a person's general h ealth and well-being. Studies have demonstrated a strong association between periodontal disease and diabetes, hear t disease, stroke, pneumonia and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although these relationships are not yet fully u nderstood. The mouth can serve as a portal of entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that aff ect general health. These bacteria can result in extensive localized infections but may also spread to other parts of the body if the normal barriers of a healthy mouth are breached. Death from complications arising from untreated de ntal abscesses is rare but does occur. Chronic pain from oral disease can also make eating difficult which thr eatens adequate nutrition, as well as a person's ability to function normally. Routine dental examinations and proph ylaxis are effective prevention measures for improving oral health and reducing the burden of oral disease. Adults regularly vis iting their dentist is an important indicator of general access to quality health care. Oral diseases affect a large proportion of the United States population. Nearly one-third of all adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay (CDC). In New York State, about 50% of adults have lost one or more teeth due to tooth decay or gum diseases and about 18% of persons 65 years and older have lost all their teeth. Cancers of the mouth and throat are detected in five New Yorkers every day. Self reports of adult residents visiting their dentist within the last year in the Capital District are at or above the State average, but remain well below the Prevention Agenda objective. Men, as with other preventive health care, are less likely to regularly visit a dentist or have had their teeth cleaned in the past year than women. As adu lts become more senior, they are less likely to have visited a dentist in the past year, decreasing each decade from ages 45-54, 55-64 and > 65 years. Numerous seniors, 44%, have had permanent teeth extracted due to decay or gum disease. Periodontal disease has been shown to increase the chances of preterm and low birth weight babies. Younger, less educated, black, unmarried women, and those with Medicaid coverage are less likely to have visited a dentist or dental clinic during pr egnancy than older, more educated, married, white, and non-Medicaid enrolled women. Untreated dental disease is more common in racial/ethnic minority groups and in populations whose access to oral health care services is limited by the inability to pay, lack of adequate insurance coverage and the lack of available providers including those acce pting third party reimbursements, especially Medicaid. The lack of awareness of the importance of oral health treatment, limited oral health literacy, fears about treatment, transportation issues and language barri ers also limit access to adequate oral health care. Access to dental care is also particularly problematic for vulnerable populations, such as: the institutionalized, elderly, children with special health care needs, persons with HIV infecti on, low income, adults with mental illness or substance abuse problems, and developmentally disabled or physically challenged children and adults.

Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow out of control. It can be caused by many different factors (genetics, lifestyle, environment, etc.). Age, gender and race are important factors in the occurrence of cancer. It causes human suffering and significant economic cost. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in New York State as well as the nation. Each year, about 100,000 New Yorkers are diagnosed with cancer. Lung, colorectal, breast and pros tate cancers account for the majority of cancers in New York and nationally. These four types of cancer account for 55.5% of all incident cancers and 50.9% of cancer death. Many cancer deaths are preventable. The goal of cancer screen ing is to identify cancers in people before they start to experience clinical symptoms. For several types of cancer, detection at an early stage significantly increases the success and options of treatment. \"Early stage\" is defined as identifying invasive cancers that are limited to the tissue of origin. The five-year survival rate for breast cancer that is in its earliest stages is 97.0% and only 23.3% at late stage. Similarly, colorectal can cer diagnosed in its earliest stage has a five year survival rate of 90.1% as opposed to later stage disease, which has a five year survival rate of 9.2%. Over 35,000 New York State residents died from maligna nt cancers each year between 2002 and 2007. Based on the data from New York State Cancer Registry, the per centages of early stage cancer diagnoses in the Capital District rarely exceed the statewide rates or approach the Prevention Agenda objectives. While screening for prostrate, melanoma and, to a lesser extent, breast cancer has proven effective at diagnosing these cancers at an early stage; early detection of ovarian, lung and oral cancers lags far behind. Still, breast and cervical cancers, followed by colorectal and melanoma cancer diagnoses in the region fall well behind Prevention Agenda objectives. Prostrate cancer screenings are not n ecessarily advisable for all patients. Consultation with a doctor and other reliable sources is advisable prior to pr oceeding with a screening or any medical procedure. County and State rates of cancer diagnosis in the early stage are reported below: Percentage of Early Stage Cancer Diagnosis 2001- 2005 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 09 0 1 0 0OralColorectalLungMelanomaFemale BreastCervical OvaryProstate Source: http://www.nyhealth.gov/statistics/chac/chai/index.htmPA 2013 50 90 80 65 95 NYS 38 43 21 83 65 54 19 88 Schenectady 37 47 21 81 68 46 17 83 Rensselaer 28 39 15 72 64 56 17 89 Albany 41 39 16 78 64 55 12 85Oral Colorectal Lung Melanoma Female Breast Cervical Ovary Prostate Community Health Profile - 2009 20 Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second leading cau se of cancer death among women in the United States, exceeded only by lung cancer. The fatality of invasive breast cancer is str ongly influenced by the stage of the disease at diagnosis. The risk of dying from breast cancer is reduced by nearly 30% among women who have regular mammograms beginning at age 50. Data support that when breast cancer is diagnosed at an early, or localized, stage, 97% of women survive for five years. The frequency of breast cancer diagnoses occurring at an ear ly stage in the Capital District is well below the prevention agenda objective and New York State experien ce. At the same time, according to e-BRFSS, over 95% of women age 40 and older in the Capital District re ported ever having had a mamm ogram, 6% above the state rate. Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer a nd second leading cause of cancer deaths (of cancers that effect both men and women). Ninety percent (90%) of ne w cancer cases are diagnosed in adults over 50. Routine screening can reduce the number of people who die from colo rectal cancer by at least 60%. The rate of colorectal cancers in the Capital District is slight ly lower than New York State rate. The percentage of early stage colorectal cancer diagnoses for Capital District counties falls below the prevention agenda goal of 50% by as little as 3% in Schenectady County, and as much as 11% in Albany and Rensselaer. According to e-BRFSS samples of about 200 adults per c ounty, the Capital District residents reported higher screening rates for colorectal cancer than the statewide rate, although the percentage in general is quite low. In Albany County, only 37.9% of adults interviewed ages 50 and older self-reported ha ving home blood stool test ever. While Rensselaer was somewhat comparable at 40.7%, Schenectady County was much higher at 53.3%. Self reports of ever having a Sigmoidoscopy and Col onoscopy among adults age 50 and older is higher compare to self-reported rates of having home blood stool test. It is highest in Albany and Schenectady Counties, 75.0% and 72.8% respectively, but significantly lower in Rensselaer County at 59.4%. Cervical Cancer Since screening programs using a Pap test were widely implemented more than 50 years ago, cervical cancer deaths have declined 75 percent nationwide. Yet cerv ical cancer still takes the lives of approximately 4,000 women in the United States each year. Cervical cancer diagnoses occurring at an early stage is well below the prevention age nda objective in the Capital District counties by as little as 9% in Rensselaer County an d as much as 19% in Schenectady County. At the same time, the percentage of women reporting ever having a Pap test in the Capital District approaches or exceeds the statewide rate of 92.5% (Albany - 98.0%, Schenectady - 95.5%, Rensselaer - 91.4%). In general, gender and race are important factors in freque ncy of different types of cancers. While cancer is the leading cause of death for women, at all ages, women have lower incidence and mortality rates than men in the same age group and this gender difference has remained stab le over time in New York State. Women have higher percentage of cancers diagnosed at an early stage compar ed to men in all three Capital District counties. Cancer does not affect all races equally in the United Stat es. African Americans are more likely to die of cancer than people of any other racial or ethnic group. Early diagnosis is critical for cancer control. In New York, for each anatomical cancer site, the percent of black males dia gnosed at a later stage is higher than for white males. This is also true for black females in comparison to white females, except for cervical and ovarian cancers, for which the percent diagnosed at a localized stage does not vary by race. The reason for these differences is not clear. Healthy Capital District Initiative 21 Numerous studies provide evidence that early detection of cancer matters. The Capital District falls below the desired goal in early detection of cancer. Efforts to re duce cancer incidence should in crease access to and use of proven, existing screening methods and focus on mi norities, especially for underserved populations.

Tobacco use and dependence is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in New York State (NYS) and in the country. Cigarette use alone results in an estimated 438,000 deaths each y ear, including 25,500 deat hs in New York State. In addition to its direct impact on smokers, smoking ne gatively affects non-smokers in proximity to smokers. Every year, 2,500 New Yorkers die from the affects of second-hand smoke. Secondha nd smoke contains hundreds of toxic and cancer-causing chemicals. The Surgeon Genera l has stated that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent). There are 389,000 children alive today who will die pr ematurely from second hand smoke. Many more children exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from respirat ory illnesses including bronchitis and pneumonia, asthma, and eye and ear problems. More than half a million New Yorkers currently have a disease caused by smoking, resulting in about $8.17 billio n in health care expenditures annually. Tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure causes heart disease and stroke; chronic lung disease; cancers of the lung, mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and bladders; and other lung and vascular diseases. Tobacco use during pregnancy leads to poor birth outcomes and increases the chances for sudden infant death syndrome. In the Capital District, the prevalence of cigarette smoki ng is highest in Rensselaer County, at exactly double the prevention agenda objective. Albany County has the low est rate of smoking among the Capital District counties. The prevalence of smoking in both New York State and the Capital District exceed the prevention agenda objective significantly. Nationwide, prevalence of cigarette smoking is high est among American Indians/Alaska natives (36.4%), followed by whites (21.4%), blacks (19.8%), Hispanics (13.3%), and Asians (9.6%). Smoking is a special problem among youth. Nearly 90% of tobacco users begin before age 18. According to CDC, 20 percent of high school students in the United St ates were current cigarette smokers in 2007. In New York State, 16.3% of youth currently smoke. In one year, an estimated 23,900 New York youth will become smokers. Rensselaer County Prevention Needs Assessment (PNA) Su rvey was conducted during the spring of 2008 among students from 6 th-12th grades and 4,579 adolescents, roughly half of all students, participated. Eight percent (8%) of participating adolescents in Rensselaer County reported smoking at least once in the past month, which meets the Prevention Agenda objective of 12%. In Albany County, 2,315 students from the 7 th-12th grades completed the New York State Youth Development Survey in the fall of 2008.

It includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and in some cases asthma. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of 127,049 Americans in 2005. The number of women dying from COPD has surpassed the nu mber seen in men. This is the fifth consecutive year in which women have exceeded me n in the number of deaths attributable to COPD. In 2005, almost 66,000 females died compared to 61,000 males. These increases likely reflect the increase in smoking by women, relative to men, si nce the 1940s. In the United States, a history of current or former smoking is the risk factor most often linked to COPD, and the increase in the number of women smoking over the past half-century is mirrored in the increase in COPD rates among women. The prevalence of both COPD morbidity and mortality has been increasing nationwide with COPD being an important cause of hospitalization in older populations. Approximately 65% of discharges were in the 65 years and older age group in 2005. COPD rates are reported in two ways; for all ages and for adults 45 and older. The chart below demonstrates that COPD mortality rates for older residents continue to incr ease in the Capital District, except for Albany County, but are consistent with upstate rates. Age-adjusted COPD mortality rates for all individual s regardless of age in Albany (39.5 per 100,000) and Schenectady 40.9) counties are above the Prevention Agenda objective of 31, but about equal to the New York State rate excluding NYC of 43. Rensselaer County, howev er, was about 50% above the state rate at 57.8. COPD mortality rates were quite a bit higher for men than women and for whites than for blacks in Rensselaer County, less so in Albany County, but comparable in Schenectady County (see Appendix IV). In the United States, tobacco use is a key factor in the development and progression of COPD - people who smoke are 10 times more likely to get COPD than tho se who don't smoke. Other risk factors include: exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors, and respiratory infections. Early detection of COPD might alter its course and progress. A simple test can be used to measure pulmonary function and detect COPD in current and former smokers aged 45 and over and anyone with respiratory problems. Avoiding tobacco smoke, home and workplace air pollutants, and respiratory infections are key to preventing the development of COPD.

More people die from lung cancer than any other type of cancer. This is true for both men and women. According to CDC, in 2005 lung cancer accounted for more deaths than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer combined. Lung cancer incidence in the Capital District and New York State exceeds the prevention agenda objective for both males and females. Rensselaer has the highest incidence of lung cancer among male and female residents compare to Albany and Schenectady counties. The Capital District rates of lung cancer incidence exceed th e statewide rate for both genders. While there has been a declin e nationally in lung cancer mortality among males, the mortality rate among females has actually increased. All three counties in the Capital District have lung cancer death rates that are slightly higher than the overall U.S. rate. Comparing the 1991- 1995 to the 1996-2000 periods, Albany County showed a 7% decrease in its lung can cer death rate. Despite this decline there has been an in crease in lung cancer deaths in Albany among people over the age of 75. Rensselaer showed a 3% decrease in lung cancer rates in the same time period. As with Albany, this decline is mostly seen in younger adults. Males, in every age group showed a decline in lung can cer deaths in Schenectady. However, the overall rate for this county had a 1% increase from the 1991-1995 to the 1996-2000 time periods, because lung cancer death rates increased for women across every adult age group. Prevention is the only way to reduce the large numbers of premature deaths caused by lung cancer. Studies show that approximately 90% of lung cancer deaths in males and 80% in females can be attributed to smoking. It seems clear that smoking cessation is the single most important way of preventing and reducing lung cancer deaths. Even long-term heavy smokers can greatly reduce their risk of lung cancer by stopping smoking.

Healthy Mothers/Healthy Babies/Healthy Children Prenatal Care Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, increase the percentage of women in New York who have received prenatal care in the first trimester to at least 90%. Prenatal care improves the likelihood of both a healthier mo ther and a healthier baby. Good prenatal care focuses on nutritional care designed to achieve adequate weight ga in and other nutritional needs. It can also provide psychosocial support to assist in smoking and al cohol cessation during pregnancy, if needed. Delayed access to prenatal care is more prevalent in inner city and rural areas. Lack of child care services and transportation may add to the barriers women face when trying to initiate care in a timely manner. Nationwide, blacks are less likel y to obtain early prenatal care compared with whites. Prenatal care is most often sought by mothers in their late twenties to late thirties. The U.S in general has seen an increase, of 11% in the proportion of mothers who receive early prenatal care from 1990 to 2003. In the Capital District, there was little to no improvement in the proportion of mothers who sought early prenatal care in 2001-2005. However, the higher prenatal care averages for Albany and Schenectady County for 2004-2006 indicate that there was an increase in prenatal care more recently. All three counties show a smaller percentage of first-trimester care compared to the U.S. as a whole and remains 10-13% below the Prevention Agenda objective. The rates of all three counties, however, are comparable to Upstate New York rates. Many women in high-risk groups participate in Medicaid programs. Historically, women enrolled in Medicaid have had more difficulty scheduling first-trimester appointments and receiving the same psychosocial support as have women with private insurance. Prenatal care for mothers in zip codes with lower average income was 16% lo wer than the county average in Albany, just 5% lower in Troy than the county rate, but over 20% lower in parts of Schenectady than the county rate. It is important to note that the data used both nationally and in the Capital District to determine access to prenatal care is derived from birth certificates. A limitation of this data source is that it provides no information about the quality of the care obtained.

Low birth weight is a term used to describe infants who weigh less than 2500 grams (about 5 \u00bd pounds) at birth. Low birth weight is a major cause of infant mortality and long term disability. The prevalence of low birth weight births in Albany and Rensselaer counties is lower compared to the statewide rate. Schenectady has the highest prevalence of low birth weight births among the Capital District counties and almost equals the state rate. Both state and Capital District rates of low birth weight births are above the Prevention Agenda objectives. Risk factors associated with low birth weight are extremes of maternal age, poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, cigarette smoking, history of having a low birth weight baby, low socio-economic status and a low leve l of education. Black infants were two times more likely to have low birth weight than white infants at birth during 2003-2005. Between 1995 and 2005, the rate of infants born at a low birth weight in the United States in creased more than 12%. The Capital District has also seen a rise in low bi rth weight births from 1991 to 2005, moving away from the Prevention Agenda Goal. Prenatal care with education focusing on behavioral changes, such as the cessation of cigarette smoking and ad equate nutrition and weight gain control, would have beneficial e ffects in reducing low birth weight.

Infant mortality has long been considered a good indicator of a community's health. Causes of infant mortality in the United States include respiratory distress and other diso rders due to low birth weight and premature birth. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), unintentional injury , and congenital anomalies ar e other causes of infant mortality. Infant mortality is reduced when pregnant women ma ke healthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cessation and avoidance of other harmful substances, maintenance of a nut ritious diet and obtaining early prenatal care. These choices are more common among pregnant women in a community that likewise chooses healthy lifestyles. Infant mortality is reduced in communities that have good neonatal specialty care for sick newborns and access to good pediatric care. This specialized medical care commonly occurs in co mmunities that have good medical care in general. Infant mortality therefore varies among communities in as much as lifestyles, preventive services and medical care varies. Infant mortality is declining consistently in US, from 8 per 1,000 live births in 1994 to 6.8 in 2004 except for a small spike in 2002. The Capital District shows a slight increase in Albany and Schenectady counties in infant mortality rates in 2001-2005. Rensselaer County experienced a slight decrease. All thr ee counties remain above the upstate Ne w York rate and above the U.S. goal of 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. In the United States race and socio-economic status are important risk factors for infant mortality. Specifically, Black Americans, and those of Hispanic or American Indian descent, have higher rates of infant mortality, as do babies born to mothers with less than 12 years of education. Risk factors for infant mortality include those for prematurity and low birth weight, namely poor prenatal care, tobacco and drug use a nd teenage pregnancy. These risks are not easily reduced by any one intervention, but may be ameliorated by concerted community interventions, societal pressures and changes in policies that affect the availability of drugs, birth control, prenatal care and post-neonatal medical care.

Disease prevention is the key to pub lic health. Vaccines are among the 20th century's most successful and cost- effective public health tools for preventing disease and death. Vaccination programs in the U.S. have eradicated or considerably reduced many vaccine-p reventable diseases, like polio, measl es, etc. Though, these diseases still exist and can once again become common and fatal if v accination coverage does not continue at high levels. Immunization of children is especially important. Newborn babies are immune to many diseases as they have antibodies from mothers, but this immunity lasts only a mont h to a year. Unvaccinated children many not be able to fight the disease when bei ng exposed to a disease agent. Immunizing children has a positive affect not only at a pers onal level, but also significant benefit for the whole community, especially for those who are not immunized. People who are not immunized include those who are too young to be vaccinated (e.g., children less than a y ear old cannot receive the measles vaccine but can be infected by the measles virus), those who cannot be vacci nated for medical reasons (e.g ., children with leukemia), and those who do not have an adequate response to vaccination. The National Immunization Survey (NIS) provides vacci nation coverage estimates among children aged 19-35 months for each of the 50 states and selected urban areas. According to the report of the 2007 NIS, for children born from January 2004 to July 2006, more than 90 per cent coverage was achieved for most of the routinely recommended vaccines. The majority of parents were vacci nating their children, with less than 1% of children receiving no vaccines by age 19-35 months. Coverage rema ined high across all racial/ethnic groups and was not significantly different among racial/ethnic groups after ad justing for poverty status. Ho wever, for some vaccines, coverage remained lower among children living below th e poverty level compared with children living at or above the poverty level. Currently there is no statistical data available about the fully immunized New York Children aged 19 to 35 months by county. The New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) Bureau of Immunization is committed to promoting the health of New York State children by reducing and/or el iminating the number of vaccine preventable diseases that affect the State's children. As part of this effort, the New York State legislature passed the Immunization Registry Law which, as of January 1, 2008, requires health care pr oviders to report all immunizations administered to persons less than 19 years of age, along with the pe rson's immunization histories, to the New York State Department of Health using the recently launched st atewide web-based Immunization Information System (IIS) . Once fully implemented, this system will be the offici al source of New York State immunization information.

Infants born to teenage mothers (age 15-17 years) are at higher risk of prematurity and low birth weight, neonatal mortality, and sudden infant death syndrome compared to infants born to mothers in their twenties and thirties. Teen motherhood also reduces a woman's opportunities in both her education and employment. The national and New York State objectives focus on teenage pregnancies rather than on birth to teenage mothers. It is estimated that up to 50% of teenage pregnancies result in fetal loss or induced abortion. The rate of teenage pregnancies in the U.S. has shown a decline of 34% since 1991, only in 2005-2006 a slight increase. A large proportion of the decline occurred in 1995-1996. Annual pregnancy data show that most of the decline occurred in the middle of the first decade, similar to nati onal data. However, the later part of the decade show relatively little improvement in the rate of teenage pregna ncies. In the second decade, so far we have witnessed an increase in teen pregnancies, albeit an inconsistent one. The Capital District, over the past decade and a half, has had a decline in births to teenage mother s in each of the three counties. Lower income urban zip codes between 2001and 2005, however, experience birth to teenagers approaching twice the county average in Rensselaer County, and over 3.5 times the county average in parts of Albany and Schenectady counties. For the most part, these rates declined over the period. Given the complexity of risk factors; cultural, psycholog-ical, socio-economic, etc., the issue of teen pregnancy appears to be an issue that requires basic societal changes before interventions have meaningful effect.

Lead poisoning is a public health problem that is totally pr eventable. Lead is a heavy me tal that was used in many products and materials before the risk to young children was identified. Some products contained lead and were used before the danger was recognized, like pa ints used in older houses before 1978. Many products that can be hazardous still remain. Lead can be spread widely by air, water, soil, or dust and ingested through swallowing or breathing. This can be ex tremely dangerous, especially for children and can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, mental retardati on, etc. Children under the age of 6, but particularly children living at or below the poverty line in older housing are at risk. Because lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious sympto ms, it is crucial to test children for blood lead levels before they are harmed. The percent of children with at least one lead screening by age 36 months in both the Capital District and New York State is below the Prevention Agenda objective. Schenectady County has the highest percentage of children with at least one lead screening compared to Albany and Rensselaer counties. As lead poisoning is completely preventable, it deserves a coordinated response to reach all affected residents. New York State Public Health Law requires all health care providers to test blood lead levels for all children at ages 1 and 2. Health care providers are also required to assess lead exposure annually for children 6 months to 6 years of age. Providers are required to distribute guidance material on lead poisoning prevention, risk reduction and nutritional counseling to parents or caregivers of children under 6.

Oral health disease can affect a person's ability to eat , how they look, the way they communicate, and for children, their ability to learn and succeed in school. In 2002, the New York State Depart ment of Health conducted a survey of the oral health of 3rd graders. The following chart shows the percent of children in the Capita l District who had dental health insurance coverage, caries experienced, untreated caries, and molar sealants. A large percentage of the children had insurance coverage including those children at or below the poverty level, yet the oral health indicators show that the children at or below the poverty level had poorer outcomes. It can be assumed that th e insurance coverage that most of these children had is Medicaid. This further supports the need for increased access for dental health services for uninsured children and those with Medicaid. The prevalence of tooth decay in 3 rd Grade children in NYS was found to be 54%; just over the national average. Local counties demonstrated a lower percentage of d ecay when children of all socioeconomic levels are considered, however low income child ren suffer untreated dental disease at nearly twice the percentage of children from higher income families. In 2000, the Surgeon General issued a report, \"Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General\". This report stated that there are profound and consequential disp arities in the oral health of the citizens of the United States. The reason for the disparities ar e complex and include, but are not lim ited to, socioeconomic factors, lack of community programs such as fluoridated water supplies, barriers to accessing oral health care, lack of resources to pay for oral health care, and the lack of public unde rstanding and awareness of the importance of oral health care. 2002 Oral Health Data on 3rd Gr ade Children by Economic Status 0102030405060708090100 Insurance - Alb Insurance - Rens Insurance - Experienced Untreated Molar Sealants (1 or More) - Alb Molar Sealants (1 or More) - Rens Molar Sealants (1 or More) - Schen P overt y Level > P overt y Level Community Health Profile - 2009 34 The Seal A Smile School Based Oral Health Program serves lower-income schools in Albany and Rensselaer counties. A similar program operates in the Schenectady City School District. In Albany and Rensselaer counties, untreated decay was found in the mouths of 50% of the nearly 6,000 children seen from 2006 to 2008. On average, 3.5 untreated cavities were found per child. Eigh t percent (8%) of children seen had significant dental problems requiring urgent dental care, including pain or active infection. Dental caries are completely preventable. The difficulty continues to be the low priority often placed on oral health and inadequate access to dental care, especially fo r low income children. The Surgeon General reports that dental sealants have been shown to reduce decay by mo re than 70%. Children from higher income families are twice as likely to have sealants as lower income children In the Counties of Albany, Schenectady and Rensselaer, th ere are four hospital-based dental programs, one county health department clinic (Albany County), and two fe derally qualified health centers serving as the primary providers for all dental care for the publicly insured, uninsured, and underinsured. School-based dental programs such as the Seal A Smile School Based Oral Health Progr am, St Peter's Ronald McD onald Care Mobile program and Schenectady's Hometown Health provide dental servi ces to children with Medicaid and Child Health Plus as well as uninsured children in the Capital District. These programs are making significant progress providing needed services. Seal A Smile serves 32% of the 10,221 children attending the 30 schools and 6 Head St art Programs in Albany and Rensselaer counties. The Hometown Health program assists 53% of the 7,759 stude nts attending schools in Schenectady. The St. Peter's program provides care to a much smaller portion of the student population but addresses an important weakness of the other two programs. St. Peter's provides rest orative services while the other two programs do not. Families not able to secure restorative care needed may be one of the reasons that untreated cavity rates have not subsided significantly while sealant rates have increased dram atically. In the first year of Seal A Smile, 4% of the children seen had sealants while in the 2008-2009 academ ic year over 30% had sealants on their teeth. Even with the expansion of school-based programs, poor a nd uninsured residents of the Capital District area do not have adequate access to dental h ealth care. Only 16 of 490 dentists in the tri-county region accept Medicaid patients. Many of these do not serve children. Ev en those who accept Medicaid often limit the number of individuals on Medicaid to whom they will provide services.

Physical Activity/Nutrition Adult Obesity, Childhood Obesity, Physical Activity Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, reduce the percent age of adult New Yorkers who are obese to no more than 15.0% By the year 2013, reduce the percentage of New York children who are overweight or obese so that: o The percentage of children (ages 2-4 years) enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) who are obese is no more than 11.6% o The percentage of children ages 6-11 and 12-19 years who are obese is no more then 5% By the year 2013, increase the per centage of adult New Yorkers who engage in some type of leisure time physical activity to at least 80% Adult Obesity Major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are related to poor diet and physical inactivity. Ranges of weight that are greater than what is generally considered healthy for a given height is defined by two terms: overweight and obese. For adults, obesity ranges are determined by using weight and height to calculate a number called the \"body mass index\" (BMI). An adult who has a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight and if BMI is 30 or higher than an adult is considered obese. Obesity is caused by complex interaction of genetic, metabolic, behavioral, social and environmental factors. Obesity is associated with adverse health, social and economic consequences. It is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes and a major contributing factor to heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and a number of psychological conditions, including depressi on. More than 80% of persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. The percentage of obese adults in New York State more than doubled from 10% in 1997 to 25% in 2008 and, nationally, obesity among children and adolescents has trip led over the past three decades. The percentage of obese adults in three Capital District counties and New York State exceeds the Prevention Agenda objective. For the e-BRFSS survey sample, Albany County had consid erably fewer obese respondents than the other two counties, but rates for all counties are likely under-repor ted as self-reported height and weight data has been demonstrated to be lower than measured data in approximately 50% of all cases. Childhood Obesity Increasing obesity rates are significantly reducing the life e xpectancy of children and adolescents in the U.S. and New York compared to their parents. The prevalence of obesity among children and teenagers in the U.S. has tripled in the past 20 to 30 years among children, aged 6-19 years, and doubled among preschool children, aged 2- 5 years. For children and teens, BMI percentile ranges above a normal weight have diffe rent labels (at risk of overweight and overweight). Additionally, BMI ranges for children and teens are defined so that they take into account normal differences in body fat between boys and gi rls and differences in body fat at various ages. Obesity, Adults BMI > 30 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives* * NYS Department of Health Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Community Health Profile - 2009 36 For preschool-age children in New York, data are only available for children from low- income families enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). The prevalence of obesity among this group of children is around 14% for all three Capital District counties, below the New York State rate, but significantly above the Prevention Agenda objective. As with adults, minority youth are disproportionately overweight and obese. The rate of obesity was highest for black teens, followed by Hisp anic teens and white teens. Close to 20% of Hispanic teens and black teens are overweight compared to 13% of white youth (YRBSS). The Prevalence of overweight preschool-age children in New York aged 2 to 5, is highest among Hispanics, lowest for whites and in between for blacks. Physical Activity Physical inactivity is significant factor leading to over weight and obesity among children and adults. Rates of having no leisure-time physical activity are higher among women, older adults, those with lower educational attainment, and ethnic minority populations, particularly blacks and Hispanics. For the participants in the e-BRFSS, the percentage of adults engaged in some type of leisure time physical activity in the Capital District is comparable and basically consistent with the Prevention Agenda objective. All three Capital District counties exceed the New York State rate of leisure time physical activity.

Healthy eating is essential for wellbeing. In the U.S., the average daily calor ic consumption has been increasing over the past 20-30 years, the same period in which obesity doubled among adults. Men are consuming, on average, an additional 168 to 268 calor ies day, and women an additional 143 to 335 calories per day. Trends that contributed to increased calorie consumption over this 30-year period include increased consumption of food outside of home, particularly fast food, larger portion sizes, increased intake of sweetened beverages, etc. Fruits and vegetable consumption reduces risk of ch ronic diseases including cancers, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines reco mmend increased amounts of fruits and vegetables for Americans 2 years and older (USDA, 2005). Four and one half cups (i.e. nine servings) of fruits and vegetables are recommended daily. Despite long-standing recommendations, a bout 27% of adults in New York State, and nearly 23% of the U.S. residents report consuming less than the minimum five ser ving daily. This rate is much less than the Prevention Agenda objective of 33%. The percentage of residents in the e-BRFSS sample consuming 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day is highest in Schenectady County, where 37.0% of 301 adults self-reported having fru its and vegetables five or more times a day. Both Albany County (20.4%) and Rensselaer County (24.7%) had considerably fewer adults eating at least the recommended number of servings. Until additional data is collected, the scale of the Schenectady County discrepancy with the other counties in the region and the state is difficult to in terpret as reflective of some community characteristics or an artifact of the sample selected. According to self-reports from the e-BRFSS data, women's consumption of 5 or more ser ving of fruits and vegetables per day is 11% to 18% higher than for men. Consumption of 5 or More Servings of Fruits & Vegetables per Day Among Adults 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives* 33.0% * NYS Department of Health Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Community Health Profile - 2009 38 Breastfeeding Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, increase the proportion of New York mothers who breastfeed their babies at 6 months to at least 50%. In regards to healthy eating for infants, breastfeeding is the gold standard. Breastfeeding is essential for the optimal growth and development of children. Human milk provides a mix of micronutrients that uniquely meets the nutritional needs of human infants. Breastfeeding signi ficantly reduces the infant's risk of infections, from diarrhea and colds to meningitis and other serious inf ections, as breast milk provides antibodies, immune cells, and other anti-infective components. Infants who are breast fed exclusively for 6 months or more usually have fewer medical office visits, receiv e fewer procedures, need fewer me dications, and experience fewer hospitalizations. In addition to these s hort-term benefits, it is demonstrated that breast milk protects the infant against a growing list of chronic diseases, including car diovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. There is increasing evidence that breastfeeding also reduces the infant's risk of childhood and adult obesity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclus ive breastfeeding for 4-6 months (2004), while the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. About 24% of women in the U.S. and 38% in New York self-report any breastfeeding at six months, which is well below the Prevention Agenda objective. For the Capital District counties, Albany County has the highest percentage of self-reported cases of mothers breastfeeding at six months. The rate of Capital District Women, Infant, and Children Program (WIC) mothers breastfeeding at six months is markedly lower compared to the statewide rate. According to the 2005 Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance in New York, the percentage of mothers who breastfeed at least six months is highest among Hispanics (47%), followed by American Indian/Alaskan Native (42%), Asian/ Pacific Islanders have the lowest percentage (35.5%) of mothers' breastfeeding reports at least 6 months.

Unintentional Injury Unintentional Injury Prevention Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, reduce the age-adjust ed unintentional injury hospitalization rate and mortality rate in New York so that: o Age-adjusted unintentional injury-relat ed hospitalization rate is no more than 44.5 per 10,000. o Age-adjusted unintentional injury-relat ed mortality rate is no more than 17.1 per 100,000. Overall Injuries are classified by the external cause and by the injury diagnosis: external cause includes both intent (e.g. unintentional, suicide, homicide) and mechanism (e.g., mo tor vehicle, firearms, poisoning, suffocation and falls); injury diagnoses include both the nature of the injury (e .g. fracture, internal injury, open wound) and the body region of the injury (e.g. head, chest, extremity). Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death for Am ericans in every age, race, gender, and economic group. For all U.S. resident deaths in 2006, unintentional injuries ranked as the fifth leading cause of death and are even more common for young people. The CDC reported that in 2003, more than 27 million people had nonfatal unintentional injuries were serious enough to require a visit to an emergency department. Se rious injuries have long term impacts on the emotional, physical, and economic well being of people and their famili es. If the injured are disabled, these impacts can last a lifetime. Capital District counties have slightly higher mortality ra tes for unintentional injuries than New York State, but well below the national rate. While Albany County uninten tional injury hospitalizations are somewhat lower than the New York rate, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties ex ceed the state rate. The Capital District has, however, a much higher prevalence of unintentional injuries than the Prevention Agenda.

Community Health Profile - 2009 40 Ages 0-14 Years Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for children under 14 years of age and are the cause of hospitalizations for many young children. The Capital District has considerably reduced unintentional injuries since 1995, although each county's experience remains slightly higher than the United States rate. This dec line appears to be tapering off, however. Albany and Rensselaer Counties continued to see a decline in injury rates from the 2001-2005 to the 1996-2000 period, while Schenectady experienced a slight increase. Boys are much more likely to experience unintentional injuries than females. Black male rates are a bit higher than whites, but non-white/Hispanic/black males have the highest incidence by far. Unintentional injury rates are higher in the Capital District than for the rest of the state. Ages 15-24 Years Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults in the Capital District. The largest source of unintentional injuries and deaths in this age group is motor vehicle crashes, a trend seen nationwide. Young people ages 15-24 represent only 14% of the U. S. population. However, they account for 30% ($19 billion) of the total costs of motor vehicle injuries am ong males and 28% ($7 billion) of the total costs of motor vehicle injuries among females . Other causes of unintentional injuries among this age group include sports injuries (often from falls), being struck by an object (such as a baseball), poisonings and injuries from sharp instruments such as knives. In the Capital District, this age group has shown a significant decline in unintentional injury rates from the 1991-1995 period. During the 1996-2000 time period, Albany County declined by 41% from the preceding 5 year period, and both Rensselaer and Schenectady declined by 28%. Compared to the preceding 5 year period, the 2001-2005 time period hospitalization rates remained almost the same for Rensselaer County, increased in Albany County and Schenectady County showed some decline.

Although black males were showing a decline nearly matching white males around 1996/1997, after 1998, this group again has shown an increase in unintentio nal injuries. During the 2001-2005 period, both black and white males in the 15-24 year age group did not show any significant difference in hospitalization rates in the Capital District.

More than one third of adults 65 and older fall each year in the United States. Every 18 seconds, an older adult is treated in an emergency department for a fall, and every 35 minutes someone in this population dies as a result of their injuries. Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five times more often than they are for injuries from other causes. The overall rate of ho spitalizations due to unintentional injuries h as increased in each of the three counties in the Capital District. When seniors fall, the health conse quences can be serious; sometimes the u ltimate result is death. Of those who fall, 20% to 30% suffer moderate to severe injuries su ch as fractures, bruises, head traumas, which can increase the risk of early death and make it hard to live independe ntly. Falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injury. Developing a fear of falling is common among people who fall, even among those who are not injured. This fear causes them to limit activities, reduce mobility which actually increases their actual risk of falling. Hospitalizations from the 1996-2000 period were sim ilar to the 1991-1995 period; however deaths from unintentional injuries increased by 31%. The number of hos pitalizations continues to increase slightly, while the number of deaths due to unintentional in juries is trending upward marginally. Whites had a greater rate of hospitalizations compared with blacks during the 1996-2000 time period. It should also be noted that the rates of hospitalization of fema les were over 60% higher than those of males during this period and more than 70 % higher during the 2001-2005 period. This is likely because of the effects of osteoporosis and the higher median age for women. The increased risk of falls and serious injury among seniors may be a result of the increased use of medications that impair perception, diseases that impact balance (e.g. vertigo) and physiological changes associated with aging. Chronic disease processes, such as osteoporosis, also place seniors (especially women) at a higher risk of breaking bones during a fall. An aging senior population in the Capital District may be another reason for the increases seen. The most common location where the elderly experience serious falls is in the home. There may be several reasons for this. Seniors prone to falling may stay home more. Also, there may be more hazards in homes than in public places. Finally, if no help is available, seniors may attempt to push their phys ical limits to continue living in their homes.

By the year 2013, reduce the pedestrian in jury hospitalization rate in New York to no more than 1.5 per 10,000 Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for persons 1 to 34 years of age and the leading cause of death from injury for all ages in the United States. Moto r vehicle-related injuries kill more children and young adults than any other single cause in the United States. Mo re than 41,000 people in the United States die in motor vehicle crashes each year, and crash in juries result in about 500,000 hospita lizations and four million emergency department visits annually. Motor vehicle injuries cause death, trauma, impairment, huge medical costs, higher insurance premiums, productivity loss at work, financial and other costs to individuals, their families, communities, and society as a whole. The economic burden of motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries is also tremendous, costing the United States more than $150 billion each year. Prevalence of motor vehicle related mortality in the Capital District and in New York State exceeds the statewide rate and the Prevention Agenda objective. Rensselaer County has the highest rate of motor vehicle related mortality compared to other Capital District counties. In the Capital District, as with the rest of the state, men were significantly more likely to die in motor vehicle related accidents, between the years of 2001-2005, than wo men. This difference is principally due to the higher mortality rates of white men, since black men experience about the same mortality rates in the region as women. Young adults and seniors are the most at risk age groups for motor vehicle related fatalities. Two out of five deaths among U.S. teens result from motor vehicle crashes. Per mile driven, teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are four times more likely than older drivers to crash. Senior drivers have the second highest motor vehicle mortality rate. In the Capital District, the motor vehicle mortality rate is 20.8 per 100,000 for individuals 15 to 34, only slightly higher than the 19.5 for seniors ages 65 or older. The slight rate difference represents a 32 person difference in fatalities. Motor vehicle fatalities are not a leading cause of death for seniors, but they are a high risk age group partly due to older drivers being more likely to die from motor vehicle accidents than younger drivers. People not driving a motor vehicle are at great risk as well. Pedestrian motor vehicle crash deaths account for 11 percent of crash deaths.

Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among older adults and the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. More than one third of adults 65 and older fall each year in the United States. Every 18 seconds, an older adult is treated in an emergenc y department for a fall, and one of these individuals dies as a result of their injuries every 35 minutes. Older adults are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five times more often than they are for injuries from other causes. Unintentional falls are a serious thr eat to the lives, independence and wellb eing of adults ages 65 and older. Of those who fall, 20% to 30% suffer moderate to severe in juries such as fractures, bruises, head traumas, which can increase the risk of early death and make it difficult to live independently. Falls are the most common cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). In 2000, TBI acc ounted for 46% of fatal falls among older adults. Hip fractures are the most frequent type of fall-related fractures. Developing a fear of falling is common among people who fall, even among those who are not injured. This fear causes them to limit activities, reducing mobility, which actually increases their risk of falling. In New York State fall-rela ted injuries are the leading cause of injury hospitalizations among older adults. In addition to the consequence of serious injuries, falls have a heavy financial burden, with a yearly cost of $1.3 billion in New York State for hospitalizations alone. The prevalence of fall related hospitalizations among older a dults in the Capital District and New York State are significantly above the Prevention Agenda objective. Schen ectady County has the highest rate of hospitalizations compared to Albany and Rensselaer counties, but a ll three counties are well above the statewide rate. The age adjusted fall mortality rates for years 2001-2005 are below the Prevention Agenda objective and below the New York State rate, exclusive of NYC, except for Schenectady County. The number of people reflected in these rates is quite small, less than 60, making the rates somewhat unstable fo r sub-populations, but higher mortality rates due to falls are seen in men and to a lesser extent, blacks. In general, men have higher risk to die from a fall than women. After adjusting for age, the fall fatality rate in 2004 was 49% higher for men than for women (CDC 2005). While New York State and Schenectady County held to this pattern, Rensselaer County had nine times as many men die from falls from 2001-2005 as women and Albany County had more women die from falls. This could be less of a pattern as a there being a small number of people who die from falls locally. Falls Hospitalization Age 65+* 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives 155.0 New York State excl.

Residents who are not black, white or Hi spanic are dramatically more likely to be hospitalized for falls throughout the state and region. The risk of being seriously injured in a fall increases with age. In 2001, the rates of fall injuries for adults 85 and older were four to five times that of adults 65 to 74. Nearly 85% of deaths from falls in 2004 were among people 75 and older (CDC 2006). People 75 and olde r who fall are four to five times more likely to be admitted to a long- term care facility for a year or longer. Although one in three older adults falls each year in the Un ited States, falls are not an inevitable part of aging. There are proven strategies that can reduce falls and help older adults live better and longer.

It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but is prevalent in adults as well. In most cases, the causes of asthma are not known. Nationwide, 9.1% of children, that is about 6.7 million, currently have asthma. An asthma attack is a distressing and potentially life-threatening experience. If poorly treated, asthma can lead to persistent hospitalization and death. Asthma is the third ranking cause of hospitalization in children under the age of 15 years. The estimated cost of treating asthma in those younger than 18 years of age is $3.2 billion per year There has been a sharp increase in asthma prevalence from 1980 to 1996 nationwide. This increase was seen in every age group. However, si nce 1996 there has not been a significant change. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately higher among children and minorities. Although the rate of asthma deaths increased during 1980-1995, the rate of deaths has decreased each year since 2000. The significant reduction in asthma hospitalizations for children 14 and under in the Capital District during the 2001-2005 period points to physicians and their patients getting a better handle on the use of maintenance medications for asthmatic children to reduce the occurrence of asthmatic attacks. Boys, however, persist in having a greater likelihood than girls of needing hospital services to treat their asthma. Individuals with asthma generally can reduce their need for medical intervention by avoiding known triggers and by adhering to the use of medications that prevent asthma attacks.

Each year, approximately 6,000 employees in this country die from workplace injuries while another 50,000 die from illnesses caused by exposure to workplace hazards. In addition, 6 million wo rkers suffer non-fatal workplace injuries at an annual cost to U.S. businesses of more than $125 billion. Injuries at work have significant direct and indirect c onsequences. Direct consequences are mostly damage that victim faces right after injury, like personal pain and su ffering, loss of income and capacity to participate in activities of daily living. In many cases, the employee is im paired for life and cannot carry out the previous work. Often accident victims face indirect mental health damages after an injury. The top causes of work-related injury hospitalizations in New York State between 2003 and 2005 are accidents caused by fire, falls, motor vehicle traffic accidents, medical complications and late effects of accidents such as musculoskeletal diseases. Occupational fatalities and losses arising from workplace disabilities cause tremendous personal and economic costs. There were over 700,000 work-related injuries and illnesses in New York State between 2003 and 2005. The most severe of which resulted in over 40,000 hospitalizations and over 700 deaths. New York State Workers' Compensation paid out more than 9 billion dollars in claims during the period. 3 According to New York State Department of Health, the top five industries for work-related injuries and illnesses are: health care, transportation, retail trade, manufacturi ng and construction. As to the seriousness of the injuries, the construction industry has the highest prevalence of work-related fatalities, followed by transportation, professional/business industries, retail trade and leisure/ hospitality. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the rate of fatal occupational injuries among self-employed wo rkers is twice the national average for all workers. In addition, there is growing evidence th at temporary workers are at higher risk for work-related injury, illness, and death. The prevalence of work related hospitalizations for the Capital District and New York State exceeds the Prevention Agenda objective but is generally below the statewide rate.

Although considerable progress has been made in reducing blood lead levels (BLLs), lead poisoning, which can adversely affect vital organs and the brain, remains a preventable environmental health problem. Lead poisoning occurs in all population groups; however, the risk is hist orically higher for persons having low income, living in older housing, and belonging to certain racial and ethnic groups. Workers can be exposed to lead by creating dust or fumes during everyday work activities. Fumes are easier to breathe in and therefore may be more dangerous than dust. It can cause adverse health outcomes among workers and can be manifested by the following symptoms: headaches, tiredness, muscle and joint pain, memory problems, etc. The elevated BLL rate for employed persons in the Capital District counties and New York State are far beyond the Prevention Agenda goal. Schenectady County has the highest incidence of elevated BLL that is more than five times higher than Albany County rate and almost twice the Rensselaer County rate. Reduction in lead poisoning over time can be addressed by identifying persons at risk, conducting professional and public education campaigns, implementing broad-based screening measures to find those at risk and ensure that they receive preventive interventions, and continuing effective community efforts to clean up problem areas, namely, substandard housing units.

Chronic Disease Diabetes Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, reduce the prevalence of adult diabetes and hospital complications of diabetes in New York so that: o The percent of adults with diabetes is no more than 5.7%. o The rate of hospitalizations for short-term complications of diabetes are no more than: 2.3 per 10,000 (ages 6-17) and 3.9 per 10,000 (ages 18+) Diabetes is a serious public health concern. Nearly 24 million people in the United States have diabetes, almost 8 percent of the population. Another 57 million people are estim ated to be at risk of diabetes, commonly referred to as pre-diabetics. Diabetes is a group of diseases marked by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. There are two major type of diabetes: Type I and type II. Type II diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. This type of diabetes has become more prevalent in the United States, particularly among minorities. According to recent studies, type II diabetes, formerly called \"adult\" diabetes, is being seen with alarming frequency among children. Diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association, cost the 21 st Congressional District $400 million in 2006. These costs could be considerably reduced and important personal benefits realized by diabetics choosing to make some lifestyle changes. The prevalence of diabetes among adults in Albany and Schenectady counties is slightly below the statewide rate and but still exceeds the Prevention Agenda objective. Adults in Rensselaer County have the highest prevalence of diabet es in the region, exceeding the state and national averages. Short-term diabetes complications have increased at an alarming rate in the Capital District. Compared to 1996-2000 hospitalization rates, 2001-2005 diabetes hospitalizations are up 24%, for Albany County, to 30% in Rensselaer County. The rates are somewhat higher for men than for women in each county. Short-term complications of diabetes are a result of extreme fluctuation in blood sugar levels. They include: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome (high blood sugar) a nd Diabetic ketoacidosis (increased blood acids). These short term complications require emergency care. The prevalence of diabetes hospitalizations due to short-term co mplications in the Capital District exceeds the Prevention Agenda and statewide rates for the group of residents ages 6-17 and over 18. For both age groups, Albany County has the highest rates of hospitalizations due to diabetes short-te rm complications, compared to the other two counties.

Serious complications can arise if diabetes is not controlled by careful adherence to medical management and proper dietary modification. Complications of uncontrolle d diabetes include heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease, nervous system di sease, amputations, dental disease, complications of pregnancy, etc. The prevalence of hospitalization due to both short and long term complications of diabetes, as well as all diabetes admissions was highest in Albany County compared to other two counties for the years of 2005-2006. When diabetes is the primary diagnosis, as well as when diabetes is any part of a hospitalization diagnosis, Capital District rates are relatively close to New York State rates, excluding New York City. Whites and blacks across the Capital District ages 15-44 are on average have about a 20% higher prevalence of primary diabetes diagnoses than the rest of the state. But both the primary diabetes diagnoses and any diabetes diagnoses are dramatically higher than state rates when non-white/black/Hispanic residents are included in the rates. Diabetes hospitalizations for this population are 6-7 times higher than for blacks and 18-22 times higher than for whites. Similar to patterns seen nationally, in the Capital District the age-adjusted rate of diabetes deaths has increased from the 1991- 1995 to the 2001-2005 periods in each of the three counties. Age adjusted diabetes mortality rates for 2001-2005 were twice as high for blacks as for whites and somewhat higher for men than for women. While complications from diabetes contribute to many premature deaths, most death certificates do not list diabetes as the underlying cause of death, thus the actual number of deaths related to diabetes is underestimated.

Residents of New York State are 29% more likely to die from coronary h eart disease than the next leading cause of death. It is estimated that more than 1 million Americans will have a new or recurrent coronary attack, and about one- third of them will die. Every 29 seconds, an American will suffer a coronary event, and about every minute someone will die from one. Each year more than 250,000 people will die of CHD within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms and before they reach a hospital. Almost 14 million people have a history of heart disease. Coronary heart disease is a disorder that affects the heart muscle and the blood vessels. The most serious danger of coronary heart disease is a heart attack, which occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is greatly reduced or stopped due to a blockage in a coronary artery. Studies among coronary heart disease patients have shown that 90% have prior exposure to at least 1 of these heart disease risk factors: high blood cholesterol or taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, high blood pressure or taking blood pressure- lowering drugs, current cigarette use, or a clinical report of diabetes. The impact of cardiovascular disease is overwhelming. A bout 950,000 Americans die each year and 61 million, or one quarter of the population, live with the disease. One in five people in the United States has some type of cardiovascular disease. These diseases take more lives than the next five leading causes of death combined (cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, in juries, diabetes and influenza/pneumonia). While coronary heart disease has declined consistently since in 1960's, recently this decline has been more pronounced among males than females and whites than bl acks. From 1994 to 2004 the death rate from coronary heart disease declined 33%. Within the Capital District, age-ad justed heart disease mortality rates remain a leading cause of death. Comparisons between the coronary heart disease mort ality rate in the Capital District, from 1991-1995 and mortality from 1996-2000 show a decline in every county, however, all counties continue to have age-adjusted death rates above the Healthy People 2010 goal. From 1991-1995 to 1996-2000, Albany County shows a 16% reduction, Rensselaer County shows a 24% reduction, and Schenectady County show ed a 16% reduction in heart disease mortality rates. These declines were present among both males and females in each age group. In 2001-2005 three counties show a decrease in the mortality rate. During this period, men were approximate ly 50% more likely to die from coronary heart disease as women. Blacks were more likely than whites to die from coronary heart disease, except in Rensselaer County Coronary Heart Disease Deaths* Total District 7,172 3,303 3,869 * NYS Department of Health Vital Statistics Community Health Profile - 2009 54 where the small number of blacks affected resulted in whites having higher mortality rates. Albany County had the highest mortality rates, 10% above the State, excluding New York City rate. The hospitalization rates for coronary heart disease hospitalizations have been declining between 2001 and 2005 throughout the Capital District, with the pattern of Albany County having lower rates than the other two counties holding throughout the period. Fortunately, the risk of developing coronary heart disease can be reduced by altering behaviors and increasing access to medical care A heart-healthy lifestyle includes eating a diet low in fat, maintaining a healthy weight , living smoke-free and keeping physically active. Routine screening for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol accelerate iden tification and treatment of these conditions. Early identification can help minimize the damage that these conditions cause the blood vessels and heart. Accessing medical care quickly when symptoms of a hear t attack occur also reduces death from coronary heart disease. Community interventions can make a difference. Even small changes in these risk factors could prevent many premature deaths.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a specific category of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), like coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). In contrast to these two diseases, c ongestive heart failure is not one of the leading causes of death in the st ate. However, it is one of the fastes t growing subgroups of CVD, making it a cause for concern and attention. Congestive heart failure accounts for 2% of all deaths in New York State and 4% of all CVD deaths. However, it has been increasing over the last 20 years. Congestive heart failure is a disorder where the heart loses its ability to pum p blood efficiently, causing fatigue and shortness of breath. Congestive heart failure is not a single disease but the end stage of many different forms of heart diseases. The most common of these is coronary artery disease that develops when the coronary arteries are blocked. In addition to coronary artery disease, hype rtension or high blood pressure, and diabetes are the most common causes of heart failure. About 7 in 10 people with heart failure have high blood pressure before being diagnosed. About 22 percent of men and 46 percent of wome n will develop heart failure within 6 years of having a heart attack. Despite its low share among CVD deaths, around 5 million pe ople in the United States have heart failure. About 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and more than 287,000 people die every year of this condition. The prevalence of congestive heart failure hospitaliza tions in the Capital District and New York State significantly exceeds the Prevention Agenda objective. For the period of 2004-2006, all three counties were above the statewide rate, with Albany County twice the State rate. Heart failure is the most common reason for hospitali zation among people on Medicare and is higher for Black than White individuals for this type of care. The prevalence of congestive heart failure is also linked to income, resulting in higher rates among people with lower socio-economic status. Women have a 15% higher hospitalization rate than men in New York State. Similar to cardiovascular disease, the number of deaths due to congestive heart failure incr eases dramatically with age. Historically, African Americans are 19% more likely than whites to die from congestive hear t failure before the age of seventy-five. Though the age-adjusted CHF mortality rate is higher for men, suggesting that men die from congestive heart failure at younger ages than women, the actual number of women dying from congestive heart failure is greater than men. The prevalence of congestive heart failure is found most often in the older segments of our population, and women constitute over 70% of the population aged 85 and older, resulting in women b earing the greatest burden from this condition. The quality of life and life expectancy of persons with h eart failure can be readily improved with early diagnosis and treatment.

Each year, more than 150,000 people in the United States die from stroke, making stroke the third leading cause of death. Stroke (Cerebrovascular disease) occurs when a blood vessel that brings oxygen and nutrients to the brain bursts or is clogged by a blood clot or some other particle. Because of this rupture or blockage, part of the brain does not get the blood and oxygen it needs. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected area of the brain can't work and die within minutes. The most important alterable risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure (systolic > 140 mm Hg), which causes about on e-fourth of all strokes. Other risk factors include cigarette smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol and use of oral contraceptives. Smoking doubles the risk of stroke and high blood pressure increases stroke risk by 4-6 times (National Stroke Association). In addition to fatal outcomes, stroke results in serious long-term disability, causing difficulty with functional limitations and daily activities. According to the American Heart Association, for 2008 direct and indirect costs for stroke is estimated to be $65.5 billion. Stroke mortality showed a sharp decline in the U.S. between 1970 and 1980 but has been leveling off since the 1980's. It again declined between 1999 and 2004; the decline is more for whites than blacks and greater for males than females. Mortalit y from stroke is on decline and by 2004 was 72% lower than it was in 1950. Unlike national trends, stroke mortality is comparable in blacks and whites in the Capital District as it is for males and females. Stroke hospitalizations patterns are more like the nation in that blacks experience higher levels of stroke hospitalization in the Capital District than whites and men are more likely to be hospitalized for stroke than women. Stroke death rates have declined in all three Capital District counties over the past 15 years generally, but particularly in 2001-2005 compared to 1996-2000.

Breast cancer is second leading cause of cancer death am ong women in the US, exceeded only by lung cancer. All women are at risk for breast cancer. Men can also get breast cancer, but this is rare. Behavioral risk factors amenable to change include ob esity after menopause, heavy consumption of alcohol and, possibly, high-fat diets and lack of exercise. Reproductive factors, including having a first child after age 30, and never having children, increases the risk of breast cancer. However, these identified risk factors do not explain the high frequency of the disease in the population. The fatality of invasive breast cancer is strongly influenced by the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Early detection of breast cancer plays significant role in reduction of breast cancer mortality. Data support that when breast cancer is diagnosed at an early, or localized, stage, 97% of women survive for five years. All three Capital District counties have age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates that are slightly higher than nati onal rates and the Prevention Agenda goal, but fluctuate around the New York State rate. The Capital District has shown an approxi mately 12% decrease in the rate of breast cancer among women when compar ing the time periods of 1991-1995 to 1996-2000. The most consistent decline in all three counties is among women aged 35-44. While breast cancer is more common among whites than blacks, blacks are more likely to die from their cancer. Behavioral risk factors amenable to change include obesity after menopause, heavy consumption of alcohol and, possibly, high-fat diets and lack of exercise. Reproductive factors, including having a first child after age 30, and never having children, increases the risk of breast ca ncer. However, these identified risk factors do not explain the high frequency of the disease in the population. Screening for breast cancer allows early identification and treatment and is the primary way of reducing mortality. It is recommended that all women perform monthly self-breast exams and have routine clinical breast exams. For women ages 40 and over, routine mammogr am tests (breast X-rays) are reco mmended every one to two years.

Cervical cancer deaths are nearly 100% preventable with early identification and appropriate treatment. Deaths from cervical cancer have been decreasing over the last several decades. This trend has occurred largely because of screening using the PAP test. This test can detect cervical cancer in situ , an early stage of cervical cancer, where the cells ar e changing in shape and organization but are still localized and pre-malignant. The rates of cervical cancer in the region hover around the Prevention Agenda objective. The total number of cervical cancer deaths in the Capital District is small making the rate unstable. Thus, the changes seen are very difficult to interpret. Several factors have been identified that place women at increased risk of developing cervical cancer. The strongest risk factor is unsafe sexual practices, including having multiple partners and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Interc ourse at a young age also increases the risk of cervical cancer. Anothe r factor associated with developing cervical cancer is cigarette smoking. CDC recommends routine administration of the HPV vaccine for girls 11 and 12 years of age. It is given in a series of three injections over a six-month period. The vaccine is also recommended for girls and women 13 through 26 years of age who did not receive it when they were younger.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer a nd second leading cause of cancer deaths (of cancers that effect both men and women). Ninety percent (90%) of new cancer cases are diagnosed in adults over 50. Routine screening can reduce the number of people who die from colorectal cancer by at least 60%. Cancers of the colon and rectum, taken together, are the third leading cause of non-skin cancer death for men (prostate and lung cancers) and women (cancer after breast and lung cancers). While there has been a steady decline in colorectal cancer deaths among whites, blacks in general have shown little change and Black males have shown increased mortality. The rate of colorectal cancers in the Capital District is slightly higher than the overall U.S. rate and they exceed the Prevention Agenda objective. However, each county has shown a decline in colo rectal cancer rates when comparing the rates for the 1991-1995 to the 1996-2000 tim e periods. Albany and Rensselaer both show an 8% decline in colorectal cancer. Schenectady shows a 9% decline. This trend of decline continued during the 2001-2005 period also. The declines are seen in both males and females in most age groups. Lifestyle factors that may contribute to increased risk of colorectal cancer include lack of regular physical activity, low fruit/vegetable intake, low-fiber and high-fat diet, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption and tobacco us.

The United States has seen a 4% decline in prostate cancer deat hs during 1992-2004. Comparing the time periods from 1991-1995 to 2001- 2005, the male-only age adjusted rate of prostate cancer increased for Rensselaer and Schenectady counties and did not experience much change in Albany County. The risk factors for prostate cancer are not well understood and it is not clear how to prevent the disease. The primary way of preventing premature death from prostate cancer may be through routine screening to detect the disease early in its development. The effectiveness of widespread screening for prostate cancer is presently uncertain. However most recent recommendations for prostate cancer screening state that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the ba lance of benefits and harms from prostate cancer screening in men younger than 75 years of age. Also, recent guidelines recommend against screening fo r prostate cancer in men age 75 years or older. Men with a family history of prostate cancer have double the risk of developing the disease, and more extensive screening tests for this subgroup may be helpful.

Infectious Disease Prevention HIV/AIDS Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 By the year 2013, reduce the newly diagnosed HIV case rate in New York to no more than 23.0 per 100,000. HIV stands for the human immunodeficiency virus that attacks the immune system and causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection. It is among the 10 leading causes of death in major age categories in New York State. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that approximately 1.1 million persons are living with HIV in the United States. More people become infected with HIV than die from th e disease each year. Prevalen ce is expected to increase due to the antiretroviral treatment that prolongs the lives of those who are infected. The opportunity for HIV transmission to others grows in parallel to HIV prev alence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently estimates that approximately one in five persons living with HIV in th e US is unaware of their infection and may be unknowingly transmitting the virus to others. Research has show n that the majority of people who know they are infected take steps to prevent tr ansmission to their partners. It is vital to identify new cases in order to control the epidemic and accurately me asure the HIV prevention effo rts and their effectiveness. New York State has 6.4% of the nation's population, but 16.1% of all persons living with AIDS, the highest percentage of any state. New York's AIDS case rate of 24.9 per 100,000 is double the U.S. average of 12.5 per 100,000. The epidemic affects persons of color in this st ate in a dramatic and disproportionate way - 78.1% of persons living with HIV and AIDS ar e persons of color; 44.8% black; 30. 4% Hispanic; 1.1% than one percent Native Am erican (confirmed cases through December 2007). New York State has both urban and rural epidemics. Ev en if New York City cases were excluded, New York State ranks 5th among all states in cumulative AIDS cases and 7th in terms of persons living with AIDS cases nationally. The prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV cases is lower for the Capital District than the State rate and Prevention Agenda objective. While the prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV in the Capital District is lower than the State rate, it is significantly higher than the 10.2 persons per 100,000 New York State exclusive of NYC rate for both Schenectady and Albany counties. AIDS prevalence in Albany County is not as far ahead of the other counties in the region as Albany is with HIV cases. The prevalence of AIDS remains high in Albany and Schenectady counties compared to the State excluding NYC and Rensselaer County rat es. The Albany County AIDS mortality rate is disproportionately high, but that may be another reflecti on of the availability of services for persons with HIV and AIDS in Albany County which may have caused patients to locate close to the services. AIDS mortality rates have dropped considerably since earlier in the decade. The AIDS mortality rates in 2001- 2005 were 7 to 10 times higher than in 2004-2006. The difference was primarily due to rates for blacks and Hispanics which were elevated, although the number of individuals impacted was less than 10 in Rensselaer and Schenectady Counties. In general, men are much more likel y to die of AIDS than women, which is a pattern that Newly Diagnosed HIV and Prevalence Newly Diagnosed* Prevalence 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives 23.0 - New York 24.0 31.7 Albany 12.6 19.5 Rensselaer 8.6 9.7 Schenectady 13.9 11.3 * New York State AIDS Case Surveillance Registry, 2004- 2006 rate per 100,000 http://www.health.s tate.ny.us/statistics/diseases/ communicable/2007/rates/2.htm rate per 10,000 Healthy Capital District Initiative 63 holds in Albany and Schenectady, but is inverted in Rensselaer County. Again, the number of people impacted is so small in Rensselaer County that this population rate is highly unstable. According to CDC, which has developed new estimates of HIV prevalence, gay and bisexual men of all races, African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinos are the most heavily affected by HIV 11. Estimates of new HIV infections in 2006 show that African Americans are 7.5 times more likely to be newly infected as are whites, with 105 new infections per 100, 000 people as compared with 14. Hispanics are also more likely than whites to acquire new HIV infections, with an estimated 70 Hispanics newly infected per 100,000 residents. In 2006, almost three quarters of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescent and adults in the US were for males. The largest estimated proportion of HIV/AIDS diagnoses were for men who have sex with men, followed by persons infected through high-risk heterosexual contact. There are various subpopulations that, becau se of their particular condition, situation, or activity, may be at risk of or infected by HIV: persons with transgender experien ce, inmates, individuals with one or more disabilities, mentally ill chemical abusers, homeless individuals, immi grants, migrants and seasonal workers, alcohol and drug users.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in New York State. Gonorrhea is an infection that is spread through sexual c ontact with another person. The bacteria are found in the mucous areas of the body. Early detection and appropriate treatment is important. If gonorrhea is left untreated, it will lead to complications such as infertility, pelvic inflamma tory disease, and ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a painful condition that occurs when the infection spreads throughout the reprodu ctive organs can lead to sterility in women. Men may suffer from swelling of the reproduc tive organs. Both sexes may suffer from arthritis, skin problems and other organ infections caused by the spread of gonorrhea within the body. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to have a significant impact on the health, safety and welfare of citizens of New York State. As in prior years, STDs are the leading category of reported communicable diseases in the State. The 90,777 cases reported in 2006 comprise 72 percent of all communicable diseases reported statewide. In 2006, 17,459 cases of gonorrhea were reported statewide; 10,299 in NYC and 7,160 in the rest of the state. Gonorrhea is highly prevalent throughout the Capital District, far exceeding the Prevention Agenda objective. Gonorrhea rates for 2007 in all three counties exceed the Ne w York State rate of 66.6 and have been increasing over the past three years. Any sexually active person can be infected with gonorrh ea. Most often, gonorrhea is found in younger people, ages 15-30, which have multiple sex partners. Gonorrhea is reported more frequently from urban areas than from rural areas. Sexually transmitted disease control pr ograms across New York State that conduct public health activities aim to: educate the public on safer sex behaviors; prevent the sp read of STDs through counseling and treatment of those infected; and provide health services to pa rtners of persons infected with STDs.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by the bite of an infected deer tick. If left untreated, the disease can cause negative health outcomes by effecting skin , nervous system, heart and/or joints. Early detection of the disease is very important, as patient s in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely. According to the National Institu tes of Health (NIH), studies have shown that most patients can be cured with a few weeks of antibiotics take n by mouth. Intravenous treatment with antibiotics may be necessary for more advanced patients with neurological or cardiac forms of illness. Patients diagnosed with later stages of disease may have persistent or recurrent symptoms and require longer treatment with antibiotics. Longer courses of antibiotics have been linked to serious complications, including death. Prevention and early diagnosis of Lyme disease are especially important in pregnant women. Lyme disease acquired during pregnancy may cause infection of the placenta and possible stillbirth. However, a mother receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment has not been linked to negative affects on the fetus. There are no reports of Lyme disease transmission from breast milk. New York State has the highest number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease in the United States . There have been about 72,000 cases confirmed in New York Stat e since the disease became reportable in 1986. Cases of Lyme disease have been increasing over the last 8 years in the Capital District . In Albany County, there were 21.5 cases of Lyme disease reported in 2001 and 18 9.4 cases identified in 2008. While Rensselaer County has had a fewer number of confirmed cases, their Lyme disease rate is even larger than Albany County. Schenectady County has not experienced the same scale of a problem. The statewide prevalence of Lyme disease has been relatively constant over the last 8 years. In New York State, the highest prevalence of Lyme disease has occurred in the Hudson Valley Region. The prevalence of Lyme disease in the Capital District significantly exceeds to the statewide rate - 175 per 100,000 for all three counties on average compared to 47.2 New York State for 2008. Lyme disease can affect people of any age. People who spend time in grassy and wooded environments are at an increased risk of exposure. Th e chances of being bitten by a deer tick are greater during times of the year when ticks are most active.

The percent of adults aged 65+ who ever had a pneumonia shot is at least 90%. Vaccines are used worldwide to protect against disease by inducing immunity . Immunization is a proven tool for controlling and even eradicating disease. It can avoid su ffering, disability and death caused by various infectious diseases. Immunization is particularly important for persons over age 65 that are at a higher risk for complications from flu including dying from the flu. An immunization campaign carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 1967 to 1977 eradicated the natural occurrence of smallpox. There are several vaccine preventable diseases and flu is among of them. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Influenza is not the common cold. It is serious condition: every year in the Untied States on average 5% to 20% of the population gets the flu; more than 226,000 Americans are hospitalized a nd 36,000 die from influenza-related complications. Flu caused by the influenza virus can cause serious complica tions: pneumonia, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes. Influenza viruses can cause disease among persons in an y age group, but rates of serious illness and death are highest among persons aged >65 years and this ag e group is mostly vulnerable to complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for over 250 million pe ople in the United States. That's 4 out of every 5 people. Influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic change, causing annual vaccination necessary against the influenza viruses forecasted to be in circulation that year for those recommended for vaccination. The prevalence of flu shots in the Capital District is below the Prevention Agenda objective. Adults over 65 years in Rensselaer County reported the lowest frequency of having a Flu Shot during the past 12 months compared to other Capital District counties, while remaining higher than the statewide rate. The flu is often complicated by pneumonia which is an inflammation of the lung most often caused by infection with bacteria, viruses, and other organisms although there are also non-infectious causes. Pneumonia and influenza together are ranked as the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. Pneum onia consistently accounts for the overwhelming majority of deaths between the two. Ol der adults are especially vulnerable. Adults age 65 and older in the Capital District had their pneumonia shots or vaccine less often than the goal set in the Prevention Agenda, but more often than the statewide average. Immunized with Flu Shot in Past Year 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives* 90.0% * NYS Department of Health Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Pneumonia Shot or Pneumococcal Vaccine 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives* * NYS Department of Health Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Healthy Capital District Initiative 67 The prevalence of laboratory confirmed influenza is highest in Schenectady County (19.3 per 100,000 residents), followed by Rensselaer (8.4) and Albany Counties (5.4). The prevalence of influenza is higher statewide and exceeds the rate for Capital District counties. Schenectady County has the highest incidence of influenza and pneumonia or flu hospitalizations in the Capital District between 2004 and 2006. This is somewhat unexpected given that Schenectady also has the highest rate of self-reported vaccinations for seniors among the three counties in 2008. This may be an artifact of the relatively small sample size for the e-BRFSS data causing a confidence interval of approximately eight percentage points higher or lower for each county. Alternatively, the public may have responded to a higher incidence of pneumonia and the flu in Schenectady County by more seniors getting immunized, or it may be due to another unidentified factor. The prevention of vaccine preventable diseases is an im portant public health goal effectively achieved through immunization. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among adults in the United States will require more cooperation among health-care providers, professional orga nizations, vaccine manufacturers, and public health departments to raise public awareness about influenza vaccination and to ensure continued distribution and administration of available vaccine throughout the vaccination season.

Community Preparedness Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 100% of the population lives within a jurisdiction with state-approved emergency preparedness plans The Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) pr ograms at Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady County local health departments serve to develop local public health preparedness plans a nd enhance the each County's capacity for responding to public health threats such as act s of terrorism, pandemic influenza, and other public health emergencies. PHEP programs collaborate with othe r local, state & federal partners (including but not limited to hospitals, emergency manageme nt, first responders), to ensure an in tegrated and cohesive approach in public health preparedness efforts. The three county health departments in the Capital District have previously established an informal association to address public health preparedness planning and response issues, and are now in the process of establishing a Capital District Public Health Preparedness Alliance to formalize existing partnerships. As of 2004, the jurisdictions of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady Counties each had established state-approved emergency preparedness plans (note: Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans are due to be updated in 2010). Capability gaps are consistent for all three counties in the Capital District, making regional collaboration the preferred approach for achieving sustainable and strengthene d public health preparedness and response planning. Challenges include the ability of local public health departments to adequately staff emergency response efforts with qualified and trained staff or volunteers; limited availability of resources to prepare for public health emergencies; and a lack of public outreach and messaging capabilities to educate and train constituents across the region. Public health staff intends to maintain collaboration with state, local and healthcare/hospital partners & community based organizations in the development of plan s (including trainings and dr ills/exercises) that address public health preparedness and response activities. Ongoi ng public health preparedness planning activities include mass prophylaxis, medical asset management and distribution, volunteer management, risk communication, surge capacity and maintenance or enhancement of epidemiological surveillance and investigation capabilities. On June 11, 2009 the World Health Organization declar ed a global pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza. Local health departments, hospitals, and community partners in Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady counties have been preparing to address related surv eillance, community mitigation, vaccine distribution, risk communication, and medical surge issues.

Mental Health/Substance Abuse Adult Poor Mental Health and Suicide Mortality Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 Reduce the age-adjusted suicide mortality rate in New York to no more than 4.8 per 100,000. Reduce the percentage of adult New Yorkers reporting 14 or more days with poor mental health in the last month to no more than 7.8%. Mental health is a core function of humans which h as physical, spiritual, and socio-economic impacts. Poor mental health is a cause of adverse physical hea lth outcomes, academic under-achievement, homelessness, unemployment and isolation. One in five New Yorkers experience s a diagnosable mental disorder a nnually; and one in ten experiences an illness serious enough to impair functioning. In the Capital District, the percentage of people experiencing poor mental health is generally consistent with statewide rates except for Albany County, for which the 2008 sample suggests has experienced a reduction more recently in the number of people afflicted. If this rate holds, it would reflect exceeding the Prevention Agenda objective slightly. Albany County estimates 5.4% of individuals, age 18 and older, are living with severe me ntal illness, with 2.6% living with severe and persistent conditions. In 2007, close to 1,500 Albany County residents received mental health services across the continuum of care. Schenectady County, by comparison, estimates 5% of residents have sever e mental illness and 2% considered to be severe and persistent. They provided 1,300 reside nts mental health services in 2008. Re nsselaer County reports 5.7% of the population with severe mental illness in 2008, approximatel y 3% of the mentally ill receiving services during the year and as did 2.2% of the severely mentally ill. Mental illness is treatable and New York State has one of the world's largest mental h ealth systems. The Capital District provides a broad network of mental hygiene servi ces to meet the needs of residents affected by mental illness or emotional disturbance. These services include pu blic, private and not-for-pro fit providers and target mental health needs from early childhood identification to the unique challenges of seniors; include public, private and not-for-profit providers; and span three di sability areas: mental health, chemical dependency and mental retardation and developmental disabilities. New Yo rkers with serious mental disorders are generally eligible for Medicaid but considerable numbers are wo rking poor, are under- or uninsured and have difficulty paying for needed services, further stretching ove r-burdened public mental health service providers. There are several patient barriers to accessing mental hygiene services: income, stigma, consumers not recognizing the value of treatment, health care providers unaware of treatments, and a complicated system of insurance reimbursement regulations with limits and exclusions. The mental health system in the region is focusi ng its continuous improvement efforts upon: timely access to mental hygiene services; youth transitioning between ch ildren's services and adult services; individuals living with co-occurring conditions (mental health, chemical de pendency, medical, and/or developmental disability); funding/insurance barriers; housing and residential opportun ities; seniors; and adults involved with the criminal justice/jail system. Adults Reporting 14 or More Days with Poor Mental Health in Last Month 2013 Prevention Agenda Objectives 7.8%* US 10.1%* of Health Prevention Agenda, 2003 Expanded BRFSS Interim Report 2008 Community Health Profile - 2009 70 Mental illness is closely linked to suicide, a fatal self- inflicted destructive act with the explicit or inferred intent to die. In general, 80 to 90 percent of people who die by suicide are suffering from a diagnosable mental illness. It is the 14th leading cause of death in NYS. The impact of suicidal behavior is not fully presented in the number of deaths, as there are hospitalizations also following suicidal attempts. Death and injuries caused by suicidal behavior affects the economic, social and health resources of the nation. The suicide mortality rate for all three Capital District counties are above the New York State Prevention Agenda objective and exceed the statewide rate as well. Schenectady County has the highest rate of suicide morta lity compared to Albany County and Rensselaer County. Women attempt suicide 20% more often than men, but men are more \"successful\" in their attempts. Men commit suicide 4.5 times as frequently as women. The suicide mort ality rate for Albany County white males is 13.8 per 100,000 residents and only 2.7 among white females. Men, ag es 15-54, are the most likely to commit suicide. In the Capital District, the suicide mortality rate for men ag es 15-54 is three times more than the statewide rate. As for ethnic disparities, White Non-Hispanic (NH) suicide ra te accounts for 75% of suicides and is 1.9 times the Black NH suicide rate in New York State. Capital District mental health providers are focused on encouraging and sustaining mental health services, supporting it by scientific inquiry and strengthening the hea lth of all citizens with poor mental health and their families.

By the year 2013, reduce the age-adjusted drug-related hospitalization rate in New York to no more than 26.0 per 10,000. Abuse of alcohol and other drugs leads to various acute and chronic adverse health outcomes. There are 1.6 million New Yorkers with a substance abuse problem statewide. These figures do not fully represent the widespread impact of substance abu se because of the millions of other indi viduals whose lives are also affected: the children, spouses, extended families and innocent bystanders. Alcohol is the primary substance used by adults; for yout h, alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs are principal concerns. Binge drinking is a common pattern of excessive al cohol use. It is a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 gram s percent or above. Binge drinking is associated with many health problems, like unintentional and intentional injuries, alcohol poisoning, sexually transmitted disease, unintended pregnancy, childr en born with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Diso rders, cardiovascular disease, neurological damage etc. Binge drinkers are 14 times more likely to report alcohol-impaired driving than non-binge drinkers. Binge drinking is directly linked to gender as it is more prevalent in males than in females. Approximately 34,800 indivi duals (age 12 and older) are living with chemical dependency problems (13.3% estimated prevalence) in Albany County (Schenectady County - 19,500; 13% estimated prevalence). In 2008, 5,296 Albany County residents received chemical dependency services, across a continuum of care levels, from public and not-for-profit service providers (Schenectady County - 5,500). Drug abuse causes significant changes in brain structure and function leading to addiction and thus to negative personal and social consequen ces, deteriorating the ability to function in a family, workplace and community. The repercussions of addiction have a significant impact on public safety, health, education and welfare of the individual. There is a clear linkage between addictive disorders and other social issues including mental illness, inadequate health care, crime, unemployment, ch ild abuse and neglect, homelessness, and educational deficiencies. Over half (55%) of all the drug misuse/abuse Emergency Department (ED) visits in the United States in 2006 involved illicit drugs, either alone or in combinati on with another drug type. Of those ED visits: Illicit drugs with pharmaceuticals - 8% Illicit drug only - 31% Alcohol only in patients under the age of 21 - 7% Pharmaceuticals only - 28% Alcohol with pharmaceuticals - 10% Illicit drugs with alcohol - 13% Illicit drugs with pharmaceu ticals and alcohol - 3% For illicit drugs, cocaine is the most frequent drug in volved in ED visits. Stimulants, amphetamines and methamphetamine, are less frequent than marijuana but as frequent as heroin.

There have been 2,089 drug-related discharges in Albany County during the years of 2004-2006, 937 in Schenectady and 808 in Rensselaer. Research shows that alcohol, medications, and other drugs have different effects on senio rs than on younger persons. The extent of alcohol and medication misuse among seniors is expected to increase signifi cantly. Overall, the total number of ED visits in the United States, attributable to drug misuse and abuse was stable across 2004, 2005 and 2006.
