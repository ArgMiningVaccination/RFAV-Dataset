Conclusion SUMMARY: Diphtheria tetanus.acellular pertussis combined (DTaP) vaccines have been successfullyused in Japan by controlling their potencleS and toxicities with animal models\u00a5 In accordance with the recent practical introduction of DTaP vaccines of various formulations, a question has been raised in other nations as to the elrlCaCy Of a quality control system based on animal tests and standard preparations. The World Health Organiza- tion issued its guidelines on the production and quality control ofacellular pe\u008eRISSis vaccines in 1998 along with the concept of quality control by ensurlng that production lots were consistent with clinical trial lots, rather than by comparing them with standard preparations in traditional laboratory tests. However, because it is not feasible to evaluate the combined use of vaccines from different manufacturers in a clinical study, the altemative trend of quality control may glVe rise to a difficulty ln rationalizing the practical immunizations to use vaccines of different brands in a mixed consequence. A standardized national regulation system to ensure the equlValence of approved products would be essential for such an immunization practice. The success of the Japanese DTaP vaccination suggests the possibility of an effective quality control of DTaP vaccines by meansof standardized test systems\u00a5 1. Introduction Diphtheria tetanus whole cell pertussis combined (DTwP) vaccine was used effectively to prevent the diseases until it was temporarily discontinued due to two cases of post-vaccina- tion death in the mid- 1 970S. Subsequently, diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis combined (DTaP) vaccines were developed and implemented in Japan in 198 I. In the course of the acellular pertussis vaccine development, protective antlgenS Were iden- been proved to correlate well with clinical protection (1). The efficacy and safety of the DTaP vaccines have been successfully controlled using animal models in Japan. The potency of the pertussis compo- nent of the DTaP vaccines has been controlled by the modi\u008bued Kendrick test with the immunization period extended to 3 weeks. The potency of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids in the DTaP vaccines has been controlled by in vivo or in vitro measurement of the antitoxin titers in the sera of immunized gulnea plgS Or mice. Animal tests have played crucial roles also in ensunng the safety of the vaccines. DTaP vaccines of variouspertussis antlgen compositions and a4juvant gel contents have been developed and put into clinical use in other nations during the past 1 0 years. Accord- ingly, a question has been raised about the validity of the pertussis icIPOtenCy test in predicting the clinical efflCaCy Of acellular vaccines. An altemative approach relying on the results ofclinical trials was suggested for the quality control of acellular pertussis vaccine (2). ln this approach, the efrlCaCy of a routine product lot was suggested to be assured by ensur- lng ltS COnSistency with the clinical trial lot. Attempts have also been made to extend this new approach to the potency tests of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (73) in order to settle the problems concemlng the varied production processes and adjuvant gel contents among the products from different manu facturers. According to the newly proposed concepts of standardiza- tion and quality control, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its guidelines f\u0081\u00f3r the production and control of the acellular pertussis component of lnOnOValent or combined vaccines (WHO Guidelines) in 1998 (3). ln this paper, the concepts of the guidelines and their influence on the current vaccination system are discussed in comparison with Japanese concepts of quality control of DTaP vaccines\u00a5 2. A brief history of Japanese acellularpertussis vaccine development Pertussis vaccination was temporarily suspended aRer two cases of post-vaccination death in 1974 and 1975 (4). As a result of the lowered vacclnation rate, by 1979 the annual number of cases of whooping COugh had increased dramatically, to 13,000 cases (5). Shortly a\u0090\u00f4er the cessation of vaccination a research team was set up to improve the vaccine. The research initially focYsed on isolating protective antigen(S) ofBondetella pertussisuslng the Kendrick test. Two candidate antlgenS Were chosen as potential protective vaccine antlgenS. One was the 22S protective antlgen, Which was reported to show purely protective activity (6,7) and the other was an antigen\u008bu\u00a5action showing histamine s.ensitizing the investiga- tlOn, an antlgenfractionwith an appearance similar to that of the 22S antlgen Was Shown to exert no protective activlty ln the Kendrick test. Accordingly, the research was concentrated on establishing a method for isolating the fraction with HA, LP and HS activities\u00a5 Although a fraction showlng Only HA activitywas separated from the HA active fraction that also showed LP and HS activities in the early stage orthe study (1 2), attempts to develop a practical vaccine were made along with the efforts to co-purifyall the active substances. A soluble fraction rich in the activities was obtained by extractlng ammonium sulfate-precIPltated culture supematant or whole culture ofB. pertussis Phase I Tohama strainwith concentrated alkaline salt solution. The extract was found to lcontain a considerable amount of endotoxin, which was removed by a sucrose-density.gradient centrifuge ( 1 3)I The fraction was lat?r proved to consist Of mainly two different antlgenS, PertuSSIS toxin (PT) and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) (14). The toxic activities of the fraction were detoxified by a formalde- hyde treatment (13)\u00a5 The DTaP vaccines w?re formulated uslng thus developed acellular pertussIS VaCClneS. Limit values f\u0082\u00edr the residual toxicities of the new vaccine were another subject of the research. An initial goal was set of reducing every measurable toxic activlty tO One tenth of the level of average whole cell vaccines. Consequently, highly sensitive and quantitative assay methods were required toachieve the goal. Kurokawa et al. (15,16,19) had developed quantitative methods f\u0081\u00f3r assaying the toxicity to mouse weight gain (mouse body weight decreasing [BWD\u0081z toxicity) and LP toxicity. BWD toxicity was assayed by measuring the toxicityofa vaccine to mouse weight gain Pyer the 1 6-h post- injection period to calculate the relative toxICltyof the vaccine referring to the dose-response of a reference vaccine that have Fn assigned unit value of the toxicity\u00a5 LP toxicitywas assayed ln the same mice by measurlng the increase in peripheral leukocyte count on the third day of injection to calculate the relative toxIClty Ofthe vaccine referring to the dose-response of the reference vaccine. At the time of the above researches, the methods available for assaying HS activlty Were those use the fatal sensitiza- tion of vaccinated mice to histamine challenge (histalnine- sensitizing death [HSD]) (17,18). To achieve the goal of reducing the activlty tO One tenth of the average ofwhole cell vaccines, the assay method was required to have the sensitivity allowing quantitative discrimination of the DTaP vaccines that showed no fatal sensitization of mice to histamine challenge (20). Ishida et al. (21) developed a highly sensitive assay method for HS activitybased on the change in rectal tempera- ture of mice after histamine challenge on the fourth day of sensitization. The assay methods f\u0082\u00edr BWD, LP and HS activities played cmcial roles not only in the development or the vaccine but also in quality control of the vaccine after its clinical introduction (22)\u00a5 A lyophilized whole cell pertu\u0092\u0097Sis vaccine was prepared for use as the reference preparatlOn (Reference pertussis v\u0083`ccine for toxicity tests, Lot 1) in the toxicitytests\u00a5 This vacclne Was ass.1\u008dbed a BWD toxicityvalue of Was determined to be 60 HSU/vial by referrlng tO the Netherlands Reference 2, whose activitywas.stFted as 4\u00a54 HSU/ml (23,24)I The identical value as the HS actlVltywas assigned for the LP activityofthe reference vaccine ( 19)\u00a5 The initial limit values implemepted for BWD, LP and HS toxicities of Japanese DTaP vacclneS were 10 BWDU, 0.5 LPU and 0.8 HSU per milliliter, respec- tively (19, 22). The formulation of adjuvant gel was examined with regard to the safety and potencies of the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis components of the vaccine\u00a5 A rather low concentration of the aluminum adjuvant gel was suggested to be adequate for the formulation of safe vaccines that confer sumcinet potencies or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (68). The upper limit of the adjuvant gel concentration was defined as 0.3 mgAl/ml (22). The newly developed DTaP vaccine was put into public use in 1981 a\u0088\u00bcr a clinical evaluation (25). The vaccine was shown to be clinically safe (5,25). ln particular, it was shown to be remarkably less pyrogenic (5). Public confidence in the safetyofthe vaccine was quickly established, and the number ofwhooplng COugh cases quickly retumed to the level seen bef\u0082\u00edre the suspension or DTwP vaccination (5). 3. A new trend in the quality control ofDTaP vaccines and its complications Followlng the recent clinical introduction of DTaP vaccines with various antlgen and adjuvant gel constituents in the United States, as well as in Europeanand someAsian countries, publications have been made by some researchers to propose altemative concepts of quality control of DTaP vaccines. The newly proposed concepts of quality control were based on ensunng the consistency ofa production lot with clinical trial 168 lots rather thanby companng the production lot with reference or standard preparations (2, 26)I In fact, the c.urrent icIPOtenCy test might have a. validitylimitation in detectlng the protective potency of certaln antlgenS that have been claimed to confer protection in humans or in mouse resplratOry infection models (27,28). The potency tests f\u0082\u00edr diphtheria and tetanus toxoids were also reported to have a complication due to varied produc- tion procedures and constituents including adjuvant (29). In 1998, WHO issued the guidelines f\u0081\u00f3r the acellular pertussis vaccine (3) based on the f\u0082\u00edllowing rationale. 1 ) Each DTaP product produced by a different manufTacturer should be considered unlque due to the differences in production processes, antlgenS and adjuvant-gel constitu- ents. 2) Their quality, theref\u0082\u00edre, camot be evaluated in a labora- tory test uslng a universal standard preparation. 3) Accordingly, their quality should be evaluated by ensuring their consistency with a clinical trial lot whose e\u0092\u00dccacy and safety have been clinically evaluated. The above concepts have led to remarkable changes in the traditional methods of vaccination and vaccine qualitycontrol, as summarized in Table I. We note that products from different manufacturers should also be considered unique because no chance ofclinical evaluation would be probable on the effect of use of vaccines of different brands in a mixed consequence for primary and booster doses.lmplementatiOn of such concepts brings an important change to the traditional vaccination practice to allow uslng a combination of different vaccine brands for pnmary and booster immuni2:ation series. The new concepts requlre that DTaP vaccines of the same brand be used for all doses in the vaccination series (30)\u00a5 Howe\u0081\u00f5er, full implementation of the new system may cause practlCaldifficulties. Practically speaking, lt Will be all but impossible to avoid uslng DTaP vaccines of different brands in a mixed consequence for achieving thefull course of vaccination (30). Although these new concepts seem to be taking hold in the quality control of DTaP vaccines, they will requlre Careful evaluations before full implementation. ln particular, certain contradictions inherent in these concepts should be discussed in detail. 3-1\u00a5 Testing the consistency of products lt has been considered to have a reliable method f\u0081\u00f3r directly testlng the consistency of the antlgen composition of final bulks\u00a5 T\u0082\u00edward this end, intensive studies were made during the development of the acellular vaccine in Japan. However, an applicable method for testing the final bulk could not be established due to the aggregation of antlgensby the detoxi- fication process. It was concluded that the test for antlgen consistency could be correctly applied only to materials before detoxification. It was assumed necessary, therefore, to consider the possibility or imposlng an in-process control test uslng reference antlgenS and standardized methods, in splte Of the possibility of practical inconsistency between the materials before detoxification and those in final bulk. Another possi- bilityWould be to test antibody production by vaccine antigens in approprlate animals. However, this would not be accurate enough f\u0082\u00edr provlng the exact consistency of products. Another concem regarding the test f\u0082\u00edr consistency is the stabilization of a clinical trial lot as the stan\u008c\u008crd preparation. lt is stated in the WHO Guidelines that it is necessary to ensure consistency between a routine product lot and clinical trial lot in order to assur.e efficacy (2,3)\u00a5 A difficultywould \u0081\u00e8ise, however, in prepanng stable vials, if by lyophilization. It would not allow ones to use the preparations ofexactly the Table I , Comparison between the current Japanese quality control system and the WHO Guidelines Current Japanese system New trends inthe WHO Guidelines A quality control system using laboratory models established or evaluated according to clinical rclcvance.A quality control system based on ensumg consistency withclinical triallots whose safetyand efficacy has been assured clinically.(2,3) Role or clinical trials and laboratory testsBecause results of a clinical trial would also have limited accuracy, lt lS nCCCSSaIY tO complement them with results or post- marketing su\u0087Wcillance and or the tests i\u0088\u00eal laboratory model systems.Should adhere strictly to tbc production process used for the manufacture of the vaccine lots used to prove cfricacy and safctyin clinical trials.

Accuracy of the results of cJinical trials The reliability orthe results ora clinical trial is orprimary importance for the system prescribed in the Guidelines. In general, however, the results of a clinical trial have limited validity ln accurately predicting the outcomes or a mass immunization due to the usually limited sample sizes or ethical restrictions in the inclusion ofa placebo. Furthermore, estimates of vaccine efrlCaCy would differ depending on the diagnostic criteria applied. The results would also be affected by the variation in clinical diagnoses, even when made and recorded in accordance with the WHO's case definition (3 1 ,32). Further- more, an estimate of vaccine efficacy, and therefore of the difference in infTection rate between the vaccinated and placebo- administered cases, would not be constant even in a slngle study\u00a5 Instead, it would vary depending on the selected obser- vation period after vacc.ination (33)\u00a5 EfflCaCy estimates on the same product can slgnificantly vary in different trials (34,35)\u00a5 Theref\u0082\u00edre, we need to be cautious not to rely too much on the absolute figures of the estimated vaccine efGcacy Pr safety\u00a5 This fact emphasizes the importance of post-market- lng Su\u0087Weillance. In addition, it has become increasingly difficult to carry out clinical trials. Although animal testlng lS O\u0090\u00f4en criticized as a means ofevalua.ting vaccine quality (26), it is necessary to develop useful animal model systems not only for quality control, but also to improve or develop new vaccines (2). 4\u00a5 Quality control ofDTaP vaccines in Japan One of the fundamental policies for DTaP vaccination in Japan has been to apply a unified vaccination program in which all vaccines are controlled to have the consistent qual- ityirrespective of the manufacturer, as explained in Table 1. This quality control has been realized uslng laboratory tests with reference or standard preparations. Accordingly, Japa- nese DTaP vaccines from six different manufacturers have been used in an interchangeable manner in the course of prlmary and booster immunizations. The system has been accepted as the realistic practice in the routine vaccination. As no chance would be generally expectable to evaluate the effect of using vaccines of different brands in combination, the Japanese system needs to base upon the assumptlOn that the vaccines from all the six manufacturers are equlValent in their efficacy and safety once they passed the approprlately implemented quality control tests. Effective model systems are of primary Importance for quahty control and successful routine vaccinations\u00a5 Japanese quality control or DTaP vaccines has largely depended on animal models and has been successful thus far (5,36-38). 4-1\u00a5 Potency of the pertussis component Development of the Japanese acellular pertussis vaccine began with identifying a pertussis bacterial fraction showing protective activlty\u00a5 This was accomplished by means or a Kendrick test in which protective activlty Was measured as the degree to which a glVen fraction protected immunized mice against an ic Injection ofvirulent B. pertussis at 2 weeks post-immunization. The test had been used throughout the course ofdeveloplng the vaccine as the only laboratory method for identifying candidate antlgenS for an effective vaccine. In the process, the interval between iThmunization and challenge was extended from the onglna1 2 weeks to 3 weeks to whooplng COughcases in Japan. Pcrtussis vaccination was suspended in I 975 due to two cases of post-vaccination death.

The Ofthc acellular pcrtussis vaccine, reproducibility (modified Kendrick test). This modification was later proved to glVe an improved immune response to PT constituFntS Of the vaccine in mice (39)\u00a5 Thusdeveloped Japanese acellular pertussis vaccines were found to compnse mainly FHA and PT. Although the vaccines from different manufacturers had varylng contents Of FHA, PT and other trace antige?S, such as agglutinogens (14), all were found to have equlValent potency ln the modified Kendrick test (40). With regard to clinical efficacy, the two Japanese acellular vaccines having the most divergent antlgen compositions, namely TJtype and B-type vaccines, were both proved to be clinically effective (33,36,38,41-43). Japanese acellular vaccines of T-type, B-type and intermediate antigen compositions approved by the modified Kendrick test showed Pomparable clinical etrlCaCy (44)\u00a5 As shownin Fig\u00a5 1 , pertussisImmunization resumed with the acellular vaccines effectively reduced the cases of whooping cough in Japan, further suggesting the validityofthe modi\u008bued Kendrick test. However, doubts have been raised in regard to the ability or the ic protection test to predict the clinical protective potency of antlgenS Other than PT. As possible altematives, lntranaSal and aerosol infection models have been examined (27,28). No agreement has been reached so far on the immunization \u008c\u008cses, schedule or challenge doses\u008bu)r an adequate stan\u008c\u008crdiza- tion of the resplratOry infection models. 4-I-I. Ic challenge model The orlglnal Kendrick test was approved based on the results of a field trial of the British Medical Research Coun- cil (MRC field bial) (1) and has been effectivelyused to control whole cell vaccines. However, the immune response of mice to acellular vaccines has been suggested to be different from that of mice to whole cell vaccines. Whole cell pertussis vaccines generate both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, while acellular vaccines induce mainly humoral immune response (27,45,46)\u00a5 T-cell dependent humorallmmune response has been suggested to play a cmcial role in the protection against ic challenge (27,45). ln particular, the DTaP vaccine containlng genetically detoxified PT has been shown to be highly protective in the ic potency test and was reported to confer a strong cell-mediated immunity both in mice and humans (52). Both PT immunization and passive anti-PT antibody are known to confer sufficient protection agalnSt ic challenge (47,48). PT has also been reported to show a synergistic effect when combined wi\u008c\u008csuch other antlgenS aS FHA or 69K outer membrane protein (69k OMP), both or which show marginal protection when given alone (49,50). The role ofPT is, there- fore, suggested to be crucial for the protection in the Kendrick test. ln addition, Pillemer 's Stromata Protective Antigen (SPA), which is assumed to comprlSe mainly bacterial components with HA activlty and was, consequently, shown to have HS activity, has been proved to be highly protective bothinKendrick test and clinically based on MRC trial (5 1). Regarding the i-unization of mice,\u0096\u00e7e optlmum immuni- zation period for the maximum anti-PT production by PT toxoid was reported to be 28 days (39). The immunization period for the modified Kendrick test, therefore, is assumed to be more appropnate f\u0081\u00f3r optlmal anti-PT production companng than the orlglnal Kendrick test. A definite correlation was seen between the logarithmically transfbmed potency values at 2 weeks and 3 weeks post-immunizations on 13 batches of DTaP and three batches ofDTwP vaccines (unpublished). The resulting equation f\u0082\u00edr the relationship between the log-potency values or immunizations of 3 weeks (Y) and 2 weeks (X) was Y - 0.864X + 0.259 with a correlation coeWICient ofO.67 1 (P - 0.0044).lmmunization of3 Weeks was suggested to give slightly higher potency values than that of 2 weeks. However, this dilrerence did not reach the level of statistical significance. The results of the modified Kendrick test obtained by the Japanese National Control Laboratory were highly consistent with those of manufacturers (unpublished). A method f\u0081\u00f3r sequential sampling lnSpeCtion has been applied\u008bu)r intelpretlng the results of the test since 1 98 1 so as to avoid approvlng a Vaccine with a potency ofbelow 4.0 units/ml. turers, including T-type and B-type (14), were shown to have similar potencies by the modi\u008bued Ken\u008c\u008cick test (40) and have been proved clinically effective (33,38,4 1-44,53,54). The ability of the ic potency test to quantitatively predict the clinical protective potency of acellular pertussis vaccines has not beenfully established. It is necessary for establishing a quantitative clinical relevance as fb\u0081\u00e7 whole cell vaccine to carry out a clinical trial similar to the MRC trial uslng Vaccines with widely varied levels of protective potency, lnCluding those with very low potency. For ethical reasons, however, it is not possible to conduct such clinical trials. The ic challenge model is assumed worthwhile to be further explored into its mechanisms of protection for its valuable facilitation as the only available potency test method. 4-1-2\u00a5 Aerosol and intranasaI (respiratory) challenge models ln models of resplratOry infection, the protective efrlCaCy of a vaccine is evaluated only with respect to the bacterial clearance from lungs, rather than in terms ofprotectionfrom mortality, since mice generally survive the challenge even after receivlng much higher doses of pertussis bacteria than in the ic challenge model. One particular advantage of the resplratOry infection model over the ic challenge model is that the susceptibilityof mice is not limited to particular challenge strains ofB. pertussis. As is the case in the ic challenge model, it was reported that anti-PT or PT alone was able to confer protection in the aerosol or intranasal challenge model (55,56). Cel\u0083gmediated immunlty has been reported to play a cmcial role also in bacterial clearance from the lungs of infected mice (46,57). Nonspecific cellular immunity has also been noted to play a role (58). A possible difference of the aerosol or 171intranasal challenge model from the ic challenge model would be that antlgenS Such as FHA, pertactin or flmbriae could be protective without the aid ofPT (59164)\u00a5 However, CPution should be taken when interpretlng the results of the resplratOry challenge model, since this model was reported to show no correlation with the clinical efficacy of whole cell vaccines and also to have f\u0082\u00edund boiled whole cell vaccines protective (65). ln addition, ethical restrictions will prevent quantita- tive determination of the clinical relevance of this model for predicting the efficacy of vaccines. Further study will be required to evaluate and standardize the respiratory infection model for any of its routine utilizations. 4-2. Potency tests of the diphtheria and tetanus compo- nents of combined vaccines Vaccination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids has played a key role in the effective prophylaxis agalnSt these diseases. The potencies of the toxoids have been controlled by measurlng neutralizing antibody production in gulnea plgS Or mice. The major concems raised thus far on the reliability of the potency tests have related to 1) immunizing animal species or strains and the clinical relevance of their lmmuPe responses; 2) the influence of the adjuvant effect of the alumlnumSalt or pertussis component; and 3) methods for titration of the serum.antitoxin\u00a5 The results of the assay to measure antitoxin inductlOn might be affected by the species or strains of immunizing animals and by an adjuvant effect of the vaccine constituents. It would also be important to use a method fb\u0081\u00e7 semm antitoxin titra- tion that can co\u0092\u00f3eCtly detect the toxin\u0088\u00eameutralizing antibody (66). There is currently a trend to simplifypotency tests.S? as to confimlthe potency ofa product only to be above the mlnlmally required level. Regarding the safety of the vaccination, however, it is also necessary to establish that the potency lS not so high as to cause?V?r-immunizations (67,68)\u00a5 Accurate quantifying of potency lS Important in this regard\u00a5 Guinea pigs have been used f\u0082\u00edr the immunization because their immune response to the toxoid antlgenS appears tO be similar to that ofhumans (69). Many works have been pub- lished regarding mouse models for testlng the potency of toxoid vacc.ines (70\u00a571,73)\u00a5 Care must be taken in selecting the\u0092@prOpnate mouse Strains, since the immune response to toxoid antigens may differ from that of guinea pi.gs (72)\u00a5 4-2-I. Effect of whole cell pertussis vacclne On the potency test of tetanus or diphtheria toxoid The adjuvant effect of constituents in combined vaccines would affect the potency of toxoids. The pertussis component in DTwP vaccines shows a slgnificant adjuvant effect on the toxoid jmmunizations both in animals and humans (68). ln the case of tetanus toxoid in DTwP vaccines, Murata et al. (74) proved the e\u008e\u0081cacy of the potency test in predicting clinical immunogenicity by showlng a Clear co\u0092\u00f3elation between the amount of immunized intemational units (IU) of tetanus toxoid and the in sera of infants (Fig\u00a5 2)\u00a5 They \u0087ksed potency the tetanus toxoid in DTwP vacclneS measured agalnSt a plain preparation of National Standard Tetanus Toxoid based upon the report on parallelism of the dose\u0083Besponse regressions of the tetanus toxoids in plain and DTwP vaccines (75, 76)\u00a5 Kondo et al\u00a5 (67) proposed a simple method f\u0082\u00edr estimating the potency or tetanus toxoid in DTwP vaccines uslng the results measured agalnSt the plain standard in accordance with the parallelism of the dose-response regressions.

Effect ofadjuvant gel and animal model on the toxoid potency test Controlling for the effects of the adjuvant gel would requlre an additional standardization strategy. The adjuvant effect may differ in different animal species or strains (72,77)\u00a5 Simultaneous dilutions of aluminum a4juvant and toxoid antlgenS would affect the slope of the dose-response regressions in the potency assays and, consequently, would influence the relative potency values (78)\u00a5 Factors possibly influencing the slope need to be carefully validated so as to minimlZe the deviation of the potency test results from those reflectlng the outcomes of clinical immunization. Although aluminum adjuvant also has a slgnificant effect on the clinical immuni- zations, differences in its content, so far as within a practical range, no slgnificant difference was detected in the clinical immunogeniclty Or adsorbed diphtheria and tetanus toxoids probably due to a wide variation in the sensitivity ofhumans (68)\u00a5 AluminuP salt showed a remarkable adjuvant effect on the immunlZatlOn Of tetanus toxoid in mice and gulnea plgS (66,79). Guinea pigs were shown to respond to an almost similar extent to adsorbed tetanus toxoids having markedly different contents of aluminum adjuvant gel (79). ln a comparison of the adjuvant effects of aluminum hydroxide and calcium phosphate on tetanus toxoid, gulnea plgS Showed a much more human-like response to aluminum hydroxide and calciumphosphate than did mice (66). On thi other hand, the response of gulnea Pigs tO both these adjuvants on diph- theria toxoid was more similar to that of mice than to that of humans. However, the difference Bomthe response ofhumans became less evident in gulnea PlgS after a booster immuniza- tion (66)\u00a5 When introducing m\u0083\u008fuse models, it is of primary lmpOrtanCe tO Select the appropnate test conditions and mouse strains having a responsiveness to adsorbed toxoid vaccines similar to that ofgulnea plgS. 4-2-3\u00a5 Effect the toxoiding process on the immun0- genicity and efrlCaCy Of adjuvant gel The process of toxoiding affects the molecular characteris- tics of the resulting toxoids and has been reported to influence 172not only the immunogeniclty Of the toxoid antlgen but also the efrlCaCy Ofthe aluminum adjuvant on the toxoid (72,80)\u00a5 This is why it has been di\u008e\u0081cult to consider the immunochemi- cally assayed antlgen COntentS, Such the value of limes flocculation (LF), as representing immunogenicity. The difficulty of consistently controlling toxoiding processes in tum makes it difficult to estimate the potency of\u008bunal products uslng the potency values of bulk materials measured before blending with adjuvant gel because of the influence of inconsistent characteristics of the resulting toxoid molecules on the efficacy ofadjuvant (81). Although it may be possible to directly evaluate the structural validityof the toxin neutraliz- ipg epitope (82), the results will not be sulrlCient for quantita- tively predicting the adjuvant effect on the toxoid immuniza- tion. 4-2-4. Establishing the clinical relevance of toxoid The cu\u0092\u00f3ent potency tests evaluate the overall immun0- geniclty Of toxoid vaccines and would be useful to predict clinical efficacy if a correlation between the potency test results and clinical immunogeniclty COuld be demonstrated, as.in the case of tetanus toxoid in DTwP vaccines (74)\u00a5 1n splte Of a possible difference in adjuvant effects between aluminum salt and whole cell pertussis vaccine (79), there seems to be a possibility of correlating the potency estimates and clinical immunogenlClty Of adsorbed toxoid vaccines. Because a clear co\u0092\u00f3elation between the potency of tetanus toxoid and the clinical immunogenicityofDTwP vaccine was proved ever uslng the tetanus toxoids prepared by various procedures Including those suggested to affect differently the characteristics of toxoid molecule (74). In addition, the difference in adjuvant contents was shown to have little effect on the immunogenicity both in guinea pigs (79) and humans (68)\u00a5 Further investigation will be nPcessary, howeyer, for identifying approprlate animal strains and immunlZation procedures - including that f\u0082\u00edr making graded doses - So as to maximally renect the clinical immunization procedure\u00a5 A potency test involving Immunization with serially varied volumes of undiluted adsorbed vaccine would seem to be worth investlgatlng aS a possible altemative to the cumnt immunization uslng Serial dilutions of the vaccine because of the possible difference between the effects of dilutions of antlgen and adjuvant on the immunization. It would also be important to evaluate boostlng ln a potency test, Since boostlng is used clinically and has been shown to result in antitoxin levels in gulnea plgS that are highly similar to those in humans and that differ considerablyfrom those obtained with a slngle dose (66,79). 4-2-5. Other problems The immunogenicityof toxoid might be affected by other antigens\u00a5 such as Haem.ophilus injluenzae.type b (Hib) polysaccharide. Conjugation Or Simultaneous Immunization ofHib polysaccharide and tetanustoxoid was reported to show profound effects on the immummogeniclty Of both antlgenS in mice without affectlng the immunogenicities of diphtheria and pertussis components (83,84)\u00a5 However, n? such immuno- potentiation \u0081\u00f5as noted or gulnea Pigs (86)\u00a5 Again, selectlng apprOprlate Strains would be very lmpOrtant for the potency test in mice. Meaningful potency estimation for Hib-conjugated tetanus toxoid in DTwP-Hib vaccines in mice seems to be possible only on\u008c\u008ce vaccine bef\u0082\u00edre or wi\u008c\u008cout conjugation. However, the dose-response containlng the conjugate of Hib- Specific or oligosaccharide did not seem to deviate slgnificantlyfrom parallelism with that of the control DTwP vaccine in mice of the CBA strain irrespective of the increased extent of antitoxin production (83)\u00a5 If this is true, estlmation of the potency of tetanus toxoid in DTwP-Hib conjugate vaccines might be possible by the method ofKondo et all (67) using a reference preparation ofDTwP vaPcine and the data orpotency measurements on and without the Hib-conjugate. 412-6. Antitoxin titration With regard to etrlCaCy, it is important to evaluate the ability oftoxoids to induce toxin\u0088\u00eameutralizing antibody. ln vivo toxin challenge methods have been loslng Support for reasons of animal welfare. ln vitro assay methods have been developed for particle agglutination (90,9 1 ) assa.ys are the methods based on antigen- antibody binding. The mlCrO Vero cell culture method (92) is an in vitro toxin neutralizing assay method. Because it is essential that the potency test be capable or evaluatlng the production or toxin-neutralizing antibodies, every ln Vitro assay method based on binding with the toxin molecule needs to be vahdated carefully before utilization. Generally, such validation has been made by provlng a correlation with an in vivo toxin-neutralizing assay. The immunizlng efGcacy of toxoid would be affected by various uncontrollable factors in the toxoiding process to glVerise to final products ofvarylng potency (80)\u00a5 The mi.cro Vero cell culture method is highly sensitive and approprlate in this regard. The TbBl assay may also become a promlSlng binding assay in this context, through the use of a monoclonal antibody recognlZlng the epltOpe Of toxic action f\u0081\u00f3r sensitizing micro-wells of plates. ELISA and passive particle agglutination assays may also become promlSlng direct binding assays by using SPeCific peptides exhibiting the responsible structure for the toxic action of toxin molecules. 4-3. Toxicity The toxicityofDTwP vaccines has been controlled as overall toxicity by means of the mouse body weight gain (MWG) test, in which the toxiclty Ofa vaccine is evaluated by the toxiclty tO Weight galn Ofmice over the first 7 days post- vaccination. Even though the MWG test has a long history of safetycontrol for the pertussis vaccine, it has been discredited by reports that PT toxicityaccelerates the weight gain of mice, thereby improving the results for toxic vaccines (1061108). It is theref\u0082\u00edre considered important to evaluate each of the toxicities separately (1 6, 1 9) for meaningful toxicity tests. Toxicitytestsfor vaccines generally need to be implemented for all measurable toxic activities unless proven to have no clinical relevance. It is difrlCult to prove the climical relevance or a biological activity, particularly without its quantitative assay results (94). Kurokawa et al. analyzed bacterial factors of pertussis vaccine influencing the MWG test and reported that endotoxin, heat-labile dermonecrotic toxin (HLT) and PT were the major moieties affecting the test at 1, 2 and from 3 days a\u0090\u00f4er injection, respectively (16,I 9,2 1 ). They developed quantitative assay methods f\u0081\u00f3r these activities and the methods were later implemented for the quality control of DTaP vaccines in the Minimum RequlrementS Of Biological Products oHapan (Minimum Requirements) in 1981 (19,22). 4-3-1. Endotoxim One of the characteristics of Japanese acellular pertussis vaccine is that it results in a slgnificantly reduced febrile reaction rate, as low as l% for a febrile reaction over 37.5oC\u0091\u00a6\u0081@\u0081@50\u0081@\u0081@\u008b\u00c2\u0081@\u0081@\u008c\u00b6\u0081@\u0081@20\u0081@\u0081@1 0 \u0081T3uanb\u0094b\u008eR 0.5\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@1.0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@1.5\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@2.0 and rcduccd to approximately I /1 0 0fthat ofDTwP vaccines. (95). This had been initially achieved by the BWD toxicity test (21 )\u00a5Asreptesented in Fig\u00a5 3, the avera.ge BWD toxicity of acellular vacclneS Was reduced to approxlmately one-tenth that ofwhole cell vaccines. The BWD toxiclty test is capable of detectlng the toxiclty Of endotoxin to mouse weight galn during the 1 6 h after injection but is possibly affected by other constituents, such as aluminum adjuvant gel and active PT (106). We should theref\u0082\u00edre consider replacing the BWD toxicitytest with some other test method, particularly for DTaP vaccines (1 06). 4-3_1_1. The bacterial endotoxin test: The endotoxin content of Japanese DTaP vaccines can also be measured by the endotoxin test method (22) usiTg Limulus amaebocyte Lyzate (LAL) reactlVity removed or suppressed (96-100) to avoid a\u0083\u008ey possible confusion due to reaction with the non-pyrogenlC substance. However, a special precaution has been shown to be necessary when applying the endotoxin test to DTaP vaccines. In an enhancement/suppression experiment to detect endotoxin added to DTaP vaccines, some commercial DTaP vaccine batches slgnificantly suppressed the endotoxin test, as shown in Table 2 (the amount ofendotoxin detected is represented as a percent of the added endotoxin). ln spite of Table 2.

Japanese DTaP vaccines show a diverse distribution of endotoxin content, as shown in Fig. 4. A rather high level of endotoxin was detected in the DTaP vaccine batches of the early 1980S, but in more recent batches the level declined remarkably to below 0. 1 EU/ml. 4-311-2. clinical relevance of the endotoxin test: The quantitatively estimated endotoxin contents of DTaP vaccines could be utilized for analyzlng the relationship with febrile reaction rate ofvaccinees, as shown in Fig. 5. Here, the probit transformed rate of vaccinees showlng a febrile reaction of 37.50C or more is shown vertically and the endotoxin content in vaccine batches is shown horizontally. The data summarized in Fig\u00a5 5 could be utilized for estimatlng a VaCCine's febrile reaction rate, provided its endotoxin content was available.

We believe that the quantitative quality control of final products would be meaningful in this regard. 4-3-I-3. Necessary cautions for substituting a test method: Introduction of a new test method, particularly of a toxiclty test, requlreS Careful validation. ln the case of the endotoxin test, at very least a limit value f\u0082\u00edr approval or rejection should be implemented so as not to approve a product that should have been rejected in the pyrogen test because safety of such products has not been proved clinically. The results of the different assays will inevitably vary. Thus the new limit should be defined so as not to falsely approve a pyrogenic product even when its endotoxin test result shows a maximal variation. From the polnt Of view of statistics, the extent of variation or accuracy or an assay result would depend on the test design, lnCluding the number ordoses and their intervals. Use of a smaller number or doses or intervals will produce less accurate results. Consequently, the limit for rejection or acceptance should not be defined according to the ordinal significance-of-difference bases to avoid a better chance ofapproval due to a less accurate measurement. hstead, the limit should be defined according to the allowable varia- tion of results under a defined accuracy, therefore a defined design, of a test. In addition, special care should be taken when substitutlng an in vitro test f\u0081\u00f3r an in vivo test. An in vitro test generally cannot detect a possible in vivo synerglStic e\u0088\u00b9ct of vaccine constituents on the target toxic activity\u00a5 It mTy require a preliminary quantitative evaluatlOn Of the synerglSm tO define the limit value not only f\u0081\u00f3r regulating the amount or toxic substance but also to regulate the extent of the resulting toxic effect. The prescribed limits of endotoxin contamination in interferon Injections, human albumin and purified plasma protein fraction lnJ eCtionsinthe Minimum RequlrementS Were defined by taking the synerglStic effect and variation of the test results into consideration so as not to allow the approval of possibly pyrogenic products (22)\u00a5 In the case of endotoxin in DTaP vacclneS, nO SynergyStic effect has been detected so far. Therefore, it would seem reasonable to set the limit for endotoxin so as not to allow approval of a batch that has not been emplnCally shown to be safe - i.e., one that may contain excess endotoxin than previous batches. 4-3-2. LP activity Leukocytosis or lymphocytosis is a characteristic symptom of whooping cough patients and PT isknown as the responsible agent. Leukocytosis can be induced in mice by whole cell pertussis vaccine or PT, and a method for quantitative measure- ment of the actiyitywas described by Kurokaw.a pt al\u00a5 (101)\u00a5 The assay was lmPlemented for testing the toxIClty Of DTaP vaccine in Minimum RequlrementS in 1 98 1. The activlty Can be assayed quantitatively ln mice by comparlng peripheral leukocytosis induced by a vaccine batch with that induced by the serial dilutions of the reference vaccine on the third day of injection. Figure 6 represents accumulated results of the assay on commercial DTaP and DTwP vaccines. The LP activity of the acellular vaccines was also shown to have been reduced to approximately one-tenth that of whole cell vaccines. The LP activities ormost of the DTaP vaccines of the early 1980s were over 0.25 LPU/ml, but these values declined to a 0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@05432 \u0081T3uanbeJj -1.0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@-0.5\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@0.0\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@0.5 Log-LPU/ml Fig. 6. was reduced to 1/10 that orDTwP vaccines. level below or equal to the sensitivlty limit. Accordingly, lt would be regarded possible currently to simplify the test adequately, Instead of carrylng Out a quantitative measurement, to prove only that the activlty Of a batch of DTaP vaccine does not significantly exceed the sensitivity limit under a valid test condition. Fur\u0090\u00e5emore, it would be assumed possible to discontinue the test if LP activity was proved to be more labile to the treatment of detoxification than HS activity under any possible variation of the detoxifying process. 4-3-3. HS activity As we attempted to develop acellular vaccines with average toxicities of less than one tenth of the average of whole cell vaccines, we faced a serious difrlCulty. Particularly for HS toxicity, the traditional assay method us\u0092\u0086g HSD was found not adequate due to its insufficient sensltlVity and accuracy even in mice of the HSFS/N line of the N:NIH(SW) strain, which are suggested to be the most sensitive to HS activlty (102)\u00a5 A highly sensitive and accurate assay method for HS activity in which rectal temperature change lS measured a\u0090\u00f4er histamine challenge on the fourthday of vaccine Injection was developed by lshida et al. in 1979 (2 I). The rectal temperature method was sensi.tive enough for quantifying even the activity of vaccines causlng nO HSD. Figure 7 shows the frequency distribution of HS activlty OfDTaP and DTwP vaccines. The sensitivity limit (HSDIO) and the median sensitizing dose (HSD50) forthe method ofHSD and the sensitivity limit for the rectal temperature method are also shown in the figure together with the current acceptance/rejection limit for DTaP vaccines. The regulation limit f\u0082\u00edr HS activlty lmplemented in 1981 was 0.8 HSU/ml, and was revised to the cu\u0092\u00f3ent 0.4 HSU/ml in 1991. The average HS activlty OfDTaP vaccines was shown to be less than one tenth of the average ofwhole cell vaccines. A commercial batch or DTaP vaccine with considerable HS activlty Was assayed repeatedly five times by the rectal temperature method and by the method of sensitizlng death. Although both methods were shown to be highly reproducible, the rectal temperature method was found to have a slgnificantly better accuracy than the sensitizlng death method, as seen in Fig\u00a5 8\u00a5 This finding emphasizes the advantage of the measure\u0088\u00ea me\u0082\u00eat on continuous variables, such as rectal temperature, rather than discrete variables, such as survival rate, which gives only one data uslng Several animals.

Both methods were proven to be highly reproducible. The rectal temperature method was shown to be more accurate thanthe HSD method and was suggested to requlrC a smaller numb(\u0092\u00f3Oranimals. In the mid-1980S, it was discovered that the chemically detoxified PT in DTaP vaccines may r?vert to toxicity during long storage, and the Minimum RequlrementS Were revised accordingly in 1991 to implement the relevant toxicity test, namely, the HS test f\u0081\u00f3r the incubated preparation in which a vaccine is tested after incubating at 37oC for 4 weeks.lmple- mentation of the new regulation had a considerable effect on the residual HS activity Of DTaP vaccines. The level of the residual activlty declined remarkably after 1990 Without slgnificant change in potency, as measured by the modified Kendrick test. Furthermore, no slgnificant change in the clinical efficacy ofDTaP vaccines was noted, as seen in Fig. 1. This might suggest that the modified Kendrick test could beused to evaluate the effects of a modification of the production process, if any, on the potency of acellular pertussis vaccines. 4.5 4.4 4.3 =\u0083q 4.1 4.0 3.9 3.8 0.01 0.1\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@1\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@\u0081@1 HSU/ml Fig. 9.

The incubation was shown to markedly increase the LHS activity, While no effect could be detected for the HS activlty measured on the fourth day of sensitization. The clinical relevance or HS activlty Was also analyzed using the accumulated data of the activityofcommercial DTaP vaccines. Both HS activities measured on the fourth and I lth days of sensitization showed a slgni\u008bucant co\u0092\u00f3elation with the rate of erythema of over 10 mm in diameter among pnmary- dose vaccinees, as shown in Fig. 9. A better co\u0092\u00f3elation was seen with L\u008foS activity than with the activity of ordinal fbur- day sensitization. Although the mechanism of the delayed HS by DTaP vaccines has not yet been clarified, these findings might suggest that f\u0082\u00edur-day sensitization is not adequate f\u0081\u00f3r hamster ovary (CHO) cell clustering test Hewlett et al.

The assay method was prescribed in the WHO Guidelines in 1998 as a sensitive technique f\u0081\u00f3r evaluat- lng the detoxification of PT.

However, this method might beuseful for ensurlng the purity of the culture ofB. pertussis producing genetically detoxified PT.

Conclusion Acellular pertussis vaccines or various f\u0082\u00edrmulations are currently available. A clinically relevant method or testlng their potency lS required in order that vaccines of different brands can be used interchangeably in the course of primary and booster irrmunizations. A clinical study similar to the MRC trial on vaccines with widely different potencies will be needed to establish the quantitative clinical relevance of potency-test- lng methods such as the Kendrick test. Cumntly, however, such clinical trials are not possible. Because the Kendrick test is the only method with proven clinical relevance for testing whole cell vaccines, it will be of particular importance to analyze the mechanism of the Kendrick test to open the way for its application to acellular pertussis vaccines. The role of PT ill both the Kendrick testand clinical protection and the fact that the current intra-muscular is not appropnate Ofthe Kendrick test. Eradication of tetanusis desperately hoped for and diphtheria would once again become epidemic if effective immuniza- tion was lost (67,93). In addition, because safetyis a concem due to the potential f\u0082\u00edr over-immunization, the potency of toxoid vaccines needs to be precisely controlled\u00a5 And although such control presents many difrlCulties, there also seem to be viable solutions, as discussed in this paper. Toxicity tests for ya?cines need to be implemented for every detectable toxic actlVlty, With the exceptlOn Of those shown to have no clinical relevance. The efrlCaCy Of every toxIClty test also needs to be carefully validated through a consider- ation of its possible mechanisms. It is of particular importance to ensure a definite correlation with the relevant in vivo test before introducing an in vitro test method. In addition, before replacing a traditional test with a new testing method, it is crucial to define the limit for acceptance/rejection so as not to approve a product that should have been rejected in the traditional test. Quantitative test results are essential for establishing clinical relevance. However, tests could be simpli\u0088\u00ea \u0093\u00caed approprlately to prove only not slgnificantly exceeding the least detectable level ira toxicity of products was reduced to below the detectable limit.
