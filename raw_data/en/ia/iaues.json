The staff was very friendly and informative. We were able to choose colors and watch the entire process, blowing the glass when instructed.

Kids will love this place! A must see in Texas!!Written April 1, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - Certainly worth a drop in if you are spending some time in Salado. I can't tell you that there was anything in particular that I found of interest, but they do have a variety of houseware, knickknack, and other items. The couple of things that I took some interest in, seemed to me to be fully priced, in other words, no special deals that I could tell.Written March 23, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - Anyone who loves different unique clothes and jewelry and one of a kind local artist at reasonable prices this is your place. Anytime I come to visit this area have to stop here to see what new items are here. On top of that owner is one of the sweetest people and knows her customers as to what they are looking for. Don't pass this place up.Written February 1, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - I lost my wedding band a few years ago and was devastated. My band was rather unique and to replace it would have cost more than double of what we paid for it back in 1982. I had some pieces of gold that I hadn't worn in years, so I came up with the idea of having made. I found Frankie's website and sent her an email, telling her the story of my lost band. She answered so quickly and was so positive and sweet, I decided to go see her (we traveled from the Tyler area). When we took the gold (my daughter and son-in-law also contributed gold for by band) to her, she spent a lot of time with me picking my brain about EXACTLY what I wanted. We picked up my ring this past weekend and I couldn't be more pleased! I actually love it even more than my original band! It has gold in it from those I love most! The sadness and hurt from losing my original band has been made so much better with my new one! I can't thank her enough! Also the price to make it was extremely reasonable for the quality of work! She has beautiful pieces of jewelry in her store, that she makes! I will be coming back to shop for sure!!!Written October 30, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - This store has extremely high quality pieces. This is not a typical antique mall or junk shop type of place. It is also not one of those places catering to decorators with expensive European seconds. And while most if not all of the stuff is beyond my limited finances, I'll continue to visit when I'm in Salado just to see what treasures the owner has managed to get her hands on. It really is a spectacular place to explore. Also - visit with the owner - she's delightful.Written June 9, 2019This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Tripadvisor performs checks on reviews. - This is a wellness-type shop. If you have a mysterious ailment that puzzles your traditional doctor, or if you are experienced with natural remedies, then you will enjoy this shop. It has vitamins, herbal capsules, essential oils, homeopathic, and more. The front of the shop also has gifts. They have tests that they can give you and a consultation regarding the tests if you need to try to determine the source of whatever ails you (there is a charge, but it's a comprehensive evaluation and one of our group found it very helpful to have this done). Lots of unique health items, such as inserts for your pillows to help you sleep better (with lavender, for example), small packs with arnica in three powers (for pain--if you don't know what arnica is, then you will Really come to appreciate this item if you don't wish to suffer from bruises or muscle strain, for arnica is among the best and most highly recommended of all homeopathic medicine). They had a chlorophyll sample on the day we went. They have some Chinese remedies here as well. If you have an ailment, there is something for most ailments, books and information aplenty here, and the staff is very knowledgeable. We were three people, so we spent around an hour exploring options for whatever our needs, whether it was difficulty sleeping, stress from work, or serious health concerns that were puzzling doctors and were therefore going untreated. The shop isn't gigantic, though it has plenty of products to explore, and it had products I would be unable to purchase even at most large grocery stores' health food sections in Austin. Kudos to the owner for kindness. They have some wild hours: 1 p.m.-5 p.m. most days (hey, this is a small town) and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. on Saturday only. So, we got there early on a day she doesn't normally open in the morning. She opened up for us anyway, and then cancelled an appointment she had made to finish up with us, so that was very kind and the way you would hope a store owner would care for you.Written September 19, 2014This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
