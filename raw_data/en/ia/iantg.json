Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument ofthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing ofcialrulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and forpublishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conven-tions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of generalinterest. It is published weekly. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform applicationof the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke,modify, or amend any of those previously published in theBulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless other-wise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internalmanagement are not published; however, statements of inter-nal practices and procedures that affect the rights and dutiesof taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in therevenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings totaxpayers or technical advice to Service eld ofces, identify-ing details and information of a condential nature are deletedto prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply withstatutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but theymay be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not berelied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel inthe disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings andprocedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations,court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered,and Service personnel and others concerned are cautionedagainst reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:Part I.\u20141986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions ofthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.\u2014Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, TaxConventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legisla-tion and Related Committee Reports. Part III.\u2014Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to thesesubjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Alsoincluded in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rul-ings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued bythe Department of the Treasury's Ofce of the Assistant Sec-retary (Enforcement). Part IV.\u2014Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbar-ment and suspension lists, and announcements. The last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. Thesemonthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and arepublished in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50Part I. Rulings and Decisions Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 Section 995.\u2014Taxation of DISC Income toShareholders 2018 Base Period T-Bill Rate. The \"base period T-bill rate\" for the period ending September 30,2018, is published as required by section 995(f) ofthe Internal Revenue Code. Rev. Rul. 2018-31 Section 995(f)(1) of the Internal Reve- nue Code provides that a shareholder of adomestic international sales corporation(\"DISC\") shall pay interest each taxableyear in an amount equal to the product ofthe \"shareholder's deferredtax liability\" period T-bill rate is the annual rate ofinterest determined by the Secretary to beequivalent to the average of the 1-yearconstant maturity Treasury yields, as pub-lished by the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System, for the 1-yearperiod ending on September 30 of thecalendar year ending with (or the mostrecent calendar year ending before) theclose of the taxable year of the share-holder. The base period T-bill rate for the pe- riod ending September 30, 2018, is 2.06percent. Pursuant to section 6622 of the Internal Revenue Code, interest must be com-pounded daily. The table below providesfactors for compounding the 2018 baseperiod T-bill rate daily for any number ofdays in the shareholder's taxable year (in-cluding for a 52-53 week accounting pe-riod). To compute the amount of the in-terest charge for the shareholder's taxableyear, multiply the amount of the share-holder's DISC-related deferred tax liabil-ity for that year by the base period T-billrate factor corresponding to the number ofdays in the shareholder's taxable year forwhich the interest charge is being com-puted. Generally, one would use the factorfor 365 days. One would use a differentfactor only if the shareholder's taxableyear for which the interest charge is beingdetermined is a short taxable year, if theshareholder uses a 52-53 week taxable year, or if the shareholder's taxable year isa leap year. For the base period T-bill rates for periods ending in prior years, see 826. DRAFTING INFORMATION The principal author of this revenue ruling is Lorraine S.

Purpose The primary purpose of this rule is to nalize, with changes in response to pub-lic comments, the interim nal regulationswith requests for comments (IFCs) pub-lished in the Federal Register on October 13, 2017 (82 FR 47792), \"Religious Ex-emptions and Accommodations for Cov-erage ServicesUnder the Affordable Care Act\" (the Re-ligious IFC). The rules are necessary toexpand the protections for the sincerelyheld religious objections of certain entitiesand individuals. The rules, thus, minimizethe burdens imposed on their exercise ofreligious beliefs, with regard to the discre-tionary requirement that health planscover certain contraceptive services withno cost-sharing, a requirement that wascreated by HHS through guidance pro-mulgated by the Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA) (herein-after \"Guidelines\"), pursuant to authoritygranted by the ACA in section 2713(a)(4)of the Public Health Service Act. In addi-tion, the rules maintain a previously cre-ated accommodation process that permitsentities with certain religious objectionsvoluntarily to continue to object while thepersons covered in their plans receivecontraceptive coverage or payments ar-ranged by their health insurance issuers orthird party administrators. The rules donot remove the contraceptive coverage re-quirement generally from HRSA's Guide-lines. The changes being nalized to theserules will ensure that proper respect isafforded to sincerely held religious objec-tions in rules governing this area of healthinsurance and coverage, with minimal im-pact on HRSA's decision to otherwise re-quire contraceptive coverage. 2. Summary of the Major Provisions a. Expanded religious exemptions to the contraceptive coverage requirement These rules nalize exemptions pro- vided in the Religious IFC for the grouphealth plans and health insurance cover-age of various entities and individuals December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 852with sincerely held religious beliefs op- posed to coverage of some or all contra-ceptive or sterilization methods encom-passed by HRSA's Guidelines. The rulesnalize exemptions to the same types oforganizatons and individuals for whichexemptions were provided in the Religious IFC: non-governmental plan sponsors in-cluding a church, an integrated auxiliary of achurch, a convention or association of churches, or a religious order; a nonprotorganization; for-prot entities; an institu-tion of higher education in arranging studenthealth insurance coverage; and, in certaincircumstances, issuers and individuals. Therules also nalize the regulatory restatementin the Religious IFC of language from sec-tion 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the Public HealthService Act. In response to public comments, vari- ous changes are made to clarify the in-tended scope of the language in the Reli-gious IFC. The prefatory language to theexemptions is claried to ensure exemp-tions apply to a group health plan estab-lished or maintained by an objecting or-ganization, or health insurance coverageoffered or arranged by an objecting orga-nization, to the extent of the objections.The Departments add language to clarifythat, where an exemption encompasses aplan or coverage established or main-tained by a church, an integrated auxiliaryof a church, a convention or association ofchurches, a religious order, a nonprotorganization, or other non-governmentalorganization or association, the exemptionapplies to each employer, organization, orplan sponsor that adopts the plan. Lan-guage is also added to clarify that theexemptions apply to non-governmentalentities, including as the exemptions ap-ply to institutions of higher education. TheDepartments revise the exemption appli-cable to health insurance issuers to makeclear that the group health plan estab-lished or maintained by the plan sponsorwith which the health insurance issuercontracts remains subject to any require-ment to provide coverage for contracep-tive services under Guidelines issued un-der \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless it is alsoexempt from that requirement. The De-partments also restructure the provisiondescribing the religious objection for en-tities. That provision species that the en- tity objects, based on its sincerely heldreligious beliefs, to its establishing, main-taining, providing, offering, or arrangingfor either: coverage or payments for someor all contraceptive services; or, a plan,issuer, or third party administrator thatprovides or arranges such coverage orpayments. The Departments also clarify language in the exemption applicable to plans ofobjecting individuals. The nal rule spec-ies that the individual exemption ensuresthat the HRSA Guidelines do not preventa willing health insurance issuer offeringgroup or individual health insurance cov-erage, and as applicable, a willing plansponsor of a group health plan, from of-fering a separate policy, certicate or con-tract of insurance or a separate grouphealth plan or benet package option, toany group health plan sponsor (with re-spect to an individual) or individual, asapplicable, who objects to coverage orpayments for some or all contraceptiveservices based on sincerely held religiousbeliefs. The exemption adds that, if anindividual objects to some but not all con-traceptive services, but the issuer, and asapplicable, plan sponsor, are willing toprovide the plan sponsor or individual, asapplicable, with a separate policy, certi-cate or contract of insurance or a separategroup health plan or benet package op-tion that omits all contraceptives, and theindividual agrees, then the exemption ap-plies as if the individual objects to allcontraceptive services. b. Optional accommodation. These rules also nalize provisions from the Religious IFC that maintain theaccommodation process as an optionalprocess for entities that qualify for theexemption. Under that process, entitiescan choose to use the accommodation pro-cess so that contraceptive coverage towhich they object is omitted from theirplan, but their issuer or third party admin-istrator, as applicable, will arrange for thepersons covered by their plan to receivecontraceptive coverage or payments. In response to public comments, these nal rules make technical changes to theaccommodation regulations maintained in parallel by HHS, the Department of La-bor, and the Department of the Treasury.The Departments modify the regulationsgoverning when an entity, that was usingor will use the accommodation, can re-voke the accommodation and operate un-der the exemption. The modications setforth a transitional rule as to when entitiescurrently using the accommodation may revoke it and use the exemption by giving60-days notice pursuant to Public HealthService Act section CFR 2590.715-2715(b). modica-tions also express a general rule that, in planyears that begin after the date on whichthese nal rules go into effect, if contracep-tive coverage is being offered by an issueror third party administrator through the ac-commodation process, an organization eli-gible for the accommodation may revoke itsuse of the accommodation process effectiveno sooner than the rst day of the rst planyear that begins on or after 30 days after thedate of the revocation. The Departments also modify the Re- ligious IFC by adding a provision thatexisted in rules prior to the Religious IFC,namely, that if an issuer relies reasonablyand in good faith on a representation bythe eligible organization as to its eligibil-ity for the accommodation, and the repre-sentation is later determined to be incor-rect, the issuer is considered to complywith any applicable contraceptive cover-age requirement from HRSA's Guidelinesif the issuer complies with the obligationsunder this section applicable to such is-suer. Likewise, the rule adds pre-existing\"reliance\" language deeming an issuerserving an accommodated organizationcompliant with the contraceptive coveragerequirement if the issuer relies reasonablyand in good faith on a representation by anorganization as to its eligibility for theaccommodation and the issuer otherwisecomplies with the accommodation regula-tion, and likewise deeming a group healthplan compliant with the contraceptivecoverage requirement if it complies withthe accommodation regulation. 3. Summary of Costs, Savings and Benets of the Major Provisions Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 853Provision Savings and Benets Costs Restatement of statutory lan- guage section 2713(a) and(a)(4) of the Public Health Ser-vice ActThe purpose of this provision is to ensure that the regulatory language that restatessection 2713(a) and (a)(4) of the PublicHealth Service Act mirrors the languageof the statute. We estimate no economicsavings or benet from nalizing this partof the rule, but consider it a deregulatoryaction to minimize the regulatory impactbeyond the scope set forth in the statute.We estimate no costs from nalizing this part of the rule. Expanded religious exemptions Expanding religious exemptions to the con- traceptive coverage requirement will relieveburdens that some entities and individualsexperience from being forced to choosebetween, on the one hand, complying withtheir religious beliefs and facing penaltiesfrom failing to comply with the contracep-tive coverage requirement, and on the otherhand, providing (or, for individuals, obtain-ing) contraceptive coverage or using theaccommodation in violation of their sin-cerely held religious beliefs.We estimate there will be transfer costs where women previously receiving contra-ceptive coverage from employers will nolonger receive that coverage where the em-ployers use the expanded exemptions. Evenafter the public comment period, we havevery limited data on what the scale of thosetransfer costs will be. We estimate that inno event will they be more than $68.9 mil-lion. We estimate that, where entities using the accommodation revoke it to use the exemp-tion, the cost to industry of sending noticesof revocation to their policy holders will be$112,163. Optional accommodation regulationsMaintaining the accommodation as an op- tional process will ensure that contraceptivecoverage is made available to many womencovered by plans of employers that objectto contraceptive coverage but not to theirissuers or third party administrators arrang-ing for such coverage to be provided totheir plan participants.We estimate that, by expanding the types of organizations that may use the accom-modation, some entities not currently usingit will opt into it. When doing so they willincur costs of $677 to send a self-certication or notice to their issuer or thirdparty administrator, or to HHS, to com-mence operation of the accommodation. We estimate that entities that newly make use of the accommodation as the result ofthese rules, or their issuers or third partyadministrators, will incur costs of $311,304in providing their policy holders with no-tices indicating that contraceptive coverageor payments are available to them under theaccommodation process. B. Background Over many decades, Congress has pro- tected conscientious objections, includingthose based on religious beliefs, in the context of health care and human servicesincluding health coverage, even as it hassought to promote and expand access to health services. 1In 2010, Congress en- acted the Patient Protection and Afford- 1See, for example , 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting individuals and health care entities from being required to provide or assist sterilizations, abortions, or other law ful health services if it would violate their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); Consolidat ed Appropriations Act of 2018, Div. H, Sec. 507(d) (Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-141, 132 Stat. 348, 764 (Mar. 23, 2018) (p rotecting any \"health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any other kind of heal th care facility, organization, or plan\" in objecting to abortion for any reason); id. at Div. E, Sec. 726(c) (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act) (protecting individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); id.at Div. E, Sec. 808 (regarding any requirement for \"the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans\" in the District of Columbia, \"it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such issue should include a 'conscience cla use' which provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.\"); id. at Div. I, (Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act) (protecting applicants for family planning funds based on their \"religious or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family planning\"); 42 U.S.C. 290bb-36 (prohibiting the statutory secti on from being construed to require suicide-related treatment services for youth where the parents or legal guardians object based on \"religious beliefs or moral objections\"); 42 U.S. C. 290kk-1 (protecting the religious character of organizations participating in certain programs and the religious freedom of beneciaries of the programs); 42 U.S.C. 300x-65 (protecting the re ligious character of organizations and the religious freedom of individuals involved in the use of government funds to provide substance abuse services); 42 U.S.C. 604a (protecting the religi ous character of organizations and the religious freedom of beneciaries involved in the use of government assistance to needy families); 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protecting agains t forced counseling or referrals in Medicare /H11001Choice (now Medicare Advantage) managed care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)(3) (ensuri ng particular Federal December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 854able Care Act (PPACA) (Pub. L. 111- 148) (March 23, 2010). Congress enactedthe Health Care and Education Reconcil-iation Act of 2010 (HCERA) (Pub. L.111-152) on March 30, 2010, which,among other things, amended the PPACA.As amended by HCERA, the PPACA isknown as the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA reorganizes, amends, and adds to the provisions of part A of titleXXVII of the Public Health Service Act(PHS Act) relating to group health plansand health insurance issuers in the groupand individual markets. The ACA addssection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to theInternal Revenue Code (Code), in order toincorporate the provisions of part A oftitle XXVII of the PHS Act into ERISAand the Code, and to make them applica-ble to group health plans and health insur-ance issuers providing health insurance coverage in connection with group healthplans. The sections of the PHS Act incor-porated into ERISA and the Code are sec-tions 2701 through 2728. In 2713(a)(4) of (hereinafter \"section 2713(a)(4)\"), Con-gress provided administrative discretionto require that certain group health plansand health insurance issuers cover certainwomen's preventive services, in additionto other preventive services required to becovered in section 2713. Congress grantedthat discretion to the Health Resourcesand Services Administration (HRSA), acomponent of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services (HHS). Spe- cically, section 2713(a)(4) allows HRSAdiscretion to specify coverage require- ments, \"with respect to women, such addi-tional preventive care and screening s...a s provided for in comprehensive guidelinessupported by\" HRSA's Guidelines. Since 2011, HRSA has exercised that discretion to require coverage for, amongother things, certain contraceptive ser-vices. 2In the same time period, the De- partments of Health and Human Services(HHS), Labor, and the Treasury (collec-tively, \"the Departments\" 3) have promul- gated regulations to guide HRSA in exer-cising its discretion to allow exemptionsto those requirements, including issuingand nalizing three interim nal regula-tions prior to 2017. 4In those regulations, the Departments dened the scope of per-missible exemptions and accommodationsfor certain religious objectors where theGuidelines require coverage of contracep- tive services, changed the scope of thoseexemptions and accommodations, and so-licited public comments on a number ofoccasions. Many individuals and entitiesbrought legal challenges to the contracep-tive coverage requirement and regulations(hereinafter, the \"contraceptive Mandate,\"or the \"Mandate\") as being inconsistentwith Freedom Restoration Act,42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1 (\"RFRA\"). Severalof those cases went to the Supreme Court.See, for example ,Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. S. (2016).The Departments most recently solicited public comments on these issues again intwo interim nal regulations with requestsfor comments (IFCs) published in the Fed- eral Register 13, 2017: the reg- ulations (82 FR 47792) that are being nal-ized with changes here, and regulations (82FR 47838) concerning moral objections (theMoral IFC), which are being nalized withchanges in companion nal rules publishedelsewhere in today's Federal Register . In the preamble to the Religious IFC, the Departments explained several rea-sons why it was appropriate to reevaluatethe religious exemptions and accommoda-tions for the contraceptive M andate and to take into account the religious beliefs ofcertain employers concerning that Man-date. The Departments also sought pub-lic comment on those modications. TheDepartments considered, among otherthings, Congress's history of providingprotections for religious beliefs regard- ing certain health services (including con-traception, sterilization, and items or ser-vices believed to involve abortion); the text,context, and intent of section 2713(a)(4) andthe ACA; protection of the free exercise ofreligion in the First Amendment and, byCongress, in RFRA; Executive Order13798, \"Promoting Free 2017); previouslysubmitted public comments; and the exten-sive litigation over the contraceptive Man-date. After consideration of the comments and feedback received from stakeholders,the Departments are nalizing the Reli- law does not infringe on \"conscience\" as protected in state law concerning advance directives); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicaid managed care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 5106i (prohibiting certain Federal statutes from bei ng construed to require that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian); 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b) ( protecting objection to abortion funding in legal services assistance grants based on \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 14406 (protecting organizations and health provi ders from being required to inform or counsel persons pertaining to assisted suicide); 42 U.S.C. 18023 (blocking any requirement that issuers or exchanges must cover abortion); 42 U.S.C. 18113 ( protecting health plans or health providers from being required to provide an item or service that helps cause assisted suicide); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(g) (protecting vaccination obj ections by \"aliens\" beliefs or moral convictions\"); 18 U.S.C. 3597 (protecting objectors to participation in Federal executions based on \"moral or religious convictions\"); 20 U.S.C. 1688 (prohibiting sex discrimination law to be used to require assistance in abortion for any reason); 22 U.S.C. 7631(d) (protecting entities from being required to use HIV/AIDS funds cont rary to their \"religious or moral \"contraceptive,\" \"contraceptive coverage,\" or \"contraceptive services\" generally include a ll contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and counseling, required by the Women's Preventive Guidelines, unless otherwise indicated.

Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 855gious IFC, with changes based on com- ments as indicated herein.5 II. Overview, Analysis, and Response to Public Comments We provided a 60-day public comment period for the Religious IFC, which closedon December 5, 2017. The D epartments received over 56,000 public commentsubmissions, which are posted at www.regulations.gov. 6Below, the Depart- ments provide an overview of the gen-eral comments on the nal regulations,and address the issues raised by com-menters. These rules expand exemptions to pro- tect religious beliefs for certain entitiesand individuals with religious objectionsto contraception whose health plans aresubject to a mandate of contraceptive cov- erage through guidance issued pursuant tothe ACA. These rules do not alter the dis-cretion of HRSA, a component of HHS, tomaintain the Guidelines requiring contra-ceptive coverage where no regulatorily rec-ognized objection exists. These rules nal-ize the accommodation process, which waspreviously established in response to objec-tions of religious organizations that were notprotected by the original exemption, as anoptional process for any exempt entities.These rules do not alter multiple other fed-eral programs that provide free or subsi-dized contraceptives or related educationand counseling for women at risk of unin-tended pregnancy. 7 A. The Departments' Authority to Mandate Coverage and ProvideReligious Exemptions The Departments received conflicting comments on their legal authority to pro-vide the expanded exemptions and accom-modation for religious beliefs. Some com-menters agreed that the Departments are legally authorized to provide the expandedexemptions and accommodation, noting thatthere was no requirement of contraceptivecoverage in the ACA and no prohibition onproviding religious exemptions in Guide-lines issued under section 2713(a)(4). Othercommenters, however, asserted that the De-partments have no legal authority to provideany exemptions to the contraceptive Man-date, contending, based on statements in theACA's legislative history, that the ACA re-quires contraceptive coverage. Still othercommenters contended that the Depart-ments are legally authorized to provide theexemptions that existed prior to the Reli-gious IFC, but not to expand them. Some commenters who argued that section 2713(a)(4) does not allow for ex-emptions said that the previous exemp-tions for houses of worship and integratedauxiliaries, and the previous accommoda-tion process, were set forth in the ACAitself, and therefore were acceptable whilethe expanded exemptions in the ReligiousIFC were not. This is incorrect. The ACAdoes not prescribe (or prohibit) the previ-ous exemptions for house of worship andthe accommodation processes that the De-partments issued through regulations. 8 The Departments, therefore, nd it appro-priate to use the regulatory process to is-sue these expanded exemptions and ac-commodation, to better address concernsabout religious exercise. The Departments conclude that legal authority exists to provide the expandedexemptions and accommodation for reli-gious beliefs set forth in these nal rules.These rules concern section 2713 of the PHS Act, as also incorporated into ERISAand the Code. Congress has granted theDepartments legal authority, collectively,to administer these statutes. 9Where it applies, section 2713(a)(4) re- quires coverage without cost sharing for\"such developed byHHS through HRSA. When Congress en-acted this provision, those Guidelines didnot exist. And nothing in the statute man-dated that the Guidelines had to includecontraception, let alone for all types ofemployers with covered plans. Instead,section 2713(a)(4) provided a positivegrant of authority for HSRA to developthose Guidelines, thus delegating author-ity to HHS, as the administering agency ofHRSA, and to all three agencies, as theadministering agencies of the statutes bywhich the Guidelines are enforced, to shape that development. See26 9834; 29 U.S.C. 1191(c), for HHS, as HRSA is a com-ponent of HHS that was unilaterally createdby the agency and thus is subject to theagency's general supervision, see47 FR 38,409 (August 31, 1982). HRSA from creating an exemp-tion from otherwise-applicable Guidelinesor prevented HHS and the other agenciesfrom directing that HRSA create such anexemption. Congress did not specify the extent to which HRSA must \"provide for\" and \"sup-port\" the application of Guidelines adopt. HRSA's authority to sup-port \"comprehensive guidelines\" involvesdetermining both the types of coverage andscope of that coverage. Section 2714(a)(4)requires coverage for preventive servicesonly \"as provided for in comprehensiveguidelines supported by [HRSA].\" That is,services are required to be included in cov-erage only to the extent that the Guidelinessupported by HRSA provide for them.Through use of the word \"as\" in the phrase\"as provided for,\" it requires that HRSA 5The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published proposed and temporary regulations as part of the joint rulemaking of the Religious IFC. The Departments of Labor and HHS published their respective rules as interim nal rules with request for comments and are nalizing their interim nal rules. The Depar tment of the Treasury and IRS are nalizing those submissions included form letters or attachments that, while not separately tabulated at regulations.gov, together included comments from, or were signed by, hundreds of thousands of s eparate persons. The Departments reviewed all of the public comments and attachments. 7See, for example , Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300 et seq .; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, Public Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 703; 42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq .; the Indian Health Service, 25 U.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), and 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq .; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), and (i); the NIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713. 8The ACA also does not require that contraceptives be covered under the preventive services provisions. 926 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 1191c; 42 U.S.C. 300gg-92. December Bulletin No. 2018-50 856support how those services apply\u2014that is, the manner in which the support will hap-pen, such as in the phrase \"as you like it.\" 10 When Congress means to require certainactivities to occur in a certain manner, in-stead of simply authorizing the agency todecide the manner in which they will occur,Congress knows how to do so. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1395x (\"The Secretary shall estab-lish procedures to make beneciaries andproviders aware of the requirement that abeneciary complete a health risk assess-ment prior to or at the same time as receiv- ing personalized prevention plan services.\")(emphasis added). Thus, the inclusion of\"as\" in section 300gg-13(a)(3), and its ab-sence in similar neighboring provisions,shows that HRSA has been granted discre-tion in supporting how the preventive cov-erage mandate applies\u2014it does not refer tothe timing of the promulgation of the Guide-lines. Nor is it simply a textual aberration that the word \"as\" is missing from theother three provisions in PHS Act section2713(a). Rather, this difference mirrors other distinctions within that section thatdemonstrate that Congress intended HRSAto have the discretion the Agencies invoke.For example, sections (a)(1) and (a)(3)require \"evidence-based\" or \"evidence-informed\" coverage, while section (a)(4)does not. This difference suggests that theAgencies have the leeway to incorporatepolicy-based concerns into their decision-making. This reading of section 2713(a)(4)also prevents the statute from being inter-preted in a cramped way that allows noflexibility or tailoring, and that would force the Departments to choose between ignor-ing religious objections in violation ofRFRA or else eliminating the contraceptivecoverage requirement from the Guidelinesaltogether. The Departments instead inter-pret section 2713(a)(4) as authorizingHRSA's Guidelines to set forth both thekinds of items and services that will becovered, and the scope of entities to whichthe contraceptive coverage requirement inthose Guidelines will apply. The religious objections at issue here, and in regulations providing exemptionsfrom the inception of the Mandate in2011, are considerations that, consistentwith the statutory provision, permissiblyinform what HHS, through HRSA, de- cides to provide for and support in the Guidelines. Since the rst rulemaking onthis subject in 2011, the Departments haveconsistently interpreted the broad discretiongranted to HRSA in section 2713(a)(4) asincluding the power to reconcile the ACA'spreventive-services requirement with sin-cerely held views of conscience on the sen-sitive subject of contraceptive coverage\u2014namely, by exempting churches and from the contraceptiveMandate. ( See76 FR at 46623.) the Departments explained at that time, theHRSA Guidelines \"exist solely to bind non-grandfathered group health plans and healthinsurance issuers with respect to the extentof their coverage of certain preventive ser-vices for women,\" and \"it is appropriate thatHRSA . . . takes into account the effect on the religious beliefs of [employers] if cov-erage of contraceptive services were re-quired in [their] group health plans.\" Id. Consistent with that longstanding view,Congress's grant of discretion in section2713(a)(4), and the lack of a specic statu-tory mandate that contraceptives must becovered or that they be covered without anyexemptions or exceptions, supports the con-clusion that the Departments are legally au-thorized to exempt certain entities or plansfrom a contraceptive Mandate if HRSA de-cides to otherwise include contraceptives inits Guidelines. The conclusions on which these nal rules are based are consistent with theDepartments' interpretation of section2713 of the PHS Act since 2010, when theACA was enacted, and since the Depart- ments started to issue interim nal regu-lations implementing that section. TheDepartments have consistently interpretedsection 2713(a)(4)'s grant of authority toinclude broad discretion regarding the ex-tent to which HRSA will provide for, andsupport, the coverage of additional wom-en's preventive care and screenings, in-cluding the decision to exempt certain en-tities and plans, and not to provide for orsupport the application of the Guidelineswith respect to those entities or plans. TheDepartments dened the scope of the ex-emption to the contraceptive Mandatewhen HRSA issued its Guidelines for con-traceptive coverage in 2011, and thenamended and expanded the exemption and added an accommodation process in mul-tiple rulemakings thereafter. The accom-modation process requires the provision of coverage or payments for contraceptives toparticipants in an eligible organization'shealth plan by the organization's insurer orthird party administrator. However, the ac-commodation process itself, in some cases,failed to require contraceptive coverage formany women, because\u2014as the Depart-ments acknowledged at the time\u2014the en-forcement mechanism for that process, sec-tion 3(16) of ERISA, does not provide ameans to impose an obligation to providecontraceptive coverage on the third partyadministrators of self-insured church plans.See80 FR 41323. Non-exempt employers participate in many church plans. Therefore,in both the previous exemption, and in theprevious accommodation's application toself-insured church plans, the Departmentshave been choosing not to require contra-ceptive coverage for certain kinds of em-ployers since the Guidelines were adopted.During prior rulemakings, the Departmentsalso disagreed with commenters who con-tended the Departments had no authority tocreate exemptions under section 2713 of thePHS Act, or as incorporated into ERISAand the Code, and who contended insteadthat we must enforce the Guidelines on thebroadest spectrum of group health plans aspossible. See, e.g. , 2012 nal regulations at 77 FR 8726. The Departments' interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) is conrmed by theACA's statutory structure. Congress didnot intend to require coverage of preven- tive services for every type of plan that issubject to the ACA. See, e.g. ,7 6F R 46623. On the contrary, Congress carvedout an exemption from PHS Act section 2713 (and from several other provi-sions) for grandfathered plans. In con-trast, grandfathered plans do have tocomply with many of the other provi-sions in Title I of the ACA\u2014provisionsreferred to by the previous Administra-tion as providing \"particularly signi-cant 2704, which prohibits preexist-ing condition exclusions or other dis-crimination based on health status in 10See As (usage 2), Oxford English Dictionary Online (Feb. 2018) (\"[u]sed to indicate by comparison the way something happens or is done\"). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 857group health coverage; section 2708, which prohibits excessive waiting peri-ods (as of January 1, 2014); section2711, which relates to lifetime and an-nual dollar limits; section 2712, whichgenerally prohibits rescission of health coverage; section 2714, which extends de-pendent child coverage until the child turns26; and section 2718, which imposes a min-imum medical loss ratio on health insuranceissuers in the individual and group healthinsurance markets, and requires them to pro-vide rebates to policyholders if that medicalloss ratio is not met. (75 FR 34538, 34540, 34542). Consequently, of the 150 mil-lion nonelderly in America withemployer-sponsored health coverage,approximately 25.5 million are esti-mated to be enrolled in grandfatheredplans not subject to section 2713. 11 Some commenters assert the exemptionsfor grandfathered plans are temporary,or were intended to be temporary, but asthe Supreme Court observed, \"there isno legal requirement that grandfatheredplans ever be phased out.\" Hobby Lobby , 134 S. at to imple-menting the ACA consistent with certainconscience laws does not justify creatingexemptions to contraceptive coverage inthe Guidelines, because those laws do notspecically require exemptions to theMandate in the Guidelines. The Depart-ments, however, believe these nal regu-lations are consistent with Executive Or-der 13535. Issued upon the signing of theACA, Executive Order 13535 speciedthat \"longstanding Federal laws to protectconscienc e... remain intact,\" including laws that protect holders of religious be-liefs from certain requirements in healthcare contexts. While the Executive Order13535 does not require the expanded ex-emptions in these rules, the expanded ex-emptions are, as explained below, consis-tent with longstanding federal laws thatprotect religious beliefs, and are consis-tent with the Executive Order's intent thatthe ACA would be implemented in accor-dance with the conscience protections setforth in those laws.The extent to which RFRA provides authority for these nal rules is discussedbelow in section II.C., The First Amend-ment and the Religious Freedom Restora-tion Act. B. Availability and Scope of Religious Exemptions Some commenters supported the ex- panded exemptions and accommodationin the Religious IFC, and the entities andindividuals to which they applied. Theyasserted the expanded exemptions and ac- commodation are appropriate exercises ofdiscretion and are consistent with reli-gious exemptions Congress has providedin many similar contexts. Some furthercommented that the expanded exemptionsare necessary under the First Amendmentor RFRA. Similarly, commenters statedthat the accommodation was an inade-quate means to resolve religious objections, and that the expanded exemptions areneeded. They objected to the accommoda-tion process because it was another methodto require compliance with the Mandate.They contended its self-certication ornotice involved triggering the very contra-ceptive coverage that organizations objectedto, and that such coverage flowed in con-nection with the objecting organizations'health plans. The commenters contendedthat the seamlessness cited by the Depart-ments between contraceptive coverage andan accommodated plan gives rise to the re-ligious objections that organizations wouldnot have with an expanded exemption. Several other commenters asserted that the exemptions in the Religious IFC aretoo narrow and called for there to be nomandate of contraceptive coverage. Someof them contended that HRSA should not include contraceptives in their women's pre-ventive services Guidelines because fertilityand pregnancy are generally healthy condi-tions, not diseases that are appropriately thetarget of preventive health services. Theyalso contended that contraceptives can posemedical risks for women and that studies donot show that contraceptive programs re-duce abortion rates or rates of unintendedpregnancies. Some commenters contendedthat, to the extent the Guidelines requirecoverage of certain drugs and devices that may prevent implantation of an embryo af-ter fertilization, they require coverage ofitems that are abortifacients and, therefore,violate federal conscience protections suchas the Weldon Amendment, seesection 507(d) of Public Law 115-141. Other commenters contended that the expanded exemptions are too broad. Ingeneral, these commenters supported theinclusion of contraceptives in the Guide-lines, contending they are a necessary pre-ventive service for women. Some said thatthe Departments should not exempt vari-ous kinds of entities such as businesses,health insurance issuers, or other plansponsors that are not nonprot entities.Other commenters contended the exemp-tions and accommodation should not beexpanded, but should remain the same asthey were in the July 2015 nal regula-tions (80 FR 41318). Some commenterssaid the Departments should not expandthe exemptions, but simply expand or ad-just the accommodation process to resolve religious objections to the Mandate andaccommodation. Some commenters con-tended that even the previous regulationsallowing an exemption and accommoda-tion were too broad, and said that no ex-emptions to the Mandate should exist, inorder that contraceptive coverage wouldbe provided to as many women as possi-ble. After consideration of the comments, the Departments are nalizing the provi-sions of the Religious IFC without con-tracting the scope of the exemptions andaccommodation set forth in the ReligiousIFC. Since HRSA issued its Guidelines in2011, the Departments have recognizedthat religious exemptions from the contra-ceptive Mandate are appropriate. The de-tails of the scope of such exemptions arediscussed in further detail below. In gen-eral, the Departments conclude it is appro-priate to maintain the exemptions createdby the Religious IFC to avoid instanceswhere the Mandate is applied in a waythat violates the religious beliefs of certainplan sponsors, issuers, or individuals. TheDepartments do not believe the previousexemptions are adequate, because somereligious objections by plan sponsors and 11Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2017 Annual Survey,\" Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (Se pt. 2017), http://les.kff.org/ attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benets-Annual-Survey-2017. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 858individuals were favored with exemp- tions, some were not subjected to contra-ceptive coverage if they fell under theindirect exemption for certain self-insuredchurch plans, and others had to choosebetween the Mandate and the accommo-dation even though they objected to both.The Departments wish to avoid inconsis-tency in respecting religious objections inconnection with the provision of contra-ceptive coverage. The lack of a congressio- nal mandate that contraceptives be covered,much less that they be covered without re-ligious exemptions, has also informed theDepartments' decision to expand the ex-emptions. And Congress's decision not toapply PHS Act section 2713 to grandfa-thered plans has likewise informed the De-partments' decision whether exemptions tothe contraceptive Mandate are appropriate. Congress has also established a back- ground rule against substantially burden-ing sincere religious beliefs except whereconsistent with the stringent requirementsof the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And Congress has consistently providedadditional, specic exemptions for reli-gious beliefs in statutes addressing federalrequirements in the context of health careand specically concerning issues such asabortion, sterilization, and contraception.Therefore, the Departments consider it ap-propriate, to the extent we impose a con-traceptive coverage Mandate by the exer-cise of agency discretion, that we alsoinclude exemptions for the protection ofreligious beliefs in certain cases. The ex-panded exemptions nalized in these rulesare generally consistent with the scope ofexemptions that Congress has establishedin similar contexts. They are also consis-tent with the intent of Executive Order13535 (March 24, 2010), which was is-sued upon the signing of the ACA anddeclared that, \"[u]nder the Act, longstand-ing federal laws to protect conscience(such as the Church Amendment, 42U.S.C. 300a-7, and the Weldon Amend-ment, section 508(d)(1) of Public Law111-8) remain intact\" and that \"[n]umer-ous executive agencies have a role in en-suring that these restrictions are enforced,including the HHS.\"Some commenters argued that Con- gress's failure to explicitly include reli-gious exemptions in PHS Act section2713 itself is indicative of an intent thatsuch exemptions not be included, but theDepartments disagree. As noted above,Congress also failed to require contracep-tive coverage in PHS Act section 2713.And the commenters' argument would ne-gate not just these expanded exemptions,but the previous exemptions for houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries, and theindirect exemption for self-insured churchplans that use the accommodation. WhereCongress left so many matters concerningsection 2713(a)(4) to agency discretion,the Departments consider it appropriate toimplement these expanded exemptions inlight of Congress's long history of re-specting religious beliefs in the context ofcertain federal health care requirements. If there is to be a federal contraceptive mandate that fails to include some\u2014or, inthe views of some commenters, any\u2014religious exemptions, the Departments do not believe it is appropriate for us to im-pose such a regime through discretionaryadministrative measures. Instead, such aserious imposition on religious libertyshould be created, if at all, by Congress, inresponse to citizens exercising their rightsof political participation. Congress did notprohibit religious exemptions under thisMandate. It did not even require contra-ceptive coverage under the ACA. It leftthe ACA subject to RFRA, and it speciedthat additional women's preventive ser-vices will only be required coverage asprovided for in Guidelines supported byHRSA. Moreover, Congress legislated inthe context of the political consensus onconscientious exemptions for health carethat has long been in place. Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, Congress and the states have consistently offered religious ex-emptions for health care providers andothers concerning issues such as steriliza-tion and abortion, which implicate deepdisagreements on scientic, ethical, andreligious (and moral) concerns. Indeedover the last 44 years, Congress has re-peatedly expanded religious exemptionsin similar cases, including to contracep-tive coverage. Congress did not purport to deviate from that approach in the ACA.Thus, we conclude it is appropriate tospecify in these nal rules, that, if theGuidelines continue to maintain a contra-ceptive coverage requirement, the ex-panded exemptions will apply to thoseGuidelines and their enforcement. Some commenters contended that, even though Executive Order 13535 re- fers to the Church Amendments, the in-tention of those statutes is narrow, shouldnot be construed to extend to entities, andshould not be construed to prohibit proce-dures. But those comments mistake theDepartments' position. The Departmentsare not construing the Church Amend-ments to require these exemptions, nor dothe exemptions prohibit any procedures.Instead, through longstanding federal con-science statutes, Congress has establishedconsistent principles concerning respectfor religious beliefs in the context of cer-tain Federal health care requirements. Un-der those principles, and absent any con-trary requirement of law, the Departmentsare offering exemptions for sincerely heldreligious beliefs to the extent the Guide-lines otherwise include contraceptive cov-erage. 12These exemptions do not prohibit any services, nor do they authorize em-ployers to prohibit employees from ob-taining any services. The Religious IFCand these nal rules simply refrain fromimposing the federal Mandate that em-ployers and health insurance issuers covercontraceptives in their health plans wherecompliance with the Mandate would vio-late their sincerely held religious beliefs.And though not necessary to the Depart- ments' decision here, the Departments notethat the Church Amendments explicitly pro-tect entities and that several subsequent fed-eral conscience statutes have protectedagainst federal mandates in health coverage. The Departments note that their deci- sion is also consistent with state practice.A signicant majority of states either im-pose no contraceptive coverage require-ment or offer broader exemptions than theexemption contained in the July 2015 nal 12The Departments note that the Church Amendments are the subject of another, ongoing rulemaking process. SeeProtecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care; Delegations of Authority, 83 FR 3880 (NPRM Jan. 26, 2018). Since the Departments are not construing the Amendments to require the religious exemptions, we defer issu es regarding the scope, interpretation, and protections of the Amendments to HHS in that rulemaking. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 859regulations.13Although the practice of states is not a limit on the discretion del-egated to HRSA by the ACA, nor is it astatement about what the federal govern-ment may do consistent with RFRA orother limitations or protections embodiedin federal law, such state practices caninform the Departments' view that it isappropriate to protect religious liberty asan exercise of agency discretion. The Departments decline to adopt the suggestion of some commenters to usethese nal rules to revoke the contracep-tive Mandate altogether, such as by de-claring that HHS through HRSA shall notinclude contraceptives in the list of wom-en's preventive services in Guidelines is-sued under section 2713(a)(4). Althoughprevious regulations were used to autho-rize religious exemptions and accommo-dations to the imposition of the Guide-lines' coverage of contraception, theissuance of the Guidelines themselves in 2011 describing what items constitute rec-ommended women's preventive services,and the update to those recommendationsin December 2016, did not occur throughthe regulations that preceded the 2017 Re-ligious IFC and these nal rules. TheGuidelines' specication of which wom-en's preventive services were recom-mended were issued, not by regulation,but directly by HRSA, after consultationwith external organizations that operatedunder cooperative agreements with HRSAto consider the issue, solicit public com-ment, and provide recommendations. TheDepartments decline to accept the invita- tion of some commenters to use these rulesto specify whether HRSA includes contra-ceptives in the Guidelines at all. Instead theDepartments conclude it is appropriate forthese rules to continue to focus on restatingthe statutory language of PHS Act section2713 in regulatory form, and delineatingwhat exemptions and accommodations ap-ply if HRSA lists contraceptives in itsGuidelines. Some commenters said that ifcontraceptives are not removed from theGuidelines entirely, some entities or individ-uals with religious objections might notqualify for the exemptions or accommoda- tion. As discussed below, however, the ex-emptions in the Religious IFC and thesenal rules cover a broad range of entitiesand individuals. The Departments are notaware of specic groups or individualswhose religious beliefs would still be sub-stantially burdened by the Mandate after theissuance of these nal rules. Some commenters asserted that HRSA should remove contraceptives from theGuidelines because the Guidelines havenot been subject to the notice and com-ment process under the AdministrativeProcedure Act. Some commenters alsocontended that the Guidelines should beamended to omit items that may prevent(or possibly dislodge) the implantation ofa human embryo after fertilization, in or-der to ensure consistency with conscienceprovisions that prohibit requiring plans topay for or cover abortions. Whether and to what extent the Guide- lines continue to list contraceptives, oritems considered to prevent implantationof an embryo, for entities not subject toexemptions and an accommodation, andwhat process is used to include thoseitems in the Guidelines, is outside thescope of these nal rules. These rules fo-cus on what religious exemptions and ac-commodations shall apply if Guidelinesissued under section 2713(a)(4) includecontraceptives or items considered to beabortifacients. Members of the public that support or oppose the inclusion of some or allcontraceptives in the Guidelines, orwish to comment concerning the contentof, and the process for developing andupdating, the Guidelines, are welcometo communicate their views to HRSA, atwellwomancare@hrsa.gov. The Departments conclude that it would be inadequate to merely attempt toamend or expand the accommodation pro-cess instead of expanding the exemption.In the past, the Departments had stated inour regulations and court briefs that theprevious accommodation process requiredcontraceptive coverage or payments in away that is \"seamless\" with the coverage provided by the objecting employer. As aresult, in signicant respects, that previ-ous accommodation process did not actu-ally accommodate the objections of manyentities, as many entities with religiousobjections have argued. The Departmentshave attempted to identify an accommo-dation process that would eliminate thereligious objections of all plaintiffs, in-cluding seeking public comment througha Request For Information, 81 FR 47741(July 26, 2016), but we stated in January2017 that we were unable to develop suchan approach at that time. 14The Depart- ments continue to believe that, because ofthe nature of the accommodation process,merely amending that accommodationprocess without expanding the exemp-tions would not adequately address reli-gious objections to compliance with theMandate. Instead, we conclude that themost appropriate approach to resolvethese concerns is to expand the exemp-tions as set forth in the Religious IFC andthese nal rules, while maintaining theaccommodation as an option for providingcontraceptive coverage, without forcingentities to choose between compliancewith either the Mandate or the accommo-dation and their religious beliefs. Comments considering the appropri- ateness of exempting certain specickinds of entities or individuals are dis-cussed in more detail below. C. The First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act Some commenters said that the Su- preme Court ruled that the exemptions tothe contraceptive Mandate, which the De-partments previously provided to housesof worship and integrated auxiliaries,were required by the First Amendment.From this, commenters concluded that theexemptions for houses of worship and in-tegrated auxiliaries are legally authorized,but exemptions beyond those are not. ButinHobby Lobby andZubik , the Supreme Court did not decide whether the exemp- 13SeeGuttmacher Institute, \"Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives\", The Guttmacher Institute (June 11, 2018), https://www.guttmacher.org/state-po licy/explore/insurance-coverage- contraceptives. 14SeeDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury, \"FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36,\" (\"the by the Departments in response to the RFI indicate that no feasible approach has been identied at this time that would resolve the co ncerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage\"). December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 860tions previously provided to houses of worship and integrated auxiliaries wererequired by the First Amendment, and theCourt did not say the Departments mustapply the contraceptive Mandate to otherorganizations unless RFRA prohibits theDepartments from doing so. Moreover,the previous church exemption, whichapplied automatically to all churcheswhether or not they had even asserted areligious objection to contraception, 45C.F.R. 147.141(a), is not tailored to anyplausible free-exercise concerns. The De-partments decline to adopt the view thatRFRA does not apply to other religiousorganizations, and there is no logical ex-planation for how RFRA could require thechurch exemption but not this expandedreligious exemption, given that the ac-commodation is no less an available alter-native for the former than the latter. Commenters disagreed about the scope of RFRA's protection in this context.Some commenters said that the expandedexemptions and accommodation are con-sistent with RFRA. Some also said thatthey are required by RFRA, as the Man-date imposes substantial burdens on reli-gious exercise and fails to satisfy thecompelling-interest and least-restrictive-means tests imposed by RFRA. Othercommenters, however, contended that theexpanded exemptions and accommoda-tion are neither required by, nor consistentwith, RFRA. In this vein, some arguedthat the Departments have a compellinginterest to deny religious exemptions, thatthere is no less restrictive means toachieve its goals, or that the Mandate orits accommodation process do not imposea substantial burden on religious exercise. For the reasons discussed below, the Departments believe that agencies chargedwith administering a statute that imposes asubstantial burden on the exercise of reli- gion under RFRA have discretion in deter-mining whether the appropriate response isto provide an exemption from the burden-some requirement, or to merely attempt tocreate an accommodation that would miti-gate the burden. Here, after further consid-eration of these issues and review of thepublic comments, the Departments have de-termined that a broader exemption, ratherthan a mere accommodation, is the appro-priate response.In addition, with respect to religious employers, the Departments concludethat, without nalizing the expanded ex-emptions, and therefore requiring certainreligiously objecting entities to choose be-tween the Mandate, the accommodation,or penalties for noncompliance\u2014or re-quiring objecting individuals to choosebetween purchasing insurance with cover-age to which they object or going withoutinsurance\u2014the Departments would vio-late their rights under RFRA. 1. Discretion to Provide Religious Exemptions In the Religious IFC, we explained that even if RFRA does not compel the De-partments to provide the religious exemp-tions set forth in the IFC, the Departmentsbelieve the exemptions are the most ap-propriate administrative response to thereligious objections that have been raised. The Departments received conflicting comments on this issue. Some comment-ers agreed that the Departments have ad-ministrative discretion to address the reli-gious objections even if the Mandate andaccommodation did not violate RFRA.Other commenters expressed the view thatRFRA does not provide such discretion,but only allows exemptions when RFRArequires exemptions. They contended thatRFRA does not require exemptions forentities covered by the expanded exemp-tions of the Religious IFC, but that sub-jecting those entities to the accommoda-tion satises RFRA, and therefore RFRAprovides the Departments with no addi-tional authority to exempt those entities.Those commenters further contended thatbecause, in their view, section 2713(a)(4)does not authorize the expanded exemp-tions, no statutory authority exists for theDepartments to nalize the expanded ex-emptions. As discussed above, the Departments disagree with the suggestions of com-menters that section 2713(a)(4) does notauthorize the Departments to adopt theexpanded exemptions. Nevertheless, theDepartments note that the expanded ex-emptions for religious objectors also reston an additional, independent ground: TheDepartments have determined that, inlight of RFRA, an expanded exemptionrather than the existing accommodation isthe most appropriate administrative re- sponse to the substantial burden identiedby the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby . Indeed, with respect to at least some ob-jecting entities, an expanded exemption,as opposed to the existing accommoda-tion, is required by RFRA. The Depart-ments disagree with commenters whocontend RFRA does not give the Depart-ments discretion to offer these expandedexemptions. The Departments' determination about their authority under RFRA rests in parton the Departments' reassessment of theinterests served by the application of theMandate in this specic context. Althoughthe Departments previously took the posi-tion that the application of the Mandate toobjecting employers was narrowly tai-lored to serve a compelling governmentalinterest, as discussed below the Depart-ments have now concluded, after reassess-ing the relevant interests and for thereasons stated below, that it does not.Particularly under those circumstances, the Departments believe that agenciescharged with administering a statute thatimposes a substantial burden on the exer-cise of religion under RFRA have discre-tion in determining whether the appropri-ate response is to provide an exemptionfrom the burdensome requirement or in-stead to attempt to create an accommoda-tion that would mitigate the burden. Andhere, the Departments have determinedthat a broader exemption rather than theexisting accommodation is the appropriateresponse. That determination is informedby the Departments' reassessment of therelevant interests, as well as by their de-sire to bring to a close the more than veyears of litigation over RFRA challengesto the Mandate. Although RFRA prohibits the govern- ment from substantially burdening a per-son's religious exercise where doing so isnot the least restrictive means of further-ing a compelling interest\u2014as is the casewith the contraceptive Mandate, pursuanttoHobby Lobby \u2014neither RFRA nor the ACA prescribes the remedy by which the government must eliminate that burden,where any means of doing so will requiredeparting from the ACA to some extent(on the view of some commenters, withwhich the Departments disagree, that sec-tion 2713(a)(4) does not itself authorize Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 861the Departments to recognize exceptions). The prior administration chose to do so through the complex accommodation itcreated, but nothing in RFRA or the ACAcompelled that novel choice or prohibitsthe current administration from employ-ing the more straightforward choice of an exemption\u2014much like the existing and un-challenged exemption for churches. Afterall, on the theory that section 2713(a)(4)allows for no exemptions, the accommoda-tion also departed from section 2713(a)(4)in the sense that employers were not them-selves offering contraceptive coverage, andthe ACA did not require the Departments tochoose that departure rather than the ex-panded exemptions as the exclusive methodto satisfy their obligations under RFRA toeliminate the substantial burden imposed bythe Mandate. The agencies' choice to adoptan exemption in addition to the accommo-dation is particularly reasonable given theexisting legal uncertainty as to whether theaccommodation itself violates RFRA. See 82 Fed. Reg. at 47,798; see also Ricci v. DeStefano , 557 U.S. 586, 585 (2009) (hold- ing that an employer need only have astrong basis to believe that an employmentpractice violates Title VII's disparate impactban in order to take certain types of remedialaction that would otherwise violate TitleVII's disparate-treatment ban). Indeed, ifthe Departments had simply adopted an ex-panded exemption from the outset\u2014as theydid for churches\u2014no one could reasonablyhave argued that doing so was improperbecause they should have invented the ac-commodation instead. Neither RFRA northe ACA compels a different result nowbased merely on path dependence. Although the foregoing analysis is in- dependently sufcient, additional supportfor this view is provided by the Depart-ments' conclusion, as explained morefully below, that an expanded exemptionis required by RFRA for at least someobjectors. In the Religious IFC, the De-partments reafrmed their conclusion thatthere is not a way to satisfy all religious objections by amending the accommoda-tion, (82 FR at 47800), a conclusion thatwas conrmed continued litigation over the accom-modation). 15Some commenters agreed the religious objections could not be sat-ised by amending the accommodationwithout expanding the exemptions, be-cause if the accommodation requires anobjecting entity's issuer or third party ad-ministrator to provide or arrange contra-ceptive coverage for persons covered by the plan because they are covered by theplan, this implicates the objection of entitiesto the coverage being provided through theirown plan, issuer, or third party administra-tor. Other commenters contended the ac-commodation could be modied to satisfyRFRA concerns without extending exemp-tions to objecting entities, but they did notpropose a method of modifying the accom-modation that would, in the view of theDepartments, actually address the religiousobjections to the accommodation. In the Departments' view, after consid- ering all the comments and the precedingyears of contention over this issue, it isappropriate to nalize the expanded ex-emptions rather than merely attempt tochange the accommodation to satisfy reli-gious objections. This is because if theaccommodation still delivers contracep-tive coverage through use of the objectingemployer's plan, issuer, or third party ad-ministrator, it does not address the reli-gious objections. If the accommodationcould deliver contraceptive coverage in-dependent and separate from the objectingemployer's plan, issuer, and third partyadministrator, it could possibly addressthe religious objections, but there are twoproblems with such an approach. First, itwould effectively be an exemption, notthe accommodation as it has existed, so itwould not be a reason not to offer theexpanded exemptions nalized in theserules. Second, although (as explainedabove) the Departments have authority toprovide exemptions to the Mandate, theDepartments are not aware of the author-ity, or of a practical mechanism, for usingsection 2713(a)(4) to require contracep-tive coverage be provided specically to persons covered by an objecting em-ployer, other than by using the employer'splan, issuer, or third party administrator,which would likely violate some entities'religious objections. The Departments are aware of ways in which certain persons cov-ered by an objecting employer might obtaincontraceptive coverage through other gov-ernmental programs or requirements, in-stead of through objecting employers' plans,issuers, or third party administrators, and wemention those elsewhere in this rule. Butthose approaches do not involve the accom-modation, they involve the expanded ex-emptions, plus the access to contraceptivesthrough separate means. 2. Requiring Entities to Choose Between Compliance with the ContraceptiveMandate or the AccommodationViolated RFRA in Many Instances Before the Religious IFC, the Depart- ments had previously contended that theMandate did not impose a substantial bur-den on entities and individuals underRFRA; that it was supported by a compel-ling government interest; and that it was,in combination with the accommodation,the least restrictive means of advancingthat interest. With respect to the coverageMandate itself, apart from the accommo-dation, and as applied to entities with sin-cerely held religious objections, that argu-ment was rejected in Hobby Lobby , which held that the Mandate imposes a substan-tial burden and was not the least restric-tive means of achieving any compellinggovernmental interest. See134 S. Ct. at 2775-79. In the Religious IFC, the De-partments revisited its earlier conclusionsand reached a different view, concludingthat requiring compliance through theMandate or accommodation constituted asubstantial burden on the religious exer-cise of many entities or individuals withreligious objections, did not serve a com-pelling interest, and was not the least re-strictive means of serving a compellinginterest, so that requiring such complianceled to the violation of RFRA in manyinstances. (82 FR at 47806). In general, commenters disagreed about this issue. Some commenters agreed withthe Departments, and with some courts, thatrequiring entities to choose between thecontraceptive Mandate and its accommoda- 15SeeRFI, 81 FR 47741 (July 26, 2016); Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury, \"FAQs, About Affordable Care Act Implementation P art 36,\" (Jan. 9, 2017), https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf and https://www.cms.go v/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/ ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17-Final.pdf (\"the comments reviewed by the Departments in response to the RFI indicate that no feasible approach has been ide ntied at this time that would resolve the concerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive c overage\"). December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 862tion violated their rights under RFRA, be- cause it imposed a substantial burden ontheir religious exercise, did not advance acompelling government interest, and wasnot the least restrictive means of achievingsuch an interest. Other commenters con-tended that requiring compliance either withthe Mandate or the accommodation did notviolate RFRA, agreeing with some courtsthat have concluded the accommodationdoes not substantially burden the religiousexercise of organizations since, in theirview, it does not require organizations tofacilitate contraceptive coverage except bysubmitting a self-certication form or no-tice, and requiring compliance was the leastrestrictive means of advancing the compel-ling interest of providing contraceptive ac-cess to women covered by objecting enti-ties' plans. The Departments have examined fur- ther, including in light of public com-ments, the issue of whether requiringcompliance with the combination of thecontraceptive Mandate and the accommo-dation process imposes a substantial bur-den on entities that object to both, and isthe least restrictive means of advancing acompelling government interest. The De-partments now reafrm the conclusion setforth in the Religious IFC, that requiringcertain religiously objecting entities or in-dividuals to choose between the Mandate,the accommodation, or incurring penaltiesfor noncompliance imposes a substantialburden on religious exercise under RFRA. a. Substantial Burden The Departments concur with the de- scription of substantial burdens expressedrecently by the Department of Justice: A governmental action substantiallyburdens an exercise of religion un-der RFRA if it bans an aspect of anadherent's religious observance orpractice, compels an act inconsis-tent with that observance or prac-tice, or substantially pressures theadherent to modify such observanceor practice.Because the government cannot second-guess the reasonableness of areligious belief or the adherent's as-sessment of the connection between the government mandate and the un-derlying religious belief, the substan-tial burden test focuses on the extentof governmental compulsion in-volved. In general, a government ac-tion that bans an aspect of an adher-ent's religious observance or practice,compels an act inconsistent with that observance or practice, or substan-tially pressures the adherent to modifysuch observance or practice, willqualify as a substantial burden on theexercise of religion. 16 The Mandate and accommodation un- der the previous regulation forced certainnon-exempt religious entities to choosebetween complying with the Mandate,complying with the accommodation, orfacing signicant penalties. Various enti-ties sincerely contended, in litigation or inpublic comments, that complying with ei-ther the Mandate or the accommodationwas inconsistent with their religious ob-servance or practice. The Departmentshave concluded that withholding an ex-emption from those entities has imposed asubstantial burden on their exercise of re-ligion, either by compelling an act incon-sistent with that observance or practice, orby substantially pressuring the adherentsto modify such observance or practice. Tothis extent, the Departments believe thatthe Court's analysis in Hobby Lobby extends, for the purposes of analyzingsubstantial burden, to the burdens that anentity faces when it opposes, on the basisof its religious beliefs, complying with theMandate or participating in the accommo-dation process, and is subject to penaltiesor disadvantages that would have appliedin this context if it chose neither. See also Sharpe Holdings , 801 F.3d at 942. Like- wise, reconsideration of these issues hasalso led the Departments to conclude thatthe Mandate imposes a substantial burdenon the religious beliefs of an individualemployee who opposes coverage of some(or all) contraceptives in his or her plan onthe basis of his or her religious beliefs,and would be able to obtain a plan thatomits contraception from a willing em-ployer or issuer (as applicable), but cannotobtain one solely because the Mandaterequires that employer or issuer to provide a plan that covers all FDA-approved con-traceptives. The Departments disagreewith commenters that contend the accom-modation did not impose a substantialburden on religiously objecting entities,and agree with other commenters andsome courts and judges that concluded theaccommodation can be seen as imposing asubstantial burden on religious exercise inmany instances. b. Compelling Interest Although the Departments previously took the position that the application ofthe Mandate to certain objecting employ-ers was necessary to serve a compellinggovernmental interest, the Departmentshave concluded, after reassessing the rel-evant interests and, in light of the publiccomments received, that it does not. Thisis based on several independent reasons. First, as discussed above, the structure of section 2713(a)(4) and the ACA evincea desire by C ongress to grant a great amount of discretion on the issue ofwhether, and to what extent, to requirecontraceptive coverage in health planspursuant to section 2713(a)(4). This in-forms the Departments' assessment ofwhether the interest in mandating thecoverage constitutes a compelling inter-est, as doing so imposes a substantialburden on religious exercise. As the De-partment of Justice has explained, \"[t]hestrict scrutiny standard applicable toRFRA is exceptionally demanding,\" and\"[o]nly those interests of the highestorder can outweigh legitimate claims tothe free exercise of religion, and suchinterests must be evaluated not in broadgeneralities but as applied to the partic-ular adherent.\" 17 Second, since the day the contraceptive Mandate came into effect in 2011, theMandate has not applied in many circum-stances. To begin, the ACA does not ap-ply the Mandate, or any part of the pre-ventive services coverage requirements, tograndfathered plans. To continue, the De-partments under the last Administrationprovided exemptions to the M andate and expanded those exemptions through multi- 16SeeFederal Law Protections for Religious Liberty, 82 FR (Oct. 26, 2017). 10, 2018 863ple rulemaking processes. Those rulemak- ing processes included an accommodationthat effectively left employees of many non-exempt religious nonprot entities withoutcontraceptive coverage, in particular withrespect to self-insured church plans exemptfrom ERISA. Under the previous accommo-dation, once a self-insured church plan leda self-certication or notice, the accommo-dation relieved it of any further obligationwith respect to contraceptive services cov-erage. Having done so, the accommodationprocess would generally have transferredthe obligation to provide or arrange for con-traceptive coverage to a self-insured plan'sthird party administrator (TPA). But the De-partments recognized that they lack author-ity to compel church plan TPAs to providecontraceptive coverage or levy nes againstthose TPAs for failing to provide it. This isbecause church plans are exempt fromERISA pursuant to section 4(b)(2) ofERISA. Section 2761(a) of the PHS Actprovides that States may enforce the provi-sions of title XXVII of the PHS Act as theypertain to health insurance issuers, but does not apply to church plans that do not providecoverage through a policy issued by a healthinsurance issuer. The combined result ofPHS Act section 2713's authority to removecontraceptive coverage obligations fromself-insured church plans, and HHS's andDOL's lack of authority under the PHS Actor ERISA to require TPAs of those plans toprovide such coverage, led to signicantdisparity in the requirement to provide con-traceptive coverage among nonprot orga-nizations with religious objections to thecoverage. Third party administrators for some, but not all, religious nonprot organiza-tions were subject to enforcement for fail-ure to provide contraceptive coverageunder the accommodation, depending on whether they administer a self-insuredchurch plan. Notably, many of those non-prot organizations were not houses of wor-ship or integrated auxiliaries. Under section3(33)(C) of ERISA, organizations whoseemployees participate in self-insured churchplans need not be churches so long as theyare controlled by or \"share[] common reli-gious bonds and convictions with\" a church or convention or association of churches.The effect is that many similar religiousorganizations were being treated differentlywith respect to their employees receivingcontraceptive coverage based solely onwhether organization employees participatein a church plan. This arrangement encompassed poten- tially hundreds of religious non-prot or-ganizations that were not covered by theexemption for houses of worship and in-tegrated auxiliaries. For example, the De-partments were sued by two large self-insured church plans\u2014Guidestone andChristian Brothers. 18Guidestone is a plan organized by the Southern Baptist con-vention that covers 38,000 employers,some of which are exempt as churches orintegrated auxiliaries, and some of whichare not. Christian Brothers is a plan thatcovers Catholic churches and integratedauxiliaries and has said in litigation that itcovers about 500 additional entities thatare not exempt as churches. In severalother lawsuits challenging the Mandate, the previous Administration took the po-sition that some plans established andmaintained by houses of worship but thatincluded entities that were not integratedauxiliaries, were church plans under sec-tion 3(33) of ERISA and, thus, the Gov-ernment \"has no authority to require theplaintiffs' TPAs to provide contraceptivecoverage at this time.\" Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius , 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). Third, the Departments now believe the administrative record on which theMandate rested was\u2014and remains\u2014in-sufcient to meet the high threshold toestablish a compelling governmental in-terest in ensuring that women covered byplans of objecting organizations receivecost-free contraceptive coverage throughthose plans. The Mandate is not narrowlytailored to advance the government's in-terests and appears both overinclusive andunderinclusive. It includes some entitieswhere a contraceptive coverage require-ment seems unlikely to be effective, suchas religious organizations of certain faiths,which, according to commenters, primar- ily hire persons who agree with their reli-gious views or make their dedication totheir religious views known to potentialemployees who are expected to respectthose views. The Mandate also does notapply to a signicant number of entitiesencompassing many employees and for-prot businesses, such as grandfatheredplans. And it does not appear to target thepopulation dened, at the time the Guide-lines were developed, as being the mostat-risk of unintended pregnancy, that is,\"women who are aged 18 to 24 years andunmarried, who have a low income, whoare not high school graduates, and who aremembers of a racial or ethnic minority.\" 19 Rather than focusing on this group, theMandate is a broad-sweeping requirementacross employer-provided coverage andthe individual and group health insurancemarkets. The Department received conflicting comments on this issue. Some comment-ers agreed that the government does nothave a compelling interest in applying the Mandate to objecting religious employers.They noted that the expanded exemptionswill impact only a small fraction ofwomen otherwise affected by the Mandateand argued that refusing to provide thoseexemptions would fail to satisfy the com-pelling interest test. Other commenters,however, argued that the government hasa broader interest in the Mandate becauseall women should be considered at-risk ofunintended pregnancy. But the Institute ofMedicine (IOM), in discussing whethercontraceptive coverage is needed, pro-vided a very specic denition of the pop-ulation of women most at-risk of unin-tended pregnancy. 20The Departments believe it is appropriate to consider thegovernment's interest in the contraceptivecoverage requirement using the denitionthat formed the basis of that requirementand the justications the Departmentshave offered for it since 2011. The Man-date, by its own terms, applies not just towomen most at-risk of unintended preg-nancy as identied by the IOM, but ap-plies to any non-grandfathered \"group 18The Departments take no view on the status of particular plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), but simply make this o bservation for the purpose of seeking to estimate the impact of these nal rules. 19Institute of Medicine, \"Clinical Preventive Services for Women: Closing the Gaps\" at 102 (2011). 20Id. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 864health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insur-ance coverage.\" PHS Act section 2713(a).Similarly, the exemptions and accommo-dation in previous rules, and the expandedexemptions in these rules, do not applyonly to coverage for women most at-riskof unintended pregnancy, but to planswhere a qualifying objection exists basedon sincerely held religious beliefs withoutregard to the types of women covered inthose plans. Seen in this light, the Depart-ments believe there is a serious questionwhether the administrative record sup-ports the conclusion that the Mandate, asapplied to religious objectors encom-passed by the expanded exemptions, isnarrowly tailored to achieve the interestspreviously identied by the government.Whether and to what extent it is certainthat an interest in health is advanced byrefraining from providing expanded reli-gious exemptions is discussed in moredetail below in section II.F., Health Ef-fects of Contraception and Pregnancy. Fourth, the availability of contracep- tive coverage from other possible sourc-es\u2014including some objecting entities thatare willing to provide some (but not all)contraceptives, or from other governmen-tal programs for low-income women\u2014detracts from the government's interest torefuse to expand exemptions to the Man-date. The Guttmacher Institute recentlypublished a study that concluded, \"[b]e- tween 2008 and 2014, there were no signif-icant changes in the overall proportion ofwomen who used a contraceptive methodboth among all women and among womenat risk of unintended pregnancy,\" and \"therewas no signicant increase in the use ofmethods that would have been covered un-der the ACA (most or moderately effectivemethods) during the most recent time period(2012-2014) excepting small increases inimplant use.\" 21In discussing why they did not see such an effect from the Mandate, theauthors suggested that \"[p]rior to the imple-mentation of the ACA, many women wereable to access contraceptive methods at lowor no cost through publicly funded familyplanning centers and Medicaid; existence ofthese safety net programs may have damp-ened any impact that the ACA could havehad on contraceptive use. In addition, cost is not the only barrier to accessing a full rangeof method options,\" and \"[t]he fact that in-come is not associated with use of mostother methods [besides male sterilizationand withdrawal] obtained through healthcare settings may reflect broader access toaffordable and/or free contraception madepossible through programs such as Title X.\" Fifth, the Departments previously cre- ated the accommodation, in part, as a wayto provide for payments of contraceptivesand sterilization in a way that is \"seam-less\" with the coverage that eligible em-ployers provide to their plan participantsand their contraceptivecoverage and employer sponsored insur-ance is important and is a compelling gov-ernmental interest, while other comment-ers disagreed. Neither Congress, nor theDepartments in other contexts, have con-cluded that seamlessness, as such, is acompelling interest in the federal govern-ment's delivery of contraceptive cover-age. For example, the preventive servicesMandate itself does not require contracep-tive coverage and does not apply to grand-fathered plans, thereby failing to guaran-tee seamless contraceptive coverage. Theexemption for houses of worship and in-tegrated auxiliaries, and the application ofthe accommodation to certain self-insuredchurch plans, also represents a failure toachieve seamless contraceptive coverage.HHS's Title X program provides contra-ceptive coverage in a way that is not nec-essarily seamless with beneciaries' em-ployer sponsored insurance plans. Afterreviewing the public comments and re-considering this issue, the Departments nolonger believe that if a woman workingfor an objecting religious employer re-ceives contraceptive access in ways thatare not seamless to her employer spon-sored insurance, a compelling governmentinterest has nevertheless been under-mined. Therefore the Departments con-clude that guaranteeing seamlessness be-tween contraceptive access and employersponsored insurance does not constitute acompelling interest that overrides employ-ers' religious objections to the contracep- tive Mandate. Some commenters contended that ob- taining contraceptive coverage from othersources could be more difcult or moreexpensive for women than obtaining itfrom their group health plan or healthinsurance plan. The Departments do notbelieve that such differences rise to thelevel of a compelling interest or make itinappropriate for us to issue the expandedexemptions set forth in these nal rules.Instead, after considering this issue, theDepartments conclude that the religiousliberty interests that would be infringed ifwe do not offer the expanded exemptionsare not overridden by the impact on thosewho will no longer obtain contraceptivesthrough their employer sponsored cover-age as a result. This is discussed in moredetail in following section, II.D., Burdenson Third Parties. D. Burdens on Third Parties The Departments received a number of comments on the question of burdens thatthese rules might impose on third parties.Some commenters asserted that the ex-panded exemptions and accommodationdo not impose an impermissible or unjus-tied burden on third parties, including on women who might not otherwise re-ceive contraceptive coverage with nocost-sharing. These included comment-ers agreeing with the Departments' ex-planations in the Religious IFC, statingthat unintended pregnancies were de-creasing before the Mandate was imple-mented, and asserting that any benetthat third parties might receive in get-ting contraceptive coverage does notjustify forcing religious persons to pro-vide such products in violation of theirbeliefs. Other commenters disagreed,asserting that the expanded exemptionsunacceptably burden women who mightlose contraceptive coverage as a result.They contended the exemptions may re-move contraceptive coverage, causingwomen to have higher contraceptivecosts, fewer contraceptive options, lessability to use contraceptives more con-sistently, more unintended pregnan- 21M.L.

Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 865cies,22births spaced more closely, and workplace, economic, or societal in-equality. Still other commenters tookthe view that other laws or protections,such as those found in the First or FifthAmendments, prohibit the expanded ex-emptions, which those commenters viewas prioritizing religious liberty of ex-empted entities over the religious lib-erty, conscience, or choices of womenwho would not receive contraceptivecoverage where an exemption is used. The Departments note that the exemp- tions in the Religious IFC and these nalrules, like the exemptions created by theprevious Administration, do not imper-missibly burden third parties. Initially, the Departments observe that these nal rulesdo not create a governmental burden; rather,they relieve a governmental burden. TheACA did not impose a contraceptive cover-age requirement. HHS exercised discretiongranted to HRSA by the Congress to includecontraceptives in the Guidelines issued un-der section 2713(a)(4). That decision iswhat created and imposed a governmental burden. These rules simply relieve part ofthat governmental burden. If some third par-ties do not receive contraceptive coveragefrom private parties who the governmentchose not to coerce, that result exists in theabsence of governmental action\u2014it is not aresult the government has imposed. Callingthat result a governmental burden rests onan incorrect presumption: that the govern-ment has an obligation to force private par-ties to benet those third parties and that thethird parties have a right to those benets.But Congress did not create a right to re-ceive contraceptive coverage from other pri-vate citizens through PHS Act section 2713,other portions of the ACA, or any otherstatutes it has enacted. Although some com-menters also contended such a right mightexist under treaties the Senate has ratied orthe Constitution, the Departments are notaware of any source demonstrating that theConstitution or a treaty ratied by the Sen-ate creates a right to receive contraceptivecoverage from other private citizens. The fact that the government at one time exercised its administrative discre-tion to require private parties to provide coverage to benet other private parties,does not prevent the government from re-lieving some or all of the burden of itsMandate. Otherwise, any governmentalcoverage requirement would be a one-wayratchet. In the Religious IFC and theserules, the government has simply restoreda zone of freedom where it once existed.There is no statutory or constitutional ob-stacle to the government doing so, and thedoctrine of third-party burdens should notbe interpreted to impose such an obstacle.Such an interpretation would be especiallyproblematic given the millions of women,in a variety of contexts, whom the Man-date does not ultimately benet, notwith-standing any expanded exemptions\u2014in-cluding through grandfathering of plans,the previous religious exemptions, and thefailure of the accommodation to requiredelivery of contraceptive coverage in var-ious self-insured church plan contexts. In addition, the Government is under no constitutional obligation to fund con-traception. Cf. Harris v. McRae , 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (holding that, although the Su-preme Court has recognized a constitu-tional right to abortion, there is no consti-tutional obligation for government to payfor abortions). Even more so may theGovernment refrain from requiring pri-vate citizens, in violation of their religiousbeliefs, to cover contraception for othercitizens. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173, 192-93 (1991) (\"A refusal to fundprotected activity, without more, cannotbe equated with the imposition of a 'pen-alty' on that activity.\"). The constitutionalrights of liberty and privacy do not requirethe government to force private parties toprovide contraception to other citizensand do not prohibit the government fromprotecting religious objections to suchgovernmental mandates, especially where,as here, the mandate is not an explicitstatutory requirement. 23The Departments do not believe that the Constitution pro-hibits offering the expanded exemptionsin these nal rules. As the Department of Justice has ob- served, the fact that exemptions may re-lieve a religious adherent from conferring a benet on a third party \"does not cate-gorically render an exemption unavail-able,\" and RFRA still applies. 24The De- partments conclusion on matter isconsistent with the Supreme Court's ob-servation that RFRA may require exemp-tions even from laws requiring claimants\"to confer benets on third parties.\" See Hobby Lobby , 134 S. Ct. at 2781 n.37. Here, no law contains such a requirement,but the Mandate is derived from an ad-ministrative exercise of discretion thatCongress charged HRSA and the Depart-ments with exercising. Burdens that mayaffect third parties as a result of revisitingthe exercise of agency discretion may berelevant to the RFRA analysis, but theycannot be dispositive. \"Otherwise, for ex-ample, the Government could decide thatall supermarkets must sell alcohol for theconvenience of customers (and therebyexclude Muslims with religious objectionsfrom owning supermarkets), or it coulddecide that all restaurants must remainopen on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn tips (and thereby ex-clude Jews with religious objections fromowning restaurants).\" Id. When government relieves burdens on religious exercise, it does not violate theEstablishment Clause; rather, \"it followsthe best of 306, 314 Su- preme Court's cases \"leave no doubt thatin commanding neutrality the ReligionClauses do not require the government tobe oblivious to impositions that legitimateexercises of state power may place onreligious belief and practice.\" Board of Educ. of Kiryas Joel Village Sch. Dist. v.Grumet , 512 U.S. 687, 705 (1994). Rather, the Supreme Court \"has long rec-ognized that the government may (andsometimes must) accommodate religiouspractices and that it may do so withoutviolating the Establishment Clause.\" Cor- poration of the Presiding Bishop of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-DaySaints v.

Unemployment Ap- peals Comm'n of Fla. , 480 U.S. 136, 22Some commenters attempted to quantify the costs of unintended pregnancy, but failed to persuasively estimate the population of women that this exemp tion may affect. 23See, for example ,Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass'n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists woman's right to an abortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or entity to facilitate either.\"). 24See Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty, 82 FR at 49670. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 866144-45 (1987)). \"[T]here is room for play in the joints between the Free Exer-cise and Establishment Clauses, allowingthe government to accommodate religionbeyond free exercise requirements, with-out offense to the Establishment Clause.\"Cutter v. Wilkinson , 544 U.S. 709, 713 (2005) (internal quotation omitted). Thus,the Supreme Court has upheld a broadrange of accommodations against Estab-lishment Clause challenges, including theexemption of religious organizations fromTitle VII's prohibition against discrimina-tion in employment on the basis of reli-gion, see Amos , 483 U.S. at 335-39; a state property tax exemption for religiousorganizations, see Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York , 397 U.S. 664, 672-80 (1970); and a state program releasing pub-lic school children during the school dayto receive religious instruction at religiouscenters, see Zorach , 343 U.S. at 315. Before 2012 (when HRSA's Guide- lines went into effect), there was no fed-eral women's preventive services cover- age mandate imposed nationally on healthinsurance and group health plans. TheACA did not require contraceptives to beincluded in HRSA's Guidelines, and it didnot require any preventive services re-quired under PHS Act section 2713 to becovered by grandfathered plans. ManyStates do not impose contraceptive cover-age mandates, or they offer religious ex-emptions to the requirements of such cov-erage mandates\u2014exemptions that havenot been invalidated by federal or Statecourts. The Departments, in previous reg-ulations, exempted houses of worship andintegrated auxiliaries from the Mandate.The Departments then issued a temporaryenforcement safe harbor allowing reli-gious nonprot groups to not provide con-traceptive coverage under the Mandate foralmost two additional years. The Depart-ments further expanded the houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries exemp-tion through denitional changes. And theDepartments created an accommodationprocess under which many women in self-insured church plans may not ultimatelyreceive contraceptive coverage. In addi-tion, many organizations have not beensubject to the Mandate in practice becauseof injunctions they received through liti-gation, protecting them from federal im-position of the Mandate, including underseveral recently entered permanent in- junctions that will apply regardless of theissuance of these nal rules. Commenters offered various assess- ments of the impact these rules mighthave on state or local governments. Somecommenters said that the expanded ex-emptions will not burden state or localgovernments, or that such burdens shouldnot prevent the Departments from offeringthose exemptions. Others said that if theDepartments provide expanded exemp-tions, states or local jurisdictions may facehigher costs in providing birth control towomen through government programs.The Departments consider it appropriateto offer expanded exemptions, notwith-standing the objection of some state orlocal governments. The ACA did not re-quire a contraceptive Mandate, and its dis-cretionary creation by means of HRSA'sGuidelines does not translate to a benetthat the federal government owes to statesor local governments. We are not aware of instances where the various situations re- cited in the previous paragraph, in which thefederal government has not imposed contra-ceptive coverage (other than through theReligious and Moral IFCs), have been de-termined to cause a cognizable injury tostate or local governments. Some states thatwere opposed to the IFCs submitted com-ments objecting to the potential impacts ontheir programs resulting from the expandedexemptions, but they did not adequatelydemonstrate that such impacts would occur,and they did not explain whether, or to whatextent, they were impacted by the otherkinds of instances mentioned above inwhich no federal mandate of contraceptivecoverage has applied to certain plans. TheDepartments nd no legal prohibition onnalizing these rules based on the specula-tive suggestion of an impact on state or localgovernments, and we disagree with the sug-gestion that once we have exercised ourdiscretion to deny exemptions\u2014no matterhow recently or incompletely\u2014we cannotchange course if some state and local gov-ernments believe they are receiving indirectbenets from the previous decision. In addition, these expanded exemp- tions apply only to a small fraction ofentities to which the Mandate would oth-erwise apply\u2014those with qualifying reli-gious objections. Public comments did notprovide reliable data on how many entitieswould use these expanded religious ex- emptions, in which states women in suchplans would reside, how many of thosewomen would qualify for or use state andlocal government subsidies of contracep-tives as a result, or in which states suchwomen, if they are low income, would gowithout contraceptives and potentially ex-perience unintended pregnancies that stateMedicaid programs would have to cover.As mentioned above, at least one study,published by the Guttmacher Institute,concluded the Mandate has caused noclear increase in contraceptive use; oneexplanation proposed by the authors of thestudy is that women eligible for familyplanning from safety net programs werealready receiving free or subsidized con-traceptive access through them, notwith-standing the Mandate's effects on theoverall market. Some commenters whoopposed the expanded exemptions admit-ted that this information is unclear at thisstage; other commenters that estimatedconsiderably more individuals and entities would seek an exemption also admittedthe difculty of quantifying estimates. In the discussion below concerning es- timated economic impacts of these rules,the Departments explain there is not reli-able data available to accurately estimatethe number of women who may lose con-traceptive coverage under these rules, andthe Departments set forth various reasonswhy it is difcult to know how manyentities will use these exemptions or howmany women will be impacted by thosedecisions. Solely for the purposes of de-termining whether the rules have a signif-icant economic impact under ExecutiveOrder 12,866, and in order to estimate thebroadest possible impact so as to deter-mine the applicability of the proceduresset forth in that Executive Order, the De-partments propose that the rules will af-fect no more than 126,400 women ofchildbearing age who use contraceptivescovered by the Guidelines, and concludethe economic impact falls well below$100 million. As explained below, thatestimate assumes that a certain percentageof employers which did not cover contra-ceptives before the ACA will use theseexemptions based on sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. The Departments do not ac-tually know that such entities will do so,however, or that they operate based on Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 867sincerely held religious beliefs against contraceptive coverage. The Departmentsalso explain that other exemptions unaf-fected by these rules may encompassmany or most women potentially affectedby the expanded exemptions. In otherwords, the houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries exemption, the accom-modation's failure to require contracep-tive coverage in certain self-insuredchurch plans, the non-applicability of PHSAct 2713 to grandfathered litigants have received againstsection 2713(a)(4), may encompass alarge percentage of women potentially af-fected by religious objections, and there-fore many women in those plans may notbe impacted by these rules at all. In addi-tion, even if 126,400 women might beaffected by these rules, that number con-stitutes less than 0.1% of all women in theUnited States. 25This suggests that if these rules have any impact on state or localgovernments, it will be statistically deminimus. The Departments conclude thatthere is insufcient evidence of a potentialnegative impact of these rules on state andlocal governments to override the appro-priateness of deciding to nalize theserules. Some commenters contended that the expanded exemptions would constitute unlawful sex discrimination, such as un-der section 1557 of the Affordable CareAct, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of1964, Title IX of the Education Amend-ments of 1972, or the Fifth Amendment.Some commenters suggested the ex-panded exemptions would discriminate onbases such as race, disability, or LGBTstatus, or that they would disproportion-ately burden certain persons in such cate-gories. But these nal rules do not discrimi- nate or draw any distinctions on the basisof sex, pregnancy, race, disability, socio-economic class, LGBT status, or other-wise, nor do they discriminate on anyunlawful grounds. The expanded exemp-tions in these rules do not authorize enti-ties to comply with the Mandate for one person, but not for another person, basedon that person's status as a member of aprotected class. Instead they allow entitiesthat have sincerely held religious objec-tions to providing some or all contracep-tives included in the Mandate to not beforced to provide coverage of those itemsto anyone. These commenters' contentions about discrimination are unpersuasive for stilladditional reasons. First, Title VII is ap-plicable to discrimination committed byemployers, and these rules have been is-sued in the government's capacity as aregulator of group health plans and groupand individual health insurance, not anemployer. See also In Re Union Pac. R.R. Emp't Practices Litig. , 479 F.3d 936, require contraception because contraception isnot a gender-specic like potentialpregnancy, but rather applies to both menand women\"). Second, these rules createno disparate impact. The women's pre-ventive services mandate under section2713(a)(4), and the contraceptive Man-date promulgated under such preventiveservices mandate, already inures to thespecic benet of women\u2014men are de-nied any benet from that section. Bothbefore and after these nal rules, section 2713(a)(4) and the Guidelines issued un-der that section treat women's preventiveservices in general, and female contracep-tives specically, more favorably thanthey treat male preventive services ormale contraceptives. It is simply not the case that the gov- ernment's implementation of section2713(a)(4) is discriminatory againstwomen because exemptions are ex-panded to encompass religious objec-tions. The previous regulations, as dis-cussed elsewhere herein, do not requirecontraceptive coverage in a host ofplans, including grandfathered plans,plans of houses of worship, and\u2014through inability to enforce the accom-modation on certain third party admin-istrators\u2014plans of many religious non- prots in self-insured church plans.Below, the Departments estimate thatfew women of childbearing age in thecountry will be affected by these ex-panded exemptions. 26In this context, the Departments do not believe that anadjustment to discretionary Guidelinesfor women's preventive services con-cerning contraceptives constitutes un-lawful sex discrimination. Otherwise,anytime the government exercises itsdiscretion to provide a benet that isspecic to women (or specic to men), itwould constitute sex discrimination forthe government to reconsider that bene-t. Under that theory, Hobby Lobby it- self, and RFRA (on which Hobby Lobby 's holding was based), which pro- vided a religious exemption to this Man-date for many businesses, would bedeemed discriminatory against womenbecause the underlying women's pre-ventive services requirement is a benetfor women, not for men. Such conclu-sions are not consistent with legal doc-trines concerning sex discrimination. It is not clear that these expanded ex- emptions will signicantly burden womenmost at risk of unintended pregnancies.Some commenters observed that contra-ceptives are often readily accessible atrelatively low cost. Other commenters dis- agreed. Some objected to the suggestionin the Religious IFC that many forms ofcontraceptives are available for around$50 per month and other forms, thoughthey bear a higher one-time cost, cost asimilar amount over the duration of use.But some of those commenters citedsources maintaining that birth control pillscan cost up to $600 per year (that is, $50per month), and said that IUDs, which canlast three to six years or more, 27can cost $1,100 (that is, less than $50 per monthover the duration of use). Some comment-ers said that, for lower income women,contraceptives can be available at free orlow cost through government programs(federal programs offering such servicesinclude, for example, Medicaid, Title X, 25U.S. Census Bureau, \"Quick Facts: Population Estimates, July 1, 2017\" (estimating 325,719,178 persons in the U.S., 50.8% of which are female), avail able at https://www.census.gov/ quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217. 26Below, the Departments estimate that no more than 126,400 women of childbearing age will be affected by the expanded exemptions. As noted above, this i s less than 0.1% of the over 165 million women in the United States. The Departments previously estimated that, at most 120,000 women of childbearing age would be affected by the e xpanded exemptions. See Religious IFC, 82 FR 47,823-84. 27See, for example , Planned https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 868community health center grants, and Tem- porary Assistance for Needy Families(TANF)). Other commenters contendedthat many women in employer-sponsoredcoverage might not qualify for those pro-grams, although that sometimes occursbecause their incomes are above certainthresholds or because the programs werenot intended to absorb privately insuredindividuals. Some commenters observedthat contraceptives may be availablethrough other sources, such as a plan ofanother family member and that the ex-panded exemptions will not likely encom-pass a very large segment of the popula-tion otherwise benetting from theMandate. Other commenters disagreed,pointing out that some government pro-grams that provide family planning haveincome and eligibility thresholds, so thatwomen earning certain amounts abovethose levels would need to pay full costfor contraceptives if they were no longercovered in their health plans. The Departments do not believe that these general considerations make it inap-propriate to issue the expanded exemp-tions set forth in these rules. In addition,the Departments note that the HHS Ofceof Population Affairs, within the Ofce ofthe Assistant Secretary for Health, hasrecently issued a proposed regulation toamend the regulations governing its TitleX family planning program. The proposedregulation would amend the denition of\"low income family\"\u2014individuals eligi-ble for free or low cost contraceptive ser-vices\u2014to include women who are unableto obtain certain family planning servicesunder their employer-sponsored healthcoverage due to their employers' religiousbeliefs or moral convictions (see 83 FR25502). If that regulation is nalized as proposed, it could further reduce any poten-tial effect of these nal rules on women'saccess to contraceptives. That proposal alsodemonstrates that the government has othermeans available to it for increasing wom-en's access to contraception. Some of thosemeans are less restrictive of religious exer-cise than imposition of the contraceptiveMandate on employers with sincerely heldreligious objections to providing such cov-erage. Some commenters stated that the ex- panded exemptions would violate section1554 of the ACA. That section says theSecretary of HHS \"shall not promulgate any regulation\" that \"creates any unrea-sonable barriers to the ability of individ-uals to obtain appropriate medical care,\"\"impedes timely access to health care ser-vices,\" \"interferes with communicationsregarding a full range of treatment optionsbetween the patient and the provider,\" \"re-stricts the ability of health care providersto provide full disclosure of all relevantinformation to patients making health caredecisions,\" \"violates the principles of in-formed consent and the ethical standardsof health care professionals,\" or \"limitsthe availability of health care treatmentfor the full duration of a patient's medicalneeds.\" 42 U.S.C. 18114. Such comment-ers urged, for example, that the ReligiousIFC created unreasonable barriers to theability of individuals to obtain appropriatemedical care, particularly in areas theysaid may have a disproportionately highnumber of entities likely to take advantageof the exemption. The Departments disagree with these comments about section 1554. The De-partments issued previous exemptions andaccommodations that allowed variousplans to not provide contraceptive cover-age on the basis of religious objections.The Departments, which administer bothACA section 1554 and PHS Act section2713, did not conclude that the exemp-tions or accommodations in those regula-tions violated section 1554. Moreover, thedecision not to impose a governmentalmandate is not the \"creation\" of a \"bar-rier,\" especially when that mandate re-quires private citizens to provide servicesto other private citizens. Nor, in any event,are the exemptions from the Mandate un-reasonable. Section 1554 of the ACA doesnot require the Departments to requirecoverage of, or to keep in place a require-ment to cover, certain services, includingcontraceptives, that was issued pursuant toHHS's exercise of discretion under sec-tion 2713(a)(4). Nor does section 1554prohibit the Departments from providingexemptions for burdens on religious exer-cise, or, as is the case here, from refrain-ing to impose the Mandate in cases wherereligious exercise would be burdened byit. In light of RFRA and the First Amend-ment, providing religious exemptions is areasonable administrative response in thecontext of this federally mandated burden,especially since the burden itself is a sub- regulatory creation that does not apply invarious contexts. Religious exemptionsfrom federal mandates in sensitive healthcontexts have existed in federal laws fordecades, and President Obama referencedthem when he issued Executive Order13535 (March 24, 2010), declaring that,under the ACA, \"longstanding Federallaws to protect conscience (such Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7,and the Weldon Amendment, Law 111-8) remainintact,\" and that \"[n]umerous executiveagencies have a role in ensuring that theserestrictions are enforced, including theHHS.\" While the text of Executive Order13535 does not require the expanded ex-emptions issued in these rules, the ex-panded exemptions are, as explained be-low, consistent with longstanding federallaws to protect religious beliefs. In short, the Departments do not be- lieve sections 1554 or 1557 of the ACA,other nondiscrimination statutes, or any constitutional doctrines, create an afrma-tive obligation to create, maintain, or im-pose a Mandate that forces covered enti-ties to provide coverage of preventivecontraceptive services in health plans. TheACA's grant of authority to HRSA toprovide for, and support, the Guidelines isnot transformed by any of the laws citedby commenters into a requirement that,once those Guidelines exist, they cannever be reconsidered or amended be-cause doing so would only affect wom-en's coverage or would allegedly impactparticular populations disparately. Members of the public have widely divergent views on whether expanding theexemptions is good public policy. Somecommenters said the exemptions wouldburden workers, families, and the eco-nomic and social stability of the country,and interfere with the physician-patientrelationship. Other commenters disagreed,favoring the public policy behind expand-ing the exemptions and arguing that theexemptions would not interfere with thephysician-patient relationship. For allthe reasons explained at length in thispreamble, the Departments have deter-mined that these rules are good policy.Because of the importance of the religiousliberty values being accommodated, thelimited impact of these rules, and uncer- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 869tainty about the impact of the Mandate overall according to some studies, the De-partments do not believe these rules willhave any of the drastic negative conse-quences on third parties or society thatsome opponents of these rules have sug-gested. E. Interim Final Rulemaking The Departments received several comments about their decision to issue theReligious IFC as interim nal rules withrequests for comments, instead of as anotice of proposed rulemaking. Severalcommenters asserted that the Departmentshad the authority to issue the ReligiousIFC in that way, agreeing that the Depart-ments had explicit statutory authority todo so, good cause under the Administra-tive Procedure Act (APA), or both. Othercommenters held the opposite view, con-tending that there was neither statutoryauthority to issue the rules on an interimnal basis, nor good cause under the APA to make the rules immediately effective. The Departments continue to believe legal authority existed to issue the Reli-gious IFC as interim nal rules. Section9833 of the Code, section 734 of ERISA,and section 2792 of the PHS Act authorizethe Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, andHHS (collectively, the Secretaries) to pro- mulgate any interim nal rules that theydetermine are appropriate to carry out theprovisions of chapter 100 of the Code,part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, andpart A of title XXVII of the PHS Act,which include sections 2701 through 2728of the PHS Act and the incorporation ofthose sections into section 715 of ERISAand section 9815 of the Code. The Reli-gious and Moral IFCs fall under thosestatutory authorizations for the use of in-terim nal rulemaking. Prior to the Reli-gious IFC, the Departments issued threeinterim nal rules implementing this sec-tion of the PHS Act because of the needsof covered entities for immediate guid-ance and the weighty matters implicatedby the HRSA Guidelines, including issu-ance of new or revised exemptions or ac-commodations. (75 FR 41726; 76 FR46621; 79 FR 51092). The Departmentsalso had good cause to issue the ReligiousIFC as interim nal rules, for the reasonsdiscussed therein. In any event, the objections of some commenters to the issuance of the Reli-gious IFC as interim nal rules with re-quest for comments does not prevent theissuance of these nal rules. These nalrules are being issued after receiving and thoroughly considering public commentsas requested in the Religious IFC. These nal rules therefore comply with theAPA's notice and comment requirements. F. Health Effects of Contraception and Pregnancy The Departments received numerous comments on the health effects of contra-ception and pregnancy. As noted above, some commenters supported the expandedexemptions, and others urged that contra-ceptives be removed from the Guidelinesentirely, based on the view that pregnancyand the unborn children resulting from con-ception are not diseases or unhealthy condi-tions that are properly the subject of preven-tive care coverage. Such commentersfurther contended that hormonal contracep-tives may present health risks to women.For example, they contended that studiesshow certain contraceptives cause or are as-sociated with an increased risk of depres-sion, 28venous larly among women who smoke, are hyper-tensive, or are older), 31hypertension,32 HIV-1 acquisition and transmission,33and breast, cervical, and liver cancers.34Some commenters also observed that fertilityawareness based methods of birth spacing 28Commenters cited Charlotte Wessel Skovlund et al., \"Association with Depression,\" 73 JAMA Psychiatry 1154, 1154 (published online Sept. 28, 2016) (\"Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents, was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a rst diagnosis of depression , suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use.\"). 29Commenters cited the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, \"Hormonal Contraception: Recent Advances and Controve rsies,\" et al., Oral Contraceptives, Effects of Estrogen Dose and Progestogen Type: Results of the MEGA Case-Control Study,\" 339 Brit.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 870are free of similar health risks since they do not involve ingestion of chemicals. Somecommenters contended that contraceptiveaccess does not reduce unintended pregnan-cies or abortions. Other commenters disagreed, citing a variety of studies they contend showhealth benets caused by, or associatedwith, contraceptive use or the preventionof unintended pregnancy. Commenterscited, for example, the 2011 IOM Re-port's discussions of the negative effectsassociated with unintended pregnancies,as well as other studies. Such commenterscontended that, by reducing unintendedpregnancy, contraceptives reduce the riskof unaddressed health complications, lowbirth weight, preterm birth, infant mortal-ity, and maternal mortality. 35Comment- ers also said studies show contraceptivesare associated with a reduced risk of con-ditions such as ovarian cancer, colorectalcancer, and endometrial cancer, 36and that contraceptives treat such conditions as en-dometriosis, polycystic ovarian pre-menstrual pain, 37Some commenters said that preg- nancy presents various health risks, suchas blood clots, bleeding, anemia, highblood pressure, gestational diabetes, anddeath. Some commenters also contendedthat increased access to contraception re-duces abortions. Some commenters said that, in the Re- ligious IFC, the Departments made incor-rect statements concerning scientic stud- ies. For example, some commentersargued there is no proven increased risk ofbreast cancer or other risks among contra-ceptive users. They criticized the Reli-gious IFC for citing studies, including onepreviewed in the 2011 IOM Report itself(Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality Report No.: 13-E002-EF (June2013) (cited above)), discussing an asso-ciation between contraceptive use and in-creased risks of breast and cervical cancer, and concluding there are no net cancer-reducing benets of contraceptive use. Asdescribed in the Religious IFC, 82 FR at47804, the 2013 Agency for HealthcareResearch and Quality study, and others,reach conclusions with which these com-menters appear to disagree. The Depart-ments consider it appropriate to take intoaccount both of those studies, as well asthe studies cited by commenters who dis-agree with those conclusions. Some com menters further criticized the Departments for saying two studies cited bythe 2011 IOM Report, which asserted anassociative relationship between contracep-tive use and decreases in unintended preg-nancy, did not on their face establish acausal relationship between a broad cover-age mandate and decreases in unintendedpregnancy. In this respect, as noted in theReligious IFC, 38the purpose for the Depart- ments' reference to such studies was tohighlight the difference between a causalrelationship and an associative one, as wellas the difference between saying contracep-tive use has a certain effect and saying acontraceptive coverage mandate (or, morespecically, the part of that mandate af-fected by certain exemptions) will necessar-ily have (or negate, respectively) such aneffect. Commenters disagreed about the ef- fects of some FDA-approved contracep-tives on embryos. Some commentersagreed with the quotation, in the ReligiousIFC, of FDA materials 39that indicate that some items it has approved as contracep-tives may prevent the implantation of anembryo after fertilization. Some of thosecommenters cited additional scienticsources to argue that certain approvedcontraceptives may prevent implantation,and that, in some cases, some contracep-tive items may even dislodge an embryoshortly after implantation. Other com-menters disagreed with the sources citedin the Religious IFC and cited additional studies on that issue. Some commentersfurther criticized the Departments for as-serting in the Religious IFC that somepersons believe those possible effects are\"abortifacient.\" The objection on this issue appears to be partially one of semantics. People dis-agree about whether to dene \"concep-tion\" or \"pregnancy\" to occur at fertiliza-tion, when the sperm and ovum unite, ordays later at implantation, when that em-bryo has undergone further cellular devel-opment, travelled down the fallopian tube, and implanted in the uterine wall. This ques-tion is independent of the question of whatmechanisms of action FDA-approved orcleared contraceptives may have. It is also aseparate question from whether members ofthe public assert, or believe, that it is appro-priate to consider the items \"abortifa-cient\"\u2014that is, a kind of abortion, or a med-ical product that causes an abortion\u2014because they believe abortion means tocause the demise of a post-fertilization em-bryo inside the mother's body. Commentersreferenced scientic studies and sources onboth sides of the issue of whether certaincontraceptives prevent implantation. Com-menters and litigants have positively statedthat some of them view certain contracep-tives as abortifacients, for this reason. See also Hobby Lobby , 134 U.S. at 2765 (\"The Hahns have accordingly excluded from thegroup-health-insurance plan they offer totheir employees certain contraceptive meth-ods that they consider to be abortifacients.\"). The Departments do not take a position on the scientic, religious, or moral de-bates on this issue by recognizing thatsome people have sincere religious objec-tions to providing contraception coverageon this basis. The Supreme Court has al-ready recognized that such a view canform the basis of a sincerely held religiousbelief under RFRA. 40Even though there is a plausible scientic argument against 35Citing, e.g., Conde-Agudelo A, Rosas-Bermudez A, Kafury-Goeta AC.

The Departments be-lieve in this context we have a sufcientrationale to offer expanded religious exemp-tions with respect to this Mandate. The Departments also received com- ments about their discussion of the uncer-tain effects of the expanded exemptionson teen sexual activity. In this respect, theDepartments stated, \"With respect toteens, the Santelli and Melnikas studycited by IOM 2011 observes that, between 1960 and 1990, as contraceptive use in-creased, teen sexual activity outside of mar-riage likewise increased (although the study does not assert a causal relationship). An-other study, which proposed an economicmodel for the decision to engage in sexualactivity, stated that '[p]rograms that increaseaccess to contraception are found to de-crease teen pregnancies in the short run butincrease teen pregnancies in the longrun.'\" 41Some commenters agreed with this discussion, while other commenters dis-agreed. Commenters who supported the ex-panded exemptions cited these and similarsources suggesting that denying expanded exemptions to the Mandate is not a narrowlytailored way to advance the Government'sinterests in reducing teen pregnancy, andsuggesting there are means of doing so thatare less restrictive of religious exercise. 42 Some commenters opposing the expandedexemptions stated that school-based healthcenters provide access to contraceptives,thus increasing use of contraceptives by sex-ually active students. They also cited studiesconcluding that certain decreases in teenpregnancy are attributable to increased con-traceptive use. 43 Many commenters opposing the Reli- gious IFC misunderstood the Depart-ments' discussion of this issue. Teens area signicant part, though not the entirety,of women the IOM identied as beingmost at risk of unintended pregnancy. TheDepartments do not take a position on the empirical question of whether contracep-tion has caused certain reductions in teenpregnancy. Rather, we note that studiessuggesting various causes of teen preg-nancy and unintended pregnancy in gen-eral support the Departments' conclusionthat it is difcult to establish causationbetween granting religious exemptions tothe contraceptive Mandate and either anincrease in teen pregnancies in particular,or unintended pregnancies in general. Forexample, a 2015 study investigating the decline in teen pregnancy since 1991 at-tributed it to multiple factors (includingbut not limited to reduced sexual activity,falling welfare benet levels, and expan-sion of family planning services in Med-icaid, with the latter accounting for lessthan 13 percent of the decline), and con-cluded \"that none of the relatively easy,policy-based explanations for the recentdecline in teen childbearing in the UnitedStates hold up very well to careful empir-ical scrutiny.\" 44One study found that dur- ing the teen pregnancy decline between2007-2012, teen sexual activity was alsodecreasing. 45One study concluded that falling unemployment rates in the 1990saccounted for 85% of the decrease in rates of rst births among 18-19 year-old Afri-can Americans. 46Another study found that the representation of African-American teachers was associated with a signicantreduction in the African-American teenpregnancy rate. 47One study concluded that an \"increase in the price of the Pill on col-lege campuse s...d i dn o t increase the rates of unintended pregnancy.\" 48Similarly, one study from England found that, where fund-ing for teen pregnancy prevention was re-duced, there was no evidence that the reduc-tion led to an increase in teen pregnancies. 49 Some commenters also cited studies, which may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 872are not limited to the issue of teen preg- nancy, that have found many women whohave abortions report that they were usingcontraceptives when they became preg-nant. 50 As the Departments stated in the Reli- gious IFC, we do not take a position onthe variety of em pirical questions discussed above. Likewise, these rules do not addressthe substantive question of whether HRSAshould include contraceptives in the wom-en's preventive services Guidelines issuedunder section 2713(a)(4). Rather, reexami-nation of the record and review of the publiccomments has reinforced the Departments'conclusion that signicantly more uncer-tainty and ambiguity exists on these issuesthan the Departments previously acknowl-edged when we declined to extend the ex-emption to certain objecting organizationsand individuals. The uncertainty surround-ing these weighty and important issuesmakes it appropriate to maintain the ex-panded exemptions and accommodation ifand for as long as HRSA continues to in-clude contraceptives in the Guidelines. Thefederal government has a long history, par-ticularly in certain sensitive and multi-faceted health issues, of providing religiousexemptions from governmental mandates.These nal rules are consistent with thathistory and with the discretion Congressvested in the Departments for implementingthe ACA. G. Health and Equality Effects of Contraceptive Coverage Mandates The Departments also received com- ments about the health and equality ef-fects of the Mandate more broadly. Somecommenters contended that the contracep-tive Mandate promotes the health and equality of women, especially low in-come women and promotes female par-ticipation and equality in the workforce.Other commenters contended that therewas insufcient evidence that the ex-panded exemptions would harm thoseinterests. Some of those commenters further questioned whether there wasevidence that broad health coveragemandates of contraception lead to in-creased contraceptive use, reductions inunintended pregnancies, or reductions innegative effects said to be associatedwith unintended pregnancies. In partic-ular, some commenters discussed thestudy quoted above, published and re-vised by the Guttmacher Institute in Octo- ber 2017, concluding that through 2014there were no signicant changes in the overall proportion of women who used acontraceptive method both among allwomen and among women at risk of unin-tended pregnancy, that there was no signif-icant shift from less effective to more effec-tive methods, and that it was \"unclear\"whether this Mandate impacted contracep-tive use because there was no signicantincrease in the use of contraceptive methodsthe Mandate covered. 51These commenters also noted that, in the 29 States where con-traceptive coverage mandates have been im-posed statewide, 52those mandates have not necessarily lowered rates of unintendedpregnancy (or abortion) overall. 53Other commenters, however, disputed the signi-cance of these state statistics, noting that ofthe 29 states with contraceptive coveragemandates, only four states have laws thatmatch the federal requirements in scope.Some also observed that, even in states withstate contraceptive coverage mandates, self-insured group health plans might escapethose requirements, and some states do notmandate the contraceptives to be covered atno out-of-pocket cost to the beneciary. The Departments have considered these experiences as relevant to the effectthe expanded exemptions in these rulesmight have on the Mandate more broadly.The state mandates apply to a very largenumber of plans and plan participants,notwithstanding ERISA preemption, andpublic commenters did not point to studiesshowing those state mandates reduced un-intended pregnancies. The federal contra-ceptive Mandate, likewise, applies to a broad, but not entirely comprehensive,number of employers. For example, to theextent that houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries may have self-insured toavoid state health insurance contraceptivecoverage mandates or for other reasons,those groups are, and have been, exemptfrom the federal Mandate prior to the Re-ligious IFC. The exemptions as set forth inthe Religious IFC and in these nal rulesleave the contraceptive Mandate in placefor nearly all entities and plans to which the Mandate has applied. The Depart-ments are not aware of data showing thatthese expanded exemptions would negateany reduction in unintended pregnanciesthat might result from a broad contracep-tive coverage mandate. Some commenters expressed concern that providing exemptions to the Mandatethat private parties provide contraceptionmay lead to exemptions regarding othermedications or services, like vaccines.The exemptions provided in these rules,however, do not apply beyond the contra-ceptive coverage requirement imple-mented through section 2713(a)(4). Spe-cically, PHS Act section 2713(a)(2)requires coverage of \"immunizations,\"and these exemptions do not encompassthat requirement. The fact that the Depart-ments have exempted houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries from the contra-ceptive Mandate since 2011 did not leadto those entities receiving exemptions un-der section 2713(a)(2) concerning vac-cines. In addition, hundreds of entitieshave sued the Departments over the im-plementation of section 2713(a)(4), lead-ing to two decisions of the U.S. SupremeCourt, but no similar wave of lawsuits haschallenged section 2713(a)(2). The ex-panded exemptions in these nal rules areconsistent with a long history of statutesprotecting religious beliefs from certainhealth care mandates concerning issuessuch as sterilization, abortion and birthcontrol. 50Commenters cited, for example, Guttmacher Institute, \"Fact Sheet: Induced Abortion in the United States\" (Jan. 2018) (\"Fifty-one percent of aborti on patients in 2014 were using a contraceptive method in the month they became pregnant\"), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/les/factsheet/fb_induced _abortion.pdf. 51Kavanaugh, Contraceptives\" (June 11, 2018); Kaiser Family Foundation, \"State Requirements for Insurance Cover age of Contraceptives,\" Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (Jan. 1, 2018), https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/state-requirements-for-insurance-coverage-of-contracepti ves/?currentTimeframe /H110050&sortModel /H11005%7B%22colId%22: %22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D. 53SeeMichael J. New, \"Analyzing the of State Level Contraception Mandates on Public Health Outcomes,\" 13 Ave Maria L. Rev. 345 (2015), available at http://avemarialaw-law- review.avemarialaw.edu/Content/articles/vXIII.i2.new.nal.0809.pdf. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 873Some commenters took issue with the conclusion set forth in the Religious IFC,which is similar to that asserted in the2017 Guttmacher study, that \"[t]he rolethat the contraceptive coverage guaranteeplayed in impacting use of contraceptionat the national level remains unclear, asthere was no signicant increase in the useof methods that would have been coveredunder the ACA.\" They observed that morewomen have coverage of contraceptivesand contraception counseling under theMandate and that more contraceptives areprovided without co-pays than before.Still other commenters argued that theMandate, or other expansions of contra-ceptive coverage, have led women to in-crease their use of contraception in gen-eral, or to change from less effective, less expensive contraceptive methods to moreeffective, more expensive contraceptivemethods. Some commenters lamented thatexemptions would include exemption fromthe requirement to cover contraceptioncounseling. Some commenters pointed to studies cited in the 2011 IOM Report rec-ommending contraception be included inthe Guidelines and argued that certainwomen will go without certain health care,or contraception specically, because ofcost. They contended that a smaller percent-age of women delay or forego health careoverall under the ACA 54and that, according to studies, coverage of contraceptives with-out cost-sharing has increased use of con-traceptives in certain circumstances. Somecommenters also argued that studies showthat decreases in unintended pregnancies aredue to broader access of contraceptives. Fi-nally, some commenters argued that birthcontrol access generally has led to socialand economic equality for women. The Departments have reviewed the comments, including studies submitted bycommenters either supporting or opposingthese expanded exemptions. Based on ourreview, it is not clear that merely expand-ing exemptions as done in these rules willhave a signicant effect on contraceptiveuse and health, or workplace equality, forthe vast majority of women benettingfrom the Mandate. There is conflictingevidence regarding whether the Mandatealone, as distinct from birth control accessmore generally, has caused increased con- traceptive use, reduced unintended preg-nancies, or eliminated workplace dispari-ties, where all other women's preventiveservices were covered without cost shar-ing. Without taking a denitive positionon those evidentiary issues, however, weconclude that the Religious IFC and thesenal rules\u2014which merely withdraw theMandate's requirement from what appearsto be a small group of newly exempt en-tities and plans\u2014are not likely to havenegative effects on the health or equalityof women nationwide. We also concludethat the expanded exemptions are an ap-propriate policy choice left to the agenciesunder the relevant statutes, and, thus, arean appropriate exercise of the Depart-ments' discretion. Moreover, we conclude that the best way to balance the various policy interestsat stake in the Religious IFC and thesenal rules is to provide the expanded ex-emptions set forth herein, even if certaineffects may occur among the populationsactually affected by the employment ofthese exemptions. These rules will pro-vide tangible protections for religious lib-erty, and impose fewer governmental bur-dens on various entities and individuals,some of whom have contended for severalyears that denying them an exemptionfrom the contraceptive Mandate imposes asubstantial burden on their religious exer-cise. The Departments view the provisionof those protections to preserve religiousexercise in this health care context as anappropriate policy option, notwithstand-ing the widely divergent effects that pub-lic commenters have predicted based ondifferent studies they cited. Providing theprotections for religious exercise set forthin the Religious IFC and these nal rulesis not inconsistent with the ACA, andbrings this Mandate into better alignmentwith various other federal conscience pro-tections in health care, some of whichhave been in place for decades. III. Description of the Text of the Regulations and Response toAdditional Public Comments Here, the Departments describe the regulatory text set forth prior to the Reli-gious IFC, the regulations from that IFC, public comments in response to the spe-cic regulatory text set forth in the IFC,the Departments' response to those com-ments, and, in consideration of those com-ments, the regulatory text as nalized inthis nal rule. As noted above, variousmembers of the public provided com-ments that were supportive, or critical, ofthe Religious IFC overall, or of signicantpolicies pertaining to those regulations.To the extent those comments apply to thefollowing regulatory text, the Depart-ments have responded to them above. Thissection of the preamble responds to com-ments that pertain more specically toparticular regulatory text. A. Restatement Statutory (a)(1)(iv)). The previous regulations restated the statutory requirements of section 2713(a) of the PHS Act, at 26 CFR align them with the text ofPHS Act section 2713(a) and (a)(4). Previous versions of these rules had varied from the statutory language. PHSAct section 2713(a) and (a)(4) requiregroup health plans and health insuranceissuers offering coverage to provide cov-erage without cost sharing for \"such addi-tional preventive care and screenings notdescribed in paragraph (1) as provided forin comprehensive guidelines\" supported by HRSA. In comparison, the previous versionof regulatory restatements of this language(as drawn from 45 CFR 147.130(a)(1) and(a)(1)(iv)) stated the coverage must include\"evidence-informed preventive care andscreenings provided for in binding compre-hensive health plan coverage guidelinessupported by\" HRSA. The Religious IFCamended this language to state, parallel tothe language in section 2713(a)(4), that thecoverage must include \"such additional pre-ventive care and screenings not described inparagraph (a)(1)(i) of this section as pro- 54Citing, for example, Adelle Simmons et al., \"The Affordable Care Act: Promoting Better Health for Women,\" Table 1, Assistant Secretary for Planning a nd Evaluation (June 14, 2016), https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/les/pdf/205066/ACAWomenHealthIssueBrief.pdf. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 874vided for in comprehensive guidelines sup- ported by\" HRSA. These rules adopt as nal, without change, the provisions in the Religious IFCamending 26 CFR In this way, the regulatorytext better conforms to the statutory lan-guage. In paragraph (a)(1) of the nal reg-ulations, instead of saying \"must providecoverage for all of the following items andservices, and may not impose any cost-sharing requirement s... with respect to those items and services:\", the regulationnow tracks the statutory language by saying\"must provide coverage for and must notimpose any cost-sharing requirement s... for\u2014\". By eliminating the language \"cov-erage for all of the following items andservices,\" and \"with respect to those itemsand services,\" the Departments do not in-tend that coverage for specied items andservices will not be required, but we simplyintend to simplify the text of the regulation to track the statute and avoid duplicativelanguage. By specifying that paragraph (a)(1)(iv) concerning the women's preventive ser-vices Guidelines encompasses \"such addi-tional preventive care and screenings notdescribed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of thissection as provided for in comprehensiveguidelines supported by the Health Re-sources and Services Administration forpurposes of section 2713(a)(4) of thePublic Health Service Act, subject to\u00a7\u00a7 147.131 and 147.132,\" the regulatorytext also better tracks the statutory lan-guage that the Guidelines are for \"such additional\" preventive services as HRSAmay \"provide[] for\" and \"support[].\" Thistext also eliminates language, not the statute, that the Guidelines are\"evidence-informed\" and \"binding.\" Con-gress did not include the word \"binding\" inPHS Act section 2713, and did include thewords \"evidence-based\" or \"evidence-informed\" in section 2713(a)(1) and (a)(3),but omitted such terms from section2713(a)(4). In this way, the regulatory textbetter comports with the scope of the statu-tory text. This text of paragraph (a)(1)(iv)also acknowledges that the Departmentshave decided Guidelines issued under sec-tion 2713(a)(4) will not be provided for orsupported to the extent they exceed the ex-emptions and accommodation set forth in 45 CFR 147.131 and 147.132. Previous ver-sions of the regulation placed that limit in 45CFR 147.130(a)(1), but did not reiterate it in\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv). To clearly set forth theapplicability of the exemptions and accom-modation, the Departments adopt as nalthe Religious IFC language, which adopt as nal the Religious IFC lan-guage which includes the exemptions andaccommodation in both \u00a7\u00a7 and147.132, and not just in \u00a7 147.131 as underthe previous rules, the Departments corre-spondingly included references to both sec-tions in this part. Some commenters supported restoring the statutory language from PHS Act sec-tion 2713(a) and (a)(4) in the regulatoryrestatements of that language. Other com-menters opposed doing so, asserting thatGuidelines issued pursuant to section2713(a)(4) must be \"evidence-informed\"and \"binding.\" The D epartments disagree with the position that, even though Con-gress omitted those terms from section2713(a)(4), their regulatory restatementof the statutory requirement should in-clude those terms. Instead, the Depart-ments conclude that it is more appropri-ate for the regulatory restatements ofsection 2713(a)(4) to track the statutorylanguage in this regard, namely, \"as pro-vided for in comprehensive guidelinessupported by [HRSA] for purposes of\"that paragraph. B. Prefatory Language of Religious Exemptions (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)) These nal rules adopt as nal, with changes based on comments as set forthbelow, the regulatory provision in the Re-ligious IFC that moved the religious ex-emption from 45 CFR 147.131(a) to 45CFR 147.132. In \u00a7 147.131(a), that HRSA'sGuidelines \"may establish an exemption\"for the health coverage of a \"reli-gious employer,\" dened as \"an organiza-tion that is organized and operates as anonprot entity and is referred to in sec-tion 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Inter-nal Revenue Code.\" The Religious IFCmoved the exemption to a new \u00a7 147.132, in which paragraph (a) discussed object-ing entities, paragraph (b) discussed ob-jecting individuals, paragraph (c) set fortha denition, and paragraph (d) The prefatory language to\u00a7 stated that HRSA'sGuidelines \"must not provide for or sup-port the requirement of coverage or pay-ments for contraceptive services\" for thehealth plan or coverage of an \"objectingorganization,\" and thus that HRSA \"willexempt\" such an organization from thecontraceptive coverage requirments of theGuidelines. The remainder of paragraph(a)(1), which is discussed in greater detailbelow, describes what entities are in-cluded as objecting organizations. This language not only species that certain entities are \"exempt,\" but also ex-plains that the Guidelines shall not sup-port or provide for an imposition of thecontraceptive coverage requirement tosuch exempt entities. This is an acknowl-edgement that section 2713(a)(4) requires women's preventive services coverageonly \"as provided for in comprehensiveguidelines supported by the Health Re-sources and Services Administration.\" Tothe extent the HRSA Guidelines do notprovide for, or support, the application ofsuch coverage to certain entities or plans,the Affordable Care Act does not requirethe coverage. T hose entities or plans are \"exempt\" by not being subject to therequirements in the rst instance. There-fore, in describing the entities or plansas \"exempt,\" and in referring to the \"ex-emption\" encompassing those entities orplans, the Departments also afrm thenon-applicability of the Guidelines tothem. The Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption set forth in\u00a7 147.132(a) applies to several distinctentities involved in the provision of cov-erage to the objecting employer's employ-ees. This explanation is consistent withhow prior regulations have worked bymeans of similar language. When sections\u00a7 147.132(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i) specify that\"[a] group health with agroup health plan,\" \"health insurancecoverage offered or arranged by an object-ing organization\" are exempt \"to the ex-tent\" of the objections \"as specied in Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 875paragraph (a)(2),\" that language exempts the group health plans of the sponsors thatobject, and their health insurance issuers inproviding the coverage in those plans(whether or not the issuers have their ownobjections). Consequently, with respect toGuidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(and as and 29CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv)), the plansponsor, in the ex-emption of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i)would face no penalty as a result of omittingcertain contraceptive coverage from thebenets of the plan participants and bene-ciaries. However, w hile the objection of a plan sponsor (or entity that arrangescoverage under the plan, as applicable)removes penalties from that plan's is-suer, it only does so for that plan\u2014itdoes not affect the issuer's coverage forother group health plans where the plansponsor has no qualifying objection.More information on the effects of theobjection of a health insurance issuer in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii) is included below. The exemptions in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1) ap- ply \"to the extent\" of the objecting enti-ties' sincerely held religious convictions.Thus, entities that hold a requisite objec-tion to covering some, but not all, contra-ceptive items would be exempt with re-spect to the items to which they object, butnot with respect to the items to which theydo not object. Some commenters said itwas unclear whether the plans of entitiesor individuals that religiously object tosome but not all contraceptives would beexempt from being required to cover justthe contraceptive methods as to whichthere is an objection, or whether the ob-jection to some contraceptives leads to anexemption from that plan being requiredto cover all contraceptives. The D epart- ments intend that a requisite religiousobjection against some but not all con-traceptives would lead to an exemptiononly to the extent of that objection: thatis, the exemption would encompass onlythe items to which the relevant entity orindividual objects, and would not en-compass contraceptive methods towhich the objection does not apply. Tomake this clearer, in these nal rules,the Departments nalize the prefatory language of \u00a7 147.132(a) with the fol-lowing change, so that the nal rulesstate that an exemption shall be in-cluded, and the Guidelines must not pro-vide for contraceptive coverage, \"to theextent of the objections specied be-low.\" The Departments have made corre- sponding changes to language throughoutthe regulatory text, to describe the exemp-tions as applying \"to the extent\" of theobjection(s). C. Scope of Religious Exemptions and Requirements for Exempt Entities (45CFR 147.132) In 45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i) through (iii) and (b), the Religious IFC expandsthe exemption to plans of additional enti-ties and individuals not encompassed bythe exemption set forth in the regulationsprior to the Religious IFC. Specic enti-ties to which the expanded exemptionsapply are discussed below. The exemptions contained in previous regulations, at \u00a7 147.131(a), did not re-quire exempt entities to submit any par-ticular self-certication or notice, either to the government or to their issuer or thirdparty administrator, in order to obtain orqualify for the exemption. Similarly, underthe expanded exemptions in \u00a7 147.132, theReligious IFC did not require exempt enti-ties to comply with a self-certication pro-cess. We nalize that approach in this re-spect without change. Although exemptentities do not need to le notices or certi-cations of their exemption, and these nalrules do not impose any new notice require-ments on them, existing ERISA rules gov-erning group health plans require that, withrespect to plans subject to ERISA, a plandocument must include a comprehensivesummary of the benets covered by the planand a statement of the conditions for eligi-bility to receive benets. Under ERISA, theplan document areprovided to participants and beneciariesunder the plan; if an objecting employer would like to exclude all or a subset ofcontraceptive services, it must ensure thatthe exclusion is clear in the plan document.Moreover, if there is a reduction in a cov- ered service or benet, the plan has to dis-close that change to plan participants. 55 Thus, where an exemption applies and all(or a subset of) contraceptive services areomitted from a plan's coverage, otherwiseapplicable ERISA disclosure documentsmust reflect the omission of coverage inERISA plans. These existing disclosure re-quirements serve to help provide notice toparticipants and beneciaries of whatERISA plans do and do not cover. Some commenters supported the ex- panded exemption's approach which main-tained the policy of the previous exemptionin not requiring exempt entities to complywith a self-certication process. They sug-gested that self-certication forms for anexemption are not necessary, could add bur-dens to exempt entities beyond those im-posed by the previous exemption, and couldgive rise to religious objections to the self-certication process itself. Commenters alsostated that requiring an exemption form forexempt entities could cause additional oper-ational burdens for plans that have existingprocesses in place to handle exemptions.Other commenters, however, favored in-cluding a self-certication process for ex-empt entities. They suggested that entitiesmight abuse the availability of an exemptionor use exempt status insincerely if no self-certication process exists, and that theMandate might be difcult to enforce with-out a self-certication process. Some com-menters asked that the government publish alist of entities that claim the exemption. The Departments believe it is appropri- ate to not require exempt entities to submit a self-certication or notice. The previousexemption did not require a self-certicationor notice, and the Departments did not col-lect a list of all entities that used the exemp-tion. The Departments believe the approachunder the previous exemption is appropriatefor the expanded exemption. Adding a self-certication or notice to the exemption pro-cess would impose an additional paperworkburden on exempt entities that the previousregulations did not impose, and would alsoinvolve additional public costs if those cer-tications or notices were to be reviewed orkept on le by the government. 55See, for example, 1022, 45 CFR 147.200 (requiring disclosure of the \"exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the coverage,\" including group health plans and group and individual issuers). December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 876The Departments are not aware of in- stances where the lack of a self-certicationunder the previous exemption led to abusesor to an inability to engage in enforcement.The Mandate is enforceable through variousmechanisms in the PHS Act, the Code, andERISA. Entities that insincerely or other-wise improperly operate as if they are ex-empt would do so at the risk of enforcementunder such mechanisms. The Departmentsare not aware of sufcient reasons to believethose measures and mechanisms would failto deter entities from improperly operatingas if they are exempt. Moreover, as notedabove, ERISA and other plan disclosure re-quirements governing group health plans re-quire provision of a comprehensive sum-mary of the benets covered by the plan anddisclosure of any reductions in covered ser-vices or benets, so beneciaries in plansthat reduce or eliminate contraceptive ben-ets as a result of the exemption will knowwhether their health plan claims an exemp-tion and will be able to raise appropriatechallenges to such claims. As a conse-quence, the Departments believe it is anappropriate balance of various concerns ex-pressed by commenters for these rules tocontinue to not require notices or self-certications for using the exemption. Some commenters asked the Depart- ments to add language indicating that anexemption cannot be invoked in the mid-dle of a plan year, nor should it be used tothe extent inconsistent with laws that ap-ply to, or state approval of, fully insuredplans. None of the previous iterations ofthe exemption regulations included suchprovisions, and the Departments do notconsider them necessary in these rules. The expanded exemptions in these rules onlypurport to exempt plans and entities fromthe application of the federal contraceptivecoverage requirement of the Guidelines is-sued under section 2713(a)(4). They do notpurport to exempt entities or plans fromstate laws concerning contraceptive cover-age, or laws governing whether an entitycan make a change (of whatever kind) dur- ing a plan year. The rules governing theaccommodation likewise do not purport toobviate the need to follow otherwise appli-cable rules about making changes during aplan year. (Below, these rules discuss in more detail the accommodation and whenan entity seeking to revoke it would be ableto do so or to notify plan participants of therevocation.) Commenters also asked that clauses be added to the regulatory text holding issu-ers harmless where exemptions are in-voked by plan sponsors. As discussedabove, the exemption rules already spec-ify that, where an exemption applies to agroup health plan, it encompasses both thegroup health plan and health insurancecoverage provided in connection with thegroup health plan, and therefore encom-passes any impact on the issuer of thecontraceptive coverage requirement withrespect to that plan. In addition, as dis-cussed below, the Departments are includ-ing, in these nal rules, language from theprevious regulations protecting issuersthat act in reliance on certain representa-tions made in the accommodation process.To the extent that commenters seek lan-guage offering additional protections forother incidents that might occur in con-nection with the invocation of an exemp-tion, the previous exemption regulationsdid not include such provisions, and theDepartments do not consider them neces-sary in these nal rules. As noted above,the expanded exemptions in these nalrules simply remove or narrow the contra-ceptive Mandate contained in and derivedfrom the Guidelines for certain plans. Theprevious regulations included a relianceclause in the accommodation provisions,but did not specify further details regard-ing the relationship between exempt enti-ties and their issuers or third party admin-istrators. Regarding the Religious IFC's expan- sion of the exemption to other kinds ofentities and individuals in general, com-menters disagreed about the likely effectsof the exemptions on the health coveragemarket. Some commenters said that ex-panding the exemptions would not causecomplications in the market, while others said that it could, due to such causes as alack of uniformity among plans or permit-ting multiple risk pools. The Departmentsnote that the extent to which plans covercontraception under the prior regulations is already far from uniform. Congress didnot require all entities to comply withsection 2713 of the PHS Act (under whichthe Mandate was promulgated)\u2014most no-tably by exempting grandfathered plans.Moreover, under the previous regulations,issuers were already able to offer plansthat omit contraceptives\u2014or offer onlysome contraceptives\u2014to houses of wor-ship and integrated auxiliaries; some com-menters and litigants said that issuerswere doing so. These cases where plansdid not need to comply with the Mandate,and the Departments' previous accommo-dation process allowing coverage not tobe provided in certain self-insured churchplans, together show that the importanceof a uniform health coverage system is notsignicantly harmed by allowing plans toomit contraception in some contexts. 56 Concerning the prospect raised by commenters of different risk pools be-tween men and women, PHS Act section2713(a) itself provides for some preven-tive services coverage that applies to bothmen and women, and some that wouldapply only to women. With respect to thelatter, it does not specify what, if any-thing, HRSA's Guidelines for women'spreventives services would cover, or ifcontraceptive coverage would be required.These rules do not require issuers to offerproducts that satisfy religiously objectingentities or individuals; they simply makeit legal to do so. The Mandate has beenimposed only relatively recently, and thecontours of its application to religious en-tities has been in continual flux, due tovarious rulemakings and court orders.Overall, concerns raised by some publiccommenters have not led the Departmentsto consider it likely that offering theseexpanded exemptions will cause any in-jury to the uniformity or operability of thehealth coverage market. D. Plan Sponsors in General (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i) prefatory text) With respect to employers and others that sponsor group health plans, in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i), the Religious IFC pro- 56See also Real Alternatives Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , 867 F.3d 338, 389 (3d Cir. 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a result of market forces, doing so would not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market.. . . Because the government has failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the ACA) would be unworkable, it has not satised strict s crutiny.\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 877vided exemptions for non-governmental plan sponsors that object to coverage ofall, or a subset of, contraceptives or ster-ilization and related patient education andcounseling based on sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. The Departments nalizethe prefatory text of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)without change. The expanded exemptions covered any kind of non-governmental employer plansponsor with the requisite objections, stat-ing the exemption encompassed \"[a]group health plan and health insurancecoverage provided in connection with agroup health plan to the extent the non-governmental plan sponsor objects asspecied in paragraph (a)(2) of this sec-tion.\" For the sake of clarity, the expandedexemptions also stated that \"[s]uch non- governmental plan sponsors include, butare not limited to, the following enti-ties,\" followed by an illustrative, non-exhaustive list of non-governmental or-ganizations whose objections qualifythe plans they sponsor for an exemption. Each type of such entities, and com-ments specically concerning them, arediscussed below. The plans of governmental employers are not covered by the plan sponsor ex-emption in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i). Some com-menters suggested that the expandedreligious exemptions should includegovernment entities. Others disagreed.The Departments are not aware of rea-sons why it would be appropriate ornecessary to offer a religious exemptionto governmental employer plan sponsorswith respect to the contraceptive Man-date. We are unaware of governmententities that would attempt to assert areligious exemption to the Mandate, andit is not clear to us that a governmentalentity could do so. Accordingly, we con-clude that it is appropriate for us to notfurther expand the religious exemptionto include governmental entities in thereligious plan-sponsor exemption. Nevertheless, as discussed below, gov- ernmental employers are permitted to re-spect an individual's objection under\u00a7 147.132(b) and, thus, to provide healthcoverage without the objected-to contracep-tive coverage to such individual. Where thatexemption is operative, the Guidelines maynot be construed to prevent a willing gov-ernmental plan sponsor of a group healthplan from offering a separate benet pack- age option, or a separate policy, certicateor contract of insurance, to any individualwho objects to coverage or payments forsome or all contraceptive services based onsincerely held religious beliefs. By the general extension of the exemp- tion to the plans of plan sponsors in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i), these nal rules alsoexempt group health plans sponsored byan entity other than an employer (for ex-ample, a union, or a sponsor of a multiem-ployer plan) that objects based on sin-cerely held religious beliefs to coverage ofcontraceptives or sterilization. Some com-menters objected to extending the exemp-tion to such entities, arguing that theycould not have the same kind of religiousobjection that a single employer mighthave. Other commenters supported theprotection of any plan sponsor with therequisite religious objection. The Depart-ments conclude that it is appropriate,where the plan sponsor of a union, mul-tiemployer, or similar plan adopts a reli-gious objection using the same proceduresthat such a plan sponsor might use tomake other decisions, that the expandedexemptions should respect that decisionby providing an exemption from the Man-date. E. Houses of Worship and Integrated Auxiliaries (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A)) As noted above, the exemption in the previous regulations, found at \u00a7 147.131(a),included only \"an organization that is orga-nized and operates as a nonprot entity andis referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or(iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,as amended.\" Section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or(iii) of the Code encompasses and conventionsor associations of churches,\" and \"the ex-clusively religious activities of any religiousorder.\" The Religious IFC expanded the exemp- tion to include, in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A),plans sponsored by \"[a] church, an inte-grated auxiliary of a church, a convention orassociation of churches, or a religious or-der.\" Most commenters did not oppose theexemptions continuing to include these en-tities, although some contended that the De-partments have no authority to exempt anyentity or plan from the Mandate, an objec-tion to which the Departments respond above. Notably, this exemption exempts \"areligious order,\" and not merely \"the exclu-sively religious activities of any religiousorder.\" In addition, section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i)species that it covers churches, not merely\"the exclusively religious activities\" of achurch. Some religious people might ex-press their beliefs through a church, othersmight do so through a religious order, andstill others might do so through religiousbodies that take a different form, structure,or nomenclature based on a different cul-tural or historical tradition. Cf. Hosanna- Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church andSchool v. E.E.O.C. , 565 U.S. 171, 198 (2012) (Alito and Kagan, JJ., concurring)(\"The term 'minister' is commonly used bymany Protestant denominations to refer tomembers of their clergy, but the term israrely if ever used in this way by Catholics,Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists.\"). Forthe purposes of respecting the exercise ofreligious beliefs, which the expanded ex-emptions in these rules concern, the Depart- ments nd it appropriate that this part of theexemption encompasses religious ordersand churches similarly, without limiting thescope of the protection to the exclusivelyreligious activities of either kind of entity.Based on all these considerations, the De-partments nalize \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A)without change. Moreover, the Departments also nal- ize the regulatory text to exempt plans\"established or maintained by\" a house ofworship or integrated auxiliary on a plan,not employer, basis. Under previous reg-ulations, the Departments stated that \"theavailability of the exemption or accom-modation [was to] be determined on an employer by employer basis , which the Department s... believe[d] best bal- ance[d] the interests of religious employ-ers and eligible organizations and those ofemployees and their dependents.\" (78 FR39886 (emphasis added)). Therefore, un-der the prior exemption, if an employerparticipated in a house of worship'splan\u2014perhaps because it was afliatedwith a house of worship\u2014but was not anintegrated auxiliary or a house of worshipitself, that employer was not covered bythe exemption, even though it was, in theordinary meaning of the text of the priorregulation, participating in a \"plan estab-lished or maintained by a [house of wor- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 878ship].\" Upon further consideration, in the Religious IFC, the Departments changedtheir view on this issue and expanded theexemption for houses of worship and in-tegrated auxiliaries. Under these rules, theDepartments intend that, when this regu-lation text exempts a plan \"established ormaintained by\" a house of worship orintegrated auxiliary, such exemption willno longer \"be determined on an employerby employer basis,\" but will be deter-mined on a plan basis\u2014that is, by whetherthe plan is a \"plan established or main-tained by\" a house of worship or inte-grated auxiliary. This interpretation betterconforms to the text of the regulation set-ting forth the exemption\u2014in both theprior regulation and in the text set forth inthese nal rules. It also offers appropriaterespect to houses of worship and theirintegrated auxiliaries not only in their in-ternal employment practices, but in theirchoice of organizational form and/or intheir activity of establishing or maintain-ing health plans for employees of associ-ated employers that do not meet the re-quirement of being integrated auxiliaries.Under this interpretation, houses of wor-ship would not be faced with the potentialof having to include, in the plans that theyhave established and maintained, cover-age for services to which they have areligious objection for employees of anafliated employer participating in theplans. The Departments do not believe there is a sufcient factual basis to excludefrom this part of the exemption entitiesthat are so closely associated with a house of worship or integrated auxiliary thatthey are permitted to participate in itshealth plan but are not themselves inte-grated auxiliaries. Additionally, this inter-pretation is not inconsistent with the op-eration of the accommodation under theprior regulation where with respect toself-insured church plans, hundreds ofnonprot religious entities participating inthose plans were provided a mechanismby which their plan participants would notreceive contraceptive coverage throughthe plan or third party administrator. 57 Therefore, the Departments believe it is most appropriate to use a plan basis, notan employer by employer basis, to deter-mine the scope of an exemption for a group health plan established or main-tained by a house of worship or integratedauxiliary. F. Nonprot Organizations (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i)(B)) The exemption under previous regula- tions did not encompass nonprot religious organizations beyond one that is organizedand operates as a nonprot entity and isreferred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or(iii) of the Code. The Religious IFC ex-panded the exemption to include planssponsored by orga- nization,\" Religious IFCalso 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A),as under the prior exemption, that theexemption covers \"a group health planestablished or maintained b y...[ a ] church, the integrated auxiliary of achurch, a convention or association ofchurches, or a religious order.\" (Herein-after \"houses of worship and integratedauxiliaries.\") These rules nalize, with-out change, the text of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(A) and (B). The Departments received comments in support of, and in opposition to, thisexpansion. Some commenters supportedthe expansion of the exemptions beyond houses of worship and integrated auxiliariesto other nonprot organizations with reli-gious objections (referred to herein as \"reli-gious nonprot\" organizations, groups oremployers). They said that religious beliefand exercise in American law has not beenlimited to worship, that religious people en-gage in service and social engagement aspart of their religious exercise, and, there-fore, that the Departments should respectthe religiosity of nonprot groups evenwhen they are not houses of worship andintegrated auxiliaries. Some public com-menters and litigants have indicated thatvarious religious nonprot groups possessdeep religious commitments even if they arenot houses of worship or their integratedauxiliaries. Other commenters did not sup-port the expansion of exemptions to non-prot organizations. Some of them de-scribed churches as having a special status that should not be extended to religious non-prot groups. Some others contended thatwomen at nonprot religious organizationsmay support or wish to use contraceptivesand that if the exemptions are expanded, itwould deprive all or most of the employeesof various religious nonprot organizationsof contraceptive coverage. After evaluating the comments, the De- partments continue to believe that an ex-panded exemption is the appropriate ad-ministrative response to the substantialburdens on sincere religious beliefs im-posed by the contraceptive Mandate, aswell as to the litigation objecting to thesame. We agree with the comments thatreligious exercise in this country has longbeen understood to encompass actionsoutside of houses of worship and theirintegrated auxiliaries. The Departments'previous assertion that the exemptionswere intended to respect a certain sphereof church autonomy (80 FR 41325) is not,in itself, grounds to refuse to extend theexemptions to other nonprot entities withreligious objections. Respect for churchesdoes not preclude respect for other reli-gious entities. Among religious nonprotorganizations, the Departments no longeradhere to our previous assertion that\"[h]ouses of worship and their integratedauxiliaries that object to contraceptivecoverage on religious grounds are morelikely than other employers to employpeople of the same faith who share thesame objection.\" (78 FR 39874.) It is notclear to the Departments that the percent-age of women who work at churches that oppose contraception, but who supportcontraception, is lower than the percent-age of woman who work at nonprot re-ligious organizations that oppose contra-ception on religious grounds, but whosupport contraception. In addition, publiccomments and litigation reflect that manynonprot religious organizations publiclydescribe their religiosity. Government re-cords and those groups' websites also of-ten reflect those groups' religious charac-ter. If a person who desires contraceptivecoverage works at a nonprot religiousorganization, the Departments believe it issufciently likely that the person wouldknow, or would know to ask, whether the 57See supra at II.A.3. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 879organization offers such coverage. The Departments are not aware of federal lawsthat would require a nonprot religiousorganization that opposes contraceptivecoverage to hire a person who the organi-zation knows disagrees with the organiza-tion's view on contraceptive coverage. In-stead, nonprot organizations generallyhave access to a First Amendment right ofexpressive association and religious freeexercise to choose to hire persons (or, inthe case of students, to admit them) basedon whether they share, or at least will berespectful of, their beliefs. 58 In addition, it is not at all clear to the Departments that expanding the exemp-tions would, as some commenters as-serted, remove contraceptive coveragefrom employees of many large religiousnonprot organizations. Many large reli-gious nonprot employers, including butnot limited to some Catholic hospitals,notied the Department under the last Ad-ministration that they had opted into theaccommodation and expressed no objec-tions to doing so. We also received publiccomments from organizations of similarnonprot employers indicating that the ac-commodation satised their religious ob-jections. These nal rules leave the ac-commodation in place as an optionalprocess. Thus, it is not clear to the Depart-ments that all or most of such large non- prot employers will choose to use theexpanded exemption instead of the ac-commodation. If they continue to use theaccommodation, their insurers or thirdparty administrators would continue to berequired to provide contraceptive cover-age to the plan sponsors' employeesthrough such accommodation. Given the sincerely held religious be- liefs of many nonprot religious organi-zations, some commenters also contendedthat continuing to impose the contracep-tive Mandate on certain nonprot reli-gious objectors might also undermine theGovernment's broader interests in ensur-ing health coverage by causing some en-tities to stop providing health coverageentirely. 59Although the Departments donot know the extent to which that effect would result from not extending exemp-tions, we wish to avoid that potential ob-stacle to the general expansion of healthcoverage. G. Closely Held For-Prot Entities (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i)(C)) The previous regulations did not ex- empt plans sponsored by closely held for-prot entities; however, the Religious IFCincluded in its list spon-sors, change. Some commenters supported including these entities in the exemption, saying own-ers of such entities exercise their religiousbeliefs through their businesses and shouldnot be burdened by a federal governmentalcontraceptive Mandate. O ther commenters opposed extending the exemption toclosely held for-prot entities, sayingthe entities cannot exercise religion orshould not have their religious opposi-tion to contraceptive coverage protectedby the exemption. Some said the entitiesshould not be able to impose their be-liefs about contraceptive coverage ontheir employees, and that doing so con-stitutes discrimination. As set forth in the Religious IFC, the Departments believe it is appropriate toexpand the exemptions to include closelyheld for-prot employers in order to pro-tect the religious exercise of those entitiesand their owners. The ACA did not applythe preventive services mandate to themany grandfathered health plans amongclosely held as well as publicly tradedfor-prot entities, encompassing tens ofmillions of women. As explained below,we are not aware of evidence showing thatthe expanded exemptions nalized herewill impact such a large number ofwomen. And, in the Departments' view,the decision by Congress to not apply thepreventive services mandate to grandfa-thered plans did not constitute improperdiscrimination or an imposition of beliefs.We also do not believe RFRA or the large number of other statutory exemptionsCongress has provided for religious be-liefs (including those exercised for prot)in certain health contexts such as steriliza-tion, contraception, or abortion have beenimproper. Including closely held for-prot enti- ties in the exemption is also consistentwith the Supreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby , which declared that a corporate entity is capable of possessing and pursu-ing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby , the pursuit of religious beliefs), regardlessof whether the entity operates as a non-prot organization, and rejected the pre-vious Administration's argument to thecontrary. 134 S. Ct. at 2768-75. Somereports and industry experts have indi-cated that few for-prot entities beyondthose that had originally challenged theMandate have sought relief from it afterHobby Lobby . 60 H. For-Prot Entities That Are Not Closely Held (45 CFR147.132(a)(1)(i)(D)) The previous regulations did not ex- empt for-prot entities that are not closelyheld. However, the Religious IFC in-cluded in its list of exempt plan sponsors,at \u00a7 \"[a] for-protentity \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D)without change. Under \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(D), the rules extend the exemption to the plans of for-prot entities that are not closely held.Some commenters supported includingsuch entities, including publicly tradedbusinesses, in the scope of the exemption.Some of them said that publicly tradedentities have historically taken various po-sitions on important public concerns be-yond merely (and exclusively) seeking thecompany's own prots, and that nothing in principle would preclude them from usingthe same mechanisms of corporate decision-making to exercise religious views againstcontraceptive coverage. They also said that 58Notably, \"the First Amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group's policy to be 'expressive association.'\" Boy Scouts of America v. Dale , 530 640, 655 (2000). 59See, e.g., Manya Brachear Pashman, \"Wheaton College ends coverage amid ght against birth control mandate,\" Chicago Tribune, July 29, 2015; Laura Ba ssett, \"Franciscan University Drops Entire Student Health Insurance Plan Over Birth Control Mandate,\" HuffPost, May 15, 2012. 60SeeJennifer Haberkorn, \"Two years later, few Hobby Lobby copycats emerge,\" Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate- employers-229627. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 880other protections for religious beliefs in fed- eral health care conscience statutes do notpreclude the application of such protectionsto certain entities on the basis that they arenot closely held, and federal law denes\"persons,\" protected under RFRA, to in-clude corporations at 1 U.S.C. 1. Othercommenters opposed including publiclytraded companies in the expanded exemp-tions. Some of these commenters stated thatsuch companies could not exercise religiousbeliefs, and opposed the effects on women ifthey could. These commenters also objectedthat including such employers, along withclosely held businesses, would extend theexemptions to all or virtually all employers. The Departments conclude it is appro- priate to include entities that are notclosely held within the expanded exemp-tions for entities with religious objection.RFRA prohibits the federal burden[ing] a it dem- onstrates that the application of the burdento the person\" is the least restrictivemeans to achieve a compelling govern-mental interest. 42 U.S.C. 2000bb-1(a) As companies, asso-ciations, rms, partnerships, societies, andjoint companies, as well as individ-uals.\" Accordingly, the Departments' de-cision to extend the religious exemption topublicly traded for prot corporations issupported by the text of RFRA. Themechanisms for determining whether acompany has adopted and holds certainprinciples or views, such as sincerely heldreligious beliefs, is a matter of well-established State law with respect to cor-porate decision-making, 61and the Depart- ments expect that application of such lawswould cabin the scope of this exemption. As to the impact of so extending the religious exemption, the Departments arenot aware of any publicly traded entitiesthat have publicly objected to providingcontraceptive coverage on the basis of re-ligious belief. As noted above, before the ACA, a substantial majority of employerscovered contraceptives. Some commenters opposed to including publicly traded entitiesin these exemptions noted that there did notappear to be any known religiously moti-vated objections to the Mandate from pub-licly traded for-prot corporations. Thesecomments support our estimates that includ-ing publicly traded entities in the exemp-tions will have little, if any effect, oncontraceptive coverage for women. Welikewise agree with the Supreme Court'sstatement in Hobby Lobby that it is unlikely that many publicly traded companies willadopt religious objections to offeringwomen contraceptive coverage. See134 S. Ct. at 2774. Some commenters contendedthat, because many closely held for-protbusinesses expressed religious objections tothe Mandate, or took advantage of the ac-commodation, it is likely that many publiclytraded businesses will do so. The Depart-ments agree it is possible that publiclytraded businesses may use the expanded ex-emption. But while scores of closely heldfor-prot businesses led suit against theMandate, no publicly traded entities did so,even though they were not authorized toseek the accommodation. Based on thesedata points, we believe the impact of theextension of the exemption to publiclytraded for-prot organizations will not besignicant. Below, based on limited data,but on years of receiving public commentsand defending litigation brought by organi-zations challenging the Mandate on the ba-sis of their religious objections, our bestestimate of the anticipated effects of theserules is that no publicly traded employerswill invoke the religious exemption. In the Departments' view, such esti- mate does not lead to the conclusion thatthe religious exemption should not be ex-tended to publicly traded corporations. The Departments are generally aware that,in a country as large as the U.S., com-prised of a supermajority of religious per- sons, 62some publicly traded entities might claim a religious character for their com-pany, or the majority of shares (or voting shares) of some publicly traded companiesmight be controlled by a small group ofreligiously devout persons so as to set forthsuch a religious character. 63Thus we con- sider it possible that a publicly traded com-pany might have religious objections to con-traceptive coverage. Moreover, as noted,there are many closely held for-prot cor-porations that do have religious objectionsto covering some or all contraceptives. TheDepartments do not want to preclude such aclosely held corporation from having to de-cide between relinquishing the exemption ornancing future growth by sales of stock,which would be the effect of denying it theexemption if it changes its status and be-came a publicly traded entity. The Depart-ments also nd it relevant that other federalconscience statutes, such as those applyingto hospitals or insurance companies, do notexclude publicly traded businesses fromprotection. 64As a result, the Departments continue to consider it appropriate not toexclude such entities from these expandedexemptions. I. Other Non-Governmental Employers (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E)) As noted above, the exemption in the previous regulations, found at \u00a7 147.131(a),included only churches, their integratedauxiliaries, conventions or associations ofchurches, and the exclusively religious ac-tivities of any religious order. The ReligiousIFC included, in its list of exempt plan spon-sors at \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)(E), \"[a]ny other non-governmental without change. Some commenters objected to extend- ing the exemption to other nongovern-mental employers, asserting that it is notclear such employers should be protected,nor that they can assert religious objec-tions. The Departments, however, agreewith other commenters that supported thatprovision of the Religious IFC. The De-partments believe it is appropriate that anynongovernmental employer asserting the 61Although the Departments do not prescribe any form or notication, they would expect that such principles or views would have been adopted and documen ted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction under which the organization is incorporated or organized. 62For example, in 2017, 74 percent of Americans said that religion is fairly important or very important in their lives, and 87 percent of Americans said t hey believe in God. Gallup, \"Religion,\" available at https://news.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx. 63See, for example , Kapitall, \"4 Publicly Traded Religious Companies if You're Looking to Invest in Faith\"(Feb. 7, 2014), http://www.nasdaq.com/article/4-publicl y-traded-religious- Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Div. H, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-141, and id.at Div. E, Sec. 808. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 881requisite religious objections should be protected from the Mandate in the sameway as other plan sponsors. Such otheremployers could include, for example, as-sociation health plans. 65The reasons dis- cussed above for providing the exemption tovarious specic kinds of employers, and fortheir ability to assert sincerely held religiousbeliefs using ordinary mechanisms of cor-porate decision-making, generally apply toother nongovernmental employers as well,if they have sincerely held religious beliefsopposed to contraceptive coverage and oth-erwise meet the requirements of these rules.We agree with commenters who contendthere is not a sufcient basis to excludeother nongovernmental employers from theexemption. J. Plans established or maintained by objecting nonprot entities (45 CFR147.132(a)(1)(ii)) Based on the expressed intent in the Religious IFC, as discussed above, to ex-pand the exemption to encompass plansestablished or maintained by nonprot or-ganizations with religious objections, andon public comments received concerningthose these rules nalize newlanguage in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii) to betterclarify the scope and application of theexemptions. The preamble to the Religious IFC contained several discussions about theDepartments' intent to exempt plans es-tablished or maintained by certain reli-gious organizations that have the requisiteobjection to contraceptive coverage, in-cluding instances in which the plans en-compass multiple employers. For exam-ple, as noted above, the Departmentsintended that the exemption for houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries be in-terpreted to apply on a plan basis, insteadof on an employer-by-employer basis. Inaddition, the Departments discussed atlength the fact that, under the prior regu-lations, where an entity was enrolled in aself-insured church plan exempt fromERISA under ERISA section 3(33) andthe accommodation in the previous regu-lations was used, that accommodationprocess provided no mechanism to im-pose, or enforce, the accommodation re-quirement of contraceptive coverage against a third party administrator of sucha plan. As a result, the prior accommoda-tion served, in effect, as an exemptionfrom requirements of contraceptive cover-age for all organizations and employerscovered under a self-insured church plan. In response to these discussions in the Religious IFC, some commenters, includ-ing some church plans, supported the ap-parent intent to exempt such plans on aplan basis, but suggested that additionalclarication is needed in the text of therule to effect this intent. They observedthat some plans are established or main-tained by religious nonprot entities thatmight not be houses of worship or inte-grated auxiliaries, and that some employ-ers that adopt or participate in such plansmay not be the \"plan sponsors.\" Theyrecommended, therefore, that the nalrules specify that the exemption applieson a plan basis when plans are establishedor maintained by houses of worship, inte-grated auxiliaries, or religious nonprots,so as to shield employers that adopt suchplans from penalties for noncompliancewith the Mandate. The text of the prefatory language of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1), as set forth in the Reli-gious IFC, declared that the Guidelineswould not apply \"with respect to a grouphealth plan established or maintained byan objecting organization, or health insur-ance coverage offered or arranged by anobjecting organization.\" We intended thislanguage to exempt a plan and/or cover-age where the entity that established ormaintained a plan was an objecting orga- nization, and not just to look at the viewsor status of individual employers (or otherentities) participating in such plan. TheDepartments agree with commenters whostated that additional clarity is needed andappropriate in these nal rules, in order toensure that such plans are exempt on aplan basis, and that employers joining oradopting those plans are exempt by virtueof the plan itself being exempt. Doing sowill make the application of the expandedexemption clearer, and protect employers(and other entities) participating in suchplans from penalties for noncompliancewith the Mandate. Clearer language willbetter realize the intent to exempt plansand coverage \"established or maintained by an objecting organization,\" and makethe operation of that exemption simpler byspecifying that the exemption appliesbased on the objection of the entity thatestablished or maintains the plan. Suchlanguage would also resolve the anomalythat, under the previous rules, only self-insured church plans (not insured churchplans) under ERISA section 3(33) effect, exempt\u2014but only indirectlythrough Departments' inability to im-pose, or enforce, the accommodation pro-cess against the third party administratorsof such plans, instead of being specicallyexempt in the rules. We believe entities participating in plans established or maintained by an ob-jecting organization usually share theviews of those organizations. Multiplelawsuits were led against the Depart-ments by churches that established ormaintained plans, or the church plansthemselves, and they generally declaredthat the entities or individuals participat-ing in their plans are usually required toshare their religious afliation or beliefs.In addition, because, as we have statedbefore, \"providing payments for contra-ceptive services is cost neutral for issuers\"(78 FR 39877), we do not believe thisclarication would produce any nancialincentive for entities that do not have re-ligious objections to contraceptive cover-age to enter into plans established ormaintained by an organization that doeshave such objections. Therefore, the D epartments nalize the text of \u00a7 147.132(a)(1) of the Reli- gious IFC with the following change:adding a provision that makes explicitthis understanding, in a new paragraphat \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii). This that the exemptions en-compassed \u00a7 147.132(a)(1) include:\"[a] group health plan, and health insur-ance coverage provided in connectionwith a group health plan, where the planor coverage is established or maintainedby a church, an integrated auxiliary of achurch, a convention or association ofchurches, a religious order, a nonprotorganization, or other organization orassociation, to the extent the plan spon-sor responsible for establishing and/or 65See 29 CFR 2510.3-5. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 882maintaining the plan objects as specied in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Theexemption in this paragraph applies toeach employer, organization, or plansponsor that adopts the plan[.]\" K. Institutions of Higher Education (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(iii)) The previous regulations did not ex- empt student health plans arranged by in-stitutions of higher education, although it did, for purposes of the accommodation,treat plans arranged by institutions of highereducation similar to the way in which theregulations treated plans of nonprot reli-gious employers. See80 FR at 41347. The Religious of exemp-tions, at \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii), \"[a]n institutionof higher education as dened in 20 U.S.C.1002 in its arrangement of student healthinsurance coverage, to the extent that insti-tution objects as specied in paragraph(a)(2) of this section. In the case of studenthealth insurance coverage, this section isapplicable in a manner comparable to itsapplicability to group health insurance cov-erage provided in connection with a grouphealth plan established or maintained by aplan sponsor that is an employer, and refer-ences to 'plan participants and beneciaries'will be interpreted as references to studentenrollees and their covered dependents.\"These rules nalize this language with achange to clarify their application, as dis-cussed below, and by redesignating theparagraph as \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii). These rules treat the plans of institu- tions of higher education that arrange stu-dent health insurance coverage similarlyto the way in which the rules treat theplans of employers. These rules do so bymaking such student health plans eligiblefor the expanded exemptions, and by per-mitting them the option of electing to uti-lize the accommodation process. Thus,these rules specify, in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii),that the exemption is extended, in the caseof institutions of higher education (as de-ned in 20 U.S.C. 1002) with objectionsto the Mandate based on sincerely heldreligious beliefs, to their arrangement ofstudent health insurance coverage in a manner comparable to the applicability ofthe exemption for group health insurancecoverage provided in connection with agroup health plan established or main-tained by a plan sponsor that is an em-ployer. Some commenters supported includ- ing, in the expanded exemptions, institu-tions of higher education that providehealth coverage for students through stu-dent health plans but have religious objec-tions to providing certain contraceptive coverage. They said that religious exemp-tions allow freedom for certain religiousinstitutions of higher education to exist,and this in turn gives students the choiceof institutions that hold different views onimportant issues such as contraceptivesand abortifacients. Other commenters op-posed including the exemption, assertingthat expanding the exemptions would neg-atively impact female students because in-stitutions of higher education might notcover contraceptives in student healthplans, women enrolled in those planswould not receive access to birth control,and an increased number of unintendedpregnancies would result among thosewomen. In the Departments' view, the reasons for extending the exemptions to institu-tions of higher education are similar to thereasons, discussed above, for extendingthe exemption to other nonprot organi-zations. Only a minority of students inhigher education receive health insurancecoverage from plans arranged by their col-leges or universities. 66It is necessarily true that an even smaller number receivesuch coverage from religious schools, andfrom religious or other private schoolsthat object to arranging contraceptive cov-erage. Religious institutions of higher ed-ucation are private entities with religiousmissions. Various commenters assertedthe importance, to many of those institu-tions, of being able to adhere to theirreligious tenets. Indeed, many studentswho attend such institutions do so becauseof the institutions' religious tenets. Nostudent is required to attend such an insti- tution. At a minimum, students who at-tend private colleges and universities havethe ability to ask those institutions in ad-vance what religious tenets they follow,including whether the institutions willprovide contraceptives in insurance plansthey arrange. Some students wish to re-ceive contraceptive coverage from ahealth plan arranged by an institution ofhigher education. But other students wishto attend an institution of higher educationthat adheres to its religious mission about contraceptives in health insurance. Andstill other students favor contraception,but are willing to attend a religious uni-versity without forcing it to violate itsbeliefs about contraceptive coverage. Ex-empting religious institutions that objectto contraceptive coverage still allows con-traceptive coverage to be provided by in-stitutions of higher education morebroadly. The exemption simply makes itlegal under federal law for institutions toadhere to religious beliefs that opposecontraception, without facing penalties fornon-compliance that could threaten theirexistence. This removes a possible barrierto diversity in the nation's higher educa-tion system, and makes it more possiblefor students to attend institutions of highereducation that hold those views. In addition, under the previous exemp- tion and accommodation, it was possiblefor self-insured church plans exempt fromERISA that have religious objection tocertain contraceptives to avoid any re-quirement that either they or their thirdparty administrators provide contraceptivecoverage. As seen in some public com-ments and litigation statements, somesuch self-insured church plans providehealth coverage for students at institutionsof higher education covered by thosechurch plans. In order to avoid the situa-tion where some student health planssponsored by institutions with religiousobjections are effectively exempt from thecontraceptive Mandate, and other studenthealth plans sponsored by other institu-tions with similar religious objections are 66The American College Health Association estimates that, in 2014, student health insurance plans at colleges and universities covered \"more than two million college students nationwide.\" \"Do You Know Why Student Health Insurance Matters?\" available at https://www.acha.org/documents/Networks/Coalitions/Why_SHIPs_Matter.pdf. We assume for the purposes of this estimate that those plans covered 2,100,000 million students. Data from the Department of Education shows that in 2014, there were 20,207,000 studen ts enrolled in degree-granting postsecondary institutions. National Center for Education Statistics, Table 105.20, \"Enrollment in elementary, secondary, and degree-granting postsecondary institutions, by level and control of institution, enrollment level, and attendance status and sex of student: Selected years, fall 1990 through fall 2026,\" available at https://nces .ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/ dt16_105.20.asp?current /H11005yes. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 883required to comply with the Mandate, the Departments consider it appropriate to ex-tend the exemption, so that religious col-leges and universities with objections tothe Mandate would not be treated differ-ently in this regard. The Departments also note that the ACA does not require institutions ofhigher education to provide student healthinsurance coverage. As a result, some in-stitutions of higher education that objectto the Mandate appear to have chosen tostop arranging student health insuranceplans, rather than comply with the Man-date or be subject to the accommoda-tion. 67Extending the exemption in these rules removes an obstacle to such entitiesdeciding to offer student health insuranceplans, thereby giving students anotherhealth insurance option. As noted above, it is not clear that studies discussing various effects of birthcontrol access clearly and specicallydemonstrate a negative impact to studentsin higher education because of the ex- panded exemption in these nal rules. TheDepartments consider these expanded ex-emptions to be an appropriate and permis-sible policy choice in light of various in-terests at stake and the lack of a statutoryrequirement for the Departments to im-pose the Mandate on entities and plansthat qualify for these expanded exemp-tions. Finally, the Religious IFC specied that the plan sponsor exemption applied to \"non-governmental\" plan sponsors (\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i)), including specied that the institution ofhigher education exemption applicableto the arrangement of student health in-surance coverage applied \"in a mannercomparable to its applicability to grouphealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with a group health plan es-tablished or maintained by a plan spon-sor that is an employer.\" Consequently,the Religious IFC's expanded exemp-tions only applied to non-governmentalinstitutions of higher education, includ-ing for student health insurance cover-age, not to governmental institutions ofhigher education. Nevertheless, the term \"non-governmental,\" while appearingtwice in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i) concerningplan sponsors, was not repeated in in\u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii). To more clearlyspecify that this limitation was intendedto apply to \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii), we nal-ize this paragraph with a change byadding the phrase \"which is non-governmental\" after the phrase \"An in-stitution of higher education as denedin 20 U.S.C. 1002\". L. Health Insurance Issuers (45 CFR 147.132(a)(1)(iv)) The previous regulations did not ex- empt health insurance issuers. However,the Religious IFC included in its list ofexemptions at \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iii), \"[a]health insurance issuer offering group orindividual insurance coverage to the ex-tent the issuer objects as specied in para- graph (a)(2) of this section. Where a healthinsurance issuer providing group health in-surance coverage is exempt under this para-graph (a)(1)(iii), the plan remains subject toany requirement to provide coverage forcontraceptive services under Guidelines is-sued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless it isalso exempt from that requirement[.]\" Theserules nalize this exemption with technicalchanges to clarify the language based onpublic comments, and redesignate the para-graph as \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(iv). The Religious IFC extends the exemp- tion to health insurance issuers offeringgroup or individual health insurance cov-erage that sincerely hold their own reli-gious objections to providing coverage forcontraceptive services. Under this exemp-tion, the only plan sponsors\u2014or in thecase of individual insurance coverage, in-dividuals\u2014who are eligible to purchase orenroll in health insurance coverage of-fered by an exempt issuer that does notcover some or all contraceptive services,are plan sponsors or individuals whothemselves object and whose plans areotherwise exempt based on their objec-tion. An exempt issuer can then offer anexempt health insurance product to an en-tity or individual that is exempt based oneither the moral exemptions for entitiesand individuals, or the religious exemp- tions for entities and individuals. Thus,the issuer exemption species that, wherea health insurance issuer providing grouphealth insurance coverage is exempt underparagraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, theplan remains subject to any requirement toprovide coverage for contraceptive ser-vices under Guidelines issued under\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), unless it is also ex-empt from that requirement. Under these rules, issuers that hold their own objections, based on sincerelyheld religious beliefs, could issue policiesthat omit contraception to plan sponsorsor individuals that are otherwise exemptbased on their religious beliefs, or on theirmoral convictions under the companionnal rules published elsewhere in today'sFederal Register . Likewise, issuers with sincerely held moral convictions, that areexempt under those companion nal rules,could issue policies that omit contracep-tion to plan sponsors or individuals thatare otherwise exempt based on either their religious beliefs or their moral convic-tions. In the separate companion IFC to the Religious IFC\u2014the Moral IFC\u2014the De-partments provided a similar exemptionfor issuers in the context of moral objec-tions, but we used slightly different oper-ative language. There, in the second sen-tence, instead of saying \"the plan remainssubject to any requirement to provide cov-erage for contraceptive services,\" the ex-emption stated, \"the group health plan es-tablished or maintained by the plansponsor with which the health insuranceissuer contracts remains subject to anyrequirement to provide coverage for con-traceptive services.\" Some commenterstook note of this difference, and asked theDepartments to clarify which languageapplies, and whether the Departments in-tended any difference in the operation ofthe two paragraphs. The Departments didnot intend the language to operate differ-ently. The language in the Moral IFC ac-curately, and more clearly, expresses theintent set forth in the Religious IFC abouthow the issuer exemption applies. Conse-quently, these rules nalize the issuer ex-emption paragraph from the Religious 67See, e.g., Manya Brachear Pashman, \"Wheaton College ends coverage amid ght against birth control mandate,\" Chicago Tribune, July 29, 2015; Laura Ba ssett, \"Franciscan University Drops Entire Student Health Insurance Plan Over Birth Control Mandate,\" HuffPost, May 15, 2012. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 884IFC with minor technical changes so that the nal language will mirror languagefrom the Moral IFC, stating that the ex-emption encompasses: \"[a] health insur-ance issuer offering group or individualinsurance coverage to the extent the issuerobjects as specied in paragraph (a)(2) ofthis section. Where a health insurance is-suer providing group health insurancecoverage is exempt under paragraph(a)(1)(iv) of this section, the group healthplan established or maintained by the plansponsor with which the health insuranceissuer contracts remains subject to anyrequirement to provide coverage for con-traceptive services under Guidelines is-sued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) unless it isalso exempt from that requirement[.]\" Some commenters supported including this exemption for issuers in these rules,both to protect the religious exercise ofissuers, and so that in the future religiousissuers that may wish to specically servereligious plan sponsors would be free toorganize. Other commenters objected to including an exemption for issuers. Someobjected that issuers cannot exercise reli-gious beliefs, while others objected thatexempting issuers would threaten contra-ceptive coverage for women. Some com-menters said that it was arbitrary and ca-pricious for the Departments to provide anexemption for issuers if we do not knowthat issuers with qualifying religious ob-jections exist. The Departments consider it appropri- ate to provide this exemption for issuers.Because the issuer exemption only applieswhere an independently exempt policy-holder (entity or individual) is involved,the issuer exemption will not serve to re-move contraceptive coverage obligationsfrom any plan or plan sponsor that is notalso exempt, nor will it prevent other is-suers from being required to provide con-traceptive coverage in individual or groupinsurance coverage. The issuer exemptiontherefore serves several interests, eventhough the Departments are not currentlyaware of existing issuers that would use it.As noted by some commenters, allowingissuers to be exempt, at least with respectto plan sponsors and plans that indepen-dently qualify for an exemption, will re- move a possible obstacle to religious is-suers being organized in the future toserve entities and individuals that wantplans that respect their religious beliefs ormoral convictions. Furthermore, permit-ting issuers to object to offering contra-ceptive coverage based on sincerely heldreligious beliefs will allow issuers to con-tinue to offer coverage to plan sponsorsand individuals, without subjecting themto liability under section 2713(a)(4), orrelated provisions, for their failure to pro-vide contraceptive coverage. In this way,the issuer exemption serves to protect ob-jecting issuers from being required to is-sue policies that cover contraception inviolation of the issuers' sincerely held re-ligious beliefs, and from being required toissue policies that omit contraceptive cov-erage to non-exempt entities or individu-als, thus subjecting the issuers to potentialliability if those plans are not exempt fromthe Guidelines. The Departments reject the proposition that issuers cannot exercise religious be-liefs. First, since RFRA protects the reli-gious exercise of corporations as persons,the religious exercise of health insuranceissuers\u2014which are generally organized ascorporations\u2014is protected by RFRA. Inaddition, many federal health care con-science laws and regulations specicallyprotect issuers or plans. For example, 42U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or managed care or-ganizations in Medicaid or MedicareAdvantage. The Weldon Amendment spe-cically protects, among other entities, provider-sponsored organizations, healthmaintenance organizations (HMOs), as a \"health care entity\" from beingrequired to pay for, or provide coverage of,abortions. See for example , Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Pub. L. No.115-141, Div. H, Sec. 507(d), 132 Stat. 348,764 (Mar. 23, 2018). 68Congress also de- clared this year that \"it is the intent of Con-gress\" to include a \"conscience clause\"which provides exceptions for religious be-liefs if the District of Columbia requires \"theprovision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans.\" See id . at Div. E, Sec. 808, 132 Stat. at 603. In light of theclearly expressed intent of Congress to pro-tect religious liberty, particularly in certainhealth care contexts, along with the specicefforts to protect issuers, the Departmentshave concluded that an exemption for issu-ers is appropriate. The issuer exemption does not specif- ically include third party administrators,although the optional accommodationprocess provided under these nal rulesspecies that third party administratorscannot be required to contract with anentity that invokes that process. Some re-ligious third party administrators havebrought suit in conjunction with suitsbrought by organizations enrolled inERISA-exempt church plans. Such plansare now exempt under these nal rules,and their third party administrators, asclaims processors, are under no obligationunder section 2713(a)(4) to provide bene-ts for contraceptive services, as that sec-tion applies only to plans and issuers. Inthe case of ERISA-covered plans, planadministrators are obligated under ERISAto follow the plan terms, but it is theDepartments' understanding that thirdparty administrators are not typically des-ignated as plan administrators, and, there-fore, would not normally act as planadministrators, under section 3(16) ofERISA. Therefore, to the Departments'knowledge, it is only under the existingaccommodation process that third partyadministrators are required to undertakeany obligations to provide or arrange forcontraceptive coverage to which theymight object. These rules make the ac-commodation process optional for em-ployers and other plan sponsors, and spec-ify that third party administrators thathave their own objection to complyingwith the accommodation process may de-cline to enter into, or decline to continue,contracts as third party administrators ofsuch plans. 68ACA section 1553 protects an identically \"health care entities,\" including provider-sponsored organizations, HMOs, health insurance plans, and \"any other kind o f... plan,\" from being subject to discrimination on the basis that it does not provide any health care item or service furnishing for the purpose of assisted suicid e, euthanasia, mercy killing, and the like. ACA section 1553, 42 U.S.C. 18113. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 885M. Description of the Religious Objection (45 CFR 147.132(a)(2)) The previous regulations did not spec- ify what, if any, religious objection ap-plied to its exemption; however, the Reli-gious IFC set forth the scope of thereligious objection of objecting entities in\u00a7 147.132(a)(2), as follows: \"The exemp-tion of this paragraph (a) will apply to theextent that an entity described in para-graph (a)(1) of this section objects to itsestablishing, maintaining, providing, of-fering, or arranging (as applicable) cover-age, payments, or a plan that providescoverage or payments for some or all con-traceptive services, based on its sincerelyheld religious beliefs.\" These rules nal-ize this description with technical changesto clarify the scope of the objection asintended in the Religious IFC, and basedon public comments. Throughout the exemptions for object- ing entities, the rules specify that theyapply where the entities object as speci-ed in \u00a7 147.132(a)(2) of the ReligiousIFC. That paragraph describes the reli-gious objection by specifying that exemp-tions for objecting entities will apply tothe extent that an entity described in para-graph (a)(1) objects to its establishing,maintaining, providing, offering, or ar-ranging (as applicable) coverage, pay-ments, or a plan that provides coverage orpayments for some or all contraceptiveservices, based on its sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. In the separate companion IFC to the Religious IFC\u2014the Moral IFC\u2014the De-partments, at \u00a7 147.133(a)(2), provided asimilar description of the scope of theobjection based on moral convictionsrather than religious beliefs, but we usedslightly different operative language.There, instead of saying the entity \"ob-jects to its establishing, maintaining, pro- viding, offering, or arranging (as applica-ble) coverage, payments, or a plan thatprovides coverage or payments for someor all contraceptive services,\" the para-graph stated the entity \"objects to its es-tablishing, maintaining, providing, offer-ing, or arranging (as applicable) coverageor payments for some or all contraceptiveservices, or for a plan, issuer, or thirdparty administrator that provides or ar-ranges such coverage or payments.\" Somecommenters took note of this difference, and asked the Departments to clarifywhich language applies, and whether theDepartments intended any difference inthe operation of the two paragraphs. TheDepartments did not intend the languageto operate differently. The language in theMoral IFC accurately, and more clearly,expresses the intent set forth in the Reli-gious IFC about how the issuer exemptionapplies. The Religious IFC explained thatthe intent of the expanded exemptions wasto encompass entities that objected to pro-viding or arranging for contraceptive cov-erage in their plans, and to encompassentities that objected to the previous ac-commodation process, by which their is-suers or third party administrators wererequired to provide contraceptive cover-age or payments in connection with theirplans. In other words, an entity would beexempt from the Mandate if it objected tocomplying with the Mandate, or if it ob-jected to complying with the accommoda-tion. The language in the Religious IFC encompassed both circumstances by en-compassing an objection to providing\"coverage [or] payments\" for contracep-tive services, and by encompassing an ob-jection to \"a plan that provides\" coverageor payments for contraceptive services.But the language describing the objectionset forth in the Moral IFC does so moreclearly, and restructuring the sentencecould make it clearer still. Questions bycommenters about the scope of the de-scription suggests that we should restruc-ture the description, in a non-substantiveway, to provide more clarity. The Depart-ments do this by breaking some of the textout into subparagraphs, and rearrangingclauses so that it is clearer which wordsthey modify. The new structure speciesthat it includes an objection to establish-ing, maintaining, providing, offering, orarranging for (as applicable) coverage orpayments for contraceptive services, andit includes an objection to establishing,maintaining, providing, offering, or ar-ranging for (as applicable) a plan, issuer,or third party administrator that providescontraceptive coverage. This more clearlyencompasses objections to complyingwith either the Mandate or the accommo-dation. Consequently, these rules nalizethe paragraph describing the religious ob-jection in the Religious IFC with minortechnical changes so that the nal lan- guage will essentially mirror languagefrom the Moral IFC. The introductoryphrase of the religious objection set forthin paragraph (a)(2) is nalized to state theexemption \"will apply to the extent that anentity described in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection objects, based on its sincerely heldreligious beliefs, to its establishing, main-taining, providing, offering, or arrangingfor (as applicable)\". The remainder ofthe paragraph is broken into two sub-paragraphs, regarding either \"coverage orpayments for some or all contraceptiveservices,\" or \"a plan, issuer, or third partyadministrator that provides or arrangessuch coverage or payments.\" Some commenters observed that by al- lowing exempt groups to object to \"someor all\" contraceptives, this might yield acafeteria-style approach where differentplan sponsors choose various combina-tions of contraceptives that they wish tocover. Some commenters further observedthat this might create a burden on issuersor third party administrators. The Depart-ments have concluded, however, that, justas the exemption under the previous reg-ulations allowed entities to object to someor all contraceptives, it is appropriate tomaintain that flexibility for entities cov-ered by the expanded exemption. Notably,even where an entity or individual quali-es for an exemption under these rules,these rules do not require the issuer orthird party administrator to contract withthat entity or individual if the issueror third party administrator does not wishto do so, including because the issuer orthird party administrator does not wish tooffer an unusual variation of a plan. Theserules simply remove the federal Mandatethat, in some cases, could have led topenalties for an employer, issuer, or thirdparty administrator if they wished to spon- sor, provide, or administer a plan thatomits contraceptive coverage in the pres-ence of a qualifying religious objection.Similarly, under the previous exemption,the plans of houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries were exempt from offer-ing some or all contraceptives, but theprevious regulations did not require issu-ers and third party administrators to con-tract with those exempt entities if theychose not to do so. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 886N. Individuals (45 CFR 147.132(b)) The previous regulations did not pro- vide an exemption for objecting individu-als. However, the Religious IFC expandedthe exemptions to encompass objectingindividuals (referred to here as the \"indi-vidual exemption\"), at \u00a7 147.132(b).These rules nalize the individual Religious IFC with changes,which reflect both non-substantial techni-cal revisions, and changes based on publiccomments to more clearly express the in- tent of the Religious IFC. In the separate companion IFC to the Religious IFC\u2014the Moral IFC\u2014the De-partments, at \u00a7 147.133(b), provided a similar individual exemption, but we usedslightly different operative language. Wherethe Religious IFC described what may beoffered to objecting individuals as \"a sepa-rate benet package option, or a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insurance,\"the Moral IFC said a willing issuer and plansponsor may offer \"a separate policy, certif-icate or contract of insurance or a separategroup health plan or benet package option,to any individual who objects\" under theindividual exemption. Some commentersobserved this difference and asked whetherthe language was intended to encompass thesame options. The Departments intendedthese descriptions to include the same scopeof options. Some commenters suggestedthat the individual exemption should notallow the offering of \"a separate grouphealth plan,\" as set forth in the versionfound in \u00a7 147.133(b), because doing socould cause various administrative burdens.The Departments disagree, since grouphealth plan sponsors and group and individ-ual health insurance issuers would be free todecline to provide that option, including be-cause of administrative burdens. In addition,the Departments wish to clarify that, wherean employee claims the exemption, a will-ing issuer and a willing employer may,where otherwise permitted, offer the em-ployee participation in a group health insur-ance policy or benet option that complieswith the employee's objection. Conse-quently, these rules nalize the individualexemption by making a technical change tothe language to adopt the formulation, \"aseparate policy, certicate or contract of in-surance or a separate group health plan orbenet package option, to any group healthplan sponsor (with respect to an individual) or individual, as applicable, who objects\"under the individual exemption. Some commenters supported the indi- vidual exemption as providing appropriateprotections for the religious beliefs of in-dividuals who obtain their insurance cov-erage in such places as the individual mar-ket or exchanges, or who obtain coveragefrom a group health plan sponsor that doesnot object to contraceptive coverage but iswilling (and, as applicable, the issueris also willing) to provide coverage that isconsistent with an individual's religiousobjections. Some commenters also ob-served that, by specifying that the individ-ual exemption only operates where theplan sponsor and issuer, as applicable, arewilling to provide coverage that is consis-tent with the objection, the exemptionwould not impose burdens on the insur-ance market because the possibility ofsuch burdens would be factored into thewillingness of an employer or issuer tooffer such coverage. Other commenters disagreed and contended that allowing theindividual exemption would cause burdenand confusion in the insurance market.Some commenters also suggested that theindividual exemption should not allow theoffering of a separate group health planbecause doing so could cause various ad-ministrative burdens. The Departments agree with the com- menters who suggested the individual ex-emption will not burden the insurancemarket, and, therefore, conclude that it isappropriate to provide the individual ex-emption where a plan sponsor and, asapplicable, issuer are willing to cooperatein doing so. As discussed in the ReligiousIFC, the individual exemption only oper-ates in the case where the group healthplan sponsor or group or individual mar-ket health insurance issuer is willing toprovide the separate option; in the case ofcoverage provided by a group health plansponsor, where the plan sponsor is will-ing; or in the case where both a plansponsor and issuer are involved, both arewilling. The Departments conclude that itis appropriate to provide the individualexemption so that the Mandate will notserve as an obstacle among these variousoptions. Practical difculties that may beimplicated by one option or another willlikely be factored into whether plan spon-sors and issuers are willing to offer par- ticular options in individual cases. In addition, Congress has provided several protections for individuals whoobject to prescribing or providing contra-ceptives contrary to their religious beliefs.See for example , Consolidated Appropri- ations Act of 2018, Div. E, Sec. 726(c)(Financial Services and General Govern-ment Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No.115-141, 132 Stat. 348, 593-94 (Mar. 23,2018). While some commenters proposedto construe this provision narrowly, Con-gress likewise provided that, if the Districtof Columbia requires \"the provision ofcontraceptive coverage by health insur-ance plans,\" \"it is the intent of Congressthat any legislation enacted on such issueshould include a 'conscience clause'which provides exceptions for religiousbeliefs and moral convictions\". Id.at E, Sec. 808, 132 Stat. at 603. A religiousexemption for individuals would not beeffective if the government simultane-ously made it illegal for issuers and group health plans to provide individuals withpolicies that comply with the individual'sreligious beliefs. The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan par-ticipant, or subscriber in the individualmarket, is enrolled (for instance, to familycoverage covering the participant and hisor her beneciaries enrolled under theplan), but does not relieve the plan's orissuer's obligation to comply with theMandate with respect to the group healthplan generally, or, as applicable, to anyother individual policies the issuer offers. This individual exemption allows plan sponsors and issuers that do not speci-cally object to contraceptive coverage tooffer religiously acceptable coverage totheir participants or subscribers who doobject, while offering coverage that in-cludes contraception to participants orsubscribers who do not object. This indi-vidual exemption can apply with respectto individuals in plans sponsored by pri-vate employers or governmental employ-ers. By its terms, the individual exemption would also apply with respect to individ-uals in plans arranged by institutions ofhigher education, if the issuers offeringthose plans were willing to provide planscomplying with the individuals' objec- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 887tions. Because federal law does not re- quire institutions of higher education toarrange such plans, the institutions wouldnot be required by these rules to arrange aplan compliant with an individual's objec-tion if the institution did not wish to do so. As an example, in one lawsuit brought against the Departments, the State of Mis-souri enacted a law under which the Stateis not permitted to discriminate againstinsurance issuers that offer group healthinsurance policies without coverage forcontraception based on employees' reli-gious beliefs, or against the individual em-ployees who accept such offers. See Wie- land, 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015-16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat. 191.724). Under the indi-vidual exemption of these nal rules, em-ployers sponsoring governmental planswould be free to honor the objections ofindividual employees by offering themplans that omit contraceptive coverage,even if those governmental entities do notobject to offering contraceptive coveragein general. This individual exemption cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or anissuer to provide coverage omitting con-traception, or, with respect to health insur-ance coverage, to prevent the applicationof State law that requires coverage of suchcontraceptives or sterilization. Nor can theindividual exemption be construed to re-quire the guaranteed availability of cover-age omitting contraception to a plan spon-sor or individual who does not have asincerely held religious objection. This in-dividual exemption is limited to the re-quirement to provide contraceptive cover-age under section 2713(a)(4), and does notaffect any other federal or State law gov-erning the plan or coverage. Thus, if thereare other applicable laws or plan termsgoverning the benets, these nal rules donot affect such other laws or terms. Some individuals commented that they welcomed the individual exemption sothat their religious beliefs were not forcedto be in tension with their desire for healthcoverage. The Departments believe the in-dividual exemption may help to meet theACA's goal of increasing health coveragebecause it will reduce the incidence ofcertain individuals choosing to forego health coverage because the only cover-age available would violate their sincerelyheld religious beliefs. 69At the same time, this individual exemption \"does notundermine the governmental interestsfurthered by the contraceptive coveragerequirement,\" 70because, when the ex- emption is applicable, the individual doesnot want the coverage, and thereforewould not use the objectionable itemseven if they were covered. Some commenters welcomed the abil- ity of individuals covered by the individualexemption to be able to assert an objectionto either some or all contraceptives. Othercommenters expressed concern that theremight be multiple variations in the kinds ofcontraceptive coverage to which individualsobject, and this might make it difcult forwilling plan sponsors and issuers to providecoverage that complies with the religiousbeliefs of an exempt individual. As dis-cussed above, where the individual exemp-tion applies, it only affects the coverage ofan individual. If an individual only objectsto some contraceptives, and the individual'sissuer and, as applicable, plan sponsor arewilling to provide the individual a packageof benets omitting such coverage, but forpractical reasons they can only do so byproviding the individual with coverage thatomits all\u2014not just some\u2014contraceptives,the Departments believe that it favors indi-vidual freedom and market choice, and doesnot harm others, to allow the issuer and plansponsor to provide, in that case, a plan omit-ting all contraceptives if the individual iswilling to enroll in that plan. The languageof the individual exemption set forth in theReligious IFC implied this conclusion, byspecifying that the Guidelines requirementof contraceptive coverage did not applywhere the individual objected to some or allcontraceptives. Notably, this was differentthan the language applicable to the exemp-tions under \u00a7 147.132(a), which speciesthat the exemptions apply \"to the extent\" ofthe religious objections, so that, as discussedabove, the exemptions include only thosecontraceptive methods to which the objec-tion applied. In response to comments sug-gesting the language of the individual ex-emption was not sufciently clear on this distinction, however, the Departments inthese rules nalize the individual exemptionat \u00a7 147.133(b) with the following change,by adding the following sentence at the endof the paragraph: \"Under this exemption, ifan individual objects to some but not allcontraceptive services, but the issuer, and asapplicable, plan sponsor, are willing to pro-vide the individual with a separate policy,certicate or contract of insurance or a sep-arate group health plan or benet packageoption that omits all contraceptives, and theindividual agrees, then the exemption ap-plies as if the individual objects to all con-traceptive services.\" Some commenters asked for plain lan- guage guidance and examples about howthe individual exemption might apply inthe context of employer-sponsored insur-ance. Here is one such example. An em-ployee is enrolled in group health cover-age through her employer. The plan isfully insured. If the employee has sin-cerely held religious beliefs objecting toher plan including coverage for contracep-tives, she could raise this with her em-ployer. If the employer is willing to offerher a plan that omits contraceptives, theemployer could discuss this with the in-surance agent or issuer. If the issuer is alsowilling to offer the employer, with respectto this employee, a group health insurancepolicy that omits contraceptive coverage,the individual exemption would make it legal for the group health insurance issuer toomit contraceptives for her and her bene-ciaries under a policy, for her employer tosponsor that plan for her, and for the issuerto issue such a plan to the employer, tocover that employee. This would not affectother employees' plans\u2014those plans wouldstill be subject to the Mandate and wouldcontinue to cover contraceptives. But if ei-ther the employer, or the issuer, is not will-ing (for whatever reason) to offer a plan ora policy for that employee that omits con-traceptive coverage, these rules do not re-quire them to. The employee would havethe choice of staying enrolled in a plan withits coverage of contraceptives, not enrollingin that plan, seeking coverage elsewhere, orseeking employment elsewhere. 69See also, for example, Wieland , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1017, and March for Life , 128 F. Supp. 3d at 130, where the courts noted that the individual employee plaintiffs indicated that they viewed the Mandate as pressuring them to \"forgo health insurance altogether.\" 7078 FR 39874. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 888For all these reasons, these rules adopt the individual exemption language fromthe Religious IFC with clarifying changesto reflect the Departments' intent. Accommodation (45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, 29 CFR2590.715-2713A) The previous regulations set forth an accommodation process at 45 CFR147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and 29CFR 2590.715-2713A, as an alternativemethod of compliance with the Mandate.Under the accommodation, if a religiousnonprot entity, or a religious closely heldfor-prot business, objected to coverageof some or all contraceptive services in itshealth plan, it could le a notice or ll outa form expressing this objection and de-scribing its objection to its plan and issueror third party administrator. Upon doingso, the plan would not cover some or allcontraceptive services, and the issuer orthird party administrator would be respon-sible for providing or arranging for per-sons covered by the plan to receive cov-erage or payments of those services(except in the case of self-insured churchplans exempt from ERISA, in which caseno such obligation was imposed on thethird party administrator). The accommo-dation was set forth in regulations of eachof the Departments. Based on each De-partment's regulatory authority, HHS reg-ulations applied to insured group healthplans, and DOL and Treasury regulationsapplied to both insured group health plansand self-insured group health plans. The Religious IFC maintained the ac- commodation process. Nevertheless, byvirtue of expanding the exemptions to en-compass all entities that were eligible forthe accommodation process under the pre-vious regulations, in addition to other newly exempt entities, the Religious IFCrendered the accommodation process op-tional. Entities could choose not just be-tween the Mandate and the accommodation,but between the Mandate, the exemption,and the accommodation. These rules nal- ize the optional accommodation process andits location in the Code of Federal Regula-tions at 45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A, but the Departments do so with several changesbased on public comments. Many commenters supported keeping the accommodation as an optional process,including some commenters who otherwisesupported creating the expanded exemp-tions. Some commenters opposed makingthe accommodation optional, but asked theDepartments to return to the previous regu-lations in which entities that did not meetthe narrower exemption could only choosebetween the accommodation process or di-rect compliance with the Mandate. Somecommenters believed there should be noexemptions and no accommodation process. The Departments continue to consider it appropriate to make the accommodationprocess optional for entities that are oth-erwise also eligible for the expanded ex-emptions\u2014that is, to keep it in place as anoption that exempt entities can choose.The accommodation provides contracep-tive access, which is a result many oppo-nents of the expanded exemptions saidthey desire. The accommodation involvessome regulation of issuers and third partyadministrators, but the previous regula-tions had already put that regulatory struc-ture in place. These rules for the most partmerely keep it in place and maintain theway it operates. The Religious IFC addssome additional paperwork burdens as aresult of the new interaction between theaccommodation and the expanded exemp-tions; those are discussed below. Above, the Departments discussed public comments concerning whether weshould have merely expanded the accom-modation rather than expanding the ex-emptions. The Religious IFC and thesenal rules expand the kinds of entities thatmay use the optional accommodation, byexpanding the exemptions and allowingany exempt entities to opt to make use of the accommodation. Consequently, underthese rules, objecting employers may makeuse of the exemption or may choose to uti-lize the optional accommodation process. Ifan eligible organization uses the optionalaccommodation process through the EBSAForm 700 or other specied notice to HHS,it voluntarily shifts an obligation to provideseparate but seamless contraceptive cover- age to its issuer or third party administrator. Some commenters asked that these - nal rules create an alternative paymentmechanism to cover contraceptive ser-vices for third party administrators obli-gated to provide or arrange such coverageunder the accommodation. These rules donot concern the payment mechanism,which is set forth in separate rules at 45CFR 156.50. The Departments do notview an alternative payment mechanismas necessary. As discussed below, al-though the Departments do not know howmany entities will use the accommoda-tion, it is reasonably likely that some en-tities previously using it will continue todo so, while others will choose the ex-panded exemption, leading to an overallreduction in the use of the accommoda-tion. The Departments have reason to be-lieve that these nal rules will not lead toa signicant expansion of entities usingthe accommodation, since nearly all of theentities of which the Departments are aware that may be interested in doing sowere already able to do so prior to theReligious IFC. Moreover, it is still thecase under these rules that if an entityserving as a third party administrator doesnot wish to satisfy the obligations it wouldneed to satisfy under an accommodation,it could choose not to contract with anentity that opts into the accommodation.This conflict is even less likely now thatentities eligible for the accommodationare also eligible for the exemption. Forthese reasons, the Departments do not ndit necessary to add an additional paymentmechanism for the accommodation pro-cess. If an eligible organization wishes to revoke its use of the accommodation, itcan do so under these rules, and operateunder its exempt status. As part of itsrevocation, the issuer or third party ad-ministrator of the eligible organizationmust provide participants and benecia-ries written notice of such revocation.Some commenters suggested HHS has notyet issued guidance on the revocation pro-cess, but CCIIO provided guidance con-cerning this process on November 30,2017. 71These rules supersede that guid- 71SeeRandy Pate, \"Notice by Issuer or Third Party Administrator for Employer/Plan Sponsor of Revocation of the Accommodation for Certain Preventive Serv ices,\" CMS (Nov. 30, 2017), https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/Notice-Issuer-Third-Party-Employer-Preventive.pdf. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 889ance, and adopt or modify its specic guidelines as explained below. As a result,these rules delete references, set forth inthe Religious IFC's accommodation reg-ulations, to \"guidance issued by the Sec-retary of the Department of Health andHuman Services.\" The guidance stated that an entity that was using the accommodation under theprevious rules, or an entity that adopts theaccommodation maintained by the IFCs,could revoke its use of the accommoda-tion and use the exemption. This guidelineapplies under the nal rules. This revoca-tion process applies both prospectively toeligible organizations that decide at a laterdate to avail themselves of the optionalaccommodation and then decide to revokethat accommodation, as well as to organi-zations that invoked the accommodationprior to the effective date of the ReligiousIFC either by their submission of anEBSA Form 700 or notication, or bysome other means under which their thirdparty administrator or issuer was notiedby DOL or HHS that the accommodationapplies. The guidance stated that, when the ac- commodation is revoked by an entity us-ing the exemption, the issuer of the eligi-ble organization must provide participantsand beneciaries written notice of suchrevocation. These rules adopt that guide-line. Consistent with other applicablelaws, the issuer or third party administra-tor of an eligible organization mustpromptly notify plan participants and ben- eciaries of the change of status to theextent such participants and beneciariesare currently being offered contraceptivecoverage at the time the accommodatedorganization invokes its exemption. Theguidance further stated that the notice maybe provided by the organization itself, itsgroup health plan, or its third party admin-istrator, as applicable. The guidance statedthat, under the regulation at 45 CFR147.200(b), \"[t]he notice of modicationmust be provided in a form that is consis-tent with the rules of paragraph (a)(4) of this section,\" and (a)(4) has detailed ruleson when electronic notice is permitted.These guidelines still apply under the nalrules. These rules adopt those guidelines. The guidance further specied that the revocation of the accommodation wouldbe effective notice on the rst day of therst plan year that begins on or after 30days after the date of the revocation, oralternatively, whether or not the objectingentity's group health plan or issuer listedthe contraceptive benet in its Summaryof Benets of Coverage (SBC), the grouphealth plan or issuer could revoke the ac-commodation by giving at least 60-daysprior notice pursuant to section 2715(d)(4)of the PHS Act (incorporated into ERISAand the Code) 72and applicable regula- tions thereunder to revoke the accommo-dation. The guidance noted that, unlikethe SBC notication process, which caneffectuate a modication of benets in themiddle of a plan year, provided it is al-lowed by State law and the contract of thepolicy, the 30 day notication process un-der the guidance can only effectuate abenet modication at the beginning of aplan year. This part of the guidance isadopted in part and changed in part bythese nal rules, as follows, based on pub-lic comments on the issue. Some commenters asked that revoca- tions only be permitted to occur on therst day of the next plan year, or nosooner than January 2019, to avoid bur-dens on plans and because some states do not allow for mid-year plan changes. TheDepartments believe that providing 60-days notice pursuant to section 2715(d)(4)of the PHS Act, where applicable, is amechanism that already exists for makingchanges in health benets covered by agroup health plan during a plan year; thatprocess already takes into considerationany applicable state laws. However, inresponse to public comments, these ruleschange the accommodation provisionsfrom the Religious IFC to indicate that, asa transitional rule, providing 60-days no- tice for revoking an accommodation isonly available, if applicable, to plans thatare using the accommodation at the timeof the publication of these nal rules. As ageneral rule, for plans that use the accom-modation in future plan years, the Depart-ments believe it is appropriate to allowrevocation of an accommodation only onthe rst day of the next plan year. Basedon the objections of various litigants andpublic commenters, we believe that someentities already using the accommodationmay have been doing so only becauseprevious regulations denied them an ex-emption. For them, access to the transi-tional 60-days notice procedure (if appli-cable) is appropriate in the periodimmediately following the nalization ofthese rules. In future plan years, howev-er\u2014plan years that begin after the effec-tive date of these nal rules\u2014plans andentities that qualify as exempt under theserules will have been on notice that theyqualify for an exemption or the accommo-dation. If they have opted to enter or re-main in the accommodation in those fu-ture plan years, when they could havechosen the exemption, the Departmentsbelieve it is appropriate for them to waituntil the rst day of the following planyear to change to exempt status. 73 This change is implemented in the fol- lowing manner. In the Religious IFC, the accommodation provisions addressing revo-cation were found at 45 CFR 147.131(c)(4),26 CFR 54.9815-2713AT(a)(5) 74, and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A(a)(5). The provisions in the Religious IFC (with technical variations among theHHS, Labor, and Treasury rules) state thata written notice of revocation must beprovided \"as specied in guidance issuedby the Secretary of the Department ofHealth and Human Services.\" On Novem-ber 30, 2017, HHS issued the guidanceregarding revocation. These nal rules in-corporate this guidance, with certain clar-ications, and state that the revocation 72See also 29 CFR 2590.715-2715(b); 45 CFR 147.200(b). 73These nal rules go into effect 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register . Some entities currently using the accommodation may have a plan year that begins less than 30 days after the effective date of these nal rules. In such cases, they may be unable, after the effective date of these nal rules, to provide a revocatio n notice 30 days prior to the start of their next plan year. However, these nal rules will be published at least 60 days prior to the start of that plan year. Therefore, entities exempt under these nal rules that have been subject to the accommodation on the date these nal rules are published, that wish to revoke the accommodation, and whose next plan years start after these nal rules go into effect, but less than 30 days thereafter, may submit their 30 day revocation notices after these nal rules are published, before these nal rules are in effect, so that they will have submitted the revocation at least 30 days before their next plan year starts. In such cases, even though the revocation notice will be submitted before these nal rules are in effec t, the actual revocation will not occur until after these nal rules are in effect, and plan participants will have been provided with 30 days' notice of the revocation. 74The Department of the Treasury's rule addressing the accommodation is being nalized at 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, superseding its temporary regulation at 26 CFR 54.9815-2713AT. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 890notice must be provided \"as specied herein.\" The nal rule incorporates thetwo sets of directions for revoking theaccommodation initially set forth in theinterim guidance in the following manner.The rst, designated as subparagprah (1)as a \"[t]ransitional rule,\" explains that ifcontraceptive coverage is being offeredthrough the accommodation process onthe date on which these nal rules go intoeffect, 60-days notice may be provided torevoke the accommodation process, orthey revocation may occur \"on the rstday of the rst plan year that begins on orafter 30 days after the date of the revoca-tion\" consistent with PHS Act section2715(d)(4), 45 CFR 147.200(b), 26 CFR54.9815-2715(b), or 29 CFR 2590.715-2715(b). The second direction, set forth insubparagraph (ii), explains the \"[g]eneralrule\" that, in plan years beginning afterthe date on which these nal rules go intoeffect, revocation of the accommodationwill be effective on \"the rst day of therst plan year that begins on or after 30days after the date of the revocation.\" The Religious IFC states that if an ac- commodated entity objects to some, butnot all, contraceptives, an issuer for aninsured group health plan that covers con-traceptives under the accommodationmay, at the issuer's option, choose to pro-vide coverage or payments for all contra-ceptive services, instead of just for thenarrower set of contraceptive services towhich the entities object. Some comment-ers supported this provision, saying that itallows flexibility for issuers that mightotherwise face unintended burdens from providing coverage under the accommoda- tion for entities that object to only somecontraceptive items. The Departments havemaintained this provision in these nalrules. Note that this provision is consistentwith the other assertions in the rules sayingthat an entity's objection applies \"to theextent\" of the entity's religious beliefs, be-cause in this instance, under the accommo-dation, the plan participant or beneciarystill receives coverage or payments for allcontraceptives, and this provision simply al-lows issuers more flexibility in choosinghow to help provide that coverage. Some commenters asked that the De- partments retain the \"reliance\" provision,contained in the previous accommodation regulations, under which an issuer isdeemed to have complied with the Man-date where the issuer relied reasonablyand in good faith on a representation by aneligible organization as to its eligibilityfor the accommodation, even if that rep-resentation was later determined to be in-correct. The Departments omitted thisprovision from the Religious IFC, on thegrounds that this provision was less nec-essary where any organization eligible forthe optional accommodation is also ex-empt. Nevertheless, in order to respond to concerns in public comments, and to pre-vent any risk to issuers of a mistake ormisrepresentation by an organization seek-ing the accommodation process, the Depart-ments have nalized the Religious IFC withan additional change that restores thisclause. The clause uses the same languagethat was in the regulations prior to the Re-ligious IFC, and it is inserted at 45 and29 renumber subsequent para-graphs in each of those sections. P. Denition of Contraceptives for the Purpose of These Final Rules The previous regulations did not dene contraceptive services. The Guidelines is-sued in 2011 included, under \"Contracep-tive methods and counseling,\" \"[a]ll Foodand Drug Administration approved con-traceptive methods, sterilization proce-dures, and patient education and counsel-ing for all women with reproductivecapacity.\" The previous regulations con-cerning the exemption and the accommoda-tion used the terms contraceptive servicesand contraceptive coverage as catch-allterms to encompass all of those Guidelines'requirements. The 2016 update to theGuidelines are similarly worded. Under\"Contraception,\" they include the \"fullrange of contraceptive methods for womencurrently identied by use,and follow-up care (for example, manage-ment, and evaluation as well as changes toand removal or discontinuation of the con- traceptive method).\" 75 To more explicitly state that the ex- emption encompasses any of the contra-ceptive or sterilization services, items, orinformation that have been required under the Guidelines, the Religious IFC included adenition at CFR54.9815-2713A(e), and 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A(e), respectively. Q. Severability The Departments nalize without change (except for certain paragraph redes-ignations), the severability clauses in theinterim nal rules, namely, at paragraph (g)of 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, the redesig-nated paragraph (g) of 29 CFR 2590.715-2713A, and 45 CFR 147.132(d). R. Other Public Comments 1. Items Approved as Contraceptives But Used to Treat Existing Conditions Some commenters noted that some drugs included in the preventive servicescontraceptive Mandate can also be usefulfor treating certain existing health condi-tions, and that women use them for non-contraceptive purposes. Certain comment-ers urged the Departments to clarify thatthe nal rules do not permit employers toexclude from coverage medically neces-sary prescription drugs used for non-preventive services. Some commenterssuggested that religious objections to theMandate should not be permitted in caseswhere such methods are used to treat suchconditions, even if those methods can alsobe used for contraceptive purposes. Section 2713(a)(4) only applies to \"preventive\" care and screenings. Thestatute does not allow the Guidelines tomandate coverage of services providedsolely for a non-preventive use, such asthe treatment of an existing condition. TheGuidelines implementing this section ofthe statute are consistent with that narrow 75https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines-2016/index.html. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 891authority. They state repeatedly that they apply to \"preventive\" services or care.76 The requirement in the Guidelines con-cerning \"contraception\" species severaltimes that it encompasses \"contracep-tives,\" that is, medical products, methods,and services applied for \"contraceptive\"uses. The Guidelines do not require cov-erage of care and screenings that are non-preventive, and the contraception portionof those Guidelines do not require cover-age of medical products, methods, care,and screenings that are non-contraceptivein purpose or use. The Guidelines' inclu-sion of contraceptive services requirescoverage of contraceptive methods as atype of preventive service only when adrug that FDA has approved for contra-ceptive use is prescribed in whole or inpart for such purpose or intended use.Section 2713(a)(4) does not authorize theDepartments to require coverage, withoutcost-sharing, of drugs prescribed exclu-sively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an existing condi-tion. 77The extent to which contraceptives are covered to treat non-preventive condi-tions would be determined by applicationof the requirement section 1302(b)(1)(F)of the ACA to cover prescription drugs(where applicable), implementing regula-tions at 45 CFR 156.122, and 156.125, and plans' decisions about the basket ofmedicines to cover for these conditions. Some commenters observed that phar- macy claims do not include a medicaldiagnosis code, so plans may be unable todiscern whether a drug approved by FDAfor contraceptive uses is actually appliedfor a preventive or contraceptive use,or for another use. Section 2713(a)(4),however, draws a distinction between pre-ventive care and screenings and otherkinds of care and screenings. That subsec-tion does not authorize the Departments toimpose a coverage mandate of servicesthat are not at least partly applied for apreventive use, and the Guidelines them-selves do not require coverage of contra- ceptive methods or care unless such meth-ods or care is contraceptive in purpose.These rules do not prohibit issuers fromcovering drugs and devices that are ap-proved for contraceptive uses even whenthose drugs and devices are prescribed fornon-preventive, non-contraceptive pur-poses. As discussed above, these nalrules also do not purport to delineate theitems HRSA will include in the Guide-lines, but only concern expanded exemp- tions and accommodations that apply tothe extent the Guidelines require contra-ceptive coverage. Therefore, the Depart-ments do not consider it appropriate tospecify in these nal rules that undersection 2713(a)(4), exempt organiza-tions must provide coverage for drugsprescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use totreat an existing condition. 2. Comments Concerning Regulatory Impact Some commenters agreed with the De- partments' statement in the Religious IFCthat the expanded exemptions are likely toaffect only a small percentage of womenotherwise receiving coverage under theMandate. Other commenters disagreed,stating that the expanded exemptionscould take contraceptive coverage awayfrom many or most women. Still othersopposed expanding the exemptions andcontended that accurately determining thenumber of women affected by the ex-panded exemptions is not possible. After reviewing the public comments, the Departments agree with commenterswho said that estimating the impact ofthese nal rules is difcult based on thelimited data available to us, and with com-menters who agreed with the ReligiousIFC that the expanded exemptions arelikely to affect only a small percentage ofwomen. The Departments do not nd theestimates of large impacts submitted bysome commenters more reliable than the estimates set forth in the Religious andMoral IFCs. Even certain commenters that\"strongly oppos[ed]\" \"thousands\" wouldbe number consistent with theDepartments' estimate of the number ofwomen who may be affected by the rule.The Departments' estimates of the impact ofthese nal rules are discussed in more detailin the following section. Therefore, the De-partments conclude that the estimates ofregulatory impact made in the ReligiousIFC are still the best estimates available.Our estimates are discussed in more detail inthe following section. 3. Interaction with State Laws Some commenters asked the Depart- ments to discuss the interaction betweenthese nal rules and state laws that eitherrequire contraceptive coverage or providereligious exemptions from those and otherrequirements. Some commenters arguedthat providing expanded exemptions inthese rules would negate state contracep-tive requirements or narrower state reli-gious exemptions. Some commentersasked that the Departments specify thatthese exemptions do not apply to plans governed by state laws that requirecontraceptive coverage. The Departmentagrees that these rules concern only theapplicability of the Federal contraceptiveMandate imposed pursuant to section2713(a)(4). They do not regulate statecontraceptive mandates or state religiousexemptions. If a plan is exempt under theReligious IFC and these rules, that exemp-tion does not necessarily exempt the planor other insurance issuer from state lawsthat may apply to it. The previous regula-tions, which offered exemptions forhouses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries, did not include regulatory languagenegating the exemptions in states that re-quire contraceptive coverage, although 76Id. 77The Departments previously cited the IOM's listing of existing conditions that contraceptive drugs can be used to treat (menstrual disorders, acne, and pelvic pain), and said of those uses that \"there are demonstrated preventive health benets from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy.\" 77 FR 8727 & n.7. This was n ot, however, an assertion that PHS Act 2713(a)(4) or the Guidelines require coverage of \"contraceptive\" methods when prescribed for an exclusively non-contraceptive, non-preventive use. Instead, it was an observation that such drugs\u2014generally referred to as \"contraceptives\"\u2014also have some alternate benecial uses to treat existing conditions. For the purposes of the se nal rules, the Departments clarify here that the reference prior to the Religious IFC to the benets of using contraceptive drugs exclusively for some non-contraceptive and non-preven tive uses to treat existing conditions did not mean that the Guidelines require coverage of such uses, and consequently is not a reason to refrain from offering the expanded exemptions provi ded here. Where a drug approved by the FDA for contraceptive use is prescribed for both a contraceptive use and a non-contraceptive use, the Guidelines (to the extent they apply) woul d require its coverage for contraceptive use. Where a drug approved by the FDA for contraceptive use is prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an exist ing condition, it would be outside the scope of the Guidelines and the contraceptive Mandate. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 892the Departments discussed the issue to some degree in various preambles of thoseprevious regulations. The Departments do not consider it appropriate or necessary inthe regulatory text of the religious exemp-tions to declare that the Federal contracep-tive Mandate will still apply in states thathave a state contraceptive mandate, sincethese rules do not purport to regulate theapplicability of state contraceptive man-dates. 78 Some commenters observed that, through ERISA, some entities mayavoid state laws that require contracep-tive coverage by self-insuring. This is aresult of the application of the preemp-tion and savings clauses contained inERISA to state insurance regulation. See 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) & (b)(1). These rulescannot change statutory ERISA not change the standardsapplicable to ERISA preemption. To theextent Congress has decided that ERISApreemption includes preemption of statelaws requiring contraceptive coverage,that decision occurred before the ACAand was not negated by the ACA. Con-gress did not mandate in the ACA thatany Guidelines issued under section2713(a)(4) must include contraceptives,nor that the Guidelines must force enti-ties with religious objections to covercontraceptives. IV. Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden The Departments have examined the impacts of the Religious IFC and the nalrules as required by Executive Order12866 on Regulatory Planning and Re-view (September 30, 1993), Executive Or-der 13563 on Improving Regulation andRegulatory Review (January 18, 2011),the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)(September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96 354),section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act,section 202 of the Unfunded MandatesReform Act of 1995 (March 22, 1995;Pub. L. 104-4), Executive Order 13132on Federalism (August 4, 1999), the Con-gressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)),and Executive Order 13771 on ReducingRegulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (January 30, 2017). A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563\u2014 Department of HHS and Department ofLabor Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 di- rect agencies to assess all costs and ben-ets of available regulatory alternativesand, if regulation is necessary, to selectregulatory approaches that maximize netbenets (including potential economic,environmental, and bothcosts and benets, reducing costs, harmo-nizing rules, and promoting flexibility. Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 denes a \"signicant regulatory action\" asan action that is likely to result in a reg-ulation: (1) having an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more in anyone year, or adversely and materially af-fecting a sector of the economy, produc-tivity, competition, jobs, the environment,public health or safety, or State, local, ortribal governments or communities (alsoreferred to as \"economically signicant\");(2) creating a serious inconsistency or oth-erwise interfering with an action taken orplanned by another agency; (3) materiallyaltering the budgetary impacts of entitle-ment grants, user fees, or loan programsor the rights and obligations of recipientsthereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policyissues arising out of legal mandates, thePresident's priorities, or the principles setforth in the Executive Order. A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economi-cally signicant effects ($100 million ormore in any one year), and an \"economi-cally signicant\" regulatory action is sub-ject to review by the Ofce of Manage-ment and Budget (OMB). As discussedbelow regarding their anticipated effects,the Religious IFC and these rules are notlikely to have economic impacts of $100million or more in any one year, andtherefore do not meet the denition of\"economically signicant\" under Execu-tive Order 12866. However, OMB hasdetermined that the actions are signicant within the meaning of section 3(f)(4) ofthe Executive Order. Therefore, OMB hasreviewed these nal rules, and the Depart-ments have provided the following assess-ment of their impact. 1. Need for Regulatory Action These nal rules adopt as nal and further change the amendments made bythe Religious IFC, which amended theDepartments' July 2015 nal regulations.The Religious IFC and these nal rulesexpand the exemption from the require-ment to provide coverage for contracep-tives and sterilization, established under the HRSA Guidelines, promulgated undersection 2713(a)(4) of the PHS Act, section715(a)(1) of ERISA, and section 9815(a)(1)of the Code, to include certain entities andindividuals with objections to compliancewith the Mandate based on sincerely heldreligious beliefs, and they revise the accom-modation process to make it optional foreligible organizations. The expanded ex-emption applies to certain individuals andentities that have religious objections tosome (or all) of the contraceptive and/orsterilization services that would be coveredunder the Guidelines. Such action has beentaken, among other reasons discussedabove, to provide for participation in thehealth insurance market by certain entitiesor individuals, by freeing them from penal-ties they could incur if they follow theirsincerely held religious beliefs against con-traceptive coverage. 2. Anticipated Effects a. Removal of burdens on religious exercise Regarding entities and individuals that are extended an exemption by the Reli-gious IFC and these nal rules, withoutthat exemption the Guidelines would re-quire many of them to either pay for cov-erage of contraceptive services that theynd religiously objectionable; submit self-certications that would result in their is-suer or third party administrator payingfor such services for their employees, 78Some commenters also asked that these nal rules specify that exempt entities must comply with other applicable laws concerning such things as notice to plan participants or collective bargaining agreements. These nal rules relieve the application of the Federal contraceptive Mandate under section 2713(a)(4) to qualied exempt e ntities; they do not affect the applicability of other laws. Elsewhere in this preamble, the Departments provide guidance applicable to notices of revocation and changes that an entity may seek to make during its plan year. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 893which some entities also believe entangles them in the provision of such objection-able coverage; or pay tax penalties, or besubject to other adverse consequences, fornon-compliance with these requirements.These nal rules remove certain associ-ated burdens imposed on these entitiesand individuals\u2014that is, by recognizingtheir religious objections to, and exempt-ing them on the basis of such objectionsfrom, the contraceptive and/or steriliza-tion coverage requirement of the HRSAGuidelines and making the accommoda-tion process optional for eligible organi-zations. b. Notices when revoking accommodated status To the extent that entities choose to revoke their accommodated status tomake use of the expanded exemption, anotice will need to be sent to enrollees(either by the objecting entity or by theissuer or third party administrator) thattheir contraceptive coverage is changing,and guidance will reflect that such a noticerequirement is imposed no more than isalready required by preexisting rules thatrequire notices to be sent to enrollees ofchanges to coverage during a plan year. Ifthe entities wait until the start of their next plan year to change to exempt sta-tus, instead of doing so during the cur-rent plan year, those entities generallywill also be able to avoid sending anysupplementary notices in addition towhat they would otherwise normallysend prior to the start of a new plan year.Additionally, these nal rules providesuch entities with an offsetting regula-tory benet by the exemption itself andits relief of burdens on their religiousbeliefs. As discussed below, assumingthat more than half of the entities thathave been using the previous accommo-dation will seek immediate revocationof their accommodated status and no-tices will be sent to all their enrollees,the total estimated cost of sending thosenotices will be $302,036. c. Impacts on third party administrators and issuers The Departments estimate that these nal rules will not result in any additionalburdens or costs on issuers or third party administrators. As discussed below, theDepartments believe that 109 of the 209entities making use of the accommodationprocess will instead make use of their newexempt status. In contrast, the Depart-ments expect that a much smaller number(which we assume to be 9) will make useof the accommodation to which theywere not previously provided access.Reduced burdens for issuers and thirdparty administrators due to reductions inuse of the accommodation will more than offset increased obligations forserving the fewer number of entities thatwill now opt into the accommodation.This will lead to a net decrease in bur-dens and costs on issuers and third partyadministrators, who will no longer havecontinuing obligations imposed on themby the accommodation. While theserules make it legal for issuers to offerinsurance coverage that omits contra-ceptives to exempt entities and individ-uals, these nal rules do not requireissuers to do so. The Departments anticipate that the ef- fect of these rules on adjustments made tothe federally facilitated Exchange userfees under 45 CFR 156.50 will be thatfewer overall adjustments will be madeusing the accommodation process, be-cause there will be more entities who pre-viously were reluctant users of the accom-modation that will choose to operateunder the newly expanded exemption thanthere will be entities not previously eligi-ble to use the accommodation that will optinto it. The Departments' estimates ofeach number of those entities is set forthin more detail below. d. Impacts on persons covered by newly exempt plans These nal rules will result in some persons covered in plans of newly ex-empt entities not receiving coverage orpayments for contraceptive services. Asdiscussed in the Religious IFC, the De-partments did not have sufcient data ona variety of relevant factors to preciselyestimate how many women would beimpacted by the expanded exemptionsor any related costs they may incur forcontraceptive coverage or the results as-sociated with any unintended pregnan- cies. i. Unknown factors concerning impact on persons in newly exempt plans As referenced above and for reasons explained here, there are multiple levels ofuncertainty involved in measuring the ef-fect of the expanded exemption, includingbut not limited to\u2014 How many entities will make use of their newly exempt status. How many entities will opt into the accommodation maintained by theserules, under which their plan partic-ipants will continue receiving con-traceptive coverage. Which contraceptive methods some newly exempt entities will continueto provide without cost-sharing de-spite the entity objecting to othermethods (for example, as reflected inHobby Lobby , several objecting en- tities have still provided coverage for14 of the 18 FDA-approved wom-en's contraceptive or sterilizationmethods, 134 S. Ct. at 2766). How many women will be covered by plans of entities using their newlyexempt status. Which of the women covered by those plans want and would haveused contraceptive coverage or pay-ments for contraceptive methods thatare no longer covered by such plans. Whether, given the broad availability of contraceptives and their relativelylow cost, such women will obtainand use contraception even if it is notcovered. The degree to which such women are in the category of women identiedby IOM as most at risk of unintendedpregnancy. The degree to which unintended pregnancies may result among thosewomen, which would be attributableas an effect of these rules only if thewomen did not otherwise use contra-ception or a particular contraceptivemethod due to their plan making useof its newly exempt status. The degree to which such unintended pregnancies may be associated withnegative health effects, or whethersuch effects may be offset by other December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 894factors, such as the fact that those women will be otherwise enrolled ininsurance coverage. The extent to w hich such women will qualify for alternative sourcesof contraceptive access, such asthrough a parent's or spouse's plan,or through one of the many govern-mental programs that subsidizecontraceptive coverage to supple-ment their access. ii. Public comments concerning estimates in Religious IFC In the public comments, some comment- ers agreed with the Departments' estimatethat, at most, the economic impact wouldlead to a potential transfer cost, from em-ployers (or other plan sponsors) to affectedwomen, of $63.8 million. Some comment-ers said the impact would be much smaller.Other commenters disagreed, suggestingthat the expanded exemptions risked remov-ing contraceptive coverage from more than55 million women receiving the benets ofthe preventive services Guidelines, or evenrisked removing contraceptive coveragefrom over 100 million women. Some com-menters cited studies indicating that, nation-ally, unintended pregnancies have largepublic costs, and the Mandate overall led tolarge out-of-pocket savings for women. These general comments do not, how- ever, substantially assist us in estimatinghow many women would be affected bythese expanded exemptions specically,or among them, how many unintendedpregnancies would result, or how many ofthe affected women would neverthelessuse contraceptives not covered under thehealth plans of their objecting employersand, thus, be subject to the transfer coststhe Departments estimate, or instead, howmany women might avoid unintendedpregnancies by changing their activities inother ways besides using contraceptives.The Departments conclude, therefore, thatour estimates of the anticipated effect in the Religious IFC are still the best esti-mates we have based on the limited dataavailable to make those estimates. We donot believe that the higher estimates sub-mitted by various public commenters suf-ciently took into consideration, or ana-lyzed, the various factors that suggest thesmall percentage of entities that will nowuse the expanded exemptions out of thelarge number of entities subject to theMandate overall. Instead, the Departmentsagree with various public commentersproviding comment and analysis that, fora variety of reasons, the best estimate ofthe impact of the expanded exemptionsnalized in these rules is that most womenreceiving contraceptive coverage underthe Mandate will not be affected. Weagree with such commenters that the num-ber of women covered by entities likely tomake use of the expanded exemptions inthese rules is likely to be very small incomparison to the overall number ofwomen receiving contraceptive coverageas a result of the Mandate. iii. Possible sources of information for estimating impact The Departments have access to the following general sources of informationthat are relevant to this issue, but thesesources do not provide a full picture of theimpact of these nal rules. First, the reg-ulations prior to the Religious IFC alreadyexempted certain houses of worship andtheir integrated auxiliaries and, as ex-plained elsewhere, effectively did not ap-ply contraceptive coverage requirementsto various entities in self-insured churchplans. The effect of those previous exemp-tions or limitations are not included aseffects of these rules, which leave thoseimpacts in place. Second, in the Depart-ments' previous regulations creating orexpanding exemptions and the accommo-dation process we concluded that no sig-nicant burden or costs would result. 76 FR 46625; 78 FR 39889. Third, someentities, including some for-prot entities,object to only some but not all contracep-tives, and in some cases will cover 14 of18 FDA-approved women's contraceptiveand sterilization methods. 79See Hobby Lobby , 134 S. Ct. at 2766. The effects of the expanded exemptions will be miti-gated to that extent. No publicly tradedfor-prot entities sued challenging theMandate, and the public comments did notreveal any that specically would seek touse the expanded exemptions. Conse-quently, the Departments agree with theestimate from the Religious IFC that pub-licly traded companies would not likelymake use of these expanded exemptions. Fourth, HHS previously estimated that 209 entities would make use of the ac-commodation process. To arrive at thisnumber, the Departments used, as a place-holder, the approximately 122 nonprotentities that brought litigation challengingthe accommodation process, and the ap-proximately 87 closely held for-prot en-tities that led suit challenging the Man-date in general. The Departments' recordsindicate, as noted in the Religious IFC,that approximately 63 entities afrma-tively submitted notices to HHS to use theaccommodation, 80and approximately 60 plans took advantage of the contraceptiveuser fees adjustments, in the 2015 planyear, to obtain reimbursement for contra- ceptive service payments made for cover-age of such services for women coveredby self-insured plans that were accommo-dated. Overall, while recognizing the lim-ited data available, the Departments as-sumed that, under an expanded exemptionand accommodation, approximately 109previously accommodated entities woulduse an expanded exemption, and about100 would continue their accommodatedstatus. We also estimated that another 9entities would use the accommodation 79By reference to the FDA Birth Control Guide's list of 18 birth control methods for women and 2 for men, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/forconsumers/ byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ ucm517406.pdf, Hobby Lobby and entities with similar beliefs were not willing to cover: IUD copper; IUD with progestin; emergency contraceptive (Le vonorgestrel); and emergency contraceptive (Ulipristal Acetate). See134 S. Ct. at 2765-66. Hobby Lobby was willing to cover: sterilization surgery for women; sterilization implant ring; cap with spermicide; female condom; spermicide alone. Id.Among women using these 18 female contraceptive methods, 85 percent use the 14 methods that Hobby Lobby and entities with similar beliefs were willing to cover (22,446,000 out of 26,436,000), and \"the pill and female sterilization have been the two most commonly used methods since 1982.\" SeeGuttmacher Institute, \"Contraceptive Use in the United States\" (Sept. 2016), https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-unit ed-states. 80This includes some fully insured and some self-insured plans, but it does not include entities that may have used the accommodation by submitting an EB SA form 700 self-certication directly to their issuer or third party administrator. In addition, the Departments have deemed some other entities as being subject to the accommoda tion through their litigation lings, but that might not have led to contraceptive coverage being provided to persons covered in some of those plans, either because they are exempt as houses of w orship or integrated auxiliaries, they are in self-insured church plans, or the Departments were not aware of their issuers or third party administrators so as to send them letters oblig ating them to provide such coverage. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 895where the entities were not previously el- igible to do so. These sources of information were out- lined in the Religious IFC. Some com-menters agreed with the Departments' es-timates based on those sources, and whileothers disagreed, the Departments con-clude that commenters did not provideinformation that allows us to make betterestimates. iv. Estimates based on litigating entities that may use expanded exemptions Based on these and other factors, the Departments considered two approachesin the Religious IFC to estimate the num-ber of women affected among entities us-ing the expanded exemptions. First, fol-lowing the use in previous regulations oflitigating entities to estimate the effect ofthe exemption and accommodation, theDepartments attempted to estimate thenumber of women covered by plans oflitigating entities that could be affected byexpanded exemptions. Based on papersled in litigation, and public sources, theDepartments estimated in the ReligiousIFC that approximately 8,700 women ofchildbearing age could have their contra-ception costs affected by plans of litigat-ing entities using these expanded exemp-tions. The Departments believe thatnumber is lower based upon the receipt,by many of those litigating entities, ofpermanent injunctions against the en-forcement of section 2713(a)(4) to the ex-tent it supports a contraceptive Mandate,which have been entered by federal dis-trict courts since the issuance of the Reli-gious IFC. 81As a result, these nal rules will not affect whether such entities willbe subject to the contraceptive Mandate. Subtracting those entities from the total,the Departments estimate that the remain-ing litigating entities employ approxi-mately 49,000 persons, male and female. The average percent of workers at rmsoffering health benets that are actuallycovered by those benets is 60 percent. 82 This amounts to approximately 29,000employees covered under those plans.EBSA estimates that for each employeepolicyholder, there is approximately onedependent. 83This amounts to approxi- mately 58,000 covered persons. Censusdata indicate that women of childbearingage\u2014that is, women aged 15 to 44\u2014compose 20.2 percent of the general pop- ulation. 84Furthermore, approximately 43.6 percent of women of childbearing age usewomen's contraceptive methods covered bythe Guidelines. 85Therefore, the Depart- ments estimate that approximately 5,200women of childbearing age that use contra-ception covered by the Guidelines are cov-ered by employer sponsored plans of entitiesthat might be affected by these nal rules.The Departments also estimate that, for theeducational institutions that brought litiga-tion challenges objecting to the Mandate asapplied to student coverage that they ar-ranged\u2014where (1) the institutions were notexempt under the prior rule, (2) their studentplans were not self-insured, and (3) theyhave not received permanent injunctionspreventing the application of the previousregulations\u2014such student plans likely cov-ered approximately 2,600 students. Thus,the Departments estimate the female mem-bers of those plans is 2,600 women. 86As- suming, as referenced above, that 43.6 per-cent of such women use contraceptioncovered by the Guidelines, the Departments estimate that 1,150 of those women wouldbe affected by these nal rules. Together, this leads the Departments to estimate that approximately 6,400 womenof childbearing age may have their con-traception costs affected by plans of liti-gating entities using these expanded ex-emptions. As noted previously, theDepartments do not have data indicatinghow many of those women agree withtheir employers' or educational institu-tions' opposition to contraception (so thatfewer of them than the national averagemight actually use contraception). Nor dothe Departments know how many wouldhave alternative contraceptive access froma parent's or spouse's plan, or from fed-eral, state, or local governmental pro-grams, nor how many of those womenwould fall in the category of being most atrisk of unintended pregnancy, nor howmany of those entities would providesome contraception in their plans whileonly objecting to certain contraceptives. v. Estimates of accommodated entities that may use expanded exemptions In the Religious IFC, the Departments also examined data concerning user-feereductions to estimate how many womenmight be affected by entities that are usingthe accommodation and would use theexpanded exemptions under these nalrules. Under the accommodation, HHShas received information from issuers thatseek user fees adjustments under 45 CFR156.50(d)(3)(ii), for providing contracep-tive payments for self-insured plans thatmake use of the accommodation. HHSreceives requests for fees adjustments 81See, for example, Catholic Benets Ass'n LCA v. Hargan , No. 5:14-cv-00240-R (W.D. Okla. Mar. and Dordt Coll. v. Burwell , No. 5:13-cv-04100 (N.D. Iowa order led June 12, 2018). 82See Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets: 2018 Annual Survey\" at 62, 83Employee Benets Security Administration, \"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21. Using Data for the March 2016 Annual Social and Eco nomic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-covera ge-bulletin-2016.pdf. 84United States Census Bureau, \"Age and Sex Composition: 2010\" (May 2011), available at https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03. pdf. The Guidelines' requirement of contraceptive coverage only applies \"for all women with reproductive capacity.\" https://www.hrsa.gov/womensguidelines/; also, see 80 FR 40318. In addition, studies commonly consider the 15-44 age range to assess contraceptive use by women of childbearing age. See, for example, Guttmacher Institute, \"Contraceptive Use in the Unite d States\" (Sept. 2016), available at https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. 85See https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states (reporting that of 61,491,766 women aged 15-44, 26,809,5550 use women's contraceptive methods covered by the Guidelines). 86On average, the Departments expect that approximately half of those students (1,300) are female. For the purposes of this estimate, we also assume tha t female policyholders covered by plans arranged by institutions of higher education are women of childbearing age. The Departments expect that they would have less than the average nu mber of dependents per policyholder than exists in standard plans, but for the purposes of providing an upper bound to this estimate, the Departments assume that they would have an average of one dependent per policyholder, thus bringing the number of policyholders and dependents back up to 2,6,00. Many of those dependents are likely not to be women of childbearing age, but in order to provide an upper bound to this estimate, the Departments assume they are. Therefore, for the purposes of this estimate, the Departments assume that the effect of these expanded exemptions on student plans of litigating entities includes 2,600 women. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 896both where Third Party Administrators (TPAs) for those self-insured accommo-dated plans are themselves issuers, andwhere the TPAs use separate issuers toprovide the payments and those issuersseek fees adjustments. Where the issuersseeking adjustments are separate from theTPAs, the TPAs are asked to report thenumber of persons covered by those plans.Some users do not enter all the requesteddata, and not all the data for the 2017 planyear is complete. Nevertheless, HHS hasreviewed the user fees adjustment datareceived for the 2017 plan year. HHS'sbest estimate from the data is that there were $38.4 million in contraceptionclaims sought as the basis for user feesadjustments for plans, and that theseclaims were for plans covering approxi-mately 1,823,000 plan participants andbeneciaries of all ages, male and female. This number fluctuates from year to year. It is larger than the estimate used inthe Religious IFC because, on closer ex-amination of the data, this number betteraccounts for plans where TPAs were alsoissuers seeking user fees adjustments, inaddition to plans where the TPA is sepa-rate from the issuer seeking user fees ad-justments. The number of employers us-ing the accommodation where user feesadjustments were sought cannot be deter-mined from HHS data, because not allusers are required to submit that informa-tion, and HHS does not necessarily re-ceive information about fully insuredplans using the accommodation. There-fore, the Departments still consider ourprevious estimate of 209 entities using theaccommodation as the best estimate avail-able. As noted in the Religious IFC, HHS's information indicates that religious non-prot hospitals or health systems spon-sored a signicant minority of the accom-modated self-insured plans that wereusing contraceptive user fees adjustments,yet those plans covered more than 80 per-cent of the persons covered in all plans using contraceptive user fees adjustments.Some of those plans cover nearly tens ofthousands of persons each and are propor-tionately much larger than the plans pro-vided by other entities using the contra-ceptive user fees adjustments. The Departments continue to believe that a signicant fraction of the personscovered by previously accommodatedplans provided by religious nonprot hos-pitals or health systems may not be af-fected by the expanded exemption. Abroad range of religious hospitals orhealth systems have publicly indicated that they do not conscientiously opposeparticipating in the accommodation. 87Of course, some of these religious hospitalsor health systems may opt for the ex-panded exemption under these nal rules,but others might not. In addition, among plans of religious nonprot hospitals orhealth systems, some have indicated thatthey might be eligible for status as a self-insured church plan. 88As discussed above, some litigants challenging the Mandatehave appeared, after their complaints wereled, to make use of self-insured churchplan status. 89(The Departments take no view on the status of these particular plansunder the Employee Retirement Income Se-curity Act of 1974 (ERISA), but simplymake this observation for the purpose ofseeking to estimate the impact of these nalrules.) Nevertheless, considering all thesefactors, it generally seems likely that manyof the remaining religious hospital or healthsystems plans previously using the accom-modation will continue to opt into the vol-untary accommodation under these nalrules, under which their employees will stillreceive contraceptive coverage. To the ex-tent that plans of religious hospitals orhealth systems are able to make use of self-insured church plan status, the previous ac-commodation rule would already have al-lowed them to relieve themselves and theirthird party administrators of obligations toprovide contraceptive coverage or pay- ments. Therefore, in such situations, the Re-ligious IFC and these nal rules would nothave an anticipated effect on the contracep-tive coverage of women in those plans. vi. Combined estimates of litigating and accommodated entities Considering all these data points and limitations, the Departments offer the fol-lowing estimate of the number of womenwho will be impacted by the expandedexemption in these nal rules. In additionto the estimate of 6,400 women of child-bearing age that use contraception cov-ered by the Guidelines, who will be af-fected by use of the expanded exemptionamong litigating entities, the Departmentscalculate the following number of womenwho we estimate to be affected by accom-modated entities using the expanded ex-emption. As noted above, approximately1,823,000 plan participants and benecia-ries were covered by self-insured plansthat received contraceptive user fee ad-justments in 2017. Although additionalself-insured entities may have participatedin the accommodation without making useof contraceptive user fees adjustments, theDepartments do not know what number ofentities did so. We consider it likely thatself-insured entities with relatively largernumbers of covered persons had sufcientnancial incentive to make use of the con-traceptive user fees adjustments. There-fore, without better data available, the De-partments assume that the number ofpersons covered by self-insured plans us-ing contraceptive user fees adjustmentsapproximates the number of persons cov-ered by all self-insured plans using theaccommodation. An additional but unknown number of persons were likely covered in fully in-sured plans using the accommodation.The Departments do not have data on howmany fully insured plans have been using 87See, e.g.,https://www.chausa.org/newsroom/women%27s-preventive-health-services-nal-rule (\"HHS has now established an accommodation tha t will allow our ministries to continue offering health insurance plans for their employees as they have always done ....W ea r e pleased that our members now have an accommodation that will not require them to contract, provide, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage ....W e will work with our members to implement this accommodation.\"). In comments submitted in previous rules concerning this Mandate, the Catholic Health Association has stated it \"is the national leadership organization for the Catholic health ministry, consisting of more than 2,000 C atholic health care sponsors, systems, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and related organizations. Our ministry is represented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\" Commen ts on CMS-9968-ANPRM (dated June 15, 2012). 88See, for example, Brief of the Catholic Health Association of the United States as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioners, led Jan. 24, 2017) (\"CHA members have relied for decades that the 'church plan' exemption contained in\" ERISA.). 89See https://www.franciscanhealth.org/sites/default/les/2015%20employee%20benet%20booklet.pdf; see, for example, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y. v. Sebelius , 987 F. Supp. 2d 232, 242 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 897the accommodation, nor on how many persons were covered by those plans.DOL estimates that, among persons cov-ered by employer-sponsored insurance inthe private sector, 62.7 percent are cov-ered by self-insured plans and 37.3 per-cent are covered by fully insured plans. 90 Therefore, corresponding to the approxi-mately 1,823,000 persons covered by self-insured plans using user fee adjustments,we estimate an additional 1,084,000 per-sons were covered by fully insured plansusing the accommodation. This yields ap-proximately 2,907,000 persons of all agesand sexes whom the Departments estimatewere covered in plans using the accom-modation under the previous regulations. Although recognizing the limited data available for our estimates, the Depart-ments estimate that 100 of the 209 entitiesthat were using the accommodation underthe previous regulations will continue toopt into it under these nal rules and thatthose entities will cover the substantialmajority of persons previously covered inaccommodated plans. The data concern-ing accommodated self-insured plans in-dicates that plans sponsored by religioushospitals and health systems and other en- tities likely to continue using the accommo-dation constitute over 60 percent of plansusing the accommodation, and encompassmore than 90 percent of the persons covered in accommodated plans. 91In other words, plans sponsored by such entities appear tobe a majority of plans using the accommo-dation, and also have a proportionatelylarger number of covered persons than doplans sponsored by other accommodated en-tities, which have smaller numbers of cov-ered persons. Moreover, as cited above,many religious hospitals and health systemshave indicated that they do not object to theaccommodation, and some of those entitiesmight also qualify as self-insured churchplans, so that these nal rules would notimpact the contraceptive coverage their em-ployees receive. The Departments do not have specic data on which plans of which sizes willactually continue to opt into the accom-modation, nor how many will make use of self-insured church plan status. The De-partments assume that the proportions ofcovered persons in self-insured plans us-ing contraceptive user fees adjustmentsalso apply in fully insured plans, forwhich the Departments lack representa-tive data. Based on these assumptions andwithout better data available, the Depart-ments assume that the 100 accommodatedentities that will remain in the accommo-dation will account for 75 percent of allthe persons previously covered in accom-modated plans. In comparison, the De-partments assume the 109 accommodatedentities that will make use of the expandedexemption will encompass 25 percent ofpersons previously covered in accommo-dated plans. Applying these percentages to the esti- mated 2,907,000 persons covered in previ- ously accommodated plans, the Depart-ments estimate that approximately 727,000persons will be covered in the 109 plans thatuse the expanded exemption, and 2,180,000persons will be covered in the estimated 100plans that continue to use the accommoda-tion. According to the Census data citedabove, women of childbearing age comprise20.2 percent of the population, which meansthat approximately 147,000 women ofchildbearing age are covered in previouslyaccommodated plans that the Departments estimate will use the expanded exemption.As noted above, approximately 43.6 percentof women of childbearing age use women'scontraceptive methods covered by theGuidelines, so that the Departments expectapproximately 64,000 women that use con-traception covered by the Guidelines will beaffected by accommodated entities using theexpanded exemption. It is not clear the extent to which this number overlaps with the number esti-mated above of 6,400 women in plans oflitigating entities that may be affected bythese rules. In order to more broadly esti-mate the possible effects of these rules,the Departments assume there is no over- lap between the two numbers, and there-fore that these nal rules would affectthe contraceptive costs of approximately 70,500 women. Under the assumptions just discussed, the number of women whose contracep-tive costs will be impacted by the ex-panded exemption in these nal rules isapproximately 0.1 percent of the 55.6 mil-lion women in private plans that HHS'sOfce of the Assistant Secretary for Plan-ning and Evaluation (ASPE) estimated in2015 received preventive services cover-age under the Guidelines. In order to estimate the cost of contra- ception to women affected by the ex-panded exemption, the Departments areaware that, under the previous accommo-dation process, the total amount of con-traceptive claims sought for self-insuredplans for the 2017 benet year was $38.5million. 92These adjustments covered the cost of contraceptive coverage provided towomen. As also discussed above, the De-partments estimate that amount corre-sponded to plans covering 1,823,000 per-sons. Among those persons, as citedabove, approximately 20.2 percent on av-erage were women of childbearing age,and of those, approximately 43.6 percentuse women's contraceptive methods cov-ered by the Guidelines. This amounts toapproximately 161,000 women. There-fore, entities using contraceptive user feesadjustments received approximately $239 per year per woman of childbearing agethat used contraception covered by theGuidelines and covered in their plans. Butin the Religious IFC, we estimated that theaverage annual cost of contraception perwoman per year is $584. As noted above,public commenters cited similar estimatesof the annual cost of various contraceptivemethods, if calculated for the life of themethod's effectiveness. Therefore, to es-timate the annual transfer effects of thesenal rules, the Departments will continueto use the estimate of $584 per woman peryear. With an estimated impact of thesenal rules of 70,500 women per year, thenancial transfer effects attributable tothese nal rules on those women would beapproximately $41.2 million. 90\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 3A, page 14. Using Data for the March 2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. https://www.dol.gov/ sites/default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2016.pdf. 91The data also reflects a religious university using the accommodation that has publicly afrmed the accommodation is consistent with its religious vi ews, and two houses of worship that are using the accommodation despite already qualifying for the previous exemption. We assume for the purposes of this estimate these three entities w ill also continue using the accommodation instead of the expanded exemption. 92The amount of user fees adjustments provided was higher than this, since an additional administrative amount was added to the amount of contraceptive costs claimed. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 898Some commenters suggested that the Departments' estimate of women affectedamong litigating entities was too low, butthey did not support their proposed highernumbers with citations or specic datathat could be veried as more reliable thanthe estimates in the Religious IFC. Theirestimates appeared to be overinclusive,for example, by counting all litigating en-tities and not just those that may be af-fected by these rules because they are notin church plans, or by counting all planparticipants and not just women of child-bearing age that use contraception. More-over, since the Religious IFC was issued,additional entities have received perma-nent injunctions against enforcement ofany regulations implementing the contra-ceptive Mandate and so will not be af-fected by these nal rules. Taking all ofthese factors into account, the Depart-ments are not aware of a better method ofestimating the number of women affectedby these expanded exemptions. vii. Alternate estimates based on consideration of pre-ACA plans To account for uncertainty in the esti- mates above, the Departments conducteda second analysis using an alternativeframework, in order to thoroughly con-sider the possible upper bound economicimpact of these nal rules. In 2015, ASPE estimated that 55.6 mil- lion women aged 15 to 64 were coveredby private insurance had preventive ser-vices coverage under the Affordable CareAct. 93The Religious IFC used this esti- mate in this second analysis of the possi-ble impact of the expanded exemptions inthe interim nal rules. ASPE has not is-sued an update to its report. Some com-menters noted that a private organizationpublished a fact sheet in 2017 claiming tomake similar estimates based on more re-cent data, in which it estimated that 62.4 million aged 15 to 64 were covered byprivate insurance had preventive servicescoverage under the Affordable CareAct. 94The primary difference between these numbers appears to be a change inthe number of persons covered by grand-fathered plans. The methodology of both reports do not fully correspond to the number theDepartments seek to estimate here for thepurposes of Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. These nal rules will not affect all women aged 15 to 64 who are covered byprivate insurance and have coverage ofpreventive services under the AffordableCare Act. This is partly because the De-partments do not have evidence to suggestthat most employers will have sincerelyheld religious objections to contraceptivecoverage and will use the expanded ex-emptions. In addition, both reports includewomen covered by plans that are notlikely affected by the expanded exemp-tions for other reasons. For example, eventhough the estimates in those reports do not include enrollees in public plans such as Medicare or Medicaid, they do includeenrollees in plans obtained on the healthinsurance marketplaces, purchased inthe individual market, obtained by self-employed persons, or offered by govern-ment employers. Women who purchase plans in the marketplaces, the individualmarket, or as self-employed persons arenot required to use the exemptions inthese rules. Government employers arealso not affected by the exemptions inthese rules. In response to public comments citing the more recent report, the Departmentsoffer the following estimates based onmore recent data than used in the Reli-gious IFC. Data from the U.S. CensusBureau indicates that 167.6 million indi-viduals, male and female, under 65 yearsof age, were covered by employment- based insurance in 2017. 95Of those, 50.1 percent were female, that is, 84 million.96 The most recent Health Insurance Cover-age Bulletin from EBSA states that,within employer-sponsored insurance,76.5% are covered by private sector em-ployers. 97As noted above, these expanded exemptions do not apply to public sectoremployers. Assuming the same percent-age applies to the Census data for 2017,64.2 million women under 65 years of agewere covered by private sector employ-ment based insurance. EBSA's bulletinalso states that, among those covered byprivate sector employer sponsored insur-ance, 5% receive health insurance cover-age from a different primary source. 98We assume for the purposes of this estimatethat an exemption claimed by an employerunder these rules need not affect contracep- tive coverage of a person who receiveshealth insurance coverage from a differentprimary source. Again assuming this per-centage applies to the 2017 coverage year,we estimate that 61 million women under 65years of age received primary health cover-age from private sector, employment-basedinsurance. In conducting this analysis, theDepartments also observed that for 3.8 per-cent of those covered by private sector em-ployment sponsored insurance, the plan waspurchased by a self-employed person, not by a third party employer. Self-employedpersons who direct rms are not required touse the exemptions in these nal rules, but ifthey do, they would not be losing contra-ceptive coverage that they want to have,since they would be using the exemptionbased on their sincerely held religious be-liefs. If those persons have employees, theemployees would be included in this esti-mate in the number of people who receiveemployer sponsored insurance from a thirdparty. Assuming this percentage applies tothe 2017 coverage year, that 93Available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/les/pdf/139221/The%20Affordable%20Care%20Act%20is%20Improving%20Access%20to%20Preventiv 20of%20Americans.pdf. 94The commenters cited the National Women's Law from September 2017, available at https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ New-Preventive-Services-Estimates-3.pdf. 95See U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey Table HI-01, \"Health Insurance Coverage in hi-01/2018/hi01_1.xls. 96Id. 97Table page 5 (stating that in coverage year 2015, 177.5 million persons of all ages were covered by employer sponsored insurance, with 135.7 millio n of those being covered by private sector employers), available at https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2016.pdf . 98Id.at Table 1C, page 8 (168.7 million persons received health insurance coverage from employer sponsored insurance as their primary source, compared to 177.5 million persons covered by employer sponsored insurance overall). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 89958.7 million women under 65 years of age received primary health coverage from pri-vate sector insurance from a third party em-ployer plan sponsor. The Kaiser Family Foundation's Em- ployer Health Benets Annual Survey2018 states that 16% of covered workersat all rms are enrolled in a plan grandfa-thered under the ACA (and thus not sub-ject to the preventive services coveragerequirements), but that only 14% of work-ers receiving coverage from state and lo-cal government employer plans are ingrandfathered plans. 99Using the data cited above in EBSA's bulletin concern-ing the number of persons covered in pub- lic and private sector employer sponsoredinsurance, this suggests 16.6% of personscovered by private sector employer spon-sored plans are in grandfathered plans,and 83.4% in non-grandfathered plans. 100 Applying this percentage to the Censusdata, 49 million women under 65 years ofage received primary health insurancecoverage from private sector, third partyemployment-based, non-grandfatheredplans. Census data indicates that amongwomen under age 65, 46.7% are of child-bearing age (aged 15 to 44). 101Therefore, we estimate that 22.9 million women aged15-44 received primary health insurancecoverage from private sector, third partyemployment based, non-grandfathered in-surance plans. Prior to the implementation of the Af- fordable Care Act, approximately 6 per-cent of employer survey respondents didnot offer contraceptive coverage, with 31percent of respondents not knowingwhether they offered such coverage. 102The 6 percent may have included approx- imately 1.37 million of the women aged15 to 44 primarily covered by employer-sponsored insurance plans in the privatesector. And as noted above, approxi-mately 43.6 percent of women of child-bearing age use women's contraceptivemethods covered by the Guidelines.Therefore, the Departments estimate that599,000 women of childbearing age thatuse contraceptives covered by the Guide-lines were covered by plans that omittedcontraceptive coverage prior to the Af-fordable Care Act. 103 It is unknown what motivated those employers to omit contraceptive cover- age\u2014whether they did so for religious orother reasons. Despite the lack of infor-mation about their motives, the Depart-ments attempt to make a reasonable esti-mate of the upper bound of the number ofthose employers that omitted contracep-tion before the Affordable Care Act andthat would make use of these expandedexemptions based on sincerely held reli-gious beliefs. To begin, the Departments estimate that publicly traded companies would notlikely make use of these expanded exemp-tions. Even though the rule does not pre-clude publicly traded companies fromdropping coverage based on a sincerelyheld religious belief, it is likely that at-tempts to object on religious grounds bypublicly traded companies would be rare.The Departments take note of the Su-preme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby , where the Court observed that \"HHS hasnot pointed to any example of a publiclytraded corporation asserting RFRA rights,and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring. Forexample, the idea that unrelated share-holders\u2014including institutional investorswith their own set of stakeholders\u2014wouldagree to run a corporation under the samereligious beliefs seems improbable.\" 134S. Ct. at 2774. The Departments are awareof several federal health care consciencelaws 104that in some cases have existed for decades and that protect companies, in-cluding publicly traded companies, fromdiscrimination if, for example, they de-cline to facilitate abortion, but the Depart-ments are not aware of examples wherepublicly traded companies have made use of these exemptions. Thus, while the De-partments consider it important to includepublicly traded companies in the scope of these expanded exemptions for reasons sim-ilar to those reasons used by the Congress inRFRA and some health care consciencelaws, in estimating the anticipated effects ofthe expanded exemptions, the Departmentsagree with the Supreme Court that it is im-probable any will do so. This assumption is signicant because 31.3 percent of employees in the privatesector work for publicly traded compa-nies. 105That m eans that only approxi- mately 411,000 women aged 15 to 44 thatuse contraceptives covered by the Guide-lines were covered by plans of non-publiclytraded companies that did not provide con-traceptive coverage pre-Affordable CareAct. Moreover, because these nal rules build on previous regulations that alreadyexempted houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries and, as explained above, 99\"Employer Health Benets: 2018 Annual Survey\" at 211, available at http://les.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benets-Annual-Survey-2018 . 100EBSA's bulletin shows 168.7 million persons with primary coverage from employer sponsored insurance, with 131.6 million in the private sector and 37 .1 million in the public sector. 16% of 168.7 million is 26.9 million. 14% of 37.1 million is 5.2 million. 26.9 million -5.2 million is 21.8 million, which is 16.6% of the 131.6 million pe rsons with primary coverage from private sector employer sponsored insurance. 101U.S. Census Bureau, Table S0101 https://data.census.gov/cedsci/results/tables?q /H11005S0101:%20AGE%20AND%20SEX&ps /H11005table*currentPage@1. Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2010 Annual Survey\" at 196, available at https://kaiserf amilyfoundation.les.word - press.com/2013/04/8085.pdf. 103Some of the 31 percent of survey respondents that did not know about contraceptive coverage may not have offered such coverage. If it were possible to ac count for this non-coverage, the estimate of potentially affected covered women could increase. On the other hand, these employers' lack of knowledge about contraceptive covera ge suggests that they lacked sincerely held religious beliefs specically objecting to such coverage\u2014beliefs without which they would not qualify for the expanded exemptions offered by t hese nal rules. In that case, omission of such employers and covered women from this estimation approach would be appropriate. Correspondingly, the 6 percent of employers that had direct k nowledge about the absence of coverage may be more likely to have omitted such coverage on the basis of religious beliefs than were the 31 percent of survey respondents who did not kno w whether the coverage was offered. Yet an entity's mere knowledge about its coverage status does not itself reflect its motive for omitting coverage. In responding to the survey , the entity may have simply examined its plan document to determine whether or not contraceptive coverage was offered. As will be relevant in a later portion of the analysis, we have no data indicating what portion of the entities that omitted contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs, as opposed to doing so for other r easons that would not qualify them for the expanded exemption offered in these nal rules. 104For example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b), 42 U.S.C. 238n, and Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Div.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 900effectively eliminated obligations to pro- vide contraceptive coverage within ob-jecting self-insured church plans, the De-partments attempt to estimate the numberof such employers whose employeeswould not be affected by these rules. Inattempting to estimate the number of suchemployers, the Departments consider thefollowing information. Many Catholic di- oceses have litigated or led public com-ments opposing the Mandate, representingto the Departments and to courts aroundthe country that ofcial Catholic Churchteaching opposes contraception. There are17,651 Catholic parishes in the UnitedStates, 106197 Catholic dioceses,1075,224 Catholic elementary schools, and 1,205Catholic secondary schools. 108Not all Catholic schools are integrated auxil-iaries of Catholic churches, but there areother Catholic entities that are integratedauxiliaries that are not schools, so theDepartments use the number of schools asan estimate of the number of integratedauxiliaries. Among self-insured churchplans that oppose the Mandate, the De-partment has been sued by two\u2014Guide-stone and Christian Brothers. Guidestoneis a plan organized by the Southern Bap-tist convention covering 38,000 employ-ers, some of which are exempt as churchesor integrated auxiliaries, and some ofwhich are not. 109Christian Brothers is a plan that covers Catholic organizations in-cluding Catholic churches and integratedauxiliaries, which are estimated above,but has also said in litigation that it coversabout 500 additional entities that are notexempt as churches. 110In total, therefore, without having certain data on the numberof entities exempt under the previousrules, the Departments estimate that ap-proximately 62,000 employers amonghouses of worship, integrated auxiliaries,and church plans, were exempt or relievedof contraceptive coverage obligations un-der the previous regulations. The Depart-ments do not know how many persons arecovered in the plans of those employers. Guidestone reports that among its 38,000employers, its plan covers approximately220,000 persons, and its employers in-clude \"churches, mission-sending agen-cies, hospitals, educational institutionsand other related ministries.\" Using thatratio, the Departments estimate that the62,000 church and church plan employers among Guidestone, Christian Brothers,and Catholic churches would include359,000 persons. Among them, as refer-enced above, 72,500 women would be ofchildbearing age, and 32,100 may usecontraceptives covered by the Guidelines. Taking all of these factors into account, the Departments estimate that the private,non-publicly traded employers that didnot cover contraception pre-AffordableCare Act, and that were not exempt by theprevious regulations nor were participantsin self-insured church plans that opposecontraceptive coverage, covered approxi-mately 379,000 women aged 15 to 44 thatuse contraceptives covered by the Guide-lines. But to estimate the likely actualtransfer impact of these nal rules, theDepartments must estimate not just thenumber of such women covered by thoseentities, but how many of those entitieswould actually qualify for, and use, theexpanded exemptions. The Departments do not have data in- dicating how many of the entities thatomitted coverage of contraception pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the basis ofsincerely held religious beliefs that mightqualify them for exempt status under thesenal rules, as opposed to having done sofor other reasons. Besides the entities thatled lawsuits or submitted public com-ments concerning previous regulations onthis matter, the Departments are not awareof entities that omitted contraception pre-Affordable Care Act and then opposed thecontraceptive coverage requirement afterit was imposed by the Guidelines. For thefollowing reasons, however, the Depart-ments believe that a reasonable estimate is that no more than approximately one thirdof the persons covered by relevant enti-ties\u2014that is, no more than approximately126,400 affected women\u2014would likelybe subject to potential transfer impactsunder the expanded religious exemptionsoffered in these nal rules. Consequently,as explained below, the Departments be-lieve that the potential impact of thesenal rules falls substantially below the$100 million threshold for an economi-cally signicant major rule. First, as mentioned, the Departments are not aware of information, or of datafrom public comments, that would lead usto estimate that all or most entities thatomitted coverage of contraception pre-Affordable Care Act did so on the basis ofsincerely held conscientious objections ingeneral or, specically, religious beliefs,as opposed to having done so for otherreasons. It would seem reasonable to as-sume that many of those entities did notdo so based on sincerely held religiousbeliefs. According to a 2016 poll, only 4%of Americans believe that using contra-ceptives is morally wrong (including froma religious perspective). 111In addition, various reasons exist for some employersnot to return to a pre-ACA situation inwhich they did not provide contraceptivecoverage, such as avoiding negative pub-licity, the difculty of taking away afringe benet that employees have be-come accustomed to having, and avoidingthe administrative cost of renegotiatinginsurance contracts. Additionally, as dis-cussed above, many employers with ob-jections to contraception, including sev-eral of the largest litigants, only object tosome contraceptives and cover as many as 14 of 18 of the contraceptive methods in-cluded in the Guidelines. This will reduce,and potentially eliminate, the contraceptivecost transfer for women covered in their 106Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno, \"Diocese of Reno Directory: at http://www.renodiocese.org/documents/2016/9/2016%20201 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Catholic_dioceses_in_the_U nited_States. 108National We Serve,\" available at https://www.guidestone.org/AboutUs/WhoWeServe. 110The Departments take no view on the status of particular plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), but simply make this o bservation for the purpose of seeking to estimate the impact of these nal rules. 111Pew Research Center, \"Where the Public Stands on Religious Liberty vs. Nondiscrimination\" at page 26 (Sept. 28, 2016), available at http://assets.p ewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/ sites/11/2016/09/Religious-Liberty-full-for-web.pdf. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 901plans.112Moreover, as suggested by the Guidestone data mentioned previously, em-ployers with conscientious objections maytend to have relatively few employees and,among nonprot entities that object to theMandate, it is possible that a greater share oftheir employees oppose contraception thanamong the general population, which shouldlead to a reduction in the estimate of howmany women in those plans actually usecontraception. It may not be the case that all entities that objected on religious grounds to con-traceptive coverage before the ACAbrought suit against the Mandate. How-ever, it is worth noting that, while lessthan 100 for-prot entities challenged theMandate in court (and an unknown num-ber joined two newly formed associationalorganizations bringing suit on their be-half), there are more than 3 million for-prot private sector establishments in theUnited States that offer health insur-ance. 113Six percent of those would be 185,000, and one third of that numberwould be 62,000. The Departments con-sider it unlikely that tens or hundreds ofthousands of for-prot private sector es-tablishments omitted contraceptive cover-age pre-ACA specically because of sin-cerely held religious beliefs, when, aftersix years of litigation and multiple publiccomment periods, the Departments areaware of less than 100 such entities. TheDepartments do not know how many ad-ditional nonprot entities would use theexpanded exemptions, but as noted above,under the rules predating the ReligiousIFC, tens of thousands were already ex- empt as churches or integrated auxiliaries,or were covered by self-insured churchplans that are not penalized if no contra-ceptive coverage is offered. Finally, among entities that omitted contraceptive coverage based on sincerelyheld conscientious objections as opposedto other reasons, it is likely that some, albeit a minority, did so based on moralobjections that are non-religious, andtherefore would not be compassed by theexpanded exemptions in these nalrules. 114Among the general public, polls vary about religious beliefs, but one prom-inent poll shows that 13 percent of Amer-icans say they do not believe in God orhave no opinion on the question. 115 Therefore, the Departments estimate that,of the entities that omitted contraceptionpre-Affordable Care Act based on sin-cerely held conscientious objections asopposed to other reasons, a small fractiondid so based on sincerely held non-religious moral convictions, and thereforewould not be affected by the expandedexemption provided by these nal rulesfor religious beliefs. For the reasons stated above, the De- partments believe it would be incorrect toassume that all or even most of the plansthat did not cover contraceptives beforethe ACA did so on the basis of religiousobjections. Instead, without data availableon the reasons those plans omitted contra-ceptive coverage before the ACA, we as-sume that no more than one third of thoseplans omitted contraceptive coveragebased on sincerely held religious beliefs.Thus, of the estimated 379,000 womenaged 15 to 44 that use contraceptives cov- ered by the Guidelines, who received pri-mary coverage from plans of private, non-publicly traded, third party employers thatdid not cover contraception pre-AffordableCare Act, and whose plans were neitherexempt nor omitted from mandatory contra-ceptive coverage under the previous regula-tions, we estimate that no more than126,400 women would be in plans that willuse these expanded exemptions.viii. Final estimates of persons affected by expanded exemptions Based on the estimate of an average annual expenditure on contraceptive prod-ucts and services of $584 per user, theeffect of the expanded exemptions on126,400 women would give rise to ap-proximately $73.8 million in potentialtransfer impact. It is possible, however,that premiums would adjust to reflectchanges in coverage, thus partially offset-ting the transfer experienced by womenwho use the affected contraceptives. Asreferenced elsewhere in this analysis, suchwomen may make up approximately 8.8percent of the covered population, 116in which case the offset would also be ap-proximately 8.8 percent, yielding a poten-tial transfer of $67.3 million. Thus, in their most expansive estimate, the Departments conclude that no morethan approximately 126,400 womenwould likely be subject to potential trans-fer impacts under the expanded religiousexemptions offered in these nal rules.The Departments estimate this nancialtransfer to be approximately $67.3 mil-lion. This falls substantially below the$100 million threshold for an economi-cally signicant and major rule. As noted above, the Departments view this alternative estimate as being the high-est possible bound of the transfer effectsof these rules, but believe the number ofestablishments that will actually exempttheir plans as the result of these rules willbe far fewer than contemplated by thisestimate. The Departments make these es-timates only for the purposes of determin-ing whether the rules are economicallysignicant under Executive Orders 12866and 13563. After reviewing public comments, both those supporting and those disagreeingwith these estimates and similar estimates 112On the other hand, a key input in the approach that generated the one third threshold estimate was a survey indicating that six percent of employers did n ot provide contraceptive coverage pre-Affordable Care Act. Employers that covered some contraceptives pre-Affordable Care Act may have answered \"yes\" or \"don't know\" to the survey. I n such cases, the potential transfer estimate has a tendency toward underestimation because the rule's effects on such women\u2014causing their contraceptive coverage to be reduced from all 18 methods to some smaller subset\u2014have been omitted from the calculation. 113Tables I.A.1 and I.A.2, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, \"Private-Sector Data by Firm Size, Industry Group, Ownership, Age of Firm, and Other Chara cteristics: 2017,\" HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (indicating total number of for-prot incorporated, for-prot unincorporated, and non-prot establishments in the United States, and the percentage of each that offer health insurance), available at https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/summ_tables/insr/national/series_1/2017/tia1.htm and ht tps://meps.ahrq.gov/data_stats/summ_tables/insr/ national/series_1/2017/tia2.htm. 2523 114Such objections may be encompassed by companion nal rules published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Those nal rules, however, are narrower in scope than these nal rules. For example, in providing expanded exemptions for plan sponsors, they do not encompass companies with certain publicly traded ownership interests. 115Gallup, \"Religion,\" available at https://news.gallup.com/poll/1690/religion.aspx. 116As cited above, women of childbearing age are 20.2 percent of woman aged 15-65, and 43.6 percent of women of childbearing age use contraceptives covere d by the Guidelines. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 902from the Religious IFC, and because the Departments do not have sufcient data toprecisely estimate the amount by whichthese factors render our estimate too high,or too low, the Departments simply con-clude that the nancial transfer falls sub-stantially below the $100 million thresh-old for an economically signicant rulebased on the calculations set forth above. B. Special Analyses\u2014Department of the Treasury These regulations are not subject to review under section 6(b) of ExecutiveOrder 12866 pursuant to the Memoran-dum of Agreement (April 11, 2018) be-tween the Department of the Treasury andthe Ofce of Management and Budgetregarding review of tax regulations. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) (RFA) imposes certainrequirements with respect to federal rulesthat are subject to the notice and commentrequirements of section 553(b) of theAPA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and that arelikely to have a signicant economic im-pact on a substantial number of small en-tities. The Religious IFC was an interimnal rule with comment period, and inthese nal rules, the Departments adoptthe Religious IFC as nal with certainchanges. These nal rules are, thus, beingissued after a notice and comment period. The Departments also carefully consid- ered the likely impact of the rule on smallentities in connection with their assess-ment under Executive Order 12866 and donot expect that these nal rules will have a signicant economic effect on a substan-tial number of small entities. These nalrules will not result in any additional coststo affected entities, and, in many cases,may relieve burdens and costs from suchentities. By exempting from the Mandatesmall businesses and nonprot organiza-tions with religious objections to some (orall) contraceptives and/or sterilization\u2014businesses and organizations that wouldotherwise be faced with the dilemma ofcomplying with the Mandate (and violat-ing their religious beliefs) or followingtheir beliefs (and incurring potentially sig-nicant nancial penalties for noncompli-ance)\u2014the Departments have reducedregulatory burden on such small entities.Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code,the notice of proposed rulemaking preced-ing these regulations was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SmallBusiness Administration for comment ontheir impact on small business. D. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Health and HumanServices Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), we arerequired to provide 30-day notice in theFederal Register and solicit public com- ment before a collection of information issubmitted to the Ofce of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review and ap-proval. In order to fairly evaluate whetheran information collection should be ap-proved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A) ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995(PRA) requires that we solicit comment on the following issues: The need for the information collec- tion and its usefulness in carryingout the proper functions of ouragency. The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. Recommendations to minimize the in- formation collection burden on the af-fected public, including automated collec-tion techniques. In the October 13, 2017(82 FR 47792) interim nal rules, we so-licited public comment on each of theseissues for the following sections of therule containing information collection re-quirements (ICRs). A description of theinformation collection provisions impli-cated in these nal rules is given in thefollowing section with an estimate of theannual burden. The burden related to theseICRs received emergency review and ap-proval under OMB control number 0938-1344. They have been resubmitted toOMB in conjunction with these nal rulesand are pending re-approval. The Depart-ments sought public comments on PRAestimates set forth in the Religious IFC,and are not aware of signicant commentssubmitted that suggest there is a betterway to estimate these burdens. 1.

Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 9032. ICRs Regarding Self-Certication or Notices to HHS (\u00a7 147.131(c)(3)) Each organization seeking to be treated as an eligible organization that wishes touse the optional accommodation processoffered under these nal rules must eitheruse the EBSA Form 700 method of self-certication or provide notice to HHS of its religious objection to coverage of all ora subset of contraceptive services. Specif-ically, these nal rules continue to alloweligible organizations to notify an issueror third party administrator using EBSAForm 700, or to notify HHS, of their reli-gious objection to coverage of all or asubset of contraceptive services, as setforth in the July 2015 nal regulations (80FR 41318). Notably, however, entities that are par- ticipating in the previous accommodationprocess, where a self-certication or no-tice has already been submitted, andwhere the entities choose to continue theiraccommodated status under these nalrules, generally do not need to le a newself-certication or notice (unless theychange their issuer or third party admin-istrator). As explained above, HHS as-sumes that, among the 209 entities theDepartments estimated are using the pre-vious accommodation, 109 will use theexpanded exemption and 100 will con-tinue under the voluntary accommodation.Those 100 entities will not need to leadditional self-certications or notices.HHS also assumes that an additional 9 entities that were not using the previousaccommodation will opt into it. Thoseentities will be subject to the self-certication or notice requirement. In order to estimate the cost for an entity that chooses to opt into the accom-modation process, HHS assumes that cler-ical staff for each eligible organizationwill gather and enter the necessary infor-mation and send the self-certication tothe issuer or third party administrator asappropriate, or send the notice to HHS. 118 HHS assumes that a compensation andbenets manager and inside legal counselwill review the self-certication or noticeto HHS and a senior executive would ex-ecute it. HHS estimates that an eligibleorganization would spend approximately50 minutes (30 minutes of clerical labor at a cost of $55.68 per hour, 10 minutes fora compensation and benets manager at acost of $122.02 per hour, 5 minutes forlegal counsel at a cost of $134.50 perhour, and 5 minutes by a senior executiveat a cost of $186.88 per hour) preparingand sending the self-certication or noticeto HHS and ling it to meet the record-keeping requirement. Therefore, the totalannual burden for preparing and providingthe information in the self-certication ornotice to HHS will require approximately50 minutes for each eligible organizationwith an equivalent cost of approximately$74.96 for a total hour burden of approx-imately 7.5 hours and an associated equiv-alent cost of approximately $675 for 9entities. As DOL and HHS share jurisdic-tion, they are splitting the hour burden sothat each will account for approximately3.75 burden hours with an equivalent costof approximately $337. HHS estimates that each self-certication or notice to HHS will require $0.50 in postageand $0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) andthe total postage and materials cost for eachself-certication or notice sent via mail will be$0.55. For purposes of this analysis, HHS as-sumes that 50 percent of self-certications ornotices to HHS will be mailed. The total costfor sending the self-certications or notices toHHS by mail is approximately $2.75 for 5entities. As DOL and HHS share jurisdictionthey are splitting the cost burden so that eachwill account for $1.38 of the cost burden. 3. ICRs Regarding Notice of Availability of Separate Payments forContraceptive Services (\u00a7 147.131(e)) As required by the July 2015 nal reg- ulations (80 FR 41318), a health insuranceissuer or third party administrator provid-ing or arranging separate payments forcontraceptive services for participants andbeneciaries in insured or self-insuredgroup health plans (or student enrolleesand covered dependents in student healthinsurance coverage) of eligible organiza-tions is required to provide a written no-tice to plan participants and beneciaries(or student enrollees and covered depen-dents) informing them of the availabilityof such payments. The notice must beseparate from, but contemporaneous with (to the extent possible), any applicationmaterials distributed in connection withenrollment (or re-enrollment) in group orstudent coverage of the eligible organiza-tion in any plan year to which the accom-modation is to apply and will be providedannually. To satisfy the notice require-ment, issuers and third party administra-tors may, but are not required to, use themodel language previously provided byHHS or substantially similar language. As mentioned, HHS is anticipating that approximately 109 entities will use theoptional accommodation (100 that used itpreviously, and 9 that will newly opt intoit). It is unknown how many issuers orthird party administrators provide healthinsurance coverage or services in connec-tion with health plans of eligible organi-zations, but HHS will assume at least 109.It is estimated that each issuer or thirdparty administrator will need approxi-mately 1 hour of clerical labor (at $55.68per hour) and 15 minutes of managementreview (at $117.40 per hour) to preparethe notices. The total burden for each is-suer or third party administrator to preparenotices will be 1.25 hours with an associ-ated cost of approximately $85.03. Thetotal burden for all 109 issuers or thirdparty administrators will be 136 hours,with an associated cost of approximately$9,268. As DOL and HHS share jurisdic-tion, they are splitting the burden eachwill account for 68 burden hours with anassociated cost of $4,634, with approxi-mately 55 respondents. The Departments estimate that approx- imately 2,180,000 plan participants andbeneciaries will be covered in the plansof the 100 entities that previously used theaccommodation and will continue doingso, and that an additional 9 entities willnewly opt into the accommodation. Wereach this estimate using calculations setforth above, in which we used 2017 dataavailable to HHS for contraceptive userfees adjustments to estimate that approx-imately 2,907,000 plan participants andbeneciaries were covered by plans usingthe accommodation. We further estimatedthat the 100 entities that previously usedthe accommodation and will continue do-ing so will cover approximately 75 per- 118For purposes of this analysis, the Department assumes that the same amount of time will be required to prepare the self-certication and the notice to H HS. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 904cent of the persons in all accommodated plans, based on HHS data concerning ac-commodated self-insured plans that indi-cates plans sponsored by religious hospi-tals and health systems encompass morethan 80 percent of the persons covered insuch plans. In other words, plans spon-sored by such entities have a proportion-ately larger number of covered personsthan do plans sponsored by other accom-modated entities, which have smallernumbers of covered persons. As notedabove, many religious hospitals and healthsystems have indicated that they do notobject to the accommodation, and some ofthose entities might also qualify as self-insured church plans. The Departments donot have specic data on which plans ofwhich employer sizes will actually con-tinue to opt into the accommodation, norhow many will make use of self-insuredchurch plan status. The Departments as-sume that the proportions of covered per-sons in self-insured plans using contracep-tive user fees adjustments also apply infully insured plans, for which we lackrepresentative data. Based on these assumptions and without better data available, the Departments esti-mate that previously accommodated entitiesencompassed approximately 2,907,000 per-sons; the estimated 100 entities that previ-ously used the accommodation and continueto use it will account for 75 percent of thosepersons (that is, approximately 2,180,000 persons); and the estimated 109 entities thatpreviously used the accommodation andwill now use their exempt status will ac-count for 25 percent of those persons (thatis, approximately 727,000 persons). It is notknown how many persons will be coveredin the plans of the 9 entities we estimate willnewly use the accommodation. Assumingthat those 9 entities will have a similar num-ber of covered persons per entity as the 100entities encompassing 2,180,000 persons,the Departments estimate that all 109 ac- commodated entities will encompass ap-proximately 2,376,000 covered persons. The Departments assume that sending one notice to each policyholder will sat-isfy the need to send the notices to allparticipants and dependents. Among per-sons covered by insurance plans spon-sored by large employers in the privatesector, approximately 50.1 percent areparticipants and 49.9 percent are depen-dents. 119For 109 entities, the total number of notices will be 1,190,613. For purposesof this analysis, the Departments also as-sume that 53.7 percent of notices will besent electronically, and 46.3 percent willbe mailed. 120Therefore, approximately 551,254 notices will be mailed. HHS es-timates that each notice will require $0.50in postage and $0.05 in materials cost(paper and ink) and the total postage andmaterials cost for each notice sent via mailwill be $0.55. The total cost for sendingapproximately 551,254 notices by mailwill be approximately $303,190. As DOLand HHS share jurisdiction, they are split-ting the cost burden so each will accountfor $151,595 of the cost burden. 4. ICRs Regarding Notice of Revocation of Accommodation (\u00a7 147.131(c)(4)) An eligible organization that now wishes to take advantage of the expandedexemption may revoke its use of the ac-commodation process; its issuer or thirdparty administrator must provide writtennotice of such revocation to participantsand beneciaries as soon as practicable.As discussed above, HHS estimates that109 entities that are using the accommo-dation process will revoke their use of theaccommodation, and will therefore be re-quired to send the notication; the issueror third party administrator can send thenotice on behalf of the entity. For thepurpose of calculating the ICRs associated with revocations of the accommodation,and for various reasons discussed above,HHS assumes that litigating entities thatwere previously using the accommodationand that will revoke their use of the ac-commodation fall within the estimated109 entities that will revoke the accom-modation overall. As before, HHS assumes that, for each issuer or third party administrator, a man-ager and inside legal counsel and clericalstaff will need approximately 2 hours toprepare and send the notication to par-ticipants and beneciaries and maintainrecords (30 minutes for a manager at acost of $117.40 per hour, 30 minutes forlegal counsel at a cost of $134.50 perhour, 1 hour for clerical staff at a cost of$55.68 per hour). The burden per respon-dent will be 2 hours with an associatedcost of approximately $182; for 109 enti-ties, the total hour burden will be 218hours with an associated cost of approxi-mately $19,798. As DOL and HHS sharejurisdiction, they are splitting the hourburden so each will account for 109 bur-den hours with an associated cost of ap-proximately $9,899. As discussed above, HHS estimates that there are approximately 727,000 cov-ered persons in accommodated plans thatwill revoke their accommodated statusand use the expanded exemption. 121As before, the Departments use the average of 50.1 percent of covered persons whoare policyholders, and estimate that anaverage of 53.7 percent of notices will besent electronically and 46.3 percent bymail. Therefore, approximately 364,102notices will be distributed, of which168,579 notices will be mailed. HHS es-timates that each mailed notice will re-quire $0.50 in postage and $0.05 in mate-rials cost (paper and ink) and the totalpostage and materials cost for each notice 119\"Health Insurance Coverage Bulletin\" Table 4, page 21. Using Data for the March 2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population S urvey. https://www.dol.gov/ sites/default/les/ebsa/researchers/data/health-and-welfare/health-insurance-coverage-bulletin-2016.pdf. 120According to data from the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), 36.0 percent of individuals age 25 and over have access to the i nternet at work. According to a Greenwald & Associates survey, 84 percent of plan participants nd it acceptable to make electronic delivery the default option, which is used as t he proxy for the number of participants who will not opt out that are automatically enrolled (for a total of 30.2 percent receiving electronic disclosure at work). Additionally, the NTIA rep orts that 38.5 percent of individuals age 25 and over have access to the internet outside of work. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 61 percent of internet users use online banking, whic h is used as the proxy for the number of internet users who will opt in for electronic disclosure (for a total of 23.5 percent receiving electronic disclosure outside of work). Comb ining the 30.2 percent who receive electronic disclosure at work with the 23.5 percent who receive electronic disclosure outside of work produces a total of 53.7 percent who will receiv e electronic disclosure overall. 121In estimating the number of women that might have their contraceptive coverage affected by the expanded exemption, the Departments indicated that we do not know the extent to which the number of women in accommodated plans affected by these nal rules overlap with the number of women in plans offered by litigating entities that wil l be affected by these nal rules, though we assume there is signicant overlap. That uncertainty should not affect the calculation of the ICRs for revocation notices, however. If the t wo numbers overlap, the estimates of plans revoking the accommodation and policyholders covered in those plans would already include plans and policyholders of litigating entities. If the numbers do not overlap, those litigating entity plans would not presently be enrolled in the accommodation, and therefore would not need to send notices concerning revocation of accommodate d status.

Submission of PRA-Related Comments We have submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its review of the rule's infor-mation collection and recordkeeping re-quirements. These requirements are noteffective until they have been approved byOMB. E. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Labor Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor,and an individual is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less it displays a valid OMB control num-ber. In accordance with the requirementsof the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA Form700 and alternative notice have previouslybeen approved by OMB under controlnumbers 1210-0150 and 1210-0152. Acopy of the ICR may be by con-tacting the PRA addressee shown belowor at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRA AD-DRESSEE: G. Christopher Cosby, Ofceof Policy and Research, U.S. Departmentof Labor, Employee Benets Security 202-693-8410; Fax:202-219-4745. These are not toll-freenumbers.The Religious nal rules amended the ICR by changing the accommodation pro-cess to an optional process for exemptorganizations and requiring a notice ofrevocation to be sent by the issuer or thirdparty administrator to participants andbeneciaries in plans whose employer re-vokes their accommodation; these nalrules conrm as nal the Religious IFC provisions on the accommodation pro-cess. DOL submitted the ICRs to OMB inorder to obtain OMB approval under thePRA for the regulatory revision. In aneffort to consolidate the number of infor-mation collection requests, DOL is com-bining the ICR related to the OMB controlnumber 1210-0152 ICR anddiscontinuing OMB control number 1210-0152. Consistent with the analysis in theHHS PRA section above, the Departmentsexpect that each of the estimated 9 eligibleorganizations newly opting into the ac-commodation will spend approximately50 minutes in preparation time and incur$0.54 mailing cost to self-certify or notifyHHS. Each of the 109 issuers or thirdparty administrators for the 109 eligibleorganizations that make use of the accom-modation overall will distribute Notices ofAvailability of Separate Payments forContraceptive Services. These issuers andthird party administrators will spend ap-proximately 1.25 hours in preparation time and incur $0.54 cost per mailed no-tice. Notices of Availability of SeparatePayments for Contraceptive Services willneed to be sent to 1,190,613 policyhold-ers, and 53.7 percent of the notices will besent electronically, while 46.3 percent willbe mailed. Finally, 109 entities using theprevious accommodation process will re-voke their use of the accommodation (infavor of the expanded exemption) and willtherefore be required to cause the Noticeof Revocation of Accommodation to besent, with the issuer or third party admin-istrator able to send the notice on behalf ofthe entity. These entities will spend ap-proximately two hours in preparation timeand incur $0.54 cost per mailed notice.Notice of Revocation of Accommodationwill need to be sent to an average of364,102 policyholders and 53.7 percent ofthe notices will be sent electronically. TheDOL information collections in this ruleare found in 29 CFR 2510.3-16 and2590.715-2713A and are summarized asfollows: Type of Review: Revised Collection.Agency: DOL-EBSA.Title: Coverage of Certain Preventive Services under the Affordable Care Act\u2014Private Sector.

Regulatory Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 Executive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, \"[t]o the maximum ex-tent permitted by law, the Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Ser-vices and the heads of all other executivedepartments and agencies (agencies) withauthorities and responsibilities under theAct shall exercise all authority and discre-tion available to them to waive, defer,grant exemptions from, or delay the im-plementation of any provision or require-ment of the Act that would impose a scalburden on any state or a cost, fee, tax,penalty, or regulatory burden on individ-uals, families, healthcare providers, healthinsurers, patients, recipients of healthcareservices, purchasers of health insurance,or makers of medical devices, products, ormedications.\" In addition, agencies are di-rected to \"take all actions consistent withlaw to minimize the unwarranted eco-nomic and regulatory burdens of the [Af-fordable Care Act], and prepare to affordthe states more flexibility and control tocreate a freer and open healthcare mar-ket.\" These nal rules exercise the discre-tion provided to the Departments underthe Affordable Care Act, RFRA, and otherlaws to grant exemptions and therebyminimize regulatory burdens of the Af-fordable Care Act on the affected entities and recipients of health care services. Consistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017),the Departments have estimated the costsand cost savings attributable to these nalrules. As discussed in more detail in thepreceding analysis, these nal rules lessenincremental reporting costs. 123However, in order to avoid double-counting with theReligious IFC, which has already beentallied as an Executive Order 13771 de-regulatory action, this nalization of theIFC's policy is not considered a deregu-latory action under the Executive Order. G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) of Pub. L. 104-4), requires the Departments to prepare awritten statement, which includes an as-sessment of anticipated costs and benets,before issuing \"any rule that includes anyfederal mandate that may result in theexpenditure by state, local, and tribal gov-ernments, in the aggregate, or by the pri-vate sector, of $100 million or more (ad-justed annually for inflation) in any oneyear.\" In 2018, that threshold after adjust-ment for inflation is $150 million. Forpurposes of the Unfunded Mandates Re-form Act, the Religious IFC and thesenal rules do not include any federal man-date that may result in expenditures bystate, local, or tribal governments, nor dothey include any federal mandates thatmay impose an annual burden of $150million, adjusted for inflation, or more onthe private sector. H. Federalism Executive Order 13132 outlines funda- mental principles of federalism, and re-quires the adherence to specic criteria byfederal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on states, the relationship between the fed- eral government and states, or the distri-bution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government.Federal agencies promulgating regula-tions that have these federalism implica-tions must consult with state and localofcials, and describe the extent of theirconsultation and the nature of the con-cerns of state and local ofcials in thepreamble to the regulation. These nal rules do not have any fed- eralism implications, since they only pro-vide exemptions from the contraceptiveand sterilization coverage requirement inHRSA Guidelines supplied under section2713 of the PHS Act. V. Statutory Authority The Department of the Treasury regu- lations are adopted pursuant to the author-ity contained in sections 7805 and 9833 ofthe Code, and Pub. L. 103-141, 107 Stat.1488 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb-2000bb-4).. The Department of Labor regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority con-tained 1201, 1562(e), Law111-148, 124 Stat. byPublic Law 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029; Pub.L. 1-2011, 77 FR 1088 (Jan. 9, 2012). The Department of Health and Human Services regulations are adopted pursuantto the authority contained in sections 2701through 2763, 2791, 300gg-63,300gg-91, and 300gg-92), as is an overlap between jurisdiction shared by HHS and DOL over these respondents and therefore they are included only once in the tota l. 123Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential decreased expenditures on contrace ptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-related medical services. OMB's guidance on EO 13771 implementation (Dominic Mancini, \"Guidance Implemen ting Executive 13771, Titled \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,\" Ofce (Apr. 5, 2017), https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.g ov/les/omb/memoranda/2017/M-17- 21-OMB.pdf ) states that impacts should be categorized as consistently as possible within Departments. The Food and Drug Administration, within HHS , and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly estimate medical expenditure impacts in the a nalyses that accompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benets (positive benets if expenditures are reduced, negative benets if expenditures are rai sed). Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting convention leads to this nal rule's medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positive or negative) benets, rather than as cos ts, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes.

(B) When a notice is provided to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,the notice must include the name of theeligible organization; a statement that itobjects as described in 45 CFR 147.132 tocoverage of some or all contraceptive ser-vices (including an identication of thesubset of contraceptive services to whichcoverage the eligible organization objects,if applicable), but that it would like toelect the optional accommodation pro-cess; the plan name and type (that is,whether it is a student health insuranceplan within the meaning of 45 CFR147.145(a) or a church plan within themeaning of section 3(33) of ERISA); andthe name and contact information for anyof the plan's third party administrators. Ifthere is a change in any of the informationrequired to be included in the notice, theeligible organization must provide up-dated information to the Secretary of theDepartment of Health and Human Ser-vices for the optional accommodation pro-cess to remain in effect. The Department of Labor (working with the Department ofHealth and Human Services) will send aseparate notication to each of the plan'sthird party administrators informing thethird party administrator that the Secretaryof the Department of Health and HumanServices has received a notice under para-graph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and de-scribing the obligations of the third partyadministrator under 29 CFR 2510.3-16and this section.(2) If a third party administrator re- ceives a copy of the self-certication froman eligible organization or a noticationfrom the Department of Labor, as de-scribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this sec-tion, and is willing to enter into or remainin a contractual relationship with the eli-gible organization or its plan to provideadministrative services for the plan, thenthe third party administrator will provideor arrange payments for contraceptive ser-vices, using one of the following meth-ods\u2014 (i) Provide payments for the contracep- tive services for plan participants and bene-ciaries without imposing any cost-sharingrequirements (such as a copayment, coinsur-ance, or a deductible), premium, fee, orother charge, or any portion thereof, directlyor indirectly, on the eligible organization,the group health plan, or plan participants orbeneciaries; or (ii) Arrange for an issuer or other entity to provide payments for the contraceptiveservices for plan participants and bene- ciaries without imposing any cost-sharingrequirements (such as a copayment, coin-surance, or a deductible), premium, fee, orother charge, or any portion thereof, di-rectly or indirectly, on the eligible orga-nization, the group health plan, or planparticipants or beneciaries.

(4) A third party administrator may not require any documentation other than acopy of the self-certication from the el-igible organization or notication fromthe Department of Labor described inparagraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. (5) Where an otherwise eligible organi- zation does not contract with a third partyadministrator and les a self-certication ornotice under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this sec-tion, the obligations under paragraph (b)(2)of this section do not apply, and the other-wise eligible organization is under no re-quirement to provide coverage or paymentsfor contraceptive services to which it ob-jects.

(c)Optional accommodation\u2014insured group health plans \u2014(1) General rule. A group health plan established or main-tained by an eligible organization that pro-vides benets through one or more grouphealth insurance issuers may voluntarilyelect an optional accommodation underwhich its health insurance issuer(s) willprovide payments for all or a subset ofcontraceptive services for one or moreplan years. To invoke the optional accom-modation process-- (i) The eligible organization or its plan must contract with one or more healthinsurance issuers. (ii) The eligible organization must pro- vide either a copy of the self-certicationto each issuer providing coverage in con-nection with the plan or a notice to theSecretary of the Department of Health andHuman Services that it is an eligible or-ganization and of its objection as de-scribed in 45 CFR 147.132 to coverage forall or a subset of contraceptive services. (A) When a self-certication is pro- vided directly to an issuer, the issuer hassole responsibility for providing such cov-erage in accordance with \u00a7 54.9815-2713. (B) When a notice is provided to the Secretary of the Department Health and Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 909Human Services, the notice must include the name of the eligible organization; astatement that it objects as described in 45CFR 147.132 to coverage of some or allcontraceptive services (including an iden-tication of the subset of contraceptiveservices to which coverage the eligibleorganization objects, if applicable) butthat it would like to elect the optionalaccommodation process; the plan nameand type (that is, whether it is a studenthealth insurance plan within the meaningof 45 CFR 147.145(a) or a church planwithin the meaning of section 3(33) ofERISA); and the name and contact infor-mation for any of the plan's health insur-ance issuers. If there is a change in any ofthe information required to be included inthe notice, the eligible organization mustprovide updated information to the Secre-tary of Department of Health and HumanServices for the optional accommodationprocess to remain in effect. The Depart-ment of Health and Human Services willsend a separate notication to each of the plan's health insurance issuers informingthe issuer that the Secretary of the Depart-ment Health and Human Services has re-ceived a notice under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)of this section and describing the obliga-tions of the issuer under this section. (2) If an issuer receives a copy of the self-certication from an eligible organi-zation or the notication from the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services asdescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of thissection and does not have its own objec-tion as described in 45 CFR 147.132 toproviding the contraceptive services towhich the eligible organization objects,then the issuer will provide payments forcontraceptive services as follows\u2014 (i) The issuer must expressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the grouphealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with the group health plan andprovide separate payments for any contra-ceptive services required to be coveredunder \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) for planparticipants and beneciaries for so longas they remain enrolled in the plan. (ii) With respect to payments for con- traceptive services, the issuer may not im-pose any cost-sharing requirements (suchas a copayment, coinsurance, or a deduct-ible), or impose any premium, fee, orother charge, or any portion thereof, di-rectly or indirectly, on the eligible orga- nization, the group health plan, or planparticipants or beneciaries. The issuermust segregate premium revenue col-lected from the eligible organization fromthe monies used to provide payments forcontraceptive services. The issuer mustprovide payments for contraceptive ser-vices in a manner that is consistent withthe requirements under sections 2706,2709, 2711, 2713, 2719, and 2719A of thePHS Act, as incorporated into section9815 of the PHS Act. If the group healthplan of the eligible organization providescoverage for some but not all of any con-traceptive services required to be coveredunder \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv), the is-suer is required to provide payments onlyfor those contraceptive services for whichthe group health plan does not providecoverage. However, the issuer may pro-vide payments for all contraceptive ser-vices, at the issuer's option. (3) A health insurance issuer may not require any documentation other than a copy of the self-certication from the el-igible organization or the noticationfrom the Department of Health and Hu-man Services described in paragraph(c)(1)(ii) of this section. (d)Notice of availability of separate payments for contraceptive services - self-insured and insured group health plans . For each plan year to which the optionalaccommodation in paragraph (b) or (c) ofthis section is to apply, a third party ad-ministrator required to provide or arrangepayments for contraceptive services pur-suant to paragraph (b) of this section, andan issuer required to provide payments forcontraceptive services pursuant to para-graph (c) of this section, must provide toplan participants and beneciaries writtennotice of the availability of separate pay-ments for contraceptive services contem-poraneous with (to the extent possible),but separate from, any application materi-als distributed in connection with enroll-ment (or re-enrollment) in group healthcoverage that is effective beginning on therst day of each applicable plan year. Thenotice must specify that the eligible orga-nization does not administer or fund con-traceptive benets, but that the third partyadministrator or issuer, as applicable, pro-vides or arranges separate payments forcontraceptive services, and must providecontact information for questions and complaints. The following model lan-guage, or substantially similar language,may be used to satisfy the notice require-ment of this paragraph (d): \"Your em-ployer has certied that your group health plan qualies for an accommodation withrespect to the federal requirement to coverall Food and Drug Administration-approvedcontraceptive services for women, as pre-scribed by a health care provider, withoutcost sharing. This means that your employerwill not contract, arrange, pay, or refer forcontraceptive coverage. Instead, [name ofthird party administrator/health insurance is-suer] will provide or arrange separate pay-ments for contraceptive services that youuse, without cost sharing and at no othercost, for so long as you are enrolled in yourgroup health plan. Your employer will notadminister or fund these payments. If youhave any questions about this notice, contact[contact information for third party admin-istrator/health insurance issuer].\" (e) Reliance\u2014insured group health plans \u2014(1) If an issuer relies reasonably and in good faith on a representation bythe eligible organization as to its eligibil-ity for the accommodation in paragraph(c) of this section, and the representationis later determined to be incorrect, theissuer is considered to comply with anyapplicable requirement under \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) to provide contraceptivecoverage if the issuer complies with theobligations under this section applicableto such issuer. (2) A group health plan is considered to comply with any applicable requirementunder \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv) to pro-vide contraceptive coverage if the plancomplies with its obligations under para-graph (c) of this section, without regard towhether the issuer complies with the ob-ligations under this section applicable tosuch issuer. (f)Denition . For the purposes of this section, reference to \"contraceptive\" ser-vices, benets, or coverage includes con-traceptive or sterilization items, proce-dures, or services, or related patienteducation or counseling, to the extentspecied for purposes of \u00a7 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv). (g)Severability . Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceableby its terms, or as applied to any person or December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 910circumstance, shall be construed so as to continue to give maximum effect to theprovision permitted by law, unless suchholding shall be one of utter invalidity orunenforceability, in which event the pro-vision shall be severable from this sectionand shall not affect the remainder thereofor the application of the provision to per-sons not similarly situated or to dissimilarcircumstances. \u00a7 [REMOVED] 5.

(b)Objecting individuals . Guidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by theHealth Resources and Services Adminis-tration must not provide for or support the requirement of coverage or payments forcontraceptive services with respect to indi-viduals who object as specied in this para-graph (b), a willing health insur-ance issuer offering group or individualhealth insurance coverage, and as applica-ble, a willing plan sponsor of a group healthplan, from offering a separate policy, certif-icate or contract of insurance or a separategroup health plan or benet package option,to any group health plan sponsor (with re-spect to an individual) or individual, as ap-plicable, who objects to coverage or pay-ments for some or all contraceptive servicesbased on sincerely held religious beliefs.Under this exemption, if an individual ob-jects to some but not all contraceptiveservices, but the issuer, and as applicable,plan sponsor, are willing to provide the plansponsor or individual, as applicable, with aseparate policy, certicate or contract of in-surance or a separate group health plan orbenet package option that omits all contra-ceptives, and the individual agrees, then theexemption applies as if the individual ob-jects to all contraceptive services.***** December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 912T.D. 9841 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYInternal Revenue Service26 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Employee Benets SecurityAdministration29 CFR Part 2590 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES45 CFR Part 147 Moral Exemptions and Accommodations forCoverage of CertainPreventive Services Underthe Affordable Care Act AGENCIES: Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury; EmployeeBenets Security Administration, Depart-ment of Labor; and Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services, Department ofHealth and Human Services. ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: These rules nalize, with changes based on public comments, theinterim nal rules issued in the Bulletin on October 13, 2017 concerning moralexemptions and accommodations regard-ing coverage of certain preventive ser-vices. These rules nalize expanded ex-emptions to protect moral beliefs forcertain entities and individuals whosehealth plans are subject to a mandate ofcontraceptive coverage through guidanceissued pursuant to the Patient Protectionand Affordable Care Act. These rules donot alter the discretion of the Health Re-sources and Services Administration, acomponent of the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services, to maintainthe guidelines requiring contraceptivecoverage where no regulatorily recog-nized objection exists. These rules alsoleave in place an optional \"accommoda-tion\" process for certain exempt entitiesthat wish to use it voluntarily. These rulesdo not alter multiple other federal pro-grams that provide free or subsidized con-traceptives for women at risk of unin- tended pregnancy. DATES: Effective date : These regulations are effective on January 14, 2019.

Executive Summary and Background A. Executive Summary 1. Purpose The primary purpose of these nal rules is to nalize, with changes in re-sponse to public comments, the interimnal regulations with requests for com-ments (IFCs) published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2017 (82 FR 47838), \"Moral Exemptions and Accom-modations for Coverage of Certain Pre-ventive Services Under the AffordableCare Act\" (the Moral IFC). The rules arenecessary to protect sincerely held moralobjections of certain entities and individ-uals. The rules, thus, minimize the bur-dens imposed on their moral beliefs, withregard to the discretionary requirementthat health plans cover certain contracep-tive services with no cost-sharing, whichwas created by HHS through guidancepromulgated by the Health Resources andServices Administration (HRSA), pursu-ant to authority granted by the ACA insection 2713(a)(4) of the Public HealthService Act. In addition, the rules nalizereferences to these moral exemptions inthe previously created accommodationprocess that permit entities with certainobjections voluntarily to continue to ob-ject while the persons covered in theirplans receive contraceptive coverage orpayments arranged by their issuers orthird party administrators. The rules donot remove the contraceptive coverage requirement generally from HRSA'sguidelines. The changes to the rules be-ing nalized will ensure clarity in im-plementation of the moral exemptionsso that proper respect is afforded to sin-cerely held moral convictions in rulesgoverning this area of health insurance and coverage, with minimal impact onHRSA's decision to otherwise requirecontraceptive coverage. 2. Summary of the Major Provisions a. Moral exemptions These rules nalize exemptions provided in the Moral IFC for the group health plansand health insurance coverage of variousentities and individuals with sincerely heldmoral convictions opposed to coverage ofsome or all contraceptive or sterilizationmethods encompassed by HRSA's guide-lines. As in the Moral IFC, the exemptionsinclude plan sponsors that are nonprot or-ganization plan sponsors or for-prot enti-ties that have no publicly traded ownershipinterests (dened as any class of commonequity securities required to be registeredunder section 12 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934). The exemptions also continueto include institutions of higher education intheir arrangement of student health insur-ance coverage; health insurance issuers (butonly with respect to plans that are otherwisealso exempt under the rules); and objectingindividuals with respect to their own cover-age, where their health insurance issuer and plan sponsor, as applicable, are willing to pro-vide coverage complying with the individual'smoral objection. After considering public comments, the Departments have decidednot to extend the moral exemptions to non-federal governmental entities at this time,although individuals receiving employer-sponsored insurance from a governmentalentity may use the individual exemption ifthe other terms of the individual exemptionapply, including that their employer is will-ing to offer them a plan consistent with theirmoral objection. In response to public comments, vari- ous changes are made to clarify the in-tended scope of the language in the MoralIFC's exemptions. The prefatory exemp-tion language is claried to ensure exemp-tions apply to a group health plan estab-lished or maintained by an objectingorganization, or health insurance coverageoffered or arranged by an objecting orga-nization, to the extent of the objections. The Departments add language to specifythat the exemption for institutions of highereducation applies to non-governmental en-tities. The Departments also modied lan- guage describing the moral objection applica-ble to the exemptions, to specify that the entityobjects, based on its sincerely held moral con-victions, to its establishing, maintaining, pro-viding, offering, or arranging for (as applica-ble) either: coverage or payments for some orall contraceptive services; or a plan, issuer, orthird party administrator that provides or ar-ranges such coverage or payments. The Departments also clarify language in the exemption applicable to plans ofobjecting individuals. The clarication ismade to ensure that the HRSA guidelinesdo not prevent a willing health insuranceissuer offering group or individual healthinsurance coverage, and as applicable, awilling plan sponsor of a group healthplan, from offering a separate policy, cer-ticate or contract of insurance or a sep-arate group health plan or benet packageoption, to any group health plan sponsor(with respect to an individual) or individ- ual, as applicable, who objects to cover-age or payments for some or all contra-ceptive services based on sincerely heldmoral convictions. The exemption addsthat, if an individual objects to some butnot all contraceptive services, but the is-suer, and as applicable, plan sponsor, arewilling to provide the plan sponsor orindividual, as applicable, with a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insuranceor a separate group health plan or benetpackage option that omits all contracep-tives, and the individual agrees, then theexemption applies as if the individual ob-jects to all contraceptive services. b. References to moral exemptions in accommodation regulations and inregulatory restatement of statutorylanguage These rules nalize without change the references to the moral exemptions thatwere inserted by the Moral IFC into therules that regulatorily restate the statutorylanguage from section 2713(a) and (a)(4)of the Public Health Service Act. Simi-larly, these rules nalize without changefrom the Moral IFC references to themoral exemptions that were inserted intothe regulations governing the optional ac-commodation process. These referencesoperationalize the effect of the moral ex-emptions rule, and they allow contracep- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 914tive services to be made available to women if any employers with non-religious moral objections to contracep-tive coverage choose to use the optional accommodation process.3. Summary of Costs, Savings and Benets of the Major Provisions Provision Savings and Benets Costs Finalizing insertion of references to moral exemptionsinto restatement of statutorylanguage from 2713(a)and (a)(4) of the Public HealthService ActThese provisions, nalized without change, are for the purpose of insertingreferences to the moral exemptions intothe the regulatory restatement of section2713(a) and (a)(4) of the Public HealthService Act, which already references thereligious exemptions. This operationalizesthe moral exemptions in each of the tri-agencies' rules. We estimate no economicsavings or benet from nalizing this partof the rule, but consider it a deregulatoryaction to minimize the regulatory impactbeyond the scope set forth in the statute.We estimate no costs from nalizing this part of the rule. Finalized moral exemptions The moral exemptions to the contraceptive coverage requirement arenalized with technical changes. Theirpurpose is to relieve burdens that someentities and individuals experience frombeing forced to choose between, on theone hand, complying with their moralbeliefs and facing penalties from failingto comply with the contraceptivecoverage requirement, and on the otherhand, providing (or, for individuals,obtaining) contraceptive coverage inviolation of their sincerely held moralbeliefs.We estimate there will be only a small amount of costs for these exemptions,because they will primarily be used byorganizations and individuals that do notwant contraceptive coverage. To theextent some other employers will use theexemption where there will be transfercosts for women previously receivingcontraceptive coverage who will nolonger receive that coverage, we expectthose costs to be minimal due to thesmall number of entities expected to usethe exemptions with non-religious moralobjections. We estimate the transfer costswill amount to $8,760. Finalizing insertion of references to moral exemptionsinto optional accommodationregulationsThese provisions, nalized without change, will allow organizations withmoral objections to contraceptivecoverage on the basis of sincerely heldmoral convictions to use theaccommodation as an optional process.These provisions will allow contraceptivecoverage to be made available to womencovered by plans of employers that objectto contraceptive coverage but do notobject to their issuers or third partyadministrators arranging for suchcoverage to be provided to personscovered by their plans.We do not estimate any entities with non- religious moral objections to use theaccommodation process at this time. B. Background Over many decades, Congress has pro- tected conscientious objections includingbased on moral convictions in the context of health care and human services, andincluding health coverage, even as it hassought to promote access to health ser-vices. 124In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable CareAct (PPACA) (Pub. L. 111-148) (March23, 2010). Congress enacted the Health 124See, for example, 42 U.S.C. 300a-7 (protecting i ndividuals and health care entities from being required to provide or assist sterilizations, abortions, or other lawful health services if it would violate their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 238n (protecting individuals and entities that object to abortion); C onsolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Div. H, Sec. 507(d) (Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-141, 132 Stat. 348, 764 (Mar. 23, 2018) (protecting any \"health care professional, a hospital, a provider-sponsored organization, a health maintenance organization, a health insurance plan, or any o ther kind of health care facility, organization, or plan\" in objecting to abortion for any reason); Id.at Div. E, Sec. 726(c) (Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act) (protecting individuals who object to prescribing or providing contraceptives contrary to their \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); Id.at Div. E, Sec. 808 (regarding any requirement of \"the provision of contraceptive coverage by health insurance plans\" in the District of Columbia, \"it is the intent of Congress that any legislation enacted on such is sue should include a 'conscience clause' which provides exceptions for religious beliefs and moral convictions.\"); Id.at Div. K, Title III (Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act) (protecting applicants for family planning funds based on their \"religious or conscientious commitment to offer only natural family planning\" ); 42 U.S.C. 290bb-36 (prohibiting the statutory Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 915Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) (Pub. L. 111-152) onMarch 30, 2010, which, among otherthings, amended PPACA. As amended byHCERA, PPACA is known as the Afford-able Care Act (ACA). The ACA reorganized, amended, and added to the provisions of part A of titleXXVII of the Public Health Service Act(PHS Act) relating to group health plansand health insurance issuers in the groupand individual markets. The ACA addedsection 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retire-ment Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to theInternal Revenue Code (Code), in order toincorporate the provisions of part A oftitle XXVII of the PHS Act into ERISAand the Code, and to make them applica-ble to group health plans and health insur-ance issuers providing health insurance coverage in connection with group healthplans. The sections of the PHS Act incor-porated into ERISA and the Code are sec-tions 2701 through 2728. In 2713(a)(4) of (hereinafter \"section 2713(a)(4)\"), Con-gress provided adm inistrative discretion to require that certain group health plansand health insurance issuers cover cer-tain women's preventive services, in ad-dition to other preventive services re-quired to be covered in section 2713.Congress granted that discretion to the Health Resources and Services Admin-istration (HRSA), a component of theU.S. Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS). Specically, section2713(a)(4) allows HRSA discretion tospecify coverage requirements, \"withrespect to women, such additional pre-ventive care and screenings as providedfor in comprehensive guidelines sup-ported\" by HRSA (the \"Guidelines\"). Since 2011, HRSA has exercised that discretion to require coverage for, among other things, certain contracep-tive services. 125In the same time period, the administering agencies\u2014HHS, theDepartment of Labor, and the Depart-ment of the Treasury (collectively, \"theDepartments\" 126)\u2014exercised discretion to allow exemptions to those require-ments by issuing rulemaking various times, including issuing and nalizingthree interim nal regulations prior to2017. 127In those regulations, the De- partments crafted exemptions and ac-commodations for certain religious ob-jectors where the Guidelines requirecoverage of contraceptive services,changed the scope of those exemptionsand accommodations, and solicited pub-lic comments on a number of occasions.Public comments were submitted onvarious iterations of the regulations is-sued before 2017, and some of those comments supported expanding the ex-emptions to include those who opposethe contraceptive coverage mandate foreither religious \"or moral\" reasons, con-sistent with various state laws (such asin Connecticut or Missouri) that protectobjections to contraceptive coveragebased on moral convictions. 128 During the period when the Depart- ments were publishing and modifying theregulations, organizations and individualsled dozens of lawsuits challenging thecontraceptive andregulations (hereinafter, nonprot organiza-tions, businesses run by religious families,individuals, and others, including severalnon-religious organizations that opposedcoverage of certain contraceptives under the Mandate on the basis of non-religiousmoral convictions. For-prot entities withreligious objections won various court de-cisions leading to the Supreme Court'sruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). The Supreme Court ruled against the Departments andheld that, under the Religious FreedomRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), theMandate could not be applied to theclosely held for-prot corporations beforethe Court because their owners had reli- section from being construed to require suicide related treatment services for youth where the parents or legal guardians object based on \"religious beliefs or moral objections\"); 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicare /H11001Choice, now Medicare Advantage, managed care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 1396a(w)(3) (ensuring particular Federal law does not infringe on \"conscience\" as protected in State law concerning advance directives); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (protecting against forced counseling or referrals in Medicaid managed care plans with respect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\") ; 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b) (protecting objection to abortion funding in legal services assistance grants based on \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 42 U.S.C. 14406 (protecting o rganizations and health providers from being required to inform or counsel persons pertaining to assisted suicide); 42 U.S.C. 18023 (blocking any requirement that issuers or exchange s must cover abortion); 42 U.S.C. 18113 (protecting health plans or health providers from being required to provide an item or service that helps cause assisted suicide); see also 8 U.S.C. 1182(g) (protecting vaccination objections by \"aliens\" due to \"religious beliefs or moral convictions\"); 18 U.S.C. 3597 (protecting objectors to participation in Fede ral executions based on \"moral or religious convictions\"); 20 U.S.C. 1688 (prohibiting sex discrimination law to be used to require assistance in abortion for any reason); 22 U.S.C. 7 631(d) (protecting entities from being required to use HIV/AIDS funds contrary to their \"religious or moral objection\"). 125The references in \"contraceptive,\" \"contraceptive coverage,\" or \"contraceptive services\" generally include a ll contraceptives, sterilization, and related patient education and counseling, required by the Women's Preventive Guidelines, unless otherwise indicated.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 916gious objections to providing such cover- age.129Later, a second series of legal challenges were led by religious non-prot organizations that stated the accom-modation impermissibly burdened theirreligious beliefs because it utilized their health plans to provide services to whichthey objected on religious grounds, and itrequired them to submit a self-certicationor notice. On May 16, 2016, the SupremeCourt issued a per curiam decision, vacatingthe judgments of the Courts of Appeals\u2014most of which had ruled in the Depart-ments' favor\u2014and remanding the cases \"inlight of the substantial clarication and re-nement in the positions of the parties\" thathad been led in supplemental briefs. Zubik v. Burwell , 136 S. Ct. 1557, 1560 (2016). The Court stated that it anticipated that, onremand, the Courts of Appeals would \"al-low the parties sufcient time to resolve anyoutstanding issues between them.\" Id. Beginning in 2015, lawsuits challeng- ing the Mandate were also led by variousnon-religious organizations with moralobjections to contraceptive coverage.These organizations stated that they be-lieve some methods classied by the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) as con-traceptives may have an abortifacient ef-fect and, therefore, in their view, are mor-ally equivalent to abortion to which theyhave a moral objection. Under regulationspreceding October 2017, these organiza-tions neither received an exemption fromthe Mandate nor qualied for the accom-modation. For example, March for Lifeled a complaint claiming that the Man-date violated the equal protection compo- nent of the Due Process Clause of theFifth Amendment, and was arbitrary andcapricious under the Administrative Pro-cedure Act (APA). Citing, for example, 77FR 8727, March for Life argued that theDepartments' stated interests behind theMandate were only advanced amongwomen who \"want\" the coverage so as toprevent \"unintended\" pregnancy. Marchfor Life contended that, because it onlyhires employees who publicly advocateagainst abortion, including what they re-gard as abortifacient contraceptive items,the Departments' interests were not ratio-nally advanced by imposing the Mandateupon it and its employees. Accordingly,March for Life contended that applying the Mandate to it (and other similarly sit-uated organizations) lacked a rational ba-sis and, therefore, was arbitrary and capri-cious in violation of the APA. March forLife further contended that, because theDepartments concluded the government'sinterests were not undermined by exempt-ing houses of worship and integrated aux-iliaries (based on the assumption that suchentities are relatively more likely thanother nonprots with religious objectionsto have employees that share their viewsagainst certain contraceptives), applyingthe Mandate to March for Life or similarorganizations that denitively hire onlyemployees who oppose certain contracep-tives lacked a rational basis and, therefore,violated their right of equal protection un-der the Due Process Clause. March for Life's employees, who stated they were personally religious (al-though personal religiosity was not a con-dition of their employment), also sued asco-plaintiffs. They contended that theMandate violated their rights under RFRAby making it impossible for them to obtainhealth coverage consistent with their reli-gious beliefs, either from the plan Marchfor Life wanted to offer them, or in theindividual market, because the Depart- ments offered no exemptions in either cir-cumstance. Another non-religious nonprotorganization that opposed the Mandate's re-quirement to provide certain contraceptivecoverage on moral grounds also led a law-suit challenging the Mandate. Real Alterna- tives, Inc. v. Burwell , 150 F. Supp. 3d 419 (M.D. Pa. 2015). Challenges by non-religious nonprot organizations led to conflicting opinionsamong the federal courts. A district courtagreed with the March for Life plaintiffson the organization's equal protectionclaim and the employees' RFRA claims,while not specically ruling on the APAclaim, and issued a permanent injunctionagainst the Departments that is still inplace. March for Life v. Burwell , 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015). The appealinMarch for Life is pending and has been stayed since early 2016. In another case,federal district and appellate courts inPennsylvania disagreed with the reason-ing in March for Life , and ruled againstclaims brought by a similarly non- religious nonprot employer and its reli-gious employees. Real Alternatives , 150 F. Supp. 3d 419, afrmed by 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). One member of the ap-peals court panel in Real Alternatives v. Sec'y of HHS dissented in part, stating he would have ruled in favor of the individ-ual employee plaintiffs under RFRA. 867F.3d 338, 367 (3d Cir. 2017) (Jordan, J.,dissenting). The Departments most recently solic- ited public comments on these issuesagain in two interim nal regulations withrequest for comments published in theFederal Register on October 13, 2017: the regulations (82 FR 47838) (the MoralIFC) that are being nalized with changeshere, and the regulations (82 FR 47792)(the Religious IFC) published on the sameday as the Moral IFC, which are beingnalized with changes in the companionnal rules published elsewhere in today'sFederal Register . In the preamble to the Moral IFC, the Departments explained several reasonswhy, after exercising our discretion to re-evaluate the exemptions and accommoda-tions for the contraceptive Mandate, wesought public comment on whether to pro-tect moral convictions in the Moral IFCand these nal rules. The Departmentsnoted that we considered, among otherthings, Congress's history of providingprotections for moral convictions regard-ing certain health services (including con-traception, sterilization, and items or ser-vices believed to involve abortion); thetext, context, and intent of section 2713(a)(4) and the ACA; Executive Order13798, \"Promoting Free Speech 2017); submitted public comments; and theextensive litigation over the contraceptiveMandate. The Departments concludedthat it was appropriate that HRSA takeinto account the moral convictions of cer-tain employers, individuals and health in-surance issuers where the coverage ofcontraceptive services is concerned. Com-ments were requested on the interim nalregulations. After consideration of the comments and feedback received from stakeholders,the Departments are nalizing the Moral 129The Supreme Court did not decide whether RFRA would apply to publicly traded for-prot corporations. See134 S. Ct. at 2774. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 917IFC, with changes based on comments as indicated herein.130 II. Overview of the Final Rules and Public Comments During the 60-day comment period for the Moral IFC, which closed on December5, 2017, the Departments received over54,000 public comment submissions,which are posted to www.regulations.gov. 131Below, the Departments provide an overview of the nal rules and addressthe issues raised in the comments we re-ceived. A.Moral Exemptions and Accommodation in General These rules expand exemptions to pro- tect certain entities and individuals with moral convictions that oppose contraceptionwhose health plans are subject to a mandateof contraceptive coverage through guidanceissued pursuant to the ACA. These rules donot alter the discretion of HRSA, a compo-nent of HHS, to maintain the Guidelinesrequiring contraceptive coverage where noregulatorily recognized objection exists.These rules also make available to exemptorganizations the accommodation process,which was previously established in re-sponse to some objections of religious orga-nizations, as an optional process for exemptentities that wish to use it voluntarily. Theserules do not alter multiple other federal pro-grams that provide free or subsidized con-traceptives or related education and counsel-ing for women at risk of unintendedpregnancy. 132 1. The Departments' Authority to Mandate Coverage or ProvideExemptions The Departments received conflicting comments on their legal authority to pro-vide exemptions and accommodations to the Mandate. Some commenters agreedthat the Departments are legally autho-rized to provide expanded exemptions andan accommodation for moral convictions,noting that there was no requirement ofcontraceptive coverage in the ACA and noprohibition on providing moral exemp-tions in Guidelines issued under section2713(a)(4). Other commenters, however,asserted that the Departments have no le-gal authority to provide any exemptions tothe contraceptive Mandate, contending,based on statements in the ACA's legis-lative history, that the ACA requires con-traceptive coverage. Still other comment-ers contended that the Departments arelegally authorized to provide the religiousexemptions that existed prior to the 2017IFCs, but not to protect moral convictions. The Departments conclude that we are legally authorized to provide the exemp-tion and accommodation for moral con-victions set forth in the Moral IFC andthese nal rules. These rules concern sec-tion 2713 of the PHS Act, as incorporatedinto ERISA and the Code. Congress hasgranted the Departments legal authority,collectively, to administer these statutes. (26 U.S.C. 9833; 29 U.S.C. 42U.S.C. 300gg-92). Where it coverage without cost sharing for\"such \"as developed byHHS acting through HRSA. When Con-gress enacted this provision, those Guide-lines did not exist. And nothing in thestatute mandated that the Guidelines hadto include contraception, let alone for alltypes of employers with covered plans.Instead, section 2713(a)(4) provided apositive grant of authority for HSRA todevelop those Guidelines, thus delegatingauthority to HHS to shape that develop-ment, as the administering agency of HRSA, and to all three agencies as theadministering agencies of the statutes bywhich the Guidelines U.S.C. HHS, as HRSA is a component ofHHS that was unilaterally created by theagency and thus is subject to the agency'sgeneral supervision, see47 F. R. 38409 (August 31, 1982). Thus, nothing pre-vented HRSA from creating an exemptionfrom otherwise-applicable guidelines orprevented HHS and the other agenciesfrom directing that HRSA create such anexemption. Congress did not specify the extent to which HRSA must \"provide for\" and\"support\" the application of HRSA's authorityto support \"comprehensive guidelines\" in-volves determining both the types of cov-erage and scope of that coverage. Section2714(a)(4) requires coverage for preven-tive services only \"as provided for in com-prehensive guidelines supported by[HRSA].\" That is, services are required tobe included in coverage only to the extentthat the Guidelines supported by HRSA provide for them. Through use of the word\"as\" in the phrase \"as provided for,\" itrequires that HRSA support how thoseservices apply\u2014that is, the manner inwhich the support will happen, such as inthe phrase \"as you like it.\" 133When Con- gress means to require certain activities tooccur in a certain manner, instead of sim-ply authorizing the agency to decide themanner in which they will occur, Con-gress knows how to do so. See for exam- ple, 42 U.S.C. 1395x (\"The Secretary shall establish procedures to make bene-ciaries and providers aware of the re-quirement that a beneciary complete ahealth risk assessment prior to or at the same time as receiving personalized pre- 130The Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service published proposed and temporary regulations as part of the joint rulemaking of the Moral IFC. The Departments of Labor and HHS published their respective rules as interim nal rules with request for comments and are nalizing their interim nal rules in these nal rules . The Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service are nalizing their those submissions included form letters or attachments that, while not separately tabulated at regulations.gov, together included comments from, or were signed by, possibly over a hundred thousand separate pe rsons. The Departments reviewed all of the public comments and attachments. 132See, for example , Family Planning grants in 42 U.S.C. 300, et seq. ; the Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Program, Public Law 112-74 (125 Stat 786, 1080); the Healthy Start Program, 42 U.S.C. 254c-8; the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, 42 U.S.C. 711; Maternal and Child Health Block Grants, 42 U.S.C. 70 3; 42 U.S.C. 247b-12; Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq. ; the Indian Health Service, 25 U.S.C. 13, 42 U.S.C. 2001(a), & 25 U.S.C. 1601, et seq. ; Health center grants, 42 U.S.C. 254b(e), (g), (h), & (i); the NIH Clinical Center, 42 U.S.C. 248; and the Personal Responsibility Education Program, 42 U.S.C. 713. 133See As (usage 2), Oxford English Dictionary Online (Feb. 2018) (\"[u]sed to indicate by comparison the way something happens or is done\"). December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 918vention plan services.\") (emphasis added). Thus, the inclusion of \"as\" in section300gg-13(a)(3), and its absence in similarneighboring provisions, shows that HRSAhas discretion whether to support how thepreventive coverage mandate applies\u2014itdoes not refer to the timing of the prom-ulgation of the Guidelines. Nor is it simply a textual aberration that the word \"as\" is missing from theother three provisions in section 2713(a)of the PHS Act. Rather, this differencemirrors other distinctions within that sec-tion that demonstrate that Congress in-tended HRSA to have the discretion theAgencies invoke. For example, sections(a)(1) and (a)(3) require \"evidence-based\"or \"evidence-informed\" coverage, while section (a)(4) does not. This differencesuggests that the Agencies have the lee-way to incorporate policy-based con-cerns into their decision-making. Thisreading of section 2713(a)(4) also pre-vents the statute from being interpretedin a cramped way that allows no flexi- bility or tailoring, and that would forcethe Departments to choose between ig-noring religious objections in violationof RFRA or else eliminating the contra-ceptive coverage requirement from theGuidelines altogether. The Departmentsinstead interpret section 2713(a)(4) asauthorizing HRSA's Guidelines to setforth both the kinds of items and ser-vices that will be covered, and the scopeof entities to which the contraceptivecoverage requirement in those Guide-lines will apply. The moral objections at issue here, like the religious objections prompting exemp-tions dating back to the inception of theMandate in 2011, may, consistent with thestatutory provision, permissibly informwhat HHS, through HRSA, decides toprovide for and support in the Guidelines.Since the rst rulemaking on this subjectin 2011, the Departments have consis-tently interpreted the broad discretiongranted to HRSA in section 2713(a)(4) asincluding the power to reconcile the ACA's preventive-services requirement with sin-cerely held views of conscience on the sensi-tive subject of contraceptive coverage\u2014namely, by exempting churches and theirintegrated from the contraceptive-coverage Mandate. ( See76 FR at 46623.) As the Departments explained at that time, theHRSA Guidelines \"exist solely to bind non- grandfathered group health plans and healthinsurance issuers with respect to the extent oftheir coverage of certain preventive servicesfor women,\" and \"it is appropriate that HRSA. . . takes into account the effect on the reli-gious beliefs of [employers] if coverage ofcontraceptive services were required in [their]group health plans.\" Id.Consistent with that longstanding view, Congress's grant of discre-tion in section 2713(a)(4), and the lack of amandate that contraceptives be covered or thatthey be covered without any exemptions orexceptions, lead the Departments to concludethat we are legally authorized to exempt cer-tain entities or plans from a contraceptiveMandate if HRSA decides to otherwise in-clude contraceptives in its Guidelines. The Departments' conclusions are con- sistent with our interpretation of section2713 of the PHS Act since 2010, when theACA was enacted, and since the Depart-ments started to issue interim nal regu-lations implementing that section. TheDepartments have consistently interpreted section 2713(a)(4) to grant broad discre-tion to decide the extent to which HRSAwill provide for, and support, the coverageof additional women's preventive careand screenings, including the decision toexempt certain entities and plans, and notto provide for or support the application ofthe Guidelines with respect to those enti-ties or plans. The Departments created anexemption to the contraceptive Mandatewhen that Mandate was announced in2011, and then amended and expanded theexemption and added an accommodationprocess in multiple rulemakings thereaf-ter. The accommodation process requiresthe provision of coverage or payments forcontraceptives to plan participants in aneligible organization's health plan by theorganization's insurer or third party ad-ministrator. However, the accommodationprocess itself, in some cases, failed torequire contraceptive coverage for manywomen, because\u2014as the Departments ac-knowledged at the time\u2014the enforcementmechanism for that process, section 3(16)of ERISA, does not provide a means toimpose an obligation to provide contra-ceptive coverage on the third party admin-istrator of self-insured church plans (see80 FR 41323). Non-exempt employersparticipate in many church plans. There-fore, the previous exemption, andin the previous accommodation's applica- tion to self-insured church plans, the De-partments have been choosing not to re-quire contraceptive coverage for certainkinds of employers since the Guidelineswere adopted. In doing so, the Depart-ments have been acting contrary to com-menters who contended the Departmentshad no authority to create exemptions un-der section 2713 of the PHS Act, or itsincorporation into ERISA and the Code,and who contended instead that the De-partments must enforce Guidelines on thebroadest spectrum of group health plansas possible, even including churches (see,for example, 2012 nal regulations at 77FR 8726). The Departments' interpretation of section 2713(a)(4) is conrmed by theACA's statutory structure. Congress didnot intend to require entirely uniform cov-erage of preventive services (see for ex-ample, 76 FR 46623). On the contrary,Congress carved out an exemption fromsection 2713 of the PHS Act (and fromseveral other provisions) for grandfa-thered plans. In contrast, the grandfather-ing exemption is not applicable to manyof the other provisions in Title I of theACA\u2014provisions previously referred toby the Departments as providing \"partic-ularly signicant protections.\" (75 FR34540). Those provisions include (fromthe section 2704, which prohib-its preexisting condition exclusions orother discrimination based on health sta-tus in group health coverage; section2708, which prohibits excessive waitingperiods (as of January 1, 2014); section2711, which relates to lifetime dollar lim-its; section 2712, which generally prohib-its rescission of health coverage; section2714, which extends dependent child cov-erage until the child turns 26; and section2718, which imposes a minimum medicalloss ratio on health insurance issuers inthe individual and group markets (for in-sured coverage), and requires them to pro-vide rebates to policyholders if that med-ical loss ratio is not met. (75 FR 34538,34540, 34542). Consequently, of the 150million nonelderly people employer-sponsored health cover-age, approximately 25.5 million are esti-mated to be enrolled in grandfathered Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 919plans not subject to section 2713.134Some commenters assert the exemptions forgrandfathered plans are temporary, orwere intended to be temporary, but as theSupreme Court observed, \"there is no le-gal requirement that grandfathered plansever be phased out.\" Burwell v. 134 S. 2764 reference to imple-menting the ACA consistent with certainconscience laws does not justify creatingexemptions to contraceptive coverage inthe Guidelines, because those laws do notspecically require exemptions in theGuidelines. The Departments, however, believe that they are acting consistent withExecutive Order 13535 by creating ex-emptions using HRSA's authority undersection 2713(a)(4), and the Departments'administrative authority over the imple-mentation of section 2713(a) of the PHSAct. Executive Order 13535, issued uponthe signing of the ACA, specied that\"longstanding Federal laws to protect con-scienc e... remain intact,\" including laws that protect holders of religious beliefs ormoral convictions from certain require-ments in health care contexts. Althoughthe text of Executive Order 13535 doesnot require the expanded exemptions con-rmed in these nal rules, the expandedexemptions are, as explained below, con-sistent with longstanding federal laws toprotect conscience objections, based onreligious beliefs or moral convictions re-garding certain health matters, and areconsistent with the intent that the ACA beimplemented in accordance with the con-science protections set forth in those laws. Some commenters contended that, even though Executive Order 13535 refersto the Church Amendments, the intentionof those statutes is narrow, should not beconstrued to extend to entities instead ofto individuals, and should not be con-strued to prohibit procedures. But thosecomments mistake the Departments' posi-tion. The Departments are not construingthe Church Amendments to require theseexemptions, nor do the exemptions pro-hibit any procedures. Instead, through longstanding federal conscience statutes,Congress has established consistent prin-ciples concerning respect for sincerelyheld moral convictions in sensitive health-care contexts. 135Under those principles, and absent any contrary requirement oflaw, the Departments are offering exemp-tions for sincerely held moral convictionsto the extent the Departments otherwiseimpose a contraceptive Mandate. Theseexemptions do not prohibit any services,nor authorize employers to prohibit em-ployees from obtaining any services. Theexemptions in the Moral IFC and thesenal rules simply refrain from imposing afederal mandate that employers covercontraceptives in their health plans even ifthey have sincerely held moral convic-tions against doing so. Some commenters stated that the Su- preme Court ruled that the exemptionsprovided for houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries were required by theFirst Amendment. From this, commentersconcluded that the exemptions for housesof worship and integrated auxiliaries arelegally authorized, but that exemptionsbeyond those are not. But the SupremeCourt did not rule on the question whetherthe exemptions provided for houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries wererequired by the First Amendment, and theCourt did not say the Departments mustapply the contraceptive Mandate unlessRFRA prohibits us from doing so. The appropriateness of including ex- emptions to protect moral convictions isinformed by Congress's long history ofproviding exemptions for moral convic-tions, especially in certain health care con-texts. 2. Congress's History of Protecting Moral Convictions The Department received numerous comments about its decision in the MoralIFC to exercise its discretion to providemoral exemptions to, and an accommoda-tion under, the contraceptive Mandate.Some commenters agreed with the De-partments' decision in the Moral IFC, ar- guing that it is appropriate to exercise theDepartments' discretion to protect moralconvictions in light of Congress's historyof protecting moral convictions in variouscontexts, especially concerning healthcare. Other commenters disagreed, sayingthat existing conscience statutes protect-ing moral convictions do not require theseexemptions and, therefore, the exemptionsshould not be offered. Some commentersstated that because Congress has providedconscience protections, but did not specif-ically provide them in section 2713(a)(4),conscience protections are inappropriatein the implementation of that section. Stillother commenters went further, disagree- ing with conscience protections regardingcontraceptives, abortions, or health care ingeneral. In deciding the most appropriate way to exercise our discretion in this context,the Departments draw on the most recentstatements of Congress, along with nearly50 years of statutes and Supreme Courtprecedent discussing the protection ofmoral convictions in certain circumstanc-es\u2014particularly in the context of healthcare and health coverage. Most recently,Congress expressed its intent on the mat-ter of Government-mandated contracep-tive coverage when it declared, with re-spect to the possibility that the District ofColumbia would require contraceptivecoverage, that \"it is the intent of Congressthat any legislation enacted on such issueshould include a 'conscience clause'which provides exceptions for religiousbeliefs convictions.\" Consoli-dated 2018, 115-141, 132Stat. 348, 603 (Mar. 23, 2018); see also Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017,Div. C, section 808, Pub. L. 115-31 (May5, 2017). The Departments consider it signif- icant that Congress's most recent statementson the prospect of Government-mandatedcontraceptive coverage specically intend thata conscience clause be included to protectmoral convictions. The Departments also consider signif- icant the many statutes listed above, in 134Kaiser Family Foundation & Health Research & Educational Trust, \"Employer Health Benets, 2017 Annual Survey,\" Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (Se pt. 19, 2017), http://les.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benets-Annual-Survey-2017. 135The Departments note that the Church Amendments are the subject of another, ongoing rulemaking process. SeeProtecting Statutory Conscience Rights in Health Care; Delegations of Authority, 83 FR 3880 (NPRM Jan. 26, 2018). Since the Departments are not construing the Amendments to require the religious exemptions, we defer issu es regarding the scope, interpretation, and protections of the Amendments to HHS in that rulemaking. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 920section I-Background footnote 1, that show Congress's consistent protection ofmoral convictions alongside religious be-liefs in the federal regulation of healthcare. These include laws such as theChurch Amendments (dating back to1973), which we discuss at length below,to the 2018 Consolidated AppropriationsAct discussed above. Notably amongthose laws, and in addition to the ChurchAmendments, Congress has enacted pro-tections for health plans or health careorganizations in Medicaid or MedicareAdvantage to object \"on moral or reli-gious grounds\" to providing coverage ofcertain counseling or referral services. 42U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) (protectingagainst forced counseling or referrals inMedicare /H11001Choice (now Medicare Ad- vantage) managed care plans with respectto objections based on \"moral or religiousgrounds\"); 42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(b)(3) (pro-tecting against forced counseling or refer-rals in Medicaid managed care plans withrespect to objections based on \"moral or religious grounds\"). Congress has alsoprotected individuals who object to pre-scribing or providing contraceptives con-trary to their \"religious beliefs or moralconvictions.\" Consolidated Appropria-tions Act, 2018, Pub. L. 115-141, Divi-sion E, section 726(c); see also Consoli- dated Appropriations Act of 2017,Division C, Title VII, Sec. 726(c) (Finan-cial Services and General GovernmentAppropriations Act), Pub. L. No. 115-31. 136 The Departments disagree with com- menters that suggested we should not con-sider Congress's history of protectingmoral objections in certain health carecontexts due to Congress's failure to ex-plicitly include exemptions in section2713(a)(4) itself. The argument by thesecommenters proves too much, since Con-gress also did not specically require con-traceptive coverage in section 2713 of thePHS Act. This argument would also ne-gate not just these expanded exemptions,but the previous exemptions provided forhouses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries, and the indirect exemption for self-insured church plans that use the accom-modation. Where Congress left so many matters concerning section 2713(a)(4) toagency discretion, the Departments con-sider it appropriate to implement theseexpanded exemptions in light of Con-gress's long history of respecting moralconvictions in the context of certain fed-eral health care requirements. a. The Church Amendments' Protection of Moral Convictions One of the most important and well- established federal statutes respectingconscientious objections in specic healthcare contexts was enacted over the courseof several years beginning in 1973, ini-tially as a response to court decisions rais-ing the prospect that entities or individualsmight be required to facilitate abortions orsterilizations because they had receivedfederal funds. These sections of the U.S.Code are known as the Church Amend-ments, named after their primary sponsor,Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho). TheChurch Amendments specically provideconscience protections based on sincerelyheld moral convictions, not just religiousbeliefs. Among other things, the amend-ments protect the recipients of certain fed-eral health funds from being required toperform, assist, or make their facilitiesavailable for abortions or sterilizations ifthey object \"on the basis of religious be-liefs or moral convictions,\" and they pro-hibit recipients of certain federal healthfunds from discriminating against anypersonnel \"because he refused to performor assist in the performance of such aprocedure or abortion on the grounds thathis performance or assistance in the per-formance of the procedure or abortionwould be contrary to his religious beliefsor moral convictions\" (42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b), (c)(1)). Later additions to the ChurchAmendments protect other conscientiousobjections, including some objections onthe basis of moral conviction to \"any law-ful health service,\" or to \"any part of program.\" (42 U.S.C.300a-7(c)(2), (d)). In contexts covered bythose sections of the Church Amend-ments, the provision or coverage of cer-tain contraceptives, depending on the cir-cumstances, could constitute \"any lawful health service\" or a \"part of a health ser-vice program.\" As such, the protectionsprovided by those provisions of theChurch Amendments would encompassmoral objections to contraceptive servicesor coverage. The Church Amendments were en- acted in the wake of the Supreme Court'sdecision in Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Although the Court in Roe re- quired abortion to be legal in certain cir-cumstances, Roe did not include, within that right, the requirement that other citi-zens facilitate its exercise. Indeed, Roe favorably quoted the proceedings of theAmerican Medical Association House ofDelegates 220 (June 1970), which de-clared, \"Neither physician, hospital, norhospital personnel shall be required toperform any act violative of personally-held moral principles.\" 410 U.S. at 144 &n.38 (1973). Likewise, in Roe's compan- ion case, Doe v. Bolton , the Court ob- served that, under state law, \"a physician or any other employee has the right torefrain, for moral or religious reasons,from participating in the abortion proce-dure.\" 410 U.S. 179, 197-98 (1973). TheCourt said that these conscience provi-sions \"obviousl y... afford appropriate protection.\" Id.at 198. As an Arizona court later put it, \"a woman's right to anabortion or to contraception does not com-pel a private person or entity to facilitateeither.\" Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass'n of &Gynecologists , 257 P.3d 181, 196 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2011). The Congressional Record contains discussions that occurred when the protec-tion for moral convictions was rst pro-posed in the Church Amendments. WhenSenator Church introduced the rst ofthose amendments in 1973, he cited notonly Roe v. Wade, but also an instance where a federal court had ordered a Cath-olic hospital to perform sterilizations. 119Congr. Rec. S5717-18 (Mar. 27, 1973).After his opening remarks, Senator AdlaiStevenson III (D-IL) rose to ask that theamendment be changed to specify that italso protects objections to abortion and 136The Departments also note that, in protecting those individual and institutional health care entities that object to certain abortion-related serv ices and activities regardless of the basis for such objection, the Coats-Snowe Amendment, PHS Act section 245 (42 U.S.C. 238n), and the Weldon Amendment, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, D iv. H, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-141, protect those whose objection is based on moral conviction. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 921sterilization based on moral convictions on the same terms as it protects objectionsbased on religious beliefs. The followingexcerpt of the Congressional Record re-cords this discussion: Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, rst of all I commend the Senator from Idahofor bringing this matter to the attention ofthe Senate. I ask the Senator a question. One need not be of the Catholic faith or any other religious faith to feel deeplyabout the worth of human life. The pro-tections afforded by this amendment runonly to those whose religious beliefswould be offended by the necessity ofperforming or participating in the perfor-mance of certain medical procedures; oth-ers, for moral reasons, not necessarily forany religious belief, can feel equally asstrong about human life. They too canrevere human life. As mortals, we cannot with condence say, when life begins. But whether it islife, or the potentiality of life, our moral convictions as well as our religious beliefs,warrant protection from this intrusion by theGovernment. Would, therefore, the Senatorinclude moral convictions? Would the Senator consider an amend- ment on page 2, line 18 which would addto religious beliefs, the words \"or moral\"? Mr. CHURCH. I would suggest to the Senator that perhaps his objective couldbe more clearly stated if the words \"ormoral conviction\" were added after \"reli-gious belief.\" I think that the SupremeCourt in considering the protection wegive religious beliefs has given compara-ble treatment to deeply held moral convic-tions. I would not be averse to amendingthe language of the amendment in such amanner. It is consistent with the generalpurpose. I see no reason why a deeplyheld moral conviction ought not be giventhe same treatment as a religious belief. Mr. STEVENSON. The Senator's sug- gestion is well taken. I thank him. 119 Congr. Rec. S5717-18.As the debate proceeded, Senator Church went on to quote Doe v. Bolton 's reliance on a Georgia statute that stated \"aphysician or any other employee has theright to refrain, for moral or religious rea-sons, from participating in the abortion pro-cedure.\" 119 Congr. Rec. S5722 (quoting 410 U.S. at 197-98). Senator Church added,\"I see no reason why the amendment oughtnot also to cover doctors and nurses whohave strong moral convictions against theseparticular operations.\" Id.Considering the scope of the protections, Senator GaylordNelson (D-WI) asked whether, \"if a hospitalboard, or whatever the ruling agency for thehospital was, a governing agency or other-wise, just capriciously\u2014and not upon thereligious or moral questions at all\u2014simplysaid, 'We are not going to bother with thiskind of procedure in this hospital,' wouldthe pending amendment permit that?\" 119Congr. Rec. S5723. Senator Church re-sponded that the amendment would not en-compass such an objection. Id. Senator James L. Buckley (C-NY), speaking in support of the amendment,added the following perspective: Mr. BUCKLEY. Mr. President, I com- pliment the Senator from Idaho for pro-posing this most important and timelyamendment. It is timely in the rst in-stance because the attempt has alreadybeen made to compel the performance ofabortion and sterilization operations onthe part of those who are fundamentally opposed to such procedures. And it istimely also because the recent SupremeCourt decisions will likely unleash a se-ries of court actions across the UnitedStates to try to impose the personal pref-erences of the majority of the SupremeCourt on the totality of the Nation. I believe it is ironic that we should have this debate at all. Who would havepredicted a year or two ago that we wouldhave to guard against even the possibilitythat someone might be free [sic] 137to participate in an abortion or sterilizationagainst his will? Such an idea is repugnantto our political tradition. This is a Nationwhich has always been concerned with theright of conscience. It is the right of con-science which is protected in our draftlaws. It is the right of conscience whichthe Supreme Court has quite properly ex-panded not only to embrace those youngmen who, because of the tenets of a par-ticular faith, believe they cannot kill an-other man, but also those who because oftheir own deepest moral convictions are so persuaded. I am delighted that the Senator from Idaho has amended his language to in-clude the words \"moral conviction,\" be-cause, of course, we know that this is nota matter of concern to any one religiousbody to the exclusion of all others, or evento men who believe in a God to the ex-clusion of all others. It has been a tradi-tional concept in our society from the ear-liest times that the right of conscience,like the paramount right to life fromwhich it is derived, is sacred. 119 Congr. Rec. S5723.In support of the same protections when they were debated in the U.S.House, Representative Margaret Heckler(R-MA) 138likewise observed that \"the right of conscience has long been recog- nized in the parallel situation in which theindividual's right to conscientious objec-tor status in our selective service systemhas been protected\" and \"expanded by theSupreme Court to include moral convic-tion as well as formal religious belief.\"119 Congr. Rec. H4148-49 (May 31,1973). Rep. Heckler added, \"We are con-cerned here only with the right of moralconscience, which has always been a partof our national tradition.\" Id.at 4149. These rst sections of the Church Amendments, codied at 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b) and (c)(1), passed the House 372-1,and were approved by the Senate 94-0.119 Congr. Rec. at H4149; 119 Congr.Rec. S10405 (June 5, 1973). The subse-quently adopted provisions that comprisethe Church Amendments similarly extendprotection to those organizations and in-dividuals who object to the provision ofcertain services on the basis of their moralconvictions, as well as those who object tosuch services on the basis of religiousbeliefs. And, as noted above, subsequentstatutes add protections for moral objec-tions in many other situations. These in-clude, for example: Protections for individuals and entities that object to abortion. See42 U.S.C. 238n; 42 U.S.C. 18023; \"[forced ]... against his will.\" 138Rep. Heckler later served as the 15th Secretary of HHS, from March 1983 to December 1985. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 922tions Act, 2018, Div. H, Sec. 507(d), Pub. L. No. 115-141. Protections for entities and individuals that object to providing or coveringcontraceptives. Seeid. at Div. Act); id.at Div. K, Ti- tle III. Protections for entities and individuals that object to performing, assisting,counseling, or referring as pertains tosuicide, assisted suicide, of the ACA). The Departments believe that the intentbehind Congress's protection of moralconvictions in certain health care contexts,especially to protect entities and individ-uals from governmental coercion, sup-ports the Departments' decision in theMoral IFC and these nal rules to protectsincerely held moral convictions fromgovernmental compulsion threatened bythe contraceptive Mandate. b. Court Precedents Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions As reflected in the legislative history of the rst Church Amendments, the Su-preme Court has long afforded protectionto moral convictions alongside religiousbeliefs. Indeed, Senator Church cited Doe v. Bolton , 410 U.S. 179, as a parallel in- stance of conscience protection and spokeof the Supreme Court generally giving\"comparable treatment to deeply heldmoral Both Senator Buckleyand specically cited theSupreme protection of moral con-victions in laws governing military ser-vice. Those legislators appear to havebeen referencing cases such as Welsh v. United States , 398 U.S. 333 (1970), whichthe Supreme Court had decided just three years earlier. Welsh involved what is perhaps the Government's paradigmatic compellinginterest\u2014the need to defend the nation bymilitary force. The Court stated that,where the Government protects objectionsto military service based on \"religioustraining and belief,\" that protection wouldalso extend to avowedly non-religious ob-jections to war held with the same moralstrength. Id.at 343. The Court declared, \"[i]f an individual deeply and sincerelyholds beliefs that are purely ethical ormoral in source and content but that nev- ertheless impose upon him a duty of con-science to refrain from participating inany war at any time, those beliefs cer-tainly occupy in the life of that individual'a place parallel to that lled b y... God' in traditionally religious persons. Becausehis beliefs function as a religion in his life,such an individual is as much entitled to a'religious' conscientious objector exemp-t i o n...a si s someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from tra-ditional religious convictions.\" In the context of this particular Man- date, it is also worth noting that, in Hobby Lobby , Justice Ginsburg (joined, in this part of the opinion, by Justices Breyer,Kagan, and Sotomayor), cited Justice Har-lan's opinion in Welsh , 398 U.S. at 357- 58, in support of her statement that \"[s]ep-arating moral convictions from religiousbeliefs would be of questionable legiti-macy.\" 134 S. Ct. at 2789 n.6. In quotingthis passage, the Departments do not meanto suggest that all laws protecting onlyreligious beliefs constitute an illegitimate\"separat[ion]\" of moral convictions, nordo the Departments assert that moral con-victions must always be protected along-side religious beliefs; we also do not agreewith Justice Harlan that distinguishing be-tween religious and moral objectionswould violate the Establishment Clause.Instead, the Departments believe that, inthe specic health care context implicated here, providing respect for moral convic-tions parallel to the respect afforded toreligious beliefs is appropriate, drawsfrom long-standing Federal Governmentpractice, and shares common ground withCongress's intent in the Church Amend-ments and in later federal statutes thatprovide protections for moral convictionsalongside religious beliefs in other healthcare contexts. c. Conscience Protections in Other Federal and State Contexts The tradition of protecting moral con- victions in certain health contexts is notlimited to laws passed by Congress. Mul-tiple federal regulations protect objectionsbased on moral convictions in such con-texts. 139Other federal regulations have also applied the principle of respectingmoral convictions alongside religious be-liefs in particular circumstances. TheEqual Employment Opportunity Commis-sion has consistently protected \"moral orethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with thestrength of traditional religious views\"alongside religious views under the\"standard [] developed in United States v. Seeger , 380 U.S. 163 (1965) and [Welsh ].\" 29 CFR 1605.1. The Depart- ment of Justice has declared that, incases of capital punishment, no ofceror employee may be required to attendor participate if doing so \"is contrary tothe moral or religious convictions of theofcer or employee, or if the employeeis a medical professional who considerssuch participation or attendance con-trary to medical ethics.\" 28 CFR26.5. 140 Forty-ve states have health care con- science protections covering objections toabortion; several of these also cover ster- ilization or contraception. 141Most of those state laws protect objections based 139See, for example , 42 CFR 422.206 (declaring that the general Medicare Advantage rule \"does not require the MA plan to cover, furnish, or pay for a particular counseling or referral service if the MA organization that offers the plan\u2014(1) Objects to the provision of that service on moral or religious grounds.\"); 42 CFR 438.102 (declaring th at information requirements do not apply \"if the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP objects to the service on moral or religious grounds\"); 48 CFR 1609.7001 (\"health plan sponsoring organizations are no t required to discuss treatment options that they would not ordinarily discuss in their customary course of practice because such options are inconsistent with their professional j udgment or ethical, moral or religious beliefs.\"); 48 CFR 352.270-9 (\"Non-Discrimination for Conscience\" clause for organizations receiving HIV or Malaria relief funds). 140See also 18 CFR 214.11 (where a law enforcement agency (LEA) seeks assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafcking of persons, the reasonablenes s of the LEA's request will depend in part on \"[c]ultural, religious, or moral objections to the request\"). 141According to the Guttmacher Institute, 45 states have conscience statutes pertaining to abortion (43 of which cover institutions), 18 have conscien ce statutes pertaining to sterilization (16 of which cover institutions), and 12 have conscience statutes pertaining to contraception (8 of which cover institutions). \"Refusing to Provide Health Services,\" The Guttmacher Institute (June 1, 2017), https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing-provide-health-services. Bulletin 2018 923on or \"conscien- tious\" grounds in addition to \"religious\"grounds. Particularly in the case of abor-tion, some federal and state consciencelaws do not require any specied motivefor the objection. 42 U.S.C. 238n; Con-solidated Appropriations, 2018, Pub. L.115-141, Div. H, section 507(d). These various statutes and regulations reflect an important governmental interestin protecting moral convictions in appro-priate health contexts. The contraceptiveMandate implicates that governmental in-terest. Many persons and entities object tothe Mandate in part because they considersome forms of FDA-approved contracep-tives to be morally equivalent to abortiondue to the possibility that such items mayprevent the implantation of a human em-bryo after fertilization. 142The Supreme Court, in describing family business own-ers with religious objections, explainedthat \"[t]he owners of the businesses havereligious objections to abortion, and ac-cording to their religious beliefs the fourcontraceptive methods at issue are aborti-facients. If the owners comply with theHHS mandate, they believe they will befacilitating abortions.\" Hobby Lobby , 134 S. Ct. at 2751. Based on pleadings in thelitigation, all of the litigants challengingthe Mandate and asserting purely non-religious objections share this view. Andas Congress has implicitly recognized inproviding health care conscience protec-tions pertaining to sterilization, contracep-tion, and other health care services andpractices, individuals or entities may haveadditional moral objections to contracep-tion. 143 d. Founding Principles The Departments also look to guidance from, and draw support for the Moral IFCand these nal rules from, the broaderhistory of respect for conscience in the laws and founding principles of theUnited States. Members of Congress spe-cically relied on the American traditionof respect for conscience when they de-cided to protect moral convictions inhealth care. In supporting the protection ofconscience based on non-religious moralconvictions, Senator Buckley declared\"[i]t has been a traditional concept in oursociety from the earliest times that theright of conscience, like the paramountright to life from which it is derived, issacred.\" Representative Heckler similarlystated that \"the right of moral conscience. . . has always been a part of our nationaltradition.\" This tradition is reflected, forexample, in a letter President GeorgeWashington wrote saying that \"he Citi-zens of the United States of America havea right to applaud themselves for havinggiven to mankind examples of an enlargedand liberal policy: a policy worthy of im-itation. All possess alike liberty of con-science and immunities of citizenship.\" 144 Thomas Jefferson similarly declared that\"[n]o provision in our Constitution oughtto be dearer to man than that which pro-tects the rights of conscience against theenterprises of the civil authority.\" 145Al- though these statements by PresidentsWashington and Jefferson were spoken toreligious congregations, and although re-ligious and moral conscience were tightlyintertwined for the Founders, they bothreflect a broad principle of respect forconscience against government coercion.James Madison likewise called con-science \"the most sacred of all property,\"and proposed that the Bill of Rightsshould guarantee, in addition to protectingreligious belief and worship, that \"the fulland equal rights of conscience [shall not]be in any manner, or on any pretext in-fringed.\" 146These Founding Era statements of gen- eral principle do not specify how theywould be applied in a particular healthcare context, and the Departments do notsuggest that the specic protections of-fered in the Moral IFC and these nalrules would be required or necessarily ap-propriate in any other context that doesnot raise the specic concerns implicatedby this Mandate. These nal rules do notaddress in any way how the Governmentwould balance its interests with respect toother health services not encompassed bythe contraceptive Mandate. 147Instead, the Departments highlight this tradition of re-spect for conscience from the Nation'sFounding Era to provide background sup-port for the Departments' decision to im-plement section 2713(a)(4), while protect-ing conscience in the exercise of moralconvictions. The Departments believe thatthese nal rules are consistent both withthe American tradition of respect for con-science and with Congress's history ofproviding conscience protections in thekinds of health care matters involved inthis Mandate. e. Executive Orders Relevant to These Expanded Exemptions Protecting moral convictions, as set forth in these expanded exemptions andaccommodation in these nal rules, isconsistent with recent executive orders.President Trump's Executive Order con-cerning this Mandate directed the Depart-ments consider providing protections,not specically for \"religious\" beliefs, butfor \"conscience.\" We interpret that term toinclude both religious beliefs and moralconvictions. Moreover, President Trump'srst Executive Order, EO 13765, declaredthat \"the Secretary of Health and HumanServices (Secretary) and the heads of allother executive departments and agencies 142FDA, \"Birth Control,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Mar. 6, 2018), https://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublicati ons/ucm313215.htm (various approved contraceptives, including Levonorgestrel, Ulipristal Acetate, and IUDs, work mainly by preventing fertilization, but \"may also wor k...b y preventing attachment (implantation) to the womb (uterus)\" of a human embryo after fertilization). 143See supra note 1. 144Letter from George Washington to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island (Aug. 18, 1790) (available at https://founders.archives.gov/do cuments/Washington/05-06-02- 0135). 145Letter to the Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church at New London, Connecticut (February 4, 1809) (available at https://founders.archives.gov /documents/Jefferson/99-01-02-9714). 146James Madison, \"Essay on Property\" (March 29, 1792); First draft of the First Amendment, 1 Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789). 147As the Supreme Court stated in Hobby Lobby , the Court's decision concerns only the contraceptive Mandate, and should not be understood to hold that all insurance-coverage mandates, for example, for vaccinations or blood transfusions, must necessarily fail if they conflict with an employer's religious beliefs. Nor does the Court' s opinion provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious (or moral) practice. 134 S. Ct. at 2783. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 924(agencies) with authorities and responsi- bilities under the [ACA] shall exercise allauthority and discretion available to themto waive, defer, grant exemptions from, ordelay the implementation of any provisionor requirement of the Act that would im-pose a scal burden on any state or a cost,fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden onindividuals, families, healthcare provid-ers, health insurers, patients, recipients ofhealthcare services, purchasers of healthinsurance, or makers of medical devices,products, or medications.\" The exemptionand accommodation adopted in these nalrules relieves a regulatory burden imposedon entities with moral convictions op-posed to providing certain contraceptivecoverage and is therefore consistent withboth Executive Orders. f. Litigation Concerning the Mandate The Departments have further taken into consideration the litigation surround-ing the Mandate in exercising their discre-tion to adopt the exemption in these nalrules. Among the lawsuits challenging theMandate, two have been led based inpart on non-religious moral convictions.In one case, the Departments are subjectto a permanent injunction requiring us torespect the non-religious moral objectionsof an employer. See March for Life v. Burwell , 128 F. Supp. 3d 116 (D.D.C. 2015). In the other case, an appeals courtafrmed a district court ruling that allowsthe previous regulations to be imposed ina way that affects the moral convictions ofa small nonprot pro-life organization andits employees. See Real Alternatives v. Sec'y, Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , 867 F.3d 338 (3d Cir. 2017). The Depart-ments' litigation of these cases has thusled to inconsistent court rulings, con-sumed substantial governmental re-sources, and created uncertainty for ob-jecting organizations, issuers, third partyadministrators, and employees and bene-ciaries. The organizations that have suedseeking a moral exemption have adoptedlongstanding moral tenets opposed to cer-tain FDA-approved contraceptives, andhire only employees who share this view.As a result, it is reasonable to concludethat employees of these organizationswould not benet from the Mandate.Thus, subjecting this subset of organiza-tions to the Mandate does not advance any governmental interest. The need to resolvethis litigation and the potential concernsof similar entities, as well as the legalrequirement to comply with permanent in-junctive relief currently imposed in March for Life , provide substantial reasons for the Departments to protect moral convic-tions through these nal rules. Although,as discussed below, the Departments as-sume the number of entities and individ-uals that may seek exemption from theMandate on the basis of moral convic-tions, as these two sets of litigants did,will be small, the Departments know fromthe litigation that it will not be zero. As aresult, the Departments have taken thesetypes of objections into consideration inreviewing our regulations. Having doneso, the Departments consider it appropri-ate to issue the protections set forth inthese nal rules. Just as Congress, inadopting the early provisions of theChurch Amendments, viewed it as neces-sary and appropriate to protect those or- ganizations and individuals with objec-tions to certain health care services on thebasis of moral convictions, so the Depart-ments, too, believe that \"our moral con-victions as well as our religious beliefs,warrant protection from this intrusion bythe Government\" in this situation. See119 Congr. Rec. S5717-18. The litigation concerning the Mandate has also underscored how important it isfor the Government to tread carefullywhen engaging in regulation concerningsensitive health care areas. As demon-strated by the litigation, as well as thepublic comments, various citizens sin-cerely hold moral convictions, which arenot necessarily religious, against provid-ing or participating in coverage of contra-ceptive items included in the Mandate,and some believe that certain contracep-tive items may cause early abortions. Pro-viding conscience protections advancesthe ACA's goal of expanding health cov-erage among entities and individuals thatmight otherwise be reluctant to participatein the market. For example, the SupremeCourt in Hobby Lobby declared that, if HHS requires owners of businesses tocover procedures that the owners \"couldnot in good conscience\" cover, such asabortion, \"HHS would effectively excludethese people from full participation in theeconomic life of the Nation.\" 134 S. Ct. at 2783. That sort of outcome is one theDepartments wish to avoid. The Depart-ments wish to implement the contracep-tive coverage Guidelines issued undersection 2713(a)(4) in a way that respectsthe moral convictions of Americans sothat they are freer to engage in \"fullparticipation in the economic life of theNation.\" The exemptions in these nalrules do so by removing an obstacle thatmight otherwise lead entities or individu-als with moral objections to contraceptivecoverage to choose not to sponsor or par-ticipate in health plans if they includesuch coverage. 3. Whether Moral Exemptions Should Exist, and Whom They Should Cover As noted above, the Department re- ceived comments expressing diverseviews as to whether exemptions based onmoral convictions should exist and, if so,whom they should cover. Some commenters supported the ex- panded exemptions and accommodationin the Moral IFC, and the choice of enti-ties and individuals to which they applied.They stated the expanded exemptions andaccommodation would be an appropriateexercise of discretion and would be con-sistent with moral exemptions Congresshas provided in many similar contexts.Similarly, commenters stated that the ac-commodation would be an inadequatemeans to resolve moral objections andthat the expanded exemptions are needed.They contended that the accommodationprocess was objectionable because it wasanother method of complying with theMandate, its self-certication or notice in-volved triggering the very contraceptivecoverage that organizations objected to,and the coverage for contraceptive ser-vices \"hijacked\" or flowed in connectionwith the objecting organizations' healthplans. The commenters contended that theseamlessness cited by the Departmentsbetween contraceptive coverage and anaccommodated plan gives rise to moralobjections that organizations would nothave with an expanded exemption. Com-menters also stated that, with respect tonon-prot organizations that have moralobjections and only hire persons whoagree with those objections, the Mandate Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 925serves no legitimate government interest because the mandated coverage is neitherwanted nor used and, therefore, wouldyield no benets\u2014it would only suppressthe existence of non-prot organizationsholding those views. Several other commenters stated that the exemptions were still too narrow.They asked that the exemptions set forthin these nal rules be as broad as theexemptions set forth in the Religious IFCconcerning sincerely held religious be-liefs. Some of these commenters alsoasked that HHS withdraw its Mandate ofcontraceptive coverage from the Guide-lines entirely. They contended that fertil-ity and pregnancy are generally healthyconditions, not diseases that are appropri-ately the target of a preventive health ser-vice; that contraceptives can pose medicalrisks for women; and that studies do notshow that contraceptive programs reduceabortion rates or unintended pregnancies.Some commented that many women re-port that they sought an abortion becausetheir contraception failed. Some othercommenters contended that, to the extentthe Guidelines require coverage of certaindrugs and devices that may prevent im-plantation of an embryo after fertilization,they require coverage of items that areabortifacient and, therefore, violate fed-eral conscience protections such as theWeldon Amendment, Consolidated Ap-propriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. 115-31,Div. H, \u00a7 507(d). Other commenters contended that the exemptions in the Moral IFC were toobroad. Some of these commenters ex- pressed concern about the prospect ofpublicly traded for-prot entities also be-ing afforded a moral exemption. One suchcommenter commented that allowing pub-licly traded for-prot entities a moral ex-emption could cause instability and con-fusion, as leadership changes at such acorporation may effectively change thecorporation's eligibility for a moral ex-emption. Still others stated that the De-partments should not exempt variouskinds of entities such as businesses, issu-ers, or nonprot entities, arguing that onlyindividuals, not entities, can possessmoral convictions. Some commenterswere concerned that providing moral ex-emptions would contribute to population growth and related societal woes. Othercommenters contended the exemptionsand accommodation should not be ex-panded, but should remain the same asthey were in the July 2015 nal regula-tions (80 FR 41318), which did not en-compass moral convictions. Other com-menters stated that the Departmentsshould not provide exemptions, butmerely an accommodation process, to re-solve moral objections to the Mandate. Some commenters objected to provid- ing any exemption or accommodation formoral objections at all. Some of thesecommenters contended that even the pre-vious regulations allowing an exemptionand accommodation were too broad andthat no exemptions to the Mandate shouldexist, in order that contraceptive coveragewould be provided to as many women aspossible. Other commenters did not gothat far, but rejected the idea of exemp-tions or an accommodation based onmoral convictions, contending that suchexemptions or accommodation wouldcontribute to population growth and re-lated social woes. Some of these com-menters also contended that the exemp-tion in the Moral IFC would constitute anexemption covering every business andnon-prot organization. After considering these comments, and although the previous Administration de-clined to afford any exemption based onmoral convictions, the Departments haveconcluded that it is appropriate to providemoral exemptions and access to the ac-commodation, as set forth in these nal rules. Congress did not mandate contra-ceptive coverage, nor provide any explicitguidance about incorporating conscienceexemptions into the Guidelines. But asnoted above, it is a long-standing Con-gressional practice to provide consistentexemptions for both religious beliefs andmoral convictions in many federal statutesin the health care context, and specicallyconcerning issues such as abortion, steril-ization, and contraception. It is not clearto the Departments that, if Congress hadexpressly mandated contraceptive cover-age in the ACA, it would have done sowithout providing for similar exemptions.Therefore, the Departments consider it ap-propriate, to the extent we impose a con- traceptive Mandate by the exercise ofagency discretion, that we also include anexemption for the protection of moralconvictions in certain cases. The exemp-tions nalized in these nal rules are gen-erally consistent with the scope of exemp-tions that Congress has established insimilar contexts. As noted above, the De- partments consider the exemptions in thesenal rules consistent with the intent of Ex-ecutive Order 13535. The Departments alsowish to avoid the stark disparity that mayresult from respecting religious objectionsto providing contraceptive coverage amongcertain entities and individuals, but not re-specting parallel objections for moral con-victions possessed by any entities and indi-viduals at all because those objections arenot specically religious. In addition, the Departments note that a signicant majority of states either imposeno contraceptive coverage requirement oroffer broader exemptions than the exemp-tion contained in the July 2015 nal reg-ulations. 148Although the practice of states is by no means a limit on the discretiondelegated to HRSA by the ACA, nor astatement about what the Federal Govern-ment may do consistent with other limita-tions in federal law, such state practicescan inform the Departments' view that itis appropriate to provide conscience pro-tections when exercising agency discre-tion. The Departments decline to use these nal rules to remove the contraceptiveMandate altogether, such as by declaringthat HHS acting through HRSA shall not include contraceptives in the list of wom-en's preventive services in Guidelines is-sued under section 2713(a)(4). HRSA'sGuidelines were not issued, ratied, orupdated through the regulations that pre-ceded the Moral IFC and these nal rules.Those Guidelines were issued in separateprocesses in 2011 and 2016, directly byHRSA, after consultation with external or-ganizations that operated under coopera-tive agreements with HRSA to considerthe issue, solicit public comment, and pro-vide recommendations. The regulationspreceding these nal rules attempted onlyto restate the statutory language of section2713 in regulatory form, and delineate 148See\"Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives,\" The Guttmacher Institute (June 11, 2018), https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/insuran ce-coverage-contraceptives. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 926what exemptions and accommodations would apply if HRSA listed contracep-tives in its Guidelines. We decline to usethese nal rules to direct the separate pro-cess that HRSA uses to determine whatspecic services are listed in the Guide-lines generally. Some commenters statedthat if contraceptives are not removedfrom the Guidelines entirely, entities orindividuals with moral objections mightnot qualify for the exemptions or accom-modation. As discussed below, however,the exemptions in these rules include abroad range of entities and individuals ofwhom we have notice may object basedon moral convictions. The Departmentsare not aware of specic employers orindividuals whose moral convictionswould still be violated by compliance withthe Mandate after the issuance of theMoral IFC and these nal rules. Some commenters stated that HRSA should remove contraceptives from theGuidelines because the Guidelines havenot been subject to the notice and com-ment process under the AdministrativeProcedure Act. Some commenters alsocontended that the Guidelines should beamended to omit items that may prevent(or possibly dislodge) the implantation ofa human embryo after fertilization, in or-der to ensure consistency with conscienceprovisions that prohibit requiring plans topay for or cover abortions. Whether and towhat extent the Guidelines continue to listcontraceptives, or items considered to pre-vent implantation of an embryo, for enti-ties not subject to exemptions and an ac-commodation, and what process is used toinclude those items in the Guidelines, isoutside the scope of these nal rules.These nal rules focus on what moralexemptions and accommodation shall ap-ply if Guidelines issued under section2713(a)(4) include contraceptives or itemsconsidered to be abortifacient. Members of the public that support or oppose the inclusion of some or all con- traceptives in the Guidelines, or wish to comment concerning the content and processof developing and updating the Guidelines, arewelcome to communicate their views toHRSA, at wellwomancare@hrsa.gov.The Departments also conclude that it would be inadequate to merely attempt toamend or expand the accommodation pro-cess to account for moral objectors, in-stead of providing the exemptions. In thepast, the Departments stated in our regu-lations and court briefs that the previousaccommodation required contraceptivecoverage in a way that is \"seamless\" withthe coverage provided by the objectingemployer. As a result, in signicant re-spects, the accommodation process didnot actually accommodate the objectionsof many entities, as indicated by manyentities with religious objections. The De-partments have attempted to identify anaccommodation that would eliminate thereligious plaintiffs' objections, includingseeking public comment through a Re-quest For Information, 81 FR 47741 (July26, 2016), but stated in January 2017 thatwe were unable to develop such an ap-proach at that time. 149Just as the Depart- ments continue to believe merely amend-ing the accommodation process would notadequately address religious objections tocompliance with the Mandate, we do notbelieve doing so would adequately ad-dress similar moral objections. Further-more, the few litigants raising non-religious moral objections have been non-prot organizations that assert they onlyhire persons who share the employers'objection to contraceptive coverage. Con-sequently, the Departments conclude thatthe most appropriate approach to resolvethese concerns is to provide the exemp-tions set forth in the Moral IFC and thesenal rules. These nal rules also nalizethe modications to the accommodationprocess to make it available to entitieswith moral objections, without forcingsuch entities to choose between compli-ance with either the Mandate or the ac-commodation. Some commenters expressed concern over the lack of a denition of \"moralconvictions\" in the Moral IFC, arguingthat, without a denition, any objection could be encompassed by the exemptionseven if it is not based on moral convic-tions. The Departments did not adopt aregulatory denition of \"moral convic-tions\" in the Moral IFC, and have decided not to adopt such a denition in responseto public comments at this time. Never-theless, the Departments look to the de-scription of moral convictions in Welsh to help explain the scope of the protectionprovided in the Moral IFC and these nalrules. Neither these nal rules or theMoral IFC, nor the Church Amendmentsor other rules, we adopt thesame background understanding of thatterm that is reflected in the CongressionalRecord in 1973, in which legislators ref-erenced cases such as Welsh to support the addition of language protecting moralconvictions. In protecting moral convic-tions in parallel to religious beliefs, Welsh describes moral convictions warrantingsuch protection as ones: (1) that the \"in-dividual deeply and sincerely holds\"; (2)\"that are purely ethical or moral in sourceand content; (3) \"but that nevertheless im-pose upon him a duty\"; (4) and that \"cer-tainly occupy in the life of that individuala place parallel to that lled b y... God' in traditionally religious persons,\" suchthat one could say \"his beliefs function asa religion in his life.\" 398 U.S. at 339-40.As recited above, Senators Church andNelson agreed that protections for suchmoral convictions would not encompassan objection that an individual or entityraises \"capriciously.\" Instead, along withthe requirement that protected moral con-victions must be \"sincerely held,\" this un-derstanding cabins the protection of moralconvictions in contexts where they occupya place parallel to that lled by sincerelyheld religious beliefs in religious personsand organizations. While moral convictions are the sort of principles that, in the life of an individual,occupy a place parallel to religion, sin-cerely held moral convictions can also beadopted by corporate bodies, not merelyby individuals. Senators Church and Nel- son, while discussing the fact that oppo-sition to abortion or sterilization on thebasis of \"moral questions\" does not in-clude capricious opposition to abortion for 149SeeDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury, FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36, (Jan. https://ww w.dol.gov/sites/default/ les/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/aca-part-36.pdf and https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and- FAQs/Downloads/ACA-FAQs-Part36_1-9-17- Final.pdf (\"the by the Departments in response to the RFI indicate that no feasible approach has been identied at this time that wou ld resolve the concerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage\"). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 927no reason at all, were specically talking about opposition to abortion by corporateentities: a \"hospital board, or whatever theruling agency for the hospital was, a gov-erning agency or otherwise.\" 150Corporate bodies operate by the decision-making ac-tions of individuals. Thus, if individualsact in the governance of a corporate bodyso as to adopt a position for that body ofadopting moral convictions against cover-age of contraceptives, such an entity canbe considered to have an objection to con-traceptive coverage on the basis of sin-cerely held moral convictions. 4. The Departments' Rebalancing of Government Interests The Departments also received com- ments on their rebalancing of interests asexpressed and referenced in the MoralIFC. Some public commenters agreedwith the Departments' conclusion that ourinterest in ensuring contraceptive cover-age does not preclude the Departments from offering exemptions and an accommo-dation for entities, plans, and individualswith a qualifying objection to contraceptivecoverage based on moral convictions. Somepublic commenters pointed out that protect-ing moral convictions serves to respect notonly the interests of certain persons to ac-cess contraceptives, but also the interests ofother persons to participate in a health cov-erage market consistent with their moralconvictions. Other commenters disagreedwith this rebalancing, and contended thatthe interest of women in receiving contra-ceptive coverage without cost-sharing is sogreat that it overrides private interests to thecontrary, such that the government shouldor must force private entities to provide thiscoverage to other private citizens. The Departments agree with the com- menters who stated that the governmentalinterest in requiring contraceptive cover-age does not override the interest in pro-tecting moral convictions and does notmake these expanded exemptions inap-propriate. For additional discussion of theGovernment's balance of interests as ap-plicable to religious beliefs, see section II.C.2.b. of the companion nal rules con-cerning religious exemptions published bythe Departments contemporaneously withthese nal rules elsewhere in today's Fed- eral Register . There, and in the Religious and Moral IFCs, the Departments ac-knowledged the reasons why the Depart-ments have changed the policies and in-terpretations previously adopted withrespect to the Mandate and the govern-mental interests underlying it. For parallelreasons, the Departments believe the Gov-ernment's legitimate interests in providingfor contraceptive coverage do not requirethe Departments to violate sincerely heldmoral convictions while implementing theGuidelines. The Departments likewise be-lieve Congress did not set forth intereststhat require us to violate sincerely heldmoral convictions if we otherwise requirecontraceptive coverage in our discretion-ary implementation of the women's pre-ventive services Guidelines under section2713(a)(4). The Departments acknowledge that coverage of contraception is an importantand highly controversial issue, implicat-ing many different views, as reflected forexample in the public comments receivedon multiple rulemakings over the courseof implementation of section 2713(a)(4),added to the PHS Act in 2010. The De-partments' expansion of conscience pro-tections for moral convictions, similar toprotections contained in numerous stat-utes governing health care regulation, isnot taken lightly. However, after consid-ering public comments on various sides ofthe issue, and reconsidering the interestsserved by the Mandate in this particularcontext, the objections raised, and the rel-evant federal law, the Departments have determined that affording the exemptionsto protect moral convictions is a moreappropriate administrative response thancontinuing to refuse to extend the exemp-tions and accommodations to certain enti-ties and individuals for whom the Man-date violates their sincerely held moralconvictions. Although the number of or- ganizations and individuals that may seekto invoke these exemptions and accom-modation may be small, the Departmentsbelieve that it is important to provide suchprotection, given the long-standing recog-nition of such protections in law and reg-ulation in the health care and health insur-ance contexts. The M oral IFC and these nal rules leave unchanged HRSA's author-ity to decide whether to include contracep-tives in the women's preventive servicesGuidelines for entities that are not exemptedby law, regulation, or the Guidelines. Theserules also do not change the many othermechanisms by which the Government ad-vances contraceptive coverage, particularlyfor low-income women, including throughsuch programs as Medicaid and Title X. TheDepartments also note that the exemptionscreated here, like the exemptions created bythe previous Administration, do not burdenthird parties to a degree that counsels againstproviding the exemptions, as discussed be-low. 5. Burdens on Third Parties The Department received a variety of comments about the effect that the exemp-tions and accommodation based on moralconvictions would have on third parties.Some commenters stated that the exemp-tions and accommodation do not imposean impermissible or unjustied burden onthird parties, including on women whomight otherwise receive contraceptivecoverage with no cost sharing. Other com-menters disagreed, asserting that the ex-emptions unacceptably burden womenwho might lose contraceptive coverage asa result. They contended the exemptionsmay remove contraceptive coverage,causing women to have higher contracep-tive costs, fewer contraceptive options,less ability to use contraceptives more consistently, more unintended pregnan-cies, 151births spaced more closely, and workplace, economic, or societal inequal-ity. Still other commenters took the view 150Nor was this recognition of the need to protect organizations that object to performance of certain health care procedures on the basis of moral convic tion limited to the Church Amendments' legislative history. The rst of the Church Amendments provides, in part, that the receipt of certain federal funds \"by any individual or entity does not authorize any court or any public ofcial or other public authority to require\u2014 . . . (2) such entity to\u2014(A) make its facilities available for the performance of any sterilization procedure or abortion if the performance of such procedure or abortion in such facilities is prohibited by the entity on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions, or (B) provide any personnel for the performance or assistance in the performance of any sterilization procedure or abortion if the performance or assistance in the performance of such procedures or abortion by such personnel would be contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of such personnel.\" 42 U.S.C. 300a-7(b). 151Some commenters attempted to quantify the costs of unintended pregnancy, but were unable to provide estimates with regard to the number of women that t his exemption may affect. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 928that other laws or protections, such as in the First or Fifth Amendments, prohibitthe expanded exemptions, which thosecommenters view as prioritizing conscien-tious objection of exempted entities overthe conscience, choices, or religious lib-erty of women who would not receivecontraceptive coverage where an exemp-tion is used. Some commenters disagreedand said the exemptions do not violatelaws and constitutional protections, nor dothey inappropriately prioritize the con-science of exempted entities over those ofthird parties. The Departments note that the exemp- tions in the Moral IFC and these nalrules, like the exemptions created by theprevious Administration, do not imper-missibly burden third parties. Initially, theDepartments observe that these rules donot create a governmental burden; rather,they relieve a governmental burden. The ACA did not impose a contraceptive cover-age requirement. Agency discretion was ex-ercised to include contraceptives in the Guidelines issued under section 2713(a)(4).That decision is what created and imposed agovernmental burden. These rules simplyrelieve part of that governmental burden. Ifsome third parties do not receive contracep-tive coverage from private parties whom thegovernment chooses not to coerce, that re-sult exists in the absence of governmentalaction\u2014it is not a result the government hasimposed. Calling that result a governmentalburden rests on an incorrect presumption:that the government has an obligation toforce private parties to benet those thirdparties, and that the third parties have a rightto those benets. Congress did not create aright to receive contraceptive coverage fromother private citizens through section 2713of the PHS Act, other portions of the ACA,or any other statutes it has enacted. Al-though some commenters also contendedsuch a right might exist under treaties theSenate has ratied or the Constitution, theDepartments are not aware of any sourcedemonstrating that the Constitution or atreaty ratied by the Senate creates a right toreceive contraceptive coverage from otherprivate citizens. The fact that the government at one time exercised its administrative discre-tion to require private parties to provide coverage to which they morally object, tobenet other private parties, does not pre-vent the government from relieving someor all of the burden of that Mandate. Oth-erwise, any governmental coverage re-quirement would be a one-way ratchet. Inthe Moral IFC and these nal rules, thegovernment has simply restored a zone offreedom where it once existed. There is nostatutory or constitutional obstacle to thegovernment doing so, and the doctrine ofthird party burdens should not be inter-preted to impose such an obstacle. Suchan interpretation would be especiallyproblematic given the millions of women,in a variety of contexts, whom the Man-date does not ultimately benet, notwith-standing any expanded exemptions\u2014in-cluding through the grandfathering ofplans, the previous religious exemptions,and the failure of the accommodation torequire delivery of contraceptive coveragein various self-insured church plan con-texts. In addition, the Government is under no constitutional obligation to fund con-traception. Cf. Harris v. McRae , 448 U.S. 297 (1980) (holding that, although the Su-preme Court has recognized a constitu-tional right to abortion, there is no consti-tutional obligation for government to payfor abortions). Even more so may the gov-ernment refrain from requiring private cit-izens, in violation of their moral convic-tions, to cover contraception for othercitizens. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173, 192-93 (1991) (\"A refusal to fundprotected activity, without more, cannotbe equated with the imposition of a 'pen-alty' on that activity.\"). The constitutionalrights of liberty and privacy do not requirethe government to force private parties toprovide contraception to other citizensand do not prohibit the government fromprotecting moral objections to such gov-ernmental mandates, especially where, ashere, the Mandate is not an explicit statu-tory requirement. 152The Departments do not believe that the Constitution prohibitsoffering the expanded exemptions in theserules. Some commenters objected that the ex- emptions would violate the EstablishmentClause of the First Amendment. The Moral IFC and these nal rules createexemptions for moral convictions, not re-ligious beliefs, and they do so for the sameneutral purposes for which Congress hascreated similar exemptions for over fourdecades. Not only do these nal rules notviolate the Establishment Clause, but theDepartments' decision to provide the ex-emptions and accommodation for moralconvictions, instead of limiting the ex-emptions to identical objections based onreligious beliefs, further demonstrates thatneither the purpose nor the effect of theseexemptions is to establish religion. TheEstablishment Clause does not force theDepartment to impose a contraceptiveMandate in violation of the moral convic-tions of entities and individuals protectedby these rules. American governmental bodies have, in many instances, refrained from requir-ing certain private parties to cover contra-ceptive services for other private parties.From 1789 through 2012 (when HRSA's Guidelines went into effect), there was nofederal women's preventive services cov-erage mandate imposed nationally onhealth insurance and group health plans.The ACA did not require contraceptivesto be included in HRSA's Guidelines, andit did not require any preventive servicesrequired under section 2713 of the PHSAct to be covered by grandfathered plans.Many states do not impose contraceptivecoverage mandates, or they offer reli-gious, and in some cases moral, exemp-tions to the requirements of such coveragemandates\u2014exemptions that have notbeen invalidated by federal or state courts.The Departments, in previous regulations,exempted houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries from the Mandate. TheDepartments then issued a temporary en-forcement safe harbor allowing religiousnonprot groups to not provide contracep-tive coverage under the Mandate for al-most two additional years. The Depart-ments further expanded the houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries exemp-tion through denitional changes. And theDepartments created an accommodationprocess under which many women in self-insured church plans may not ultimately 152See, for example, Planned Parenthood Ariz., Inc. v. Am. Ass'n of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists woman's right to an abortion or to contraception does not compel a private person or entity to facilitate either.\"). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 929receive contraceptive coverage. The De- partments are not aware of federal courtsdeclaring that the exemptions, safe harbor,or accommodations gave rise to thirdparty burdens that required the govern-ment to mandate contraceptive coverageby entities eligible for an exemption oraccommodation. In addition, many orga-nizations have not been subject to theMandate in practice because of injunc-tions they received through litigation, pro-tecting them from federal imposition ofthe Mandate, including under several re-cently entered permanent injunctions thatwill apply regardless of the issuance ofthese nal rules. Commenters offered various assess- ments of the impact these rules mighthave on state or local governments. Somecommenters stated that the expanded ex-emptions will not burden state or localgovernments, or that such burdens shouldnot prevent the Departments from offeringthose exemptions. Others commentersstated that if the Departments provide ex- panded exemptions, states or local juris-dictions may face higher costs in provid-ing birth control to women throughgovernment programs. The Departmentsconsider it appropriate to offer expandedexemptions, notwithstanding the objec-tion of some state or local governments.Until 2012, there was no federal mandateof contraceptive coverage across healthinsurance and health plans nationwide.The ACA did not require a contraceptiveMandate, and its discretionary creation bymeans of HRSA's Guidelines does nottranslate to a benet that the federal gov-ernment owes to state or local govern-ments. The various situations recited inthe previous paragraph, in which the fed-eral government has not imposed contra-ceptive coverage, have not been deemedto cause a cognizable injury to state orlocal governments. The Departments ndno legal prohibition on nalizing thesenal rules based on the allegation of animpact on state or local governments, anddisagree with the suggestion that oncehaving exercised our discretion to denyexemptions\u2014no matter how recently orincompletely\u2014the Departments cannotchange course if some state and local gov-ernments believe they are receiving indi- rect benets from the previous decision. In addition, the exemptions at issue here are available only to a tiny fraction of entities to which the Mandate would other-wise apply\u2014those with qualifying moralobjections. Public comments did not pro-vide reliable data on how many entitieswould use these expanded moral exemp-tions, in which states women in those planswould reside, how many of those womenwould qualify for or use state and localgovernment subsidies of contraceptives as aresult, or in which states such women, ifthey are low income, would go without con-traceptives and potentially experience unin-tended pregnancies that state Medicaid pro-grams would potentially have to cover. Asnoted below, at least one study 153has con- cluded the Mandate caused no clear increasein contraceptive use; one explanation pro-posed by the authors of the study is thatwomen eligible for family planning fromsafety net programs were already receivingfree or subsidized contraceptive access through them, notwithstanding the Man-date's effects on the overall market. Somecommenters who opposed the exemptionsadmitted that this information is unclear atthis stage; other commenters that estimatedconsiderably more individuals and entitieswould seek an exemption also admitted thedifculty of quantifying estimates. In addi-tion, the only entities that have brought suitbased on their moral objections to the Man-date are non-prot entities that have saidthey only hire persons who share their ob-jections and do not use the contraceptives towhich their employers object, so it is un-likely that exemptions for those entitieswould have any impact on safety net pro-grams. Below, we predict that a small num-ber of additional nonprot and closely heldfor-prot entities will use the exemptionsbased on moral convictions. In light of thelimited evidence of third party or state andlocal government impact of these nal rules,the Departments consider it an appropriatepolicy option to provide the exemptions. Some commenters contended that the exemptions would constitute unlawful sexdiscrimination, such as under section 1557of the Affordable Care Act, Title VII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX ofthe Education Amendments of 1972, or the Fifth Amendment. Some commenterssuggested the expanded exemptionswould discriminate on bases such as race,disability, or LGBT status, or that theywould disproportionately burden certainpersons in such categories. But these rules do not discriminate or draw any distinctions on the basis of sex,pregnancy, race, disability, socio-economicclass, LGBT status, or otherwise, nor dothey discriminate on any unlawful grounds.The exemptions in these rules do not autho-rize entities to comply with the Mandate forone person, but not for another person,based on that person's status as a member ofa protected class. Instead, they allow entitiesthat have sincerely held moral objections toproviding some or all contraceptives in-cluded in the Mandate to not be forced toprovide coverage of those items to anyone. Those commenters' contentions about discrimination are unpersuasive for stilladditional reasons. First, Title VII is ap-plicable to discrimination committed by employers, and these nal rules have beenissued in the government's capacity as aregulator of group health plans and groupand individual health insurance, not in itscapacity as an employer. See also In Re Union Pac. R.R. Emp't Practices Litig. , 479 F.3d 936, Title VII \"does coverage of contraception becausecontraception is not a gender-specic termlike potential pregnancy, but rather ap-plies to both men and women\"). Second,these rules create no disparate impact. Thewomen's preventive service mandate un-der section 2713(a)(4), and the contracep- tive Mandate promulgated specic de-nied any benet from section 2713(a)(4).Both before and after these rules are in ef-fect, section 2713(a)(4) and the Guidelinesissued under that section treat women's pre-ventive services in general, and female con-traceptives specically, more favorably thanthey treat male preventive services or con-traceptives. It is simply not the case that the gov- ernment's implementation of section2713(a)(4) is discriminatory against 153M.L. Kavanaugh et al., \"Contraceptive method use in the United States: trends and characteristics between 2008, 2012 and 2014,\", 97 Contraception 14, 14-21 (2018), available at http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(17)30478-X/pdf. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 930women because exemptions encompass moral objections. The previous rules, asdiscussed elsewhere herein, do not re-quire contraceptive coverage in a host ofplans, including grandfathered plans,plans of houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries, and\u2014through inabil-ity to enforce the accommodation oncertain third party administrators\u2014plans of many religious non-prots inself-insured church plans. Below, theDepartments estimate that nearly allwomen of childbearing age in the coun-try will be unaffected by these exemp-tions. In this context, the Departmentsdo not believe that an adjustment todiscretionary Guidelines for women'spreventive services concerning contra-ceptives constitutes unlawful sex dis-crimination. Otherwise, anytime thegovernment exercises its discretion toprovide a benet that is specic towomen (or specic to men), it wouldconstitute sex discrimination for thegovernment to reconsider that benet.Under that theory, Hobby Lobby itself, and RFRA (on which Hobby Lobby 's holding was based), which provided areligious exemption to this Mandate formany businesses, would be deemed dis-criminatory against women because theunderlying women's preventive servicesrequirement is a benet for women, notfor men. Such conclusions are not con-sistent with legal doctrines concerningsex discrimination. It is not clear that these expanded ex- emptions will signicantly burden womenmost at risk of unintended pregnancies. Some commenters stated that contracep-tives are often readily accessible at rela-tively low cost. Other commenters dis-agreed. Some commenters objected thatthe Moral IFC's estimate of a $584 yearlycost of contraceptives for women was toolow. But some of those same commentersprovided similar estimates, citing sourcesclaiming that birth control pills can costup to $600 per year, and stated that IUDs,which can last 3 to 6 years or more, 154can cost $1,100 (that is, less than $50 permonth over the duration of use). Somecommenters stated that, for lower incomewomen, contraceptives and related educa-tion and counseling can be available atfree or low cost through government pro- grams (federal programs offering suchservices include, for example, Medicaid,Title X, community health center grants,and Temporary Assistance for NeedyFamilies (TANF)). Other commenterscontended that many women in employer-sponsored coverage might not qualify forthose programs, although that sometimesoccurs because their incomes are abovecertain thresholds or because the pro-grams were not intended to absorb pri-vately covered individuals. Some com-menters observed that contraceptives maybe available through other sources, suchas a plan of another family member, andthat the expanded exemptions will notlikely encompass a very large segment ofthe population otherwise benetting fromthe Mandate. Other commenters dis-agreed, emphasizing that income and eli-gibility thresholds could prevent somewomen from receiving contraceptivesthrough certain government programs ifthey were no longer covered in their grouphealth plans or health insurance plans. The Departments do not believe that such differences make it inappropriate toissue the expanded exemptions set forth inthese rules. As explained more fully be-low, the Departments estimate that nearlyall women of childbearing age in thecountry will be unaffected by these ex-emptions. Moreover, the Departmentsnote that the HHS Ofce of PopulationAffairs, within the Ofce of the AssistantSecretary for Health, has recently issued aproposed rule to amend the regulationsgoverning its Title X family planning pro- gram. The proposed rule would amend thedenition of \"low income family\"\u2014indi-viduals eligible for free or low cost con-traceptive services\u2014to include womenwho are unable to obtain certain familyplanning services under their employer-sponsored health coverage due to theiremployers' religious beliefs or moral con-victions. (83 FR 25502). If that rule isnalized as proposed, it would further re-duce any potential effect of these nalrules on women's access to contracep-tives. Some commenters stated that the ex- panded exemptions would violate section1554 of the ACA. That section says theSecretary of HHS \"shall not promulgate any regulation\" that \"creates any unrea-sonable barriers to the ability of individ-uals to obtain appropriate medical care,\"\"impedes timely access to health care ser-vices,\" \"interferes with communicationsregarding a full range of treatment optionsbetween the patient and the provider,\" \"re-stricts the ability of health care providersto provide full disclosure of all relevantinformation to patients making health caredecisions,\" \"violates the principles of in-formed consent and the ethical standardsof health care professionals,\" or \"limitsthe availability of health care treatmentfor the full duration of a patient's medicalneeds.\" 42 U.S.C. 18114. Such comment-ers urged, for example, that the Moral IFCcreated unreasonable barriers to the abilityof individuals to obtain appropriate med-ical care, particularly in areas they saidmay have a disproportionately high num-ber of entities likely to take advantage ofthe exemption. The Departments disagree with these comments about section 1554 of the ACA.The Departments issued previous exemp-tions and accommodations that allowedvarious plans to not provide contraceptivecoverage on the basis of religious objec-tions; multiple courts considered thoseregulations; and while many ruled thatentities did not need to provide contracep-tive coverage, none ruled that the exemp-tions or accommodations in the regula-tions violated section 1554 of the ACA.Moreover, the decision not to impose agovernmental mandate is not the creationof a \"barrier,\" especially when that man- date requires private citizens to provideservices to other private citizens. Thiswould turn the assumptions of the UnitedStates' system of government on its head.See, for example , U.S. Constitution, Ninth Amendment. Section 1554 of the ACAlikewise does not require the Departmentsto require coverage of, or to keep in placea requirement to cover, certain services,including contraceptives, that was issuedpursuant to HHS's exercise of discretionunder section 2713(a)(4). Nor does sec-tion 1554 of the ACA prohibit the Depart-ments from providing exemptions to re-lieve burdens on moral convictions, or asis the case here, from refraining to impose 154See, for example , \"IUD,\" Planned Parenthood, https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 931the Mandate in cases where moral convic- tions would be burdened by the Mandate.Moral exemptions from federal mandatesin certain health contexts, including ster-ilization, contraception, or items believedto be abortifacient, have existed in federallaws for decades. Some of those lawswere referenced by President Obama insigning Executive Order 13535. In light ofthat Executive Order and Congress's longhistory of providing exemptions for moralconvictions in the health context, provid-ing moral exemptions is a reasonable ad-ministrative response to this federallymandated burden, especially since theburden itself is a subregulatory creationthat does not apply in various contexts. In short, we do not believe sections 1554 or 1557 of the ACA, other nondis-crimination statutes, or any constitutionaldoctrines, create an afrmative obligationto create, maintain, or impose a Mandatethat forces covered entities to providecoverage of preventive contraceptive ser-vices in health plans. The ACA's grant ofauthority to HRSA to provide for, andsupport, the Guidelines is not transformedby any of the laws cited by commentersinto a requirement that, once those Guide-lines exist, they can never be reconsid-ered, or amended because doing so wouldonly affect women's coverage or wouldallegedly impact particular populations disparately. In summary, members of the public have widely divergent views on whetherthe exemptions in the Moral IFC and thesenal rules are good public policy. Somecommenters stated that the exemptionswould burden workers, families, and theeconomic and social stability of the coun-try, and interfere with the physician-patient relationship. Other commentersdisagreed, favoring the public policy be-hind the exemption, and arguing that theexemption would not interfere with thephysician-patient relationship. The De-partments have determined that these nalrules are an appropriate exercise of public policy discretion. Because of the impor-tance of the moral convictions being ac-commodated, the limited impact of thesenal rules, and uncertainty about the im-pact of the Mandate overall according tosome studies, the Departments do not be-lieve these nal rules will have any of thedrastic negative consequences on thirdparties or society that some opponents ofthese rules have suggested. 6. Interim Final Rulemaking The Departments received several comments about the decision to issue theMoral IFC as interim nal rules with re-quest for comments, instead of as a noticeof proposed rulemaking. Several com-menters asserted that the Departments hadthe authority to issue the Moral IFC in thatway, agreeing with the Departments thatthere was explicit statutory authority to doso, good cause under the APA, or both.Other commenters held the opposite view,contending that there was neither statutoryauthority to issue the rules on an interimnal basis, nor good cause under the APAto make the rules immediately effective. The Departments continue to believe authority existed to issue the Moral IFC asinterim nal rules. Section 9833 of theCode, section 734 of ERISA, and section2792 of the PHS Act authorize the Secre-taries of the Treasury, Labor, and HHS(collectively, the Secretaries) to promul-gate any interim nal rules that they de-termine are appropriate to carry out theprovisions of chapter 100 of the Code,part 7 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, andpart A of title XXVII of the PHS Act,which include sections 2701 through 2728of that Act, and the incorporation of thosesections into section 715 of ERISA andsection 9815 of the Code. The Religiousand Moral IFCs fall under those statutoryauthorizations for the use of interim nalrulemaking. Prior to the Moral IFC, theDepartments issued three interim nal regulations implementing this section ofthe PHS Act because of the needs of cov-ered entities for immediate guidance andthe weighty matters implicated by theHRSA Guidelines, including issuance ofnew or revised exemptions FR 46621; 79FR 51092). cause to issue the Moral IFC asinterim nal rules, for the reasons dis-cussed therein. In any event, the objections of some commenters to the issuance of the MoralIFC as interim nal rules with request forcomments does not prevent the issuanceof these nal rules. These nal rules wereissued after receiving and thoroughly con-sidering public comments as requested inthe Moral IFC. These nal rules thereforecomply with the APA's notice and com-ment requirements. 7. Health Effects of Contraception and Pregnancy The Departments received numerous comments on the health effects of contra-ception and pregnancy. As noted above,some commenters supported the expandedexemptions, and others urged that contra-ceptives be removed from the Guidelinesentirely, based on the view that pregnancyand the unborn children resulting fromconception are not diseases or unhealthyconditions that are properly the subject ofpreventive care coverage. Such comment-ers further contended that hormonal con-traceptives may present health risks towomen. For example, they contended thatstudies show certain contraceptives cause,or are associated with, an increased risk ofdepression, pulmonary women whosmoke, are hypertensive, or are older), 158 hypertension,159HIV-1 acquisition and 155Commenters cited Charlotte Wessel Skovlund, et with Depression,\" Psychiatry 1154, 1154 (published online Sept. 28, 2016) (\"Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents, was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a rst diagnosis of depression , suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use.\"). 156Commenters cited the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, \"Hormonal Contraception: Recent Advances and Controve rsies,\" et al., Oral Contraceptives, Effects of Estrogen Dose and Progestogen Type: Results of the MEGA Case-Control Study,\" 339 Brit.

Some commenterscontended that it is not the case that con-traceptive access reduces unintendedpregnancies or abortions. Other commenters disagreed, citing a variety of studies they contend showhealth benets caused by, or associatedwith, contraceptive use or the preventionof unintended pregnancy. Commenterscited, for example, the 2011 Report of theInstitute of Medicine (IOM), \"ClinicalPreventive Services for Women: Closingthe Gaps,\" in its discussion of the negativeeffects associated with unintended preg-nancies, as well as other studies. Suchcommenters contended that, by reducingunintended pregnancy, contraceptives re-duce the risk of unaddressed health com-plications, low birth weight, preterm birth,infant mortality, and maternal mortality.Commenters also stated that studies showcontraceptives are associated with a re- duced risk of conditions such as ovariancancer, colorectal cancer, and endometrialcancer, and that contraceptives treat suchconditions as endometriosis, polycysticovarian syndrome, migraines, pre-menstrualpain, menstrual regulation, and pelvic in-flammatory disease. 162Some commenters stated that pregnancy presents varioushealth risks, such as blood clots, bleeding,anemia, high blood pressure, gestational di- abetes, and death. Some commenters alsocontended that increased access to contra-ception reduces abortions. Some commenters stated that, in the Moral IFC, the Departments relied on in-correct statements concerning scienticstudies. For example, some commentersstated that there is no proven increasedrisk of breast cancer or other risks among contraceptive users. They criticized theDepartments for citing studies, includingone previewed in the 2011 IOM Reportitself (Agency for Healthcare Researchand Quality, Report No. 13-E002-EF(June 2013) (cited above)), discussing anassociation between contraceptive use andincreased risks of breast and cervical can-cer, and concluding there are no netcancer-reducing benets of contraceptiveuse. As described in the Religious IFC, 82FR 47804, the 2013 Agency for Health-care Research and Quality study, andother sources, reach conclusions withwhich these commenters appear to dis-agree. The Departments consider it appro-priate to consider these studies, as well asthe studies cited by commenters who dis-agree with those conclusions. Some commenters further criticized the Departments for saying two studiescited by the 2011 IOM Report, whichasserted an associative relationship be-tween contraceptive use and decreases inunintended pregnancy, did not on theirface establish a causal relationship be-tween a broad coverage mandate and de- creases in unintended pregnancy. In thisrespect, as noted in the Religious IFC, 163 the purpose for the Departments' refer-ence to such studies was to highlight thedifference between a causal relationshipand an associative one, as well as thedifference between saying contraceptiveuse has a certain effect and saying a con-traceptive coverage mandate (or part of that mandate affected by certain exemp-tions) will necessarily have (or negate,respectively) such an effect. Commenters disagreed about the ef- fects of some FDA-approved contracep-tives on embryos. Some commentersagreed with the quotation, in the MoralIFC, of FDA materials 164that indicate that some items it has approved as contra-ceptives may prevent the implantation ofan embryo after fertilization. Some ofthose commenters cited additional scien-tic sources to argue that certain approvedcontraceptives may prevent implantation,and that, in some cases, some contracep-tive items may even dislodge an embryoshortly after implantation. Other com-menters disagreed with the sources citedin the Moral IFC and cited additionalstudies on that issue. Some commentersfurther criticized the Departments for as-serting in the Moral IFC that some per-sons believe those possible effects are\"abortifacient.\" This objection on this issue appears to be partially one of semantics.

Thisquestion is independent of the questionof what mechanisms of action FDA-approved or cleared contraceptives mayhave. It is also a separate question fromwhether members of the public assert, orbelieve, that it is appropriate to considerthe items \"abortifacient\"\u2014that is, a kindof abortion, or a medical product thatcauses an abortion\u2014because they believeabortion means to cause the demise of apost-fertilization embryo inside the moth-er's body. Commenters referenced scien-tic studies and sources on both sides ofthe issue of whether certain contraceptivesprevent implantation. Commenters andlitigants have positively stated that someof them view certain contraceptives asabortifacients, for this reason. See also Hobby Lobby , 134 U.S. at 2765 (\"The Hahns have accordingly excluded fromthe group-health-insurance plan they offerto their employees certain contraceptive methods that they consider to be abortifa-cients.\"). The Departments do not take a position on the scientic, religious, or moral de-bates on this issue by recognizing thatsome people have sincere moral objec-tions to providing contraception coverageon this basis. The Supreme Court has al-ready recognized that such a view canform the basis of an objection based onsincerely held religious belief underRFRA. 165Several litigants have sepa- rately raised non-religious moral objec-tions to contraceptive coverage based on the same basic rationale. Even thoughthere is a plausible scientic argumentagainst the view that certain contracep-tives have mechanisms of action that mayprevent implantation, there is also a plau-sible scientic argument in favor of it\u2014asdemonstrated, for example, by FDA'sstatement that some contraceptives mayprevent implantation and by some scien-tic studies cited by commenters. The De-partments believe in this context we havea sufcient rationale to offer moral ex-emptions with respect to this Mandate. The Departments also received com- ments about their discussion, located inthe Religious IFC but partly relied upon inthe Moral IFC, concerning uncertaintyabout the effects the Mandate's expandedexemptions might have on teen sexual ac-tivity. In this respect, the Departmentsstated, \"With respect to teens, the Santelliand Melnikas study cited by IOM 2011observes that, between 1960 and 1990, ascontraceptive use increased, teen sexualactivity outside of marriage likewise in-creased (although the study does not as-sert a causal relationship). Another study,which proposed an economic model for the decision to engage in sexual activity,stated that '[p]rograms that increase ac-cess to contraception are found to de-crease teen pregnancies in the short runbut increase teen pregnancies in the longrun.'\" 166Some commenters agreed with this discussion, while other commentersdisagreed. Commenters who supportedthe expanded exemptions cited these andsimilar sources suggesting that limitingthe exemptions to the Mandate to thosethat existed prior to the Religious andMoral IFCs is not tailored towards ad-vancing the Government's interests in re- ducing teen pregnancy. Instead they sug-gested there are means of reducing teenpregnancy that are less burdensome onconscientious objections. 167Some com- menters opposing the expanded exemp-tions stated that school-based health cen-ters provide access to contraceptives, thusincreasing use of contraceptives by sexu-ally active students. They also cited stud-ies concluding that certain decreases inteen pregnancy are attributable to in-creased contraceptive use. 168 Many commenters opposing the moral exemptions misunderstood the Depart-ments' discussion of this issue. Teens area signicant part, though not the entirety,of women the IOM identied as beingmost at risk of unintended pregnancy. TheDepartments do not take a position on theempirical question of whether contracep-tion has caused certain reductions in teenpregnancy. Rather, the Departments notethat studies suggesting various causes ofteen pregnancy and unintended pregnancyin general make it difcult to establishcausation between exemptions to the con-traceptive Mandate, and an increase inteen pregnancies in particular, or unin- tended pregnancies in general. For exam-ple, a 2015 study investigating the declinein teen pregnancy since 1991 attributed itto multiple factors (including, but not lim-ited to, reduced sexual activity, fallingwelfare benet levels, and expansion offamily planning services in Medicaid,with the latter accounting for less than 13percent of the decline). It concluded that\"that none of the relatively easy, policy-based explanations for the recent declinein teen childbearing in the United Stateshold up very well to careful empirical 165\"Although many of the required, FDA-approved methods of contraception work by preventing the fertilization of an egg, four of those methods (those sp ecically at issue in these cases) may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.

Likewise, these rules do notaddress the substantive question of whetherHRSA should include contraceptives in thewomen's preventive services Guidelines is-sued under section 2713(a)(4). Rather, reex-amination of the record and review of publiccomments has reinforced the Departments'view that the uncertainty surrounding theseweighty and important issues makes it ap-propriate to provide the moral exemptionsand accommodation if and for as long asHRSA continues to include contraceptives in the Guidelines. The federal governmenthas a long history, particularly in certainsensitive and multi-faceted health issues, ofproviding moral exemptions from govern-mental mandates. These nal rules are con-sistent with that history and with the discre-tion Congress vested in the Departments toimplement the ACA. 8. Health and Equality Effects of Contraceptive Coverage Mandates The Departments also received com- ments about the health and equality ef-fects of the Mandate more broadly. Somecommenters contended that the contracep-tive Mandate promoted the health andequality of women, especially low incomewomen, and promoted female participa-tion and equality in the workforce. Othercommenters contended there was insuf-cient evidence showing that the expandedexemptions would harm those interests.Some of those commenters further ques-tioned whether there was evidence toshow that broad health coverage mandatesof contraception lead to increased contra-ceptive use, reductions in unintendedpregnancies, or reductions in negative ef-fects said to be associated with unintendedpregnancies. In particular, some com-menters discussed a study published andrevised by the Guttmacher Institute in Oc-tober 2017, concluding that \"[b]etween2008 and 2014, there were no signicantchanges in the overall proportion ofwomen who used a contraceptive methodboth among all women and among womenat risk of unintended pregnancy.\" 176This timeframe includes the rst two years ofthe contraceptive Mandate's implementa-tion. Despite some changes in the use ofvarious methods of contraceptives, the study concluded that, \"[f]or the most part,women are changing method type withinthe group of most or moderately effectivemethods and not shifting from less effec-tive to more effective methods.\" Regard-ing the effect of this Mandate in particu-lar, the authors concluded that \"[t]he rolethat the contraceptive coverage guaranteeplayed in impacting use of contraceptionat the national level remains unclear, asthere was no signicant increase in the useof methods that would have been coveredunder the ACA (most or moderately ef-fective methods) during the most recenttime period (2012-2014) excepting smallincreases in implant use.\" The authors that other \"[s]tudies have producedmixed evidence regarding the relationshipbetween the implementation of the ACAand contraceptive use patterns.\" In ex-plaining some possible reasons or no cleareffect on contraceptive use, the authorssuggested that \"existence of these safetynet programs [publicly funded familyplanning centers and Medicaid] may havedampened any impact the ACA couldhave had on contraceptive use,\" \"cost isnot the only barrier to accessing a fullrange method options,\" and \"access toaffordable and/or free contraception madepossible through programs such as TitleX\" may have led to income not beingassociated with the use of most contracep-tive methods. 177In addition, commenters 169Kearney MS and Levine PB, \"Investigating recent trends in the U.S. birth rate,\" 41 J.

Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 935noted that in the 29 states where contra- ceptive coverage mandates have been im-posed statewide, 178those mandates have not necessarily lowered rates of unin-tended pregnancy (or abortion) overall. 179 Other commenters, however, disputed the signicance of these state statistics,noting that, of the 29 states with contra-ceptive coverage mandates, only fourstates have laws that match the federalrequirements in scope. Some also ob-served that, even in states with statecontraceptive coverage mandates, self-insured group health plans might escapethose requirements, and some states donot mandate the contraceptives to be cov-ered at no out-of-pocket cost to the bene-ciary. The Departments have considered these experiences as relevant to the effectthe exemption in these rules might haveon the Mandate more broadly. The statemandates of contraceptive coverage stillapply to a very large number of plans andplan participants notwithstanding ERISApreemption, and public commenters didnot point to studies showing those statemandates reduced unintended pregnan-cies. The federal contraceptive Mandate,likewise, applies to a broad, but not en-tirely comprehensive, number of employ-ers. For example, to the extent that housesof worship and integrated auxiliaries mayhave self-insured to avoid state health in-surance contraceptive coverage mandatesor for other reasons, those groups werealready exempt from the federal Mandateprior to the 2017 Religious and MoralIFCs. The exemptions as set forth in theMoral IFC and in these nal rules leavethe contraceptive Mandate in place fornearly all entities and plans to which theMandate has applied. The Departmentsare not aware of data showing that these expanded exemptions would negate anyreduction in unintended pregnancies thatmight result from the contraceptive Man-date here. Some commenters took a view that ap- pears to disagree with the assertion in the2017 Guttmacher study, that \"[t]he role that the contraceptive coverage guaranteeplayed in impacting use of contraceptionat the national level remains unclear, asthere was no signicant increase in the useof methods that would have been coveredunder the ACA.\" These commenters in-stead observed that, under the Mandate,more women have coverage of contracep-tives and contraception counseling andthat more contraceptives are providedwithout co-pays than before. Still othersargued that the Mandate, or other expan-sions of contraceptive coverage, have ledwomen to increase their use of contracep-tion in general, or to change from lesseffective, less expensive contraceptivemethods to more effective, more expen-sive contraceptive methods. Some com-menters pointed to studies cited in the2011 IOM Report recommending contra-ception be included in the Guidelines andargued that certain women will go withoutcertain health care, or contraception spe-cically, because of cost. They contendedthat a smaller percentage of women delayor forego health care overall under theACA 180and that, according to studies, coverage of contraceptives without cost-sharing has increased use of contracep-tives in certain circumstances. Some com-menters also stated that studies show thatdecreases in unintended pregnancies aredue to broader access to contraceptives.Finally, some commenters also stated thatbirth control access generally has led tosocial and economic equality for women. The Departments have reviewed the comments, including studies submitted bycommenters either supporting or opposingthese expanded exemptions. Based on thatreview, it is not clear that merely offeringthe exemption in these rules will have asignicant effect on contraceptive use and health, or workplace equality, for the vastmajority of women benetting from theMandate. There is conflicting evidence re-garding whether the Mandate alone, asdistinct from contraceptive access moregenerally, has caused increased contracep-tive use, reduced unintended pregnancies, or eliminated workplace disparities, whereall other women's preventive serviceswere covered without cost sharing. With-out taking a denitive position on thoseevidentiary issues, however, the Depart-ments conclude that the Moral IFC andthese nal rules\u2014which merely withdrawthe Mandate's requirement from what ap-pears to be a small number of newly ex-empt entities and plans\u2014are not likely tohave negative effects on the health orequality of women nationwide. The De-partments also conclude that the expandedexemptions are an appropriate policychoice left to the agencies under the rele-vant statutes, and, thus, an appropriateexercise of the Departments' discretion. Moreover, the Departments conclude that the best way to balance the variouspolicy interests at stake in the Moral IFCand these nal rules is to provide theexemptions set forth herein, even if cer-tain effects may occur among the popula-tions actually affected by the employmentof these exemptions. These rules providetangible conscience protections for moralconvictions, and impose fewer govern-mental burdens on various entities andindividuals, some of whom have con-tended for several years that denying theman exemption from the contraceptiveMandate imposes a burden on their moralconvictions. The Departments view theprovision of those protections to preserveconscience in this health care context asan appropriate policy option, notwith-standing the widely divergent effects thatpublic commenters have predicted basedon different studies they cited. Providingthe protections for moral convictions setforth in the Moral IFC and these nalrules is not inconsistent with the ACA,and brings this Mandate into better align-ment with various other federal con-science protections in health care, some ofwhich have been in place for decades. 178See Guttmacher Institute, \"Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives\" (June 11, 2018); \"State Requirements for Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives, \" Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation (Jan. 1, 2018), https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/state-requirements-for-insurance-coverage-of-contraceptives/?currentTime frame/H110050&sortModel /H11005%7B%22colId%22:%22 Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D . 179SeeMichael J.

December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 9369. Other General Comments Some commenters expressed the view that the exemptions afforded in the MoralIFC and herein violate the RFRA rights ofwomen who might not receive contracep-tive coverage as the result of these nalrules, by allowing their employers to im-pose their moral convictions on them byremoving contraceptive coverage throughuse of the exemption. Still other com-menters stated that employer payment ofinsurance premiums is part of any em-ployee's compensation package, the ben-ets of which employers should not beable to limit. In the Departments' view,the expanded exemptions in these nalrules do not prohibit employers from pro-viding contraceptive coverage. Instead,they lift a government burden that wasimposed on some employers to providecontraceptive coverage to their employeesin violation of those employers' moralconvictions. The Departments do not be-lieve RFRA requires, or has ever required,the federal government to force employersto provide contraceptive coverage. Thefederal government's decision to exemptsome entities from a requirement to pro-vide no-cost-sharing services to privatecitizens does not constitute a federalgovernment-imposed burden on the latterunder RFRA. Some commenters asked the Depart- ments to discuss the interaction betweenthese rules and state laws that either re-quire contraceptive coverage or provideexemptions from those and other require-ments. Some commenters argue that pro-viding the exemptions in these ruleswould negate state contraceptive require- ments or narrower state exemptions. Somecommenters asked that the Departmentsspecify that these exemptions do not applyto plans governed by state laws that re-quire contraceptive coverage. The Departments agree that these rules only concern the applicability of the fed-eral contraceptive Mandate imposed pur-suant to section 2713(a)(4). They do notregulate state contraceptive mandates orstate exemptions. If a plan is exempt un-der the Moral IFC and these nal rules,that exemption does not necessarily ex- empt the plan or other insurance issuerfrom state laws that may apply to it. Theprevious regulations, which offered ex-emptions for houses of worship and inte-grated auxiliaries, did not include regula-tory language negating the exemptions instates that require contraceptive coverage,although the Departments discussed theissue to some degree in various preamblesof those previous regulations. The Depart-ments do not consider it appropriate ornecessary in the regulatory text of themoral exemption rules to declare whetherthe federal contraceptive Mandate wouldstill apply in states that have a state con-traceptive mandate, since these rules donot purport to regulate the applicability ofstate contraceptive mandates. 181 Some commenters observed that, through ERISA, some entities mayavoid state laws that require contracep-tive coverage by self-insuring. This is aresult of the application of the preemp-tion and savings clauses contained inERISA to state insurance regulation. See 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) & (b)(1). These nal rules cannot change statu- tory ERISA provisions, and do not changethe standards applicable to ERISA pre-emption. To the extent Congress has de-cided that ERISA preemption includespreemption of state laws requiring contra-ceptive coverage, that occurredbefore the ACA and was not negated bythe ACA. Congress did not mandate in theACA that any Guidelines issued undersection 2713(a)(4) must include contra-ceptives, nor that the Guidelines mustforce entities with moral objections tocover contraceptives. Finally, some commenters expressed concern that providing moral exemptionsto the mandate that private parties providecontraception may lead to exemptions re-garding other medications or services, likevaccines. The exemptions provided inthese rules, however, do not apply beyondthe contraceptive coverage requirement implemented through section 2713(a)(4).Specically, section 2713(a)(2) of thePHS Act requires coverage of \"immuni-zations,\" and these exemptions do not en-compass that requirement. The fact that the Departments have exempted houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries fromthe contraceptive Mandate since 2011 didnot lead to those entities receiving exemp-tions under section 2713(a)(2) concerningvaccines. In addition, hundreds of entitieshave sued the Departments over the im-plementation of section 2713(a)(4), lead-ing to two decisions of the U.S. SupremeCourt, but no similar wave of lawsuits haschallenged section 2713(a)(2). The ex-panded exemptions in these nal rules areconsistent with a long history of statutesprotecting moral convictions from certainhealth care mandates concerning issuessuch as sterilization, abortion and birthcontrol. B.Text of the Final Rules In this section, the Departments de- scribe the regulations from the MoralIFC, public comments in response to thespecic regulatory text set forth in theIFC, the Departments' response to thosecomments, and, in consideration ofthose comments, the regulatory text asnalized in this nal rule. We also notethe regulatory text as it existed prior tothe Religious and Moral IFCs, as appro-priate. The Departments consider theexemptions nalized here to be an ap-propriate and permissible policy choicein light of various interests at stake andthe lack of a statutory requirement forthe Departments to impose the Mandateon entities and plans that qualify forthese exemptions. As noted above, various members of the public provided comments that weresupportive, or critical, of the regulationsoverall, or of signicant policies pertain-ing to the regulations. To the extent thosecomments apply to the following regula-tory text, the Departments have respondedto them above. This section of the pream-ble responds to comments that pertainmore specically to particular regulatorytext. 181Some commenters also asked that these nal rules specify that exempt entities must comply with other applicable laws concerning such things as notice to plan participants or collective bargaining agreements. These nal rules relieve the application of the federal contraceptive Mandate under section 2713(a)(4) to qualied exempt e ntities; they do not affect the applicability of other laws. In the preamble to the companion nal rules concerning religious exemptions published elsewhere in today's Federal Register , the Departments provide guidance applicable to notices of revocation and changes that an entity may seek to make during its plan year. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 9371. Restatement of Statutory Requirements of Section 2713(a) and(a)(4) of the PHS Act (26 and (a)(1)(iv),and 45 CFR 147.130(a)(1) and(a)(1)(iv)). The regulations restated the statutory requirements of section 2713(a)and (a)(4) of the PHS Act, at 26 those restate-ments to more closely align them with thetext of section 2713(a) and (a)(4) of thePHS Act. Those sections cross-reference the other sections of the Departments' rulesthat provide exemptions to the contraceptiveMandate. After the Religious IFC changedthose sections, the those new \u00a7 147.133, the textof the moral exemptions. The insertions cor-respond to the cross-references to the reli-gious exemptions added by the ReligiousIFC. The Departments nalize these parts ofthe Moral IFC without change. 2. Exemption for Objecting Entities Based on Moral Convictions (45 CFR147.133(a)) The previous regulations contained no exemption concerning moral convictions,as distinct from religious beliefs. Instead,at 45 CFR 147.131(a), they offered anexemption for houses of and in-tegrated auxiliaries. In the remaining partof \u00a7 147.131, the previous regulations de-scribed the accommodation process fororganizations with religious objections.The Religious IFC moved the religiousexemption to a new section 45 CFR147.132, and expanded its scope. TheMoral IFC created a new section 45 CFR147.133, providing exemptions for moralconvictions similar to, but not exactly thesame as, the exemptions for religious be-liefs set forth in \u00a7 147.132. The prefatory language of \u00a7 147.133(a) not only species that certain entities are\"exempt,\" but also explains that theGuidelines shall not support or provide foran imposition of the contraceptive cover-age requirement to such exempt entities.This is an acknowledgement that section2713(a)(4) requires women's preventive services coverage only \"as provided for incomprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad-ministration.\" To the extent the HRSAGuidelines do not provide for, or support,the application of such coverage to certainentities or plans, the Affordable Care Actdoes not require the coverage. Those en-tities or plans are \"exempt\" by not beingsubject to the requirements in the rstinstance. Therefore, in describing the en-tities or plans as \"exempt,\" and in refer-ring to the \"exemption\" encompassingthose entities or plans, the Departmentsalso afrm the non-applicability of theGuidelines to them. The Departments wish to make clear that the expanded exemption set forth in\u00a7 147.133(a) applies to several distinctentities involved in the provision of cov-erage to an objecting employer's employ-ees. This explanation is consistent withhow prior regulations have worked bymeans of similar language. When \u00a7 147.133(a)(1) and (a)(1)(i) specify that\"[a] group health with agroup health plan,\" \"health insurancecoverage offered or arranged by an object-ing organization\" are the ex-tent\" specied inparagraph (a)(2),\" that language exemptsthe group health plans of the sponsors thatobject, and their health insurance issuersin providing the coverage in those plans(whether or not the issuers have their ownobjections). Consequently, with respect to Guidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(and as referenced by the 2713(a)(1)(iv)and 29 CFR 2590.715 through 2713(a)(1)(v)), the plan sponsor, issuer, and plancovered in the exemption of that paragraphwould face no penalty as a result of omittingcontraceptive coverage from the benets ofthe plan participants and beneciaries.However, while a plan sponsor's or arrang-er's objection removes penalties from thatgroup health plan's issuer, it only does sowith respect to that group health plan\u2014itdoes not affect the issuer's coverage forother group health plans where the plansponsor has no qualifying objection. Moreinformation on the effects of the objectionof a health insurance issuer in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii) is included below.The exemptions in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1) ap- ply \"to the extent\" of the objecting enti-ties' sincerely held moral convictions.Thus, entities that hold a requisite objec-tion to covering some, but not all, contra-ceptive items would be exempt with re-spect to the items to which they object, butnot with respect to the items to which theydo not object. Some commenters stated itwas unclear whether the plans of entitiesor individuals that morally object to somebut not all contraceptives would be ex-empt from being required to cover just thecontraceptive methods as to which there isan objection, or whether the objection tosome contraceptives leads to an exemp-tion from that plan being required to coverall contraceptives. The Departments in-tend that a requisite moral objection tosome, but not all, contraceptives wouldlead to an exemption only to the extent ofthat objection: that is, the exemptionwould encompass only the items to whichthe relevant entity or individual objectsand would not encompass contraceptive methods to which the objection does notapply. To make this clearer, in these nalrules the Departments nalize the prefa-tory language of \u00a7 147.133(a) so that therst sentence of that paragraph states thatan exemption shall be included, and theGuidelines must not provide for contra-ceptive coverage, \"to the extent of theobjections specied below.\" The Depart-ments have made corresponding changesto language throughout the regulatorytext, to describe the exemptions as apply-ing \"to the extent\" of the objection(s). The exemptions contained in previous regulations, at \u00a7 147.131(a), did not re-quire an exempt entity to submit any par-ticular self-certication or notice, either tothe government or to the entity's issueror third party administrator, in order toobtain or qualify for their exemption. Sim-ilarly, under the expanded exemptions in\u00a7 147.133, the Moral IFC did not requireexempt entities to comply with a self-certication process. We nalize that ap-proach without change. Although exemptentities do not need to le notices or cer-tications of their exemption, and thesenal rules do not impose any new noticerequirements on them, existing ERISArules governing group health plans requirethat, with respect to plans subject toERISA, a plan document must include a December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 938comprehensive summary of the benets covered by the plan and a statement of theconditions for eligibility to receive bene-ts. Under ERISA, the plan documentidenties what benets are provided toparticipants and beneciaries under theplan; if an objecting employer would liketo exclude all or a subset of contraceptiveservices, it must ensure that the exclusionis clear in the plan document. Moreover, ifthere is a reduction in a covered service orbenet, the plan has to disclose thatchange to plan participants. 182Thus, where an exemption applies and all (or asubset of) contraceptive services are omit-ted from a plan's coverage, otherwise ap-plicable ERISA disclosures must reflectthe omission of coverage in ERISA plans.These existing disclosure requirementsserve to help provide notice to participantsand beneciaries of what ERISA plans doand do not cover. Some commenters supported this ap- proach, while others did not. Those infavor suggested that self-certication forms for an exemption are not necessary,could add burdens to exempt entities be-yond those imposed by the previous ex-emption, and could give rise to objectionsto the self-certication process itself.Commenters also stated that requiring anexemption form for exempt entities couldcause additional operational burdens forplans that have existing processes in placeto handle exemptions. Other commentersfavored including a self-certication pro-cess for exempt entities. They suggested that entities might abuse the availability ofan exemption or use their exempt statusinsincerely if no self-certication processexists, and that the Mandate might be dif-cult to enforce without a self-certicationprocess. After considering the comments, the Departments continue to believe it is ap-propriate to not require exempt entities tosubmit a self-certication or notice. Theprevious exemption did not require a self-certication or notice, and the Depart-ments did not collect a list of all entitiesthat used the exemption, although theremay have been thousands of houses ofworship and integrated auxiliaries coveredby the previous exemption and the De-partments think it likely that only a small number of entities will use the moral ex-emption. Adding a self-certication or no-tice to the exemption would impose anadditional paperwork burden on exemptentities that the previous regulations didnot impose, and would also involve addi-tional public costs if those certications ornotices are to be reviewed or kept on leby the government. The Departments are not aware of in- stances where the lack of a self-certicationunder the previous exemption led to abusesor to an inability to engage in enforcement.The Mandate is enforceable through variousmechanisms in the PHS Act, the Code, andERISA. Entities that insincerely or other-wise improperly operate as if they are ex-empt would do so at the risk of enforcementand accountability under such mechanisms.The Departments are not aware of sufcientreasons to believe those measures andmechanisms would fail to deter entities fromimproperly operating as if they are exempt.Moreover, as noted above, ERISA and other plan disclosure requirements governinggroup health plans require provision of acomprehensive summary of the benetscovered by the plan and disclosure of anyreductions in covered services or benets,so beneciaries will know whether theirhealth plan claims a contraceptive Mandateexemption and will be able to raise appro-priate challenges to such claims. As a con-sequence, the Departments believe it is anappropriate balance of various concerns ex-pressed by commenters for these nal rulesto continue to not require notices or self-certications for using the exemption. Some commenters asked the Depart- ments to add language indicating that anexemption cannot be invoked in the mid-dle of a plan year, nor should it be used tothe extent inconsistent with laws that ap-ply to, or state approval of, fully insuredplans. None of the previous iterations ofthe exemption regulations included suchprovisions, and the Departments do not consider them necessary in these nal rules.The exemptions in these nal rules onlypurport to exempt plans and entities fromthe application of the federal contraceptivecoverage requirement of the Guidelines is-sued under section 2713(a)(4). They do notpurport to exempt entities or plans from state laws concerning contraceptive cover-age, or laws governing whether an entitycan make a change (of whatever kind) dur-ing a plan year. Final rules governing theaccommodation likewise do not purport toobviate the need to follow otherwise appli-cable rules about making changes during aplan year. (In the companion rules concern-ing religious beliefs published elsewhere intoday's Federal Register , the Departments discuss in more detail the accommodationand when an entity seeking to revoke itwould be able to do so or to notify planparticipants of the revocation.) Commenters also asked that clauses be added to the regulatory text holding issu-ers harmless where exemptions are in-voked by plan sponsors. As discussedabove, the exemption rules already spec-ify that where an exemption applies to agroup health plan, it encompasses both thegroup health plan and health insurancecoverage provided in connection with thegroup health plan, and therefore encom- passes any impact on the issuer of thecontraceptive coverage requirement withrespect to that plan. In addition, as dis-cussed in the companion religious nalrule published elsewhere in today's Fed- eral Register , the Departments have added language from the previous regula-tions, in \u00a7 147.131(f), to protect issuersthat act in reliance on certain representa-tions made in the accommodation process.To the extent that commenters seek lan-guage offering additional protections forother incidents that might occur in con-nection with the invocation of an exemp-tion, the previous exemption regulationsdid not include such provisions, and theDepartments do not consider them neces-sary in these nal rules. As noted above,the expanded exemptions in these nalrules simply remove or narrow the contra-ceptive Mandate contained in, and derivedfrom, the Guidelines for certain plans. Theprevious regulations included a relianceclause in the accommodation provisions,but did not specify further details regard-ing the relationship between exempt enti-ties and their issuers or third party admin-istrators. The Departments do not believeit necessary to do so in these nal rules. 182See, for example, 29 U.S.C. 1022, CFR 147.200 (requir ing disclosure of the \"exceptions, reductions, and limitations of the coverage,\" including group health plans and group & individual issuers). Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 939Commenters disagreed about the likely effects of the moral exemptions on thehealth coverage market. Some comment-ers stated that expanding the exemptionsto encompass moral convictions wouldnot cause complications in the market,while others said that it could, due to such causes as a lack of uniformity amongplans, or permitting multiple risk pools.The Departments note that the extent towhich plans cover contraception under theprior regulations is already far from uni-form. Congress did not require all entitiesto comply with section 2713 of the PHSAct (under which the Mandate was pro-mulgated)\u2014most notably by exemptinggrandfathered plans. Moreover, under theprevious regulations, issuers were alreadyable to offer plans that omit contracep-tives\u2014or only some contraceptives\u2014tohouses of worship and integrated auxilia-ries, and some commenters and litigantssaid that issuers were doing so. Thesecases where plans did not need to complywith the Mandate, and the Departments'previous accommodation process whichhad the effect of allowing coverage not tobe provided in certain self-insured churchplans, together show that the importanceof a uniform health coverage system is notsignicantly harmed by allowing plans toomit contraception in some contexts. 183 Concerning the prospect raised by some commenters of different risk poolsbetween men and women, section 2713(a)of the PHS Act itself provides for somepreventive services coverage that appliesto both men and women, and some thatwould apply only to women. With respectto the latter, it does not specify what, ifanything, HRSA's Guidelines for wom-en's preventives services would cover, orif contraceptive coverage will be required.The Moral IFC and these nal rules do notrequire issuers to offer health insuranceproducts that satisfy morally objecting en-tities, they simply make it legal to do so.The Mandate has been imposed only rel-atively recently, and the contours of itsapplication to objecting entities has beenin continual flux, due to various rulemak-ings and court orders. Overall, concernsraised by some public commenters have not led the Departments to consider itlikely that offering these expanded ex-emptions will cause any injury to the uni-formity or operability of the health cover-age market. 3. Exemption for Certain Plan Sponsors (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(i)) The exemption in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i) of the Moral IFC covers a group health planand health insurance coverage for non-governmental plan sponsors that object asspecied in paragraph (a)(2), and that areeither nonprot organizations, or are for-prot entities that have no publicly tradedownership interests (dened as any classof common equity securities required tobe registered under section 12 of the Se-curities Exchange Act of 1934). The De-partments nalize this paragraph withoutchange, and discuss each part of the para-graph in turn. a. Plan sponsors in general (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(i) prefatory text) Under the plan sponsor exemption in \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(i), the prefatory text inthat paragraph species that it encom-passes group health plans, and health in-surance coverage provided in connectionwith such group health plans, that aresponsored by certain kinds of entities,namely, nonprot organizations or for-prot entities that have no publicly tradedownership interests. Such plan sponsors, if they are other- wise nonprot organizations or for-protentities that have no publicly traded own-ership interests, can include entities thatare not employers (for example, a union,or a sponsor of a multiemployer plan),where the plan sponsor objects based onsincerely held moral convictions to cover-age of contraceptives or sterilization. Plansponsors encompassed by the exemptioncan also include employers, and consistentwith the denition of \"employer\" in 29CFR 2510.3-5, can include associationhealth plans, where the plan sponsor is anonprot organization or a for-prot en-tity that has no publicly traded ownership interests. Some commenters objected to extend- ing the exemption to plan sponsors thatare not single employers, arguing that theycould not have the same kind of moralobjection that a single employer might have. Other commenters supported theprotection of any plan sponsor with therequisite moral objection. The Depart-ments conclude that it is appropriate,where a plan sponsor of a multiemployerplan or multiple employer plan adopts amoral objection using the same proce-dures that such a plan sponsor might useto make other decisions, to respect thatdecision by providing an exemption fromthe Mandate. The plans of governmental employers are not covered by the plan sponsor ex-emption in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i), which in-stead limits the moral exemptions to \"non-governmental plan sponsors.\" As notedabove, the Departments sought publiccomment on whether to extend the ex-emptions to non-federal governmentalplan sponsors. Some commenters sug-gested that the moral exemptions shouldinclude government entities because otherconscience laws can include governmententities, such as when they oppose offer-ing abortions. Others disagreed, contend-ing that governmental entities should notor cannot object based on moral convic-tions, or that it would be unlawful forthem to do so. The Departments are sympathetic to the arguments of commenters that favorincluding government entities in the ex-emption for moral convictions. The pro-tections outlined in the rst paragraph ofthe Church Amendments for entities thatobject based on moral convictions to mak-ing their facilities or personnel availableto assist in the performance of abortionsor sterilizations do not turn on the natureof the entity, whether public, private, non-prot, for-prot, or governmental. (42U.S.C. 300a-7(b)). Both the Weldon andCoats-Snowe Amendments also protectstate and local government entities fromproviding, promoting, or paying for abor- 183See also Real Alternatives , 867 F.3d 338, 389 (3d Cir. 2017) (Jordan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"Because insurance companies would offer such plans as a resu lt of market forces, doing so would not undermine the government's interest in a sustainable and functioning market .... Because the government has failed to demonstrate why allowing such a system (not unlike the one that allowed wider choice before the ACA) would be unworkable, it has not satised strict scrutiny.\" (citation and interna l quotation marks omitted)). December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 940tions in particular ways.184Congress has generally not limited protections for con-science based on the nature of an entity\u2014even in the case of governmental entities. At the same time, the Departments do not at this time have information suggest-ing that an exemption for governmentalentities is needed or desired. The Depart-ments have not been sued by any govern-mental entities raising objections to theMandate based on non-religious moralconvictions. Although the Departmentssought public comment on the issue, theDepartments received no public com-ments identifying governmental entitiesthat need or desire such an exemption.Rather, the Departments are aware of gov-ernmental entities that, despite not pos-sessing their own objections to contracep-tive coverage, have acted to protect theiremployees who have conscientious objec-tions to receiving contraceptive coveragein their employer-provided health insur-ance plans. See Wieland v. U.S. 191.724). The individualexemption adopted in these rules will en-sure the Mandate is not an obstacle tothose efforts. Thus, in light of the balance of public comments, the Departments decline to ex-tend the moral convictions exemption togovernmental entities. As is the case withthe Departments' decision not to extendthe moral exemption to publicly tradedfor-prot entities, this decision does notreflect a disagreement with the variousconscience statutes that provide exemp-tions for moral convictions without cate-gorically excluding governmental entities.The Departments remain open to the pos-sibility of future rulemaking on this issueif the Departments become aware of agovernmental entity seeking to be exemptfrom the contraceptive Mandate. b. Nonprot organizations (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(i)(A)) As discussed above, some commenters opposed offering exemptions based onmoral convictions to any plan sponsors, and/or objected to doing so for nonprotorganizations, on various grounds, includ-ing but not limited to arguments that thebenets of contraception access shouldoverride moral objections, entities cannotassert moral objections, and moral objec-tions burden third parties. Other com-menters supported the exemptions, gener-ally defending the interest of nonprotorganizations not to be forced to violatetheir moral convictions, supporting thehistory of government protection of moralconvictions in similar contexts, and dis-puting the claims of opponents of the ex-emptions. The Departments are aware, through litigation, of only two non-religious non-prot organizations with moral objectionsto the contraceptive Mandate. Many morenonprot religious organizations havesued suggesting\u2014as discussed below\u2014that the effect of this exemption for non-religious nonprot objections to the Man-date will be far less signicant thancommenters who oppose the exemptionbelieve it will.. The two non-religiousnonprot organizations that challengedthe Mandate in court provide a good illus-tration of the reasons why the Departmenthas decided to provide this exemption tononprot organizations. Both organiza-tions have said in court they oppose cer-tain contraceptives on non-religious moralgrounds as being abortifacient and statethat they only hire employees who sharethat view. Public comments and litigationreflect that many nonprot organizationspublicly describe their beliefs and convic-tions. Government records and many ofthose groups' websites also often reflectthose groups' religious or moral character,as the case may be. If a person who de-sires contraceptive coverage works at anonprot organization, the Departmentsview it as sufciently likely that the per-son would know, or would know to ask,whether the organization offers such cov-erage. The Departments are not aware offederal laws that would require a nonprotorganization that opposes contraceptivecoverage to hire a person who disagreeswith the organization's view on contra- ceptive coverage. Instead, nonprot orga-nizations generally have access to a FirstAmendment right of expressive associa-tion to choose to hire persons (or, in thecase of students, to admit them) based onwhether they share, or at least will berespectful of, their beliefs. 185 The Departments agree with comment- ers who support offering the exemption tononprot organizations and believe thatdoing so is an appropriate protection andis not likely to have a signicant impacton women who want contraceptive cover-age. c. For-Prot Entities (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(i)(B)) With respect organizations addressed in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(i)(B), in theMoral IFC, the Departments did not also included some for-prot entities.Some commenters supported includingfor-prot entities in the exemption, sayingowners of such entities exercise theirmoral convictions through their busi-nesses, and that such owners should not beburdened by a federal governmental con-traceptive Mandate. Other commentersopposed extending the exemption toclosely held for-prot entities, saying theentities cannot exercise moral convictionsor should not have their moral oppositionto contraceptive coverage protected by theexemption. Some commenters stated thatthe entities should not be able to imposetheir beliefs about contraceptive coverageon their employees and that doing so con-stitutes discrimination. The Departments agree with comment- ers who support including some for-protentities in the exemption. Many of thefederal health care conscience statutescited above offer protections for the moralconvictions of entities, without regard towhether they operate as nonprot organi-zations or for-prot entities. In addition,nearly half of the states either impose nocontraceptive coverage requirement or of-fer \"an almost unlimited\" exemption en- 184Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Div.

Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 941compassing both \"religious and secular organizations.\"186States also generally protect moral convictions in other healthcare conscience laws whether or not anentity operates as a nonprot. 187 Extending the exemption to certain for- prot entities is also consistent with theSupreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby , which declared that a corporate entity iscapable of possessing and pursuing non-pecuniary goals (in Hobby Lobby , the pur- suit of religious beliefs), regardless ofwhether the entity operates as a nonprotorganization and rejected the Depart-ments' argument to the contrary. 134 S.Ct. at 2768-75. The mechanisms bywhich a for-prot company makes deci-sions of conscience, or resolves disputeson those issues among their owners, areproblems that \"state corporate law pro-vides a ready means\" of solving. Id.at 2774-75. Some reports and industry ex-perts have indicated that few for-protentities beyond those that had originallychallenged the Mandate have sought relieffrom it after Hobby Lobby . 188Because all of those appear to be informed by reli-gious beliefs, extending the exemption toentities with non-religious moral convic-tions would seem to have an even smallerimpact on access to contraceptive cover-age. The Moral IFC only extended the ex- emption covering for-prot entities tothose that are closely held, not to for-protentities that are publicly traded, but askedfor comment on whether publicly tradedentities should be included in the moralexemption. In this way the Moral IFCdiffered from the exemption provided toplan sponsors with objections based onsincerely held religious beliefs set forth inthe Religious IFC, at \u00a7 147.132(a)(1), -nalized in in today's Federal Register . Some commenters supported including publicly traded entities in the moral ex- emption, contending that publicly tradedentities have historically taken various po-sitions on important public concerns be-yond merely seeking the company's ownprots, and that nothing in principle would preclude them from using the samemechanisms of corporate decision-makingto establish and exercise moral convic-tions against contraceptive coverage.They observed that large publicly tradedentities are exempt from the contraceptiveMandate by means of the grandfatheringprovision of the ACA, so that it is inap-propriate to refuse to exempt publiclytraded entities that actually have sincerelyheld moral convictions against compli-ance with the Mandate. They further ar-gued that in some instances there areclosely held companies that are as large aspublicly traded companies of signicantsize. They also stated that other protec-tions for moral convictions in certain fed-eral health care conscience statutes do notpreclude the application of such protec-tions to certain entities on the basis thatthey are not closely held, and federal lawdenes \"persons\" to include all forms ofcorporations, not just closely held corpo-rations, at 1 U.S.C. 1. Additionally, somecommenters were concerned that not pro-viding a moral exemption for publiclytraded for-prot entities but allowing areligious exemption for publicly tradedfor-prot entities (as was allowed in theReligious IFC, and as is allowed in thecompanion religious nal rules publishedelsewhere in today's Federal Register ), may raise Establishment Clause ques-tions, may cause confusion to the public,and may make the exemptions more dif-cult for the Departments and enforcingagencies to administer. They stated that itis incongruous to include publicly tradedentities in the exemption for religious be-liefs, but exclude them from the exemp-tion for moral convictions. Other commenters opposed including publicly traded companies in these moralexemptions. Some stated that such com-panies could not exercise moral convic-tions and opposed the effects on women if they would. They also objected that in-cluding such companies, along withclosely held businesses, would extend theexemptions to all or virtually all compa-nies. Some commenters stated that many publicly traded companies would use amoral exemption if available to them, be-cause many closely held for-prot busi-nesses expressed religious objections tothe Mandate, or availed themselves of thereligious accommodation. As is the case for non-federal govern- mental employers, the Departments aresympathetic to the arguments of com-menters that favor including publiclytraded entities in the exemption for moralconvictions. In the case of particularlysensitive health care matters, several sig-nicant federal health care consciencestatutes protect entities' moral objectionswithout regard to their ownership status.For example, the rst paragraph of theChurch Amendments provides certainprotections for entities that object basedon moral convictions to making their fa-cilities or personnel available to assist inthe performance of abortions or steriliza-tions; the protections of the ChurchAmendments do not turn on the nature ofthe entity, whether public, private, non-prot, for-prot, or governmental. (42U.S.C. 300a-7(b)). Thus, under section300a-7(b), a hospital in a publicly tradedhealth system, or a local governmentalhospital, could adopt sincerely held moralconvictions by which it objects to provid-ing facilities or personnel for abortions orsterilizations, and if the entity receivesrelevant funds from HHS specied by sec-tion 300a-7(b), the protections of that sec-tion would apply. Other federal con-science protections in the health sectorapply in the same manner: The Coats-Snowe Amendment (42 U.S.C. 238n) provides certain protec-tions for health care entities and post-graduate physician training programs that, among other things, choose not toperform, refer for, or provide trainingfor, abortions. The Weldon Amendment 189provides certain protections for health care en-tities, hospitals, provider-sponsoredorganizations, health maintenance or- 186\"Insurance Coverage of Contraceptives,\" The Guttmacher (June 11, 2018), ce-coverage-contraceptives. , \"Refusing to Provide 2018), https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/refusing- provide-health-services. 188See Jennifer Haberkorn, \"Two years later, few Hobby copycats emerge,\" Politico (Oct. 11, 2016), http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obamacare-birth-control-mandate- employers-229627. 189See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub.

The ACA provides certain protections for any institutional health care entity,hospital, provider-sponsored organiza-tion, health maintenance organization,health insurance plan, or any otherkind of health care facility, that doesnot provide any health care item orservice furnished for the purpose ofcausing or assisting in causing assistedsuicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing.(42 U.S.C. 18113). 190 Social Security sections and 1932(b)(3)(B)(Medicaid), 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and 1396u-2(b)(3)(B),provide protections so that the statutescannot be construed to require organi-zations that offer Medicare Advantageand Medicaid managed care plans incertain contexts to provide, reimbursefor, or provide coverage of a counsel-ing or referral service if they object to doing so on moral grounds. Congress's most recent statement on contraceptive coverage specied that,if the District of Columbia requires\"the provision of contraceptive cover-age by health insurance plans,\" \"it isthe intent of Congress that any legis-lation enacted on such issue shouldinclude a 'conscience clause' whichprovides exceptions for religious Act, 2018, Pub.L. 115-141, Div. E, Sec. 808. In all of these instances, Congress did notlimit the protection for conscience basedon the nature of the entity\u2014and did notexclude publicly traded entities from pro-tection. At the same time, as stated in the Moral IFC, the Departments continue to lack sig-nicant information about whether thereis a need to extend the expanded exemp-tion to publicly traded entities. The De-partments have been sued by nonprotentities expressing objections to the Man-date based on non-religious moral convic-tions, as well as by closely held for-protentities expressing religious objections,but not by any publicly traded entities. Inaddition, the Departments sought public comments on whether publicly traded en-tities might benet from extending themoral exemption to them. No such entitieswere brought to the attention of the De-partment through the comment process.The Supreme Court concluded it is im-probable that publicly traded companieswith numerous \"unrelated shareholders\u2014including institutional investors with theirown set of stakeholders\u2014would agree torun a corporation under the same religiousbeliefs.\" Hobby Lobby , 134 S. Ct. at 2774. It would appear to be even less probablethat publicly traded entities would adoptthat view based on non-religious moralconvictions. In light of the balance of public com- ments, the Departments decline to extendthe moral convictions exemption to pub-licly traded entities. Because the Depart-ments are aware of so many closely-heldfor-prot entities with religious objectionsto contraceptive coverage, and of somenonprot entities with non-religious moral objections to contraceptive coverage, theDepartments believe it is reasonably pos-sible that closely held for-prot entitieswith non-religious moral objections tocontraceptive coverage might exist orcome into being. The Departments havealso concluded that it is reasonably possi-ble, even if improbable, that publiclytraded entities with religious objections tocontraceptive coverage might exist orcome into being. But the Departmentsconclude there is not a similar probabilitythat publicly traded for-prot entities withnon-religious moral objections to contra-ceptive coverage may exist and need to beincluded in these expanded exemptions.The decision to not extend the moral ex-emption to publicly traded for-prot enti-ties in these rules does not reflect a dis-agreement with the various consciencestatutes that provide exemptions for moralconvictions without categorically exclud-ing publicly traded entities. The Depart-ments remain open to the possibility offuture rulemaking on this issue, if we be-come aware of the need to expand theexemptions to publicly traded corpora-tions with non-religious moral objectionsto all (or a subset of) contraceptives.In contrast, the Departments nalize, without change, the Moral IFC's exten-sion of the exemptions in these rules toclosely held for-prot entities with moralconvictions opposed to offering coverageof some or all contraceptives. The Depart-ments conclude that it is sufciently likelythat closely held for-prot entities exist ormay come into being and may maintainmoral objections to certain contraceptives,so as to support including them in theseexpanded exemptions. The Departments seek to remove an obstacle that mightprevent individuals with moral objectionsfrom forming or maintaining such smallor closely held businesses and providinghealth coverage to their employees in ac-cordance with their moral convictions. In dening what constitutes a closely held for-prot entity to which these ex-emptions extend, the Moral IFC used lan-guage derived from the July 2015 nalregulations. Those regulations, in offeringthe accommodation (not an exemption) toreligious (not moral) closely held for-prot entities, did so by attempting topositively dene what constitutes aclosely held entity, formulating a multi-factor, and partially open-ended, deni-tion for that purpose. (80 FR 41313). Anysuch positive denition runs up againstthe myriad state differences in deningsuch entities and potentially intrudes intoa traditional area of state regulation ofbusiness organizations. Instead of at-tempting to positively dene closely heldbusinesses in the Moral IFC, however, theDepartments considered it much clearer,effective, and preferable to dene the cat-egory negatively, by reference to one el-ement of the previous denition: that theentity has no publicly traded ownershipinterest (that is, any class of common eq-uity securities required to be registeredunder section 12 of the Securities Ex-change Act of 1934). 4. Institutions of Higher Education (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(ii)) The previous regulations did not ex- empt plans arranged by institutions ofhigher education, although they did in-clude, in the accommodation, plans ar- 190The lack of the limitation in this provision may be particularly relevant since it was enacted in the same statute, the ACA, as the provision under which the Mandate\u2014and these exemptions to the Mandate\u2014were promulgated. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 943ranged by institutions of higher education similarly to the way in which the regula-tions provided the accommodation toplans of nonprot religious employers.(See 80 exemption, \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii), encompassing institutions ofhigher education that arrange studenthealth insurance coverage, and stating theexemption would operate in a mannercomparable to the exemption for employ-ers with respect to plans they sponsor. Inthese nal rules, the Departments nalize\u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii) with one change. These rules treat the health plans of institutions of higher education that ar-range student health insurance coveragesimilarly to the way in which the rulestreat the plans of employers. The rules doso by making such student health planseligible for the expanded exemptions, and by permitting them the option of electing toutilize the accommodation process. Thus,these rules specify, in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii),that the exemption is extended, in the caseof institutions of higher education (as de-ned in 20 U.S.C. 1002) with objections tothe Mandate based on sincerely held moralconvictions, to their arrangement of studenthealth insurance coverage, in a mannercomparable to the exemption for grouphealth insurance coverage provided in con-nection with a group health plan establishedor maintained by a plan sponsor. Some commenters supported includ- ing, in the exemptions, institutions ofhigher education that provide health cov-erage for students through student healthplans but have moral objections to provid-ing certain contraceptive coverage. Theystated that moral exemptions allow free-dom for certain institutions of higher ed-ucation to exist, and this in turn givesstudents the choice of institutions thathold different views on important issues such as contraceptives and abortifacients.Other commenters opposed including theexemption, asserting that expanding theexemption would negatively impact fe-male students because institutions ofhigher education might not cover contra-ceptives in student health plans, womenenrolled in those plans would not receiveaccess to birth control, and an increasednumber of unintended pregnancies wouldresult.In the Departments' view, the reasons for extending the exemption to institutionsof higher education are similar to the rea-sons, discussed above, for extending theexemption to other nonprot organiza-tions. The Departments are not aware ofany institutions of higher education thatarrange student health insurance coverageand object to the Mandate based on non-religious moral convictions. But becausethe Departments have been sued by sev-eral institutions of higher education thatarrange student health insurance coverageand object to the Mandate based on reli-gious beliefs and by several nonprot or-ganizations with moral objections, theDepartments believe the existence of in-stitutions of higher education with non-religious moral objections, or the possibleformation of such entities in the future, issufciently possible to justify includingprotections for such entities in these nalrules. The Departments conclude that this as- pect of the exemption is likely to have a minimal impact on contraceptive cover-age for women at institutions of highereducation. As noted above, the Depart-ments are not aware of any institutions ofhigher education that would currentlyqualify for the objection. In addition, onlya minority of students in higher educationreceive health insurance coverage fromplans arranged by their colleges or univer-sities, as opposed to from other sources,and an even smaller number receive suchcoverage from schools objecting to con-traceptive coverage. Exempting institu-tions of higher education that object tocontraceptive coverage based on moralconvictions does not affect student healthinsurance contraceptive coverage at thevast majority of institutions of higher ed-ucation. The exemption simply makes itlegal under federal law for institutions toadhere to moral convictions that opposecontraception, without facing penalties fornon-compliance that could threaten theirexistence. This removes a possible barrierto diversity in the nation's higher educa-tion system, because it makes it easier forstudents to attend institutions of highereducation that hold those views, if theinstitutions exist or come into being andstudents choose to attend them. Moreover,because institutions of higher educationhave no legal obligation to sponsor stu-dent health insurance coverage, providing this moral exemption removes an obstacleto such institutions sponsoring studenthealth insurance coverage, thus possiblyencouraging more widespread health in-surance coverage. As noted above, after seeking public comment on whether the nal moral ex-emptions rules should be extended to in-clude non-federal governmental entities,the Departments have concluded theyshould only include non-governmental en-tities. For the same reasons, the Depart-ments are inserting a reference into\u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii) specifying that it in-cludes an institution of higher education\"which is non-governmental.\" This lan-guage is parallel to the same limitingphrase used in the religious exemptionsrule governing institutions of higher edu-cation, at \u00a7 147.132(a)(1)(ii). in 20 U.S.C. 1002,which is non-governmental, in its arrange-ment of student health insurance coverage, to the extent that institution objects as spec-ied in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\" Theremaining text of \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(ii) is -nalized without change. 5. Health Insurance Issuers (45 CFR 147.133(a)(1)(iii)) The Moral IFC extended the exemp- tion, in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii), to health in- surance issuers offering group or individualhealth insurance coverage that sincerelyhold their own moral convictions opposedto providing coverage for contraceptive ser-vices. The issuer exemption only applied tothe group health plan if the plan itself wasalso exempt under an exemption for the plansponsor or individuals. In these nal rules,the Departments nalize \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii)without change. As discussed above, where the exemp- tion for plan sponsors or institutions ofhigher education applies, issuers are ex- empt under those sections with respect toproviding contraceptive coverage in thoseplans. The issuer exemption in \u00a7 147.133(a)(1)(iii) adds to that protection, but the addi-tional protection operates in a different waythan the plan sponsor exemption operates.The only plan sponsors\u2014or in the case ofindividual insurance coverage, individu- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 944als\u2014who are eligible to purchase or enroll in health insurance coverage offered by anexempt issuer that does not cover some orall contraceptive services, are plan sponsorsor individuals who themselves object andwhose plans are otherwise exempt based onthat objection. An exempt issuer can thenoffer an exempt product to an entity or in-dividual that is exempt based on either themoral exemptions for entities and individu-als, or the religious exemptions for entitiesand individuals. Thus, the issuer exemptionspecies that, where a health insurance is-suer providing group health insurance cov-erage is exempt under paragraph (a)(1)(iii),the plan remains subject to any requirementto provide coverage for contraceptive ser-vices under Guidelines issued under\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), unless the plan is oth-erwise exempt from that requirement. Ac-cordingly, the only plan sponsors, or in thecase of individual insurance coverage, indi-viduals, who are eligible to purchase or en-roll in health insurance coverage offered byan exempt issuer under this paragraph(a)(1)(iii) that does not include some or allcontraceptive services, are plan sponsors orindividuals who themselves object and areexempt. Under these rules, issuers that hold their own objections based on sincerelyheld moral convictions could issue poli-cies that omit contraception to plan spon-sors or individuals that are otherwise ex-empt based on their moral convictions, orif they are exempt based on their religiousbeliefs under the companion nal rulespublished elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Likewise, issuers with sincerely held religious beliefs, that are exempt un-der those companion nal rules, couldlikewise issue policies that omit contra-ception to plan sponsors or individuals that are otherwise exempt based on eithertheir religious beliefs or their moral con-victions. Some commenters supported including this exemption for issuers in these rules,both to protect the moral convictions ofissuers, and so that, in the future, issuerswould be free to organize that may wish to specically serve plan sponsors and indi-viduals that object to contraception basedon religious or moral reasons. Other com-menters objected to including an exemp-tion for issuers. Some commenters statedthat issuers cannot exercise moral convic-tions, while others stated that exemptingissuers would threaten contraceptive cov-erage for women. Some commentersstated that it was arbitrary and capriciousfor the Departments to provide an exemp-tion for issuers if they do not know thatissuers with qualifying moral objectionsexist. The Departments consider it appropri- ate to provide this exemption for issuers.Because the issuer exemption only applieswhere an independently exempt policy-holder (entity or individual) is involved,the issuer exemption will not serve to re-move contraceptive coverage obligationsfrom any plan or plan sponsor that is notalso exempt, nor will it prevent other is-suers from being required to provide con-traceptive coverage in individual or groupinsurance coverage. The issuer exemption serves several interests, even though the Departments arenot currently aware of existing issuers thatwould use it. As noted by some comment-ers, allowing issuers to be exempt, at leastwith respect to plan sponsors, plans, andindividuals that independently qualify foran exemption, will remove a possible ob-stacle to issuers with moral convictionsbeing organized in the future to serve en-tities and individuals that want plans thatrespect their religious beliefs or moralconvictions. Furthermore, permitting issu-ers to object to offering contraceptive cov-erage based on sincerely held moral con-victions will allow issuers to continue to offer coverage to plan sponsors and indi-viduals, without subjecting them to liabil-ity under section 2713(a)(4), or relatedprovisions, for their failure to providecontraceptive coverage. In this way, theissuer exemption serves to protect object-ing issuers both from being required toissue policies that cover contraception in violation of the issuers' sincerely heldmoral convictions and from being askedor required to issue policies that omit con-traceptive coverage to non-exempt entitiesor individuals, thus subjecting the issuersto potential liability if those plans are notexempt from the Guidelines. The Departments reject the proposition that issuers cannot exercise moral convic- tions. Many federal health care consciencelaws and regulations protect issuers or plansspecically. For example, as discussedabove, 42 U.S.C. 1395w-22(j)(3)(B) and1396u-2(b)(3) protect plans or managedcare organizations in Medicare Advantageor Medicaid. The Weldon Amendment spe-cically protects, among other entities,HMOs, health insurance plans, and \"anyother kind of health care facility[ies], orga-nization[s] or plan[s]\" as a \"health care en-tity\" from being required to provide cover-age of, or pay for, abortions. See, forexample, Consolidated Appropriations Act,2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, Div. H, Sec.507(d). 191The most recently enacted Con- Act declares thatCongress supports a \"conscience clause\" toprotect moral convictions concerning \"theprovision of contraceptive coverage byhealth insurance plans.\" See id. at Div. E, Sec. 808. The issuer exemption does not specif- ically include third party administrators,for the reasons discussed in the compan-ion Religious IFC and nal rules concern-ing religious beliefs issued contemporane-ously with these nal rules and publishedelsewhere in today's Federal Register . 192 6. Description of the Moral Objection (45 CFR 147.133(a)(2)) The Moral IFC set forth the scope of the moral objection of objecting entities in\u00a7 147.133(a)(2), so that it applies to theextent an entity described in paragraph(a)(1), based on sincerely held moral con-victions, objects to \"establishing, main-taining, providing, offering, care entities,\" including provider-sponsored organizations, HMOs, health insurance plans, and \"any other kind o f... plan,\" from being subject to discrimination on the basis that it does not provide any health care item or service furnishing for the purpose of assisted suicide, euthanasia, mercy killing, and the like. ACA section 1553, 42 U.S.C. 18113. 192The exemption for issuers, as outlined here, does not make a distinction among issuers based on whether they are publicly traded, unlike the plan spons or exemption for employers. Because the issuer exemption operates more narrowly than the exemption for plan sponsors operates, in the ways described here (i.e., the issuer exemp tion does not operate unless the plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, is also exempt), and exists in part to help preserve market options for objecting plan sponsors and individuals , the Departments consider it appropriate to not draw such a distinction among issuers. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 945ceptives, or \"for a plan, issuer, or third party administrator that provides or ar-ranges such coverage or payments.\" TheDepartments are nalizing this exemptionwith structural changes separating the sec-ond half of the sentence into separate sub-paragraphs, so as to more clearly specify,as set forth in the Moral IFC text, that theobjection may pertain either to coverageor payments for contraceptives, or to aplan, issuer, or third party administratorthat provides or arranges such coverage orpayments. Some commenters observed that, by allowing exempt plan sponsors to objectto \"some or all\" contraceptives, this mightyield a cafeteria-style approach where dif-ferent plan sponsors choose various com-binations of contraceptives that they wishto cover. Some commenters further ob-served that this might create a burden onissuers or third party administrators. The Departments have concluded, however, that just as the previous exemp-tion rules allowed certain religious plan sponsors to object to some or all contra-ceptives, it is appropriate to maintain thatflexibility for entities covered by the ex-panded exemption. These rules do not re-quire any issuer or third party administra-tor to contract with an exempt entity orindividual if the issuer or third party ad-ministrator does not wish to do so, includ-ing because the issuer or third party ad-ministrator does not wish to offer anunusual plan variation. These rules simplyremove the federal Mandate, in somecases, where it could have led to penaltieson an employer, issuer, or third party ad-ministrator if they wished to sponsor, pro-vide, or administer a plan that omits con-traceptive coverage in the presence of aqualifying moral objection. That approachis consistent with the approach under theprevious regulations, which did not re-quire issuers and third party administra-tors to contract with exempt plans ofhouses of worship or integrated auxiliariesif they did not wish to do so. The denition does not specify that the moral convictions that can support an ex-emption need to be non-religious moralconvictions. We nd it unnecessary tolimit the denition in that way. Eventhough moral convictions need not bebased on religious beliefs, religious be-liefs can have a moral component. It is notalways clear whether a moral conviction is based on religious tenets. As noted inWelsh , a moral conviction can be \"purely ethical or moral in source and content butthat nevertheles s... occupy in the life of that individual a place parallel to thatlled by God [and] function as a religionin his life.\" 398 U.S at 340. One reason forproviding exemptions for moral convic-tions is so that the government need notengage in the potentially difcult task ofparsing which convictions are religiousand which are not. If sincerely held moralconvictions supporting an exemption arereligious, they will be encompassed by theexemption for sincerely held religious be-liefs. If the moral convictions are not alsoreligious, or if their religious quality isunclear but they are ethical or moral, theycan qualify as sincerely held moral con-victions under these rules if the other re-quirements of these rules are met. The Departments are not aware of any entities that qualify for an exemption un-der the religious exemptions nalizedelsewhere in today's Federal Register , but not under the moral exemptions nal-ized here, such as publicly traded entities.If publicly traded entities object to theMandate, it seems unlikely their objectionis based on moral convictions and notreligious beliefs, given that many moreobjections to the Mandate have beenbased on religious beliefs. Thus, the De-partments nd it unlikely that they wouldbe faced with a situation where a publiclytraded entity, for example, has an objec-tion to the contraceptive Mandate, but it isnot clear whether that objection is basedon sincerely held religious beliefs ormerely based on sincerely held moral con-victions. 7. Individuals (45 CFR 147.133(b)) The previous regulations did not provide an exemption for objecting individuals. TheMoral IFC provided such an exemption forobjecting individuals (referred to here as the\"individual exemption\"), using the follow- ing HealthResources and Services Administrationmust not provide for or support the re-quirement of coverage or payments forcontraceptive services with respect toindividuals who object as specied in this paragraph (b), and nothing in\u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv), 26 CFR 54.9815-2713(a)(1)(iv), or 29 CFR 2590.715-2713(a)(1)(iv) may be construed to pre-vent a willing health insurance issueroffering group or individual health in-surance coverage, and as applicable, awilling plan sponsor of a group healthplan, from offering a separate policy,certicate or contract of insurance or aseparate group health plan or benetpackage option, to any individual whoobjects to coverage or payments forsome or all contraceptive services basedon sincerely held moral convictions.\" The Departments nalize this lan- guage, with changes in response to publiccomments in some of the text and in a newsentence at the end of the paragraph thatclarify how the exemption applies. Section 147.133(b) sets forth a special rule pertaining to individuals (referred tohere as the \"individual exemption\"). Thisrule exempts plans of certain individuals with moral objections to contraceptivecoverage where the plan sponsor and, asapplicable, issuer is willing to provide aplan compliant with the individuals' ob-jections to such plan sponsors or individ-uals, as applicable. Some commenters supported this ex- emption as providing appropriate protec-tions for the moral convictions of individ-uals who obtain their insurance coveragein such places as the individual market orexchanges, or who obtain coverage from agroup health plan sponsor that does notobject to coverage of contraceptives but iswilling (and, as applicable, the issuer isalso willing) to provide coverage consis-tent with an individual's moral objections.They commented that this exemptionwould free individuals from having theirmoral convictions placed in tension withtheir desire for health coverage. They alsocontended that the individual exemptionwould not undermine any government in-terests behind the contraceptive Mandate,since the individuals would be choosingnot to have the coverage. Some comment-ers also observed that, by specifying thatthe individual exemption only operateswhere the plan sponsor and issuer, as ap-plicable, are willing to provide coveragethat is consistent with the objection, theexemption would not impose burdens on December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 946the insurance market because the possibil- ity of such burdens would be factored intothe willingness of an employer or issuer tooffer such coverage. Other commenters disagreed and con- tended that allowing the individual ex-emption would cause burden and confu-sion in the insurance market. Somecommenters also suggested that the indi-vidual exemption should not allow theoffering of a separate group health planbecause doing so could cause various ad-ministrative burdens. The Departments agree with the com- menters who suggested the individual ex-emption will not burden the insurancemarket, and, therefore, conclude that it isappropriate to provide the individual ex-emption where a plan sponsor and, asapplicable, issuer are willing to cooperatein doing so. The Departments note thatthis individual exemption only operates inthe case where the issuer is willing toprovide the separate option; in the case ofcoverage provided by a group health plan sponsor, where the plan sponsor is will-ing; or in the case where both a plansponsor and issuer are involved, both arewilling. The Departments conclude that itis appropriate to provide the individualexemption so that the Mandate will notserve as an obstacle among these variousoptions. Practical difculties that may beimplicated by one option or another willlikely be factored into whether plan spon-sors and issuers are willing to offer par-ticular options in individual cases. But theDepartments do not wish to pose an ob-stacle to the offering of such coverage. The Departments note that their deci- sion is consistent with the decision by Congress to provide protections in cer-tain contexts for individuals who objectto prescribing or providing contracep-tives contrary to their moral convic-tions. See, for example , Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Div. E,Sec. 726(c) (Mar. 23, 2018). Whilesome commenters argued that such ex-press protections are narrow, Congresslikewise provided that, if the District ofColumbia requires \"the provision ofcontraceptive coverage by health insur-ance plans,\" \"it is the intent of Congressthat any legislation enacted on such is-sue should include a 'conscience clause'which provides exceptions for religiousbeliefs and moral convictions\". Id.at Div. E, Sec. 808. A moral exemption forindividuals would not be effective if thegovernment did not, at the same time,permit issuers and group health plans toprovide individuals with policies thatcomply with their moral convictions. The individual exemption extends to the coverage unit in which the plan par-ticipant, or subscriber in the individualmarket, is enrolled (for instance, to familycoverage covering the participant and hisor her beneciaries enrolled under theplan), but does not relieve the plan's orissuer's obligation to comply with theMandate with respect to the group healthplan generally, or, as applicable, to anyother individual policies the issuer offers.Thus, this individual exemption allowsplan sponsors and issuers that do not spe-cically object to contraceptive coverageto offer morally acceptable coverage totheir participants or subscribers who doobject, while offering coverage that in-cludes contraception to participants or subscribers who do not object. The July2013 regulations stated that, because em-ployees of objecting houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries are relativelylikely to oppose requirement.\"(78 FR 39874). For parallel reasons, theDepartments stated in Moral IFC (83FR at 47853 through 47854), this individ-ual exemption does undermine thegovernmental interests furthered by thecontraceptive coverage requirement, be-cause, when the exemption is applicable,the individual does not want the coverage,and therefore would not use the objection-able items even if they were covered. This individual exemption can apply with respect to individuals in plans spon-sored by private employers or governmen-tal employers. For example, in one casebrought against the Departments, the Stateof Missouri enacted a law under whichthe state is not permitted to discriminateagainst insurance issuers that offer group health insurance policies without coveragefor contraception based on employees' reli-gious beliefs \"or moral convictions,\" such See Wieland , 196 F. Supp. 3d at 1015-16 (quoting Mo. Rev. Stat.191.724). Under the individual exemption in these rules, employers sponsoring gov-ernmental plans would be free to honor themoral objections of individual employeesby offering them plans that omit contracep-tive coverage, even if those governmentalentities do not object to offering contracep-tive coverage in general. In the separate companion IFC to the Moral IFC\u2014the Religious IFC\u2014the De-partments, at \u00a7 147.133(b), provided asimilar individual but we usedslightly different operative language.Where the Moral IFC said a willing issuerand plan sponsor may offer \"a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insuranceor a separate group health plan or benetpackage option, to any individual whoobjects\" under the individual exemption,the Religious IFC described what may beoffered to objecting individuals as \"a sep-arate benet package option, or a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insur-ance.\" Some commenters observed thisdifference and asked whether the lan- guage was intended to encompass thesame options. The Departments intendedthese descriptions to include the samescope of options. Some commenters sug-gested that the individual exemptionshould not allow the offering of \"a sepa-rate group health plan,\" because doing socould cause various administrative bur-dens. The Departments disagree, sincegroup health plan sponsors and group andindividual health insurance issuers wouldbe free to decline to provide that option,including because of administrative bur-dens. In addition, the Departments wish toclarify that, where an employee claims theexemption, a willing issuer and a willingemployer may, where otherwise permit-ted, offer the employee participation in agroup health insurance policy or benetoption that complies with the employee'sobjection. Consequently, these rules nal-ize the individual exemption by making atechnical change to the language to adoptthe formulation, \"a separate policy, certif-icate or contract of insurance or a separategroup health plan or benet package op-tion, to any group health plan sponsor(with respect to an individual) or individ-ual, as applicable, who objects.\" This individual exemption cannot be used to force a plan (or its sponsor) or anissuer to provide coverage omitting con- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 947traception, or, with respect to health insur- ance coverage, to prevent the applicationof state law that requires coverage of suchcontraceptives or sterilization. Nor can theindividual exemption be construed to re-quire the guaranteed availability of cover-age omitting contraception to a plan spon-sor or individual who does not have asincerely held moral objection. This indi-vidual exemption is limited to the require-ment to provide contraceptive coverageunder section 2713(a)(4), and does notaffect any other federal or state law gov-erning the plan or coverage. Thus, if thereare other applicable laws or plan termsgoverning the benets, these rules do notaffect such other laws or terms. The Departments received numerous comments about the administrative bur-den from the potential variations in moralconvictions held by individuals. Somecommenters welcomed the ability of indi-viduals covered by the individual exemp-tion to be able to assert an objection toeither some or all contraceptives, while others expressed concern that the varia-tions in the kinds of contraceptive cover-age to which individuals object mightmake it difcult for willing plan sponsorsand issuers to provide coverage that com-plies with the moral convictions of anexempt individual. If an individual only objects to some contraceptives, and the individual's issuerand, as applicable, plan sponsor are will-ing to provide the individual a package ofbenets omitting such coverage, but forpractical reasons can only do so by pro-viding the individual with coverage thatomits all\u2014not just some\u2014contraceptives,the Departments believe that it favors in-dividual freedom and market choice, anddoes not harm others, to allow the issuerand plan sponsor to provide, in that case,a plan omitting all contraceptives if theindividual is willing to enroll in that plan.The language of the individual exemptionset forth in the Moral IFC implied thisconclusion by specifying that the Guide-lines requirement of contraceptive cover-age did not apply where the individualobjected to some or all contraceptives.Notably, that language differed from thelanguage applicable to the exemptions un-der \u00a7 147.133(a), which species thatthose exemptions apply \"to the extent\" ofthe moral objections, so that, as discussedabove, they include only those contracep- tive methods to which the objection ap-plied. In response to comments suggestingthe language of the individual exemptionwas not sufciently clear on this distinc-tion, however, the Departments in theserules nalize the individual exemption at\u00a7 147.133(b), with the following change,by adding the following sentence at theend of the paragraph: \"Under this exemp-tion, if an individual objects to some butnot all contraceptive services, but the is-suer, and as applicable, plan sponsor, arewilling to provide the plan sponsor orindividual, as applicable, with a separatepolicy, certicate or contract of insuranceor a separate group health plan or benetpackage option that omits all contracep-tives, and the individual agrees, then theexemption applies as if the individual ob-jects to all contraceptive services.\" Some commenters asked for plain lan- guage guidance and examples about howthe individual exemption might apply inthe context of employer-sponsored insur-ance. Here is one such example. An em-ployee is enrolled in group health cover-age through her employer. The plan isfully insured. If the employee has sin-cerely held moral convictions objecting toher plan including coverage for contracep-tives, she could raise this with her em-ployer. If the employer is willing to offerher a plan that omits contraceptives, theemployer could discuss this with the in-surance agent or issuer. If the issuer is alsowilling to offer the employer, with respectto the employee, a group health insurancepolicy that omits contraceptive coverage,the individual exemption would make itlegal for the group health insurance issuerto omit contraceptives for her and herbeneciaries under her policy, for her em-ployer to sponsor that plan for her, and for the issuer to issue such a plan to the em- ployer, to cover that employee. This wouldnot affect other employees' plans\u2014thoseplans would still be subject to the Mandateand would continue to cover contraceptives.But if either the employer, or the issuer, isnot willing (for whatever reason) to offer aplan or a policy for that employee that omitscontraceptive coverage, these rules do notrequire them to do so. The employee wouldhave the choice of staying enrolled in a planwith its coverage of contraceptives, not en-rolling in that plan, seeking coverage else- where, or seeking employment elsewhere. For all these reasons, these rules adopt the individual exemption language from theReligious IFC with changes, to read as fol-lows: \"(b) Objecting individuals . Guidelines issued under \u00a7 147.130(a)(1)(iv) by theHealth Resources and Services Administra-tion must not provide for or support therequirement of coverage or payments forcontraceptive services with respect to indi-viduals who object as specied in this para-graph (b), a willing health insur-ance issuer offering group or individualhealth insurance coverage, and as applica-ble, a willing plan sponsor of a group healthplan, from offering a separate policy, certif-icate or contract of insurance or a separategroup health plan or benet package option,to any group health plan sponsor (with re-spect to an individual) or individual, as ap-plicable, who objects to coverage or pay-ments for some or all contraceptive servicesbased on sincerely held moral convictions.Under this exemption, if an individual ob-jects to some but not all contraceptive ser-vices, but the issuer, and as applicable, plansponsor, are willing to provide the plansponsor or individual, as applicable, with aseparate policy, certicate or contract of in-surance or a separate group health plan orbenet package option that omits all contra-ceptives, and the individual agrees, then theexemption applies as if the individual ob-jects to all contraceptive services.\" 8. Accommodation (45 CFR 147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, 29 CFR2590.715-2713A) The previous regulations did not offer the accommodation process to entitieswith moral non-religious objections. TheReligious IFC amended the accommoda-tion regulations to offer it to all entitiesthat are exempt on the basis of religiousbeliefs under \u00a7 147.132, as an optionalprocess in which such entities could par-ticipate voluntarily. The Moral IFC didnot change that accommodation process,but inserted references in it to the newsection \u00a7 147.133, alongside the refer-ences to section \u00a7 147.132. These changesmade entities eligible for the voluntary December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 948accommodation process if they are ex- empt on the basis of moral convictions.The references were inserted in 45 CFR147.131, 26 CFR 54.9815- 2713A, and 29CFR 2590.715- 2713A. In these rules, Departments nal- ize, without change, the Moral IFC's re-visions of 147.131, 26 CFR54.9815-2713A, 2713A. The the accommo- dation process, changes made in theReligious IFC, and public commentsconcerning the accommodation, aremore fully described in the ReligiousIFC, and in the companion nal rulesconcerning the religious exemptions andaccommodation, published elsewhere intoday's Federal Register . Those de- scriptions are incorporated here by ref-erence to the extent they apply to theserules. Many commenters supported extend- ing the accommodation process to enti-ties with objections based on moral con-victions. Others objected to doing so,raising arguments parallel to their objec-tions to creating exemptions for grouphealth plan sponsors with moral convic-tions. For much the same reasons dis-cussed above concerning why the De-partments nd it appropriate to exemptentities with moral objections to contra-ceptive coverage, the Departments ndit appropriate to extend the optional ac-commodation process to these entities.The Departments observe that, to theextent such entities wish to use the pro-cess, it will not be an obstacle to con-traceptive coverage, but will insteadhelp deliver contraceptive coverage towomen who receive health coveragefrom such entities while respecting themoral convictions of the entities. TheDepartments are not aware of entitieswith non-religious moral convictionsagainst contraceptive coverage that alsoconsider the accommodation acceptableand would opt into it, but we are awareof a small number of entities with non-religious moral objections to the Man-date. The Departments, therefore, con-tinue to consider it appropriate to extendthe optional accommodation to such en-tities in case any wish to use it. Below,albeit based on very limited data, the Departments estimate that a small num-ber of entities with non-religious moralobjections may use the accommodationprocess. 9. Denition of Contraceptives for the Purpose of These Final Rules The previous regulations did not de- ne contraceptive services. The Guide-lines issued in 2011 included, under\"Contraceptive methods and counsel-ing,\" \"[a]ll Food and Drug Administra-tion approved contraceptive methods,sterilization procedures, and patient ed-ucation and counseling for all womenwith reproductive capacity.\" The previ-ous regulations concerning the theterms \"contraceptive services\" and\"contraceptive coverage\" as catch-allterms to encompass all of those Guide-lines requirements. The 2016 update tothe Guidelines are similarly worded.Under \"Contraception,\" they include the\"full range of contraceptive methods forwomen currently identied by the U.S.Food and and to\"include contraceptive initi-ation of contraceptive use, andfollow-up care (e.g., management, andevaluation as well as changes to andremoval or discontinuation of the con-traceptive method).\" 193 To more explicitly state that the ex- panded exemptions encompass any of thecontraceptive or sterilization services,items, procedures, or related patient edu-cation or information that have been re-quired under the Guidelines, the MoralIFC included a denition of contraceptiveservices, benets or coverage, at 45 CFR147.133(c). These rules nalize that de-nition without change. 10. SeverabilityThe Departments nalize, without change, the severability clause set forth at\u00a7 147.133(d).C.Other Public Comments 1. Items Approved as Contraceptives But Used to Treat Existing Conditions Some commenters noted that some drugs included in the preventive servicescontraceptive Mandate can also be usefulfor treating certain existing health condi-tions, and that women use them for non-contraceptive purposes. Certain comment-ers urged the Departments to clarify thatthe nal rules do not permit employers toexclude from coverage medically neces-sary prescription drugs used for non-preventive services. Some commenterssuggested that moral objections to theMandate should not be permitted in caseswhere contraceptive methods are used totreat such existing medical conditions andnot for preventive purposes, even if thosecontraceptive methods can also be usedfor contraceptive purposes. Section 2713(a)(4) only applies to \"preventive\" care and screenings. Thestatute does not allow the Guidelines tomandate coverage of services providedsolely for a non-preventive use, such asthe treatment of an existing condition. TheGuidelines implementing this section ofthe statute are consistent with that narrowauthority. They state repeatedly that theyapply to \"preventive\" services or care. 194 The requirement in the Guidelines con-cerning \"contraception\" species severaltimes that it encompasses \"contracep-tives,\" that is, medical products, methods,and services applied for \"contraceptive\"uses. The Guidelines do not require cov-erage of care and screenings that are non-preventive, and the contraception portionof those Guidelines do not require cover-age of medical products, methods, care,and screenings that are non-contraceptivein purpose or use. The Guidelines' inclu-sion of contraceptive services requirescoverage of contraceptive methods as atype of preventive service only when adrug that FDA has approved for contra-ceptive use is prescribed in w hole or in part for such purpose or intended use. Section2713(a)(4) does not authorize the Depart-ments to require coverage of drugs pre-scribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive 193\"Women's Preventive Services Guidelines,\" reviewed Oct. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 949and non-preventive use to treat an existing condition.195The extent to w hich contra- ceptives are covered to treat non-preventive conditions would be deter-mined by application of the requirementsection 1302(b)(1)(F) of the ACA tocover prescription drugs (where regulations at 45CFR 156.122, and 156.125, and plans'decisions about the basket of medicinesto cover for these conditions. Some commenters observed that phar- macy claims do not include a medical diag-nosis code, so that plans may be unable todiscern whether a drug approved by FDAfor contraceptive uses is actually applied fora preventive or contraceptive use. Section2713(a)(4), however, draws a distinction be-tween preventive and other kinds of careand screenings. That subsection does notauthorize the Departments to impose a cov-erage mandate of services that are not atleast partly applied for a preventive use, andthe Guidelines themselves do not requirecoverage of care unless it is contraceptive inpurpose. These rules do not prohibit issuersfrom covering drugs and devices that areapproved for contraceptive uses even whenthose drugs and devices are prescribed fornon-preventive, non-contraceptive pur-poses. As discussed above, these nal rulesdo not purport to delineate the items HRSAwill include in the Guidelines, but only con-cern expanded exemptions and accommo-dations that apply if the Guidelines requirecontraceptive coverage. Therefore, the De-partments do not consider it appropriate tospecify in these nal rules that, under sec-tion 2713(a)(4), exempt organizations mustprovide coverage for drugs or items pre-scribed exclusively for a non-contraceptiveand non-preventive use to treat an existingcondition. 2. Comments Concerning Regulatory Impact Some commenters agreed with the De- partments' statement in the Moral IFCthat the moral exemptions are likely toaffect only a very small number of women otherwise receiving coverage under theMandate. Other commenters disagreed,stating that the exemptions could takecontraceptive coverage away from manyor most women. Still others opposed es-tablishing the exemptions, but contendedthat accurately determining the number ofwomen affected by the exemptions is notpossible. Public comments included vari-ous statements that these exemptionswould impact coverage for a large numberof women, while others stated they wouldaffect only a very small number. But few,if any, public commenters provided datapredicting a precise number of entitiesthat would make use of the exemptions formoral convictions nor a precise number ofemployees that would potentially be af-fected. After reviewing the public comments, the Departments do not nd the sugges-tions of commenters who predicted a verylarge impact any more reliable than theestimates set forth in the Religious andMoral IFCs. Therefore, the Departmentsconclude that the estimates of regulatoryimpact made in the Religious and MoralIFCs are still the best estimates available.The Departments' estimates are discussedin more detail in the following section. III. Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden The Departments have examined the impacts of these nal rules as required byExecutive Order 12866 on RegulatoryPlanning and Review (September 30,1993), Executive Order 13563 on Improv-ing Regulation and Regulatory Review(January 18, 2011), the Regulatory Flexi-bility Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980,Pub. L. 96-354, section1102(b) of theSocial Security Act, section 202 of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995(March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104-4), Exec-utive Order 13132 (August4, the Congressional Review Act(5 U.S.C. 804(2)) and Executive Order13771 on Reducing Regulation and Con- trolling Regulatory Costs (January 30,2017). A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563\u2014 Department of HHS and Department ofLabor Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 di- rect agencies to assess all costs and ben-ets of available regulatory alternativesand, if regulation is necessary, to selectregulatory approaches that maximize netbenets (including potential economic,environmental, and bothcosts and benets, reducing costs, harmo-nizing rules, and promoting flexibility. Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 denes a \"signicant regulatory action\" asan action that is likely to result in a reg-ulation: (1) having an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more in any 1year, or adversely and materially affectinga sector of the economy, productivity,competition, jobs, the environment, publichealth or safety, or state, local, or tribalgovernments or communities (also re-ferred to as \"economically signicant\");(2) creating a serious inconsistency or oth-erwise interfering with an action taken orplanned by another agency; (3) materiallyaltering the budgetary impacts of entitle-ment grants, user fees, or loan programsor the rights and obligations of recipientsthereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policyissues arising out of legal mandates, thePresident's priorities, or the principles setforth in the Executive Order. A regulatory impact analysis must be prepared for major rules with economi-cally signicant effects ($100 million ormore in any 1 year), and an \"economicallysignicant\" regulatory action is subject toreview by OMB. As discussed below re-garding their anticipated effects, the thesenal rules are not likely to have economicimpacts of $100 million or more in any 195The Departments previously cited the IOM's listing of existing conditions that contraceptive drugs can be used to treat (menstrual disorders, acne, and pelvic pain), and said of those uses that \"there are demonstrated preventive health benets from contraceptives relating to conditions other than pregnancy.\" 77 FR 8727 & n.7. This was n ot, however, an assertion that section 2713(a)(4) or the Guidelines require coverage of \"contraceptive\" methods when prescribed for an exclusively non-contraceptive, non-preventive use. Instead, it was an observation that such drugs\u2014generally referred to as \"contraceptives\"\u2014also have some alternate benecial uses to treat existing conditions. For the purposes of these n al rules, the Departments clarify here that the previous reference to the benets of using contraceptive drugs exclusively for some non-contraceptive and non-preventive uses to treat exi sting conditions did not mean that the Guidelines require coverage of such uses, and consequently is not a reason to refrain from offering the exemptions provided here. Where a drug approve d by the FDA for contraceptive use is prescribed for both a contraceptive use and a non-contraceptive use, the Guidelines (to the extent they apply) would require its coverage. Where a d rug approved by the FDA for contraceptive use is prescribed exclusively for a non-contraceptive and non-preventive use to treat an existing condition, it would be outside the s cope of the Guidelines and the contraceptive Mandate. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 950one year, and therefore do not meet the denition of \"economically signicant\"under Executive Order 12866. However,OMB has determined that the actions aresignicant within the meaning of section3(f)(4) of the Executive Order. Therefore,OMB has reviewed these nal rules andthe Departments have provided the fol-lowing assessment of their impact. 1. Need for Regulatory Action The Religious IFC amended the De- partments' July 2015 nal regulations.The Moral IFC amended those regulationsfurther, and added an additional rule at 45CFR part 147.133. These nal rules adoptas nal, and further amend, the amend-ments made by the Moral IFC. The De-partments do so in conjunction with theamendments made in the companion nalrules concerning religious beliefs pub-lished elsewhere in today's Federal Reg- ister . These rules provide an exemption from the requirement to provide coveragefor contraceptives and sterilization, estab-lished under the HRSA Guidelines, pro-mulgated section 2713(a)(4), sec-tion 715(a)(1) of the ERISA, and section9815(a)(1) of the Code, for certain entitiesand individuals with objections to compli-ance with the Mandate based on sincerelyheld moral convictions, and they revisethe accommodation process by makingthe accommodation applicable to organi-zations with such convictions as an op-tion. The exemption applies to certain in-dividuals, nonprot entities, institutions ofhigher education, issuers, and for-prot entities that do not have publicly tradedownership interests, that have a moral ob-jection to some (or all) of the contracep-tive and/or sterilization services coveredby the Guidelines. Such action has beentaken to provide for participation in thehealth insurance market by certain entitiesor individuals in a manner free from pen-alties for violating sincerely held moralconvictions opposed to providing or re-ceiving coverage of contraceptive ser-vices, to ensure the preventive servicescoverage requirement is implemented in a way consistent with longstanding federalconscience statutes, to prevent lawsuits ofthe kind that were led against the Depart-ments when the expanded exemption inthese nal rules was not offered, and forthe other reasons discussed above. 2. Anticipated Effects The Departments acknowledge that ex- panding the exemption to include objec-tions based on moral convictions mightresult in less insurance coverage of con-traception for some women who maywant the coverage. Although the Depart-ments do not know the exact scope of thateffect attributable to the moral exemptionin these nal rules, we believe it to besmall. With respect to the exemption for non- prot organizations with objections basedon moral convictions, as noted above, theDepartments are aware of two small non-prot organizations that have led law-suits raising non-religious moral objec-tions to coverage of some contraceptives.Both of those entities have fewer than veemployees enrolled in health coverage,and both require all of their employees toagree with their opposition to the nature ofcertain contraceptives subject to coverageunder the Mandate. 196One of them has obtained a permanent injunction againstany regulations implementing the contra-ceptive Mandate, and so will not beaffected by these nal rules. Based oncomments submitted in response to rule-makings prior to the Moral and Religious IFCs, the Departments believe that at leastone other similar entity exists. 197How- ever, the Departments do not know howmany similar entities exist and are cur-rently unable to estimate the number ofsuch entities. Lacking other information,we assume that the number is small. TheDepartments estimate it to be less than 10and assume the exemption will be used bynine nonprot entities. The Departments also assume that those nine entities will operate in a fash-ion similar to the two similar entities of which we are aware, so that their employ-ees will likely share their views againstcoverage of certain contraceptives. This isconsistent with the conclusion in previousregulations that no signicant burden orcosts would result from exempting housesof worship requiring that housesof worship and integrated auxiliaries onlyhire persons who agree with their viewsagainst contraception and without requir-ing that such entities actually oppose con-traception in order to be exempt (in con-trast, the exemption here requires theexempt entity to actually possess sincerelyheld moral convictions objecting to con-traceptive coverage). In concluding thatthe exemption for houses of worship andintegrated auxiliaries would result in nosignicant burden or costs, the Depart-ments relied on the assumption that theemployees of exempt houses of worshipand integrated auxiliaries likely sharetheir employers' opposition to contracep-tive coverage. A similar assumption is appropriate with respect to the expanded exemptionfor nonprot organizations with objec-tions based on moral convictions. To theknowledge of the Departments, the vastmajority of organizations objecting to theMandate assert objections based on reli-gious beliefs. The only nonprot organi-zations of which they are aware that pos- sess non-religious moral convictionsagainst some or all contraceptive methodsonly hire persons who share their convic-tions. It is possible that the exemption fornonprot organizations with moral con-victions in these nal rules could be usedby a nonprot organization that employspersons who do not share the organiza-tion's views on contraception, but it wasalso possible under the Departments' pre-vious regulations that a house of worshipor integrated auxiliary could employ per-sons who do not share their views oncontraception. 198Although the Depart- 196Non-religious nonprot organizations that engage in expressive activity generally have a First Amendment right to hire only people who share their m oral convictions or will be respectful of them\u2014including their convictions on whether the organization or others provide health coverage of contraception, or of certain items they view as being abortifacient. 197See, for example, Americans United for Life (\"AUL\") Comment on CMA-9992-IFC2 at 10 (Nov. 1, 2011), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!docu mentDetail;D /H11005HHS-OS- 2011-0023-59496, and AUL Comment on CMS-9968-P at 5 (Apr. 8, 2013), available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D /H11005CMS-2012-0031-79115. 198Cf., for example , Frank Newport, \"Americans, Including Catholics, Say Birth Control Is Morally OK,\" Gallup, (May 22, 2012), http://www.gallup.com/poll/154799/a mericans-including- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 951ments are unable to nd sufcient data on this issue, we believe that there are farfewer nonprot organizations opposed tocontraceptive coverage on the basis ofmoral convictions than there are houses ofworship or integrated auxiliaries with re-ligious objections to such coverage. Basedon the limited data available, the Depart-ments believe the most likely effect of theexpanded exemption for nonprot entitiesis that it will be used by entities similar tothe two entities that have sought an ex-emption through litigation, and whoseemployees also oppose certain contracep-tive coverage. Therefore, the Departmentsexpect that the moral exemption for non-prot entities will have a minimal effectof reducing contraceptive coverage withrespect to employees who want such cov-erage. These rules extend the exemption to include institutions of higher educationthat arrange student coverage and havenon-religious moral objections to theMandate, and make exempt entities with moral objections eligible to avail them-selves of the accommodation. The Depart-ments are not aware of any institutions ofhigher education with this kind of non-religious moral convictions. Moreover,the Departments believe the overall num-ber of entities that would object to theMandate based on non-religious moralconvictions is already very small. Theonly entities of which we are aware thathave raised such objections are not insti-tutions of higher education. Public com-ments did not reveal the existence of anyinstitutions of higher education with suchmoral convictions. Therefore, for the pur-poses of estimating the anticipated effectof these nal rules on contraceptivecoverage of women who wish to receivesuch coverage, the Departments assumethat\u2014at this time\u2014no entities with non-religious moral objections to the Mandatewill be institutions of higher educationthat arrange student coverage, and noother entities with non-religious moral ob-jections will opt into the accommodation.We wish to make the expanded exemptionand accommodation available to such en-tities in case they do exist or might comeinto existence, based on reasons similar tothose given above for why the exemptions and accommodations are extended toother entities. The Departments believe that the ex- emption for issuers with objections basedon moral convictions will not result in adistinct effect on contraceptive coveragefor women who wish to receive it, becausethat exemption only applies in caseswhere plan sponsors or individuals arealso otherwise exempt, and the effect ofthose exemptions is discussed elsewhereherein, or in the companion nal rulesconcerning religious beliefs publishedelsewhere in today's Federal Register . The exemption for individuals that opposecontraceptive coverage based on sincerelyheld moral convictions will provide cov-erage that omits contraception for individ-uals that object to contraceptive coverage. The moral exemption will also cover for-prot entities that do not have publiclytraded ownership interests and that havenon-religious moral objections to theMandate, if such entities exist. Some com- menters agreed that the impact of thesenal rules would be no more than theDepartments estimated in the Moral IFC,and some commenters stated the impactwould be much smaller. Other comment-ers disagreed, suggesting that the ex-panded exemptions risked removing con-traceptive coverage from more than 55million women receiving the benets ofthe preventive services Guidelines, oreven risked removing contraceptive cov-erage from over 100 million women.Some commenters cited studies indicatingthat, nationally, unintended pregnancieshave large public costs, and the Mandateoverall led to large out-of-pocket savingsfor women. These general comments didnot, however, substantially assist the De-partments in estimating the number ofwomen that would potentially be affectedby these exemptions for moral convictionsspecically, or among them, how manyunintended pregnancies would result, howmany of the affected women would nev-ertheless use contraceptives not coveredunder the health plans of their objectingemployers and, thus, be subject to theestimated transfer costs, or instead, howmany women might avoid unintendedpregnancies by changing their activities in other ways besides using contraceptives. Some of the comments opposing these exemptions assert that they will lead to alarge number of entities dropping contra-ceptive coverage. The Departments dis-agree; they are aware of only two entitiesthat hold non-religious moral convictionsagainst contraceptive coverage. Both onlyhire employees that share their beliefs,and one will not be affected by these nalrules because it is protected by an injunc-tion from any regulations implementingthe contraceptive Mandate. Commenterscited no other specic entities that mightassert these moral convictions, and did notprovide better data to estimate how manyentities might exist. Likewise, the Depart-ments nd it unlikely that any of the vastmajority of entities that covered contra-ceptives before this Mandate was an-nounced in 2011 would terminate suchcoverage because of these exemptionsbased on moral convictions. The Depart-ments also nd it unlikely that a signi-cant contraceptive coveragebefore the ACA on the basis of objectionsgrounded in non-religious moral convic-tions, and would claim an exemption un-der these nal rules. No such entities, ordata concerning such entities, were iden-tied by public commenters, nor are theDepartments aware of any involved in lit-igation over the Mandate. Numerous for-prot entities claiming religious objections have led suit chal-lenging the Mandate. Among the over 200entities that brought legal challenges, onlytwo entities (less than 1 percent) raisednon-religious moral objections\u2014and bothwere nonprot organizations. Among thegeneral public, polls vary about religiousbeliefs, but one prominent poll shows that89 percent of Americans say they believein God. 199Among non-religious persons, only a very small percentage of the pop-ulation appears to hold moral objectionsto contraception. A recent study foundthat only 2 percent of religiously unafl-iated persons believed using contracep- catholics-say-birth-control-morally.aspx (\"Eighty-two percent of U.S. Catholics say birth control is morally acceptable\"). 199Frank Newport, \"Most Americans Still Believe in God,\" Gallup (June 29, 2016), http://www.gallup.com/poll/193271/americans-believe-god.aspx. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 952tives is morally wrong.200Combined, this suggests that 0.2 percent of Americans atmost 201might believe contraceptives are morally wrong based on moral convic-tions but not religious beliefs. The Depart-ments have no information about howmany of those persons run closely heldbusinesses, offer employer sponsoredhealth insurance, and would make use ofthe expanded exemption for moral convic-tions set forth in these nal rules. Giventhe large number of closely held entitiesthat challenged the Mandate based on re-ligious objections, the Departments as-sume that some similar for-prot entitieswith non-religious moral objections exist.But the Departments expect that it will bea comparatively small number of entities, since among the nonprot litigants, onlytwo were non-religious. Without dataavailable to estimate the actual number ofentities that will make use of the expandedexemption for for-prot entities withoutpublicly traded ownership interests andwith sincere moral objections to the Man-date, the Departments expect that fewerthan 10 entities, if any, will do so\u2014so theDepartments assume nine for-prot enti-ties will use the exemption in these nalrules. The moral exemption encompassing certain for-prot entities could result inthe removal of contraceptive coveragefrom women who do not share their em-ployers' views. The Departments useddata from the Current Population Survey(CPS) and the Medical Expenditure PanelSurvey-Insurance Component (MEPS-IC)to obtain an estimate of the number ofpolicyholders that will be covered by theplans of the nine for-prot entities we assume may make use of these expandedexemptions. 202The average number of policyholders (9) in plans with under 100employees was obtained. It is not knownhow many employees would be employedby the for-prot employers that mightclaim this exemption, but as discussedabove these nal rules do not include pub-licly traded companies, and both of thetwo nonprot entities that challenged theMandate based on moral objections in-cluded fewer than ve policyholders intheir group plans. Therefore, the Depart-ments assume that the for-prot entitiesthat may claim this expanded exemptionwill have fewer than 100 employees andan average of 9 policyholders. For 9 enti- ties, the total number of policyholderswould be approximately 81. DOL esti-mates that for each policyholder, there isapproximately one dependent. 203This amounts to approximately 162 coveredpersons. Census data indicate that womenof childbearing age, i.e., women aged 15to 44, comprise 20.2 percent of the gen-eral population. 204This amounts to ap- proximately 33 women of childbearingage for this group of individuals coveredby group plans sponsored by for-protmoral objectors. Approximately 44.3 per-cent of women currently use contracep-tives covered by the Guidelines. 205Thus, the Departments estimate that approxi-mately 15 women may incur contracep-tive costs due to for-prot entities usingthe expanded moral exemption providedfor in these nal rules. 206In the compan- ion nal rules concerning religious beliefsissued contemporaneously with these nalrules and published elsewhere in today's Federal Register , we estimate that the average cost of contraception per year perwoman of childbearing age that use con-traception covered by the Guidelines, inhealth plans that cover contraception, is$584. Consequently, the Departments es-timate that the anticipated effects attribut-able to the cost of contraception from for-prot entities using the expanded moralexemption in these nal rules is approxi-mately $8,760. The Departments estimate that these nal rules will not result in any additionalburden or costs on issuers or third partyadministrators. As discussed above, weassume that no entities with non-religiousmoral convictions will avail themselves of the accommodation, although the Depart-ments wish to make it available in case anentity voluntarily opts into it in order toallow contraceptive coverage to be pro-vided to its plan participants and bene-ciaries. While these nal rules make itlegal for issuers to offer insurance cover-age that omits contraceptives to/for ex-empt entities and individuals, these nalrules do not require issuers to do so. Fi-nally, because the accommodation pro-cess was not previously available to enti-ties that possess non-religious moralobjections to the Mandate, the Depart-ments do not anticipate that these nalrules will result in any burden from suchentities acting to revoke their accommo-dated status. The Departments believe the foregoing analysis represents a reasonable estimateof the likely impact under the exemptionsnalized in these nal rules.

The G uidelines' requirement of contraceptive coverage only applies \"for all women with reproductive capacity.\" Women's Preventive Services Guidelines, HRSA (last reviewed Oct. 2017), https://www.hrsa.gov/ womensguidelines/; see also 80 FR 40318. In addition, studies commonly consider the 15-44 age range to assess contraceptive use by women of childbearing age. See, e.g. , \"Contraceptive Use in the United States,\" The Guttmacher Institute (Sept. 2016), https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-united-states. 205See\"Contraceptive Use in the United States,\" The Guttmacher Institute (Sept. 2016), https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-use-u nited-states. 206The Departments note that many non-religious for-prot entities which sued the Departments challenging the Mandate, including some of the largest e mployers, only objected to coverage of 4 of the 18 types of contraceptives required to be covered by the Mandate\u2014namely, those contraceptives which they viewed as abortifacients, and aki n to abortion \u2014and they were willing to provide coverage for other types of contraception. It is reasonable to assume that this would also be the case with respect to some for-prots that ob ject to the Mandate on the basis of sincerely held moral convictions. Accordingly, it is possible that even fewer women beneciaries under such plans would bear out-of-pocket expense s in order to obtain contraceptives, and that those who might do so would bear lower costs due to many contraceptive items being covered. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 953ments acknowledge uncertainty in the es- timate and, therefore, conducted a secondanalysis using an alternative framework,which is set forth in the companion nalrules concerning religious beliefs issuedcontemporaneously with these nal rulesand published elsewhere in today's Fed- eral Register , with reference to the anal- ysis conducted in the Religious IFC. Un-der either estimate, these nal rules arenot deemed to be economically signi-cant. The Departments reiterate the rareness of instances in which we are aware thatemployers assert non-religious objectionsto contraceptive coverage based on sin-cerely held moral convictions, as dis-cussed above, and also that in the fewinstances where such an objection hasbeen raised, employees of such employersalso opposed contraception. B. Special Analyses\u2014Department of the Treasury These regulations are not subject to review under section 6(b) of ExecutiveOrder 12866 pursuant to the Memoran-dum of Agreement (April 11, 2018) be-tween the Department of the Treasury andthe Ofce of Management and Budgetregarding review of tax regulations. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) imposes certainrequirements with respect to federal reg-ulations that are subject to the notice andcomment requirements of section 553(b)of the APA (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) and thatare likely to have a signicant economicimpact on a substantial number of smallentities. Under section 553(b) of the APA,a general notice of proposed rulemaking isnot required when an agency, for goodcause, nds that notice and public com-ment thereon are impracticable, unneces-sary, or contrary to the public interest. TheMoral IFC was a set of interim nal ruleswith comment, and in these nal rules, theDepartments nalize the Moral IFC withcertain changes based on public com-ments. The Moral IFC was exempt fromthe notice and comment requirements ofthe APA, both because the PHS Act,ERISA, and the Code contain specic pro-visions under which the Secretaries may adopt regulations by interim nal rule andbecause the Departments have made agood cause nding that a general notice ofproposed rulemaking is not necessary ear-lier in this preamble. Therefore, the RFAdid not apply to the Moral IFC. Thesenal rules are, however, issued after anotice and comment period. The Departments carefully considered the likely impact of the rules on smallentities in connection with their assess-ment under Executive Order 12866. TheDepartments do not expect that these nalrules will have a signicant economic ef-fect on a substantial number of small en-tities, because they will not result in anyadditional costs to affected entities. In-stead, by exempting from the Mandatesmall businesses and nonprot organiza-tions with moral objections to some or allcontraceptives and/or sterilization\u2014busi-nesses and organizations which wouldotherwise be faced with the dilemma ofcomplying with the Mandate (and violat-ing their moral convictions), or of follow-ing their moral convictions and incurringpotentially signicant nancial penaltiesfor noncompliance\u2014the reduced Pursuant to section 7805(f) of theCode, the notice of proposed rulemakingpreceding these regulations was submittedto the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of theSmall Business Administration for com-ment on their impact on small business. D. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Health and HumanServices Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (the PRA), federal agencies are re-quired to publish notice in the Federal Register and solicit public comment be- fore a collection of information is submit-ted to the Ofce of Management and Bud-get (OMB) for review and approval.Interested persons are invited to sendcomments regarding our burden estimatesor any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including any of the follow-ing subjects: (1) the necessity and utilityof the proposed information collection forthe proper performance of the agency'sfunctions; (2) the accuracy of the esti-mated burden; (3) ways to enhance thequality, utility, and clarity of the informa- tion to be collected; and (4) the use ofautomated collection techniques or otherforms of information technology to mini-mize the information collection burden. The Departments estimate that these nal rules will not result in additionalburdens not accounted for as set forth incompanion nal rules concerning reli-gious beliefs issued contemporaneouslywith these nal rules and published else-where in today's Federal Register .A s discussed there, rules covering the accom-modation include provisions regardingself-certication or notices to HHS fromeligible organizations (\u00a7 147.131(c)(3)),notice of availability of separate paymentsfor contraceptive (\u00a7 147.131(e)),and notice of revocation of accommoda-tion 147.131(c)(4)). The relatedto these information collection require-ments received emergency reviewand approval under OMB Control Num-ber 0938-1344. They have been resubmit-ted to OMB in conjunction with this nalrule and are pending re-approval. As discussed above, however, the De- partments assume that no entities withnon-religious moral objections to theMandate will use the accommodation. TheDepartments know that no such entitieswere eligible for it until now, so that noentity possesses an accommodated statusthat would need to be revoked. Therefore,the Departments believe that the burdenfor these ICRs is accounted for in thecollection approved under OMB ControlNumbers 0938-1344, as described in thenal rules concerning religious beliefs is-sued contemporaneously with these nalrules. E. Paperwork Reduction Act\u2014Department of Labor Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, an agency may not conduct or sponsor,and an individual is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less it displays a valid OMB control num-ber. In accordance with the requirementsof the PRA, the ICR for the EBSA Form700 and alternative notice have previouslybeen approved by OMB under controlnumbers 1210-0150 and 1210-0152. In aneffort to consolidate the number of infor-mation collections the Department is com- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 954bining OMB control numbers 1210-0150 and 1210-0152 num-ber 1210-0150 and discontinuing OMBcontrol number 1210-0152. A copy of the ICR may be obtained by contacting the PRA addressee shown be-low or at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRAADDRESSEE: G. Christopher Cosby, Of-ce of Policy and Research, U.S. Depart-ment of Labor, Employee Benets Secu-rity Administration, 200 (202) 219-4745. (These are nottoll-free numbers). Consistent with the analysis in the HHS PRA section above, although thesenal rules make entities with certainmoral convictions eligible for the accom-modation, the Department assumes (1)that no entities will use the accommoda-tion rather than the exemption, and (2)entities using the moral exemption wouldnot have to revoke an accommodation,because they previously were not eligiblefor it. Therefore, the Department believesthese nal rules do not involve additionalburden not accounted for under OMBcontrol number 1210-0150, which is pub-lished elsewhere in today's issue of theBulletin in connection with the compan- ion Religious Exemption and Accommo-dation Preventive Health Service nalrule. The Department will publish a noticeinforming the public of OMB's actionwith respect to the Department's submis-sion of the ICRs under OMB control num-ber 1210-0150. F. Regulatory Reform Executive Orders 13765, 13771 and 13777 Executive Order 13765 (January 20, 2017) directs that, \"[t]o the maximum ex-tent permitted by law, the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services (Secretary)and the heads of all other executive de-partments and agencies (agencies) withauthorities and responsibilities under the[Affordable Care] Act shall exercise allauthority and discretion available to themto waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provisionor requirement of the Act that would im-pose a scal burden on any state or a cost,fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden onindividuals, families, healthcare provid-ers, health insurers, patients, recipients ofhealthcare services, purchasers of healthinsurance, or makers of medical devices,products, or medications.\" In addition,agencies are directed to \"take all actionsconsistent with law to minimize the un-warranted economic and regulatory bur-dens of the [Affordable Care Act], andprepare to afford the States more flexibil-ity and control to create a more free andopen healthcare market.\" The Moral IFCand these nal rules exercise the discre-tion provided to the Departments underthe Affordable Care Act and other laws togrant exemptions and thereby minimizeregulatory burdens of the Affordable CareAct on the affected entities and recipientsof health care services. Consistent with Executive Order 13771 (82 FR 9339, February 3, 2017),the Departments have estimated the costsand cost savings attributable to theserules. As discussed in more detail in thepreceding analysis, these nal rules lessenincremental reporting costs. 207However, in order to avoid double-counting with theMoral IFC, which already been 13771 action, thisnalization of the is not con-sidered a deregulatory action under theExecutive Order. G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a) (Pub. L. 104-4),requires the Departments to prepare awritten statement, which includes an as-sessment of anticipated costs and benets,before issuing \"any rule that includes anyfederal mandate that may result in theexpenditure by state, local, and tribal gov-ernments, in the aggregate, or by the pri-vate sector, of $100 million or more (ad-justed annually for inflation) in any 1year.\" In 2018, that threshold is approxi- mately $150 million. For purposes of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act, theMoral IFC and these nal rules do notinclude any federal mandate that may re-sult in expenditures by state, local, ortribal governments, nor do they includeany federal mandates that may impose anannual burden of $150 million or more onthe private sector. H. Federalism Executive Order 13132 outlines funda- mental principles of federalism, and re-quires the adherence to specic criteria byfederal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on states, the relationship between the fed-eral government and states, or the distri-bution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government.Federal agencies promulgating regula-tions that have these federalism implica-tions must consult with state and localofcials, and describe the extent of theirconsultation and the nature of the con-cerns of state and local ofcials in thepreamble to the regulation. These rules do not have any Federal- ism implications, since they only provideexemptions from the contraceptive andsterilization coverage requirement inHRSA Guidelines supplied under section2713 of the PHS Act. IV. Statutory Authority The Department of the Treasury regu- lations are adopted pursuant to the author-ity contained in sections 7805 and 9833 ofthe Code. The Department of Labor regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority con-tained sec.401(b), Public Law 105-200, 112 Stat. 207Other noteworthy potential impacts encompass potential changes in medical expenditures, including potential decreased expenditures on contrace ptive devices and drugs and potential increased expenditures on pregnancy-related medical services. OMB's guidance on EO 13771 implementation (https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-pre ss-ofce/2017/04/05/memorandum- implementing-executive-order-13771-titled-reducing-regulation) states that impacts should be categorized as consistently as possible withi n Departments. The Food and Drug Administration, within HHS, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), within DOL, regularly es timate medical expenditure impacts in the analyses that accompany their regulations, with the results being categorized as benets (positive benets if expenditures are reduc ed, negative benets if expenditures are raised). Following the FDA, OSHA and MSHA accounting convention leads to these nal rules' medical expenditure impacts being categorized as (positi ve or negative) benets, rather than as costs, thus placing them outside of consideration for EO 13771 designation purposes.

ACTION: Final regulations.SUMMARY: This document contains - nal regulations on allocating costs to cer-tain property produced or acquired for re-sale by a taxpayer. These nal regulations:provide rules for the treatment of negativeadjustments related to certain costs re-quired to be capitalized to property pro-duced or acquired for resale; provide anew simplied method of accounting fordetermining the additional costs allocableto property produced or acquired for re-sale; and redene how certain types ofcosts are categorized for purposes of thesimplied methods. These nal regula-tions affect taxpayers that are producers orresellers of property that are required tocapitalize costs to the property and thatelect to allocate costs using a simpliedmethod. DATES: Effective Date : These regula- tions are effective on November 20, 2018.Applicability Date : For date of applicabil- ity, see \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-1(l)(5) and 1.263A-2(g)(3). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Natasha M. Mulleneaux, of the Ofce of the Associate Chief Counsel(Income Tax and Accounting) at (202)317-7007 (not a toll-free number).SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains nal regula- tions that amend the Income Tax Regula-tions (26 CFR part 1) relating to allocationof costs to certain property produced oracquired for resale under section 263A ofthe Internal Revenue Code (Code). Section 263A requires taxpayers to capitalize the direct costs and indirectcosts that are properly allocable to: (1)Real or tangible personal property pro-duced by the taxpayer, and (2) real andpersonal property described in section1221(a)(1) acquired for resale by the tax-payer. The costs that a taxpayer must cap-italize under section 263A are its section471 costs, additional section costs,and interest capitalizable section263A costs to specic of propertyproduced or acquired for resale. However,section 263A(j) instructs the Secretary toprescribe regulations that may be neces-sary or appropriate to carry out the pur-poses of including regula-tions (the simplied resale method (SRM))to allocate a lump sum of additional sec-tion 263A costs properly allocable toproperty produced or acquired for resaleto property that is on hand at the end ofthe taxable year, in lieu of allocating coststo specic items of property. Some tax-payers using the SPM or SRM include anegative adjustment in additional section263A costs when the taxpayer capitalizesa cost as a section 471 cost in an amountthat is greater than the amount required tobe capitalized for tax purposes. Notice2007-29 (2007-14 IRB 881) providesthat, pending the issuance of additionalpublished guidance, the IRS generally willnot challenge the inclusion of negativeadjustments in computing additional costsunder section 263A or the permissibilityof aggregate negative additional section263A costs. On September 5, 2012, the Treasury Department and the IRS published in theFederal Register (77 FR 54482) a notice Bulletin No. 10, 2018 957of proposed rulemaking (REG-126770- 06, 2012-38 IRB 347) under section 263A(the proposed regulations) relating to theinclusion of negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs under the sim-plied methods. The proposed regulationsalso provided a new simplied the additional 263A alloca-ble to property produced or acquired forresale, and redened how certain types ofcosts are categorized for purposes of thesimplied methods. Two comments re-sponding to the proposed regulations werereceived and a public hearing was held onJanuary 7, 2013. After consideration ofthe comments received, these nal regu-lations adopt the proposed regulations asrevised by this Treasury decision. Summary of Comments and Explanation of Provisions 1.General Prohibition on Negative Adjustments in Additional Section 263ACosts The proposed regulations generally provided that taxpayers could not includenegative adjustments in additional section263A costs to remove section 471 costs,unless the taxpayers used: (1) the SPMand had average annual gross receipts of$10,000,000 or less; (2) the SRM; or (3)the MSPM. Both commenters stated that the pro- posed regulations' prohibition on includ-ing negative adjustments in additionalsection 263A costs for taxpayers using theSPM (and above the gross receipts thresh-old) was unfair to taxpayers unable orunwilling to use the MSPM. One com-menter suggested that taxpayers using theSPM are at a disadvantage compared totaxpayers using the MSPM, because theSPM overcapitalizes additional section263A costs to the raw material content ofending inventory. Another commenterstated that the proposed regulations' pro-hibition on including negative adjust-ments in additional section 263A costsunder the SPM unduly punished taxpayersthat were unable to use the MSPM byrequiring those taxpayers to calculate theamount of deductible section 471 coststhat should be excluded from ending in-ventory. This commenter also suggestedthat only a small number of taxpayers have the resources to determine thesecosts. The Treasury Department and the IRS do not adopt these comments because in-cluding negative adjustments in additionalsection 263A costs under the SPM mayresult in signicant theamount of additional section 263A costsand section 471 costs allocated to endinginventory. However, these nal regula-tions include several changes to addressthese comments and reduce compliancecosts, burden, and administrative com-plexity. Generally, including negative ad-justments in additional section 263A costsresults in distortions because the methodused to capitalize the section 471 cost isdifferent than the method used to removethe cost from ending inventory. The extentof the distortion, and whether it is favor-able or unfavorable to the taxpayer, gen-erally depends on whether the cost wasincurred in the production process andhow the cost was allocated to raw mate-rials, work-in-process, or nished goodsinventories for purposes of section 471.Accordingly, the general restriction on theinclusion of negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs provided in theproposed regulations remains unchangedin these nal regulations. In order to limit potential distortion in the simplied methods, these nal regula-tions also provide a new consistency re-quirement for taxpayers that are permittedto include negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs to remove sec-tion 471 costs and that include negativeadjustments to remove section 471 costs.The rule provides that such taxpayer mustuse this method of accounting for all sec-tion 471 costs that are permitted to beremoved using negative adjustments. In addition, these nal regulations clar- ify that certain business expenses de-scribed in section 162(c), (e), (f), and (g),including bribes, lobbying expenses, andnes and penalties, cannot be removedfrom a taxpayer's section 471 costs asnegative adjustments clarication is consistentwith \u00a7 1.471-3(f), which provides thatcertain of these expenses are not permittedto be included in the cost of inventories.2.Classication of Costs One commenter stated that it was un- clear how negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs are measured(for example, in the case of depreciation,at the individual asset level or using totaldepreciation expense). These nal regula-tions provide that section 471 costs, addi-tional section 263A costs, and any adjust-ments to section 471 costs or additionalsection 263A costs are classied using thenarrower of (1) the classications of costsused by the taxpayer in its nancial state-ment or (2) the classications of costs in\u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(2), (3), and (4). If a cost isnot described within \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(2),(3), or (4), the cost is classied using theclassication of costs used in the taxpay-er's nancial statement. 3.Modied Simplied Production Method The proposed regulations provided a new simplied method, the MSPM, to re-duce distortions that may result from theSPM. The MSPM in the proposed regula-tions reduced distortions by more pre-cisely allocating additional section 263Acosts, including negative adjustments,among raw materials, work-in-process,and nished goods inventories on hand atyear end. Generally, taxpayers wouldhave determined the allocable portion ofpre-production additional section 263Acosts using a pre-production absorptionratio of pre-production additional section263A costs incurred during the taxableyear over raw materials costs incurredduring the taxable year. This ratio wouldhave applied to raw material section 471costs incurred during the taxable year andremaining on hand at year end (includingunprocessed raw materials, and raw mate-rials integrated into work-in-process andnished goods). Similarly, under theMSPM in the proposed regulations, tax-payers would have determined the alloca-ble portion of all other additional section263A costs using a production absorptionratio of production additional section263A costs incurred during the taxableyear over production section 471 costsincurred during the taxable year. This ra-tio would have applied to production sec-tion 471 costs incurred during the taxable December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 958year and remaining on hand at year end (excluding raw materials integrated intowork-in-process and nished goods). Both commenters stated that some tax- payers could not readily identify raw ma-terials that are integrated into work-in-process and nished goods inventories onhand at year end. The commenters as-serted that those taxpayers would have tomodify their books and records or pur-chase a new computer system to trackthese raw materials. Both commentersstated that this requirement would placean unfair burden on taxpayers, especiallysmaller taxpayers. One commenter sug-gested that the nal regulations clarifythat a taxpayer may use any reasonablemethod to estimate the raw material com-ponent of work-in-process and nishedgoods inventories on hand at year end. First, to reduce the number of dened terms and to be consistent with the use ofthat term in \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i)(A), thesenal regulations use ma-terial costs\" rather than \"raw material costs,\" as used in the proposed regula-tions. Second, the Treasury Department and the IRS understand that some taxpayersmay not be able to readily identify directmaterial costs in work-in-process and n-ished goods inventories on hand at yearend. Accordingly, these nal regulationsmodify the MSPM so that taxpayers usingthe MSPM are not required to separatelytrack direct material costs that are inte-grated into work-in-process and nishedgoods inventories. Specically, only material sec-tion 471 costs incurred during the taxableyear and remaining on hand at year end;(2) applying the production absorption ra-tio to all production section 471 costs in-curred during the taxable year and remain-ing on hand at year end, which includesdirect material costs that have entered orcompleted production; (3) including thepre-production additional section 263Acosts that are not allocated by the pre-production absorption ratio in the numer-ator of the production absorption ratio;and (4) including the direct material coststhat have entered or completed productionin the denominator of the productionabsorption ratio. These modications tothe proposed MSPM reduce compliance costs, burden, and administrative com-plexity by eliminating the need to sepa-rately track direct material costs in work-in-process and nished goods inventorieson hand at year end. One commenter stated that the produc- tion absorption ratio under the MSPM inthe proposed regulations was distortivebecause it included post-production addi-tional section 263A costs (for example,storage and handling allocable to nishedgoods). This commenter suggested the MSPM include a third ratio to allocatepost-production additional section 263Acosts to nished goods inventories. Thissuggestion is not adopted in the nal reg-ulations because including a third ratio toallocate post-production additional 263Acosts adds a degree of complexity to theMSPM that outweighs the benet of theadditional precision it might provide. 4.Allocation of Mixed Service Costs Under the MSPM The proposed regulations provided that taxpayers must allocate capitalizablemixed service costs to pre-production ad-ditional section 263A costs in proportionto the raw material costs in total section471 costs, with the remaining amount ofcapitalizable mixed service costs allocatedto production additional section 263Acosts. The proposed regulations also spe-cically requested comments on howmixed service costs should be allocatedbetween raw materials, work-in-process,and nished goods under the MSPM. Both commenters stated that generally raw materials do not attract a largeamount of mixed service costs, except fora limited amount of labor-related purchas-ing costs. The commenters stated that theproposed regulations' allocation of capi-talizable mixed service costs between pre-production and production additionalsection 263A costs resulted in a dispro-portionate allocation of mixed servicecosts to pre-production additional section263A costs. One commenter suggestedthat the regulations taxpayersto allocate capitalizable mixed between pre-production and produc-tion additional section 263A costs usingany reasonable method and provided anexample of a labor-based allocation method to allocate mixed service costs. In response to the comm ents, these nal regulations expand the types ofmethods permitted under the MSPM toallocate mixed service costs betweenpre-production and production addi-tional section 263A costs. These regula-tions provide that a taxpayer using theMSPM that capitalizes mixed servicecosts using the simplied service costmethod under \u00a7 1.263A-1(h) may capitalizable mixed costs pre-production additional section 263Acosts based on unprocessed direct materialcosts in section 471 costs or, alternatively,based on pre-production labor costs in totallabor costs. Additionally, if a taxpayer usingthe MSPM determines its capitalizablemixed service costs using a method scribed in \u00a7 1.263A-1(g)(4) (a directreallocation method, a step-allocationmethod, or any other reasonable alloca-tion method), the taxpayer must use areasonable method to allocate the costs (for example, department or activitycosts) between pre-production and pro-duction additional section 263A costs,unless departments or ac-tivities are identied as exclusively pre-production or production. For example,it may be reasonable for a taxpayer us-ing a method described in \u00a7 1.263A-1(g)(4) to allocate a department's mixedservice costs between pre-productionand production additional section 263Acosts based on labor associated with thedepartment when the department is notexclusively identied as pre-productionor production. If a taxpayer that deter-mines its capitalizable mixed servicecosts using a method described in\u00a7 1.263A-1(g)(4) has departments or ac-tivities that are identied as exclusivelypre-production or production, the de-partment or activity costs must be allo-cated to pre-production or section or activity's identi-cation. One commenter stated that the pro- posed regulations would unnecessarily re-quire taxpayers that do not have any ad-ditional section 263A costs that relate to raw material costs to compute a pre-production absorption ratio. The commentersuggested allocating capitalizable mixed Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 959service costs between pre-production and production additional section 263A costsbased on the relative proportion of addi-tional section 263A costs in each categorythat are incurred by the taxpayer. These nalregulations do not adopt this suggestion be-cause the relative amount of pre-productionand production additional section 263Acosts reflect the amount of capitalizable taxcosts in excess of the costs capitalized fornancial statement purposes but do not ac-curately reflect the amount of mixed servicecosts allocable to pre-production and pro-duction activities. However, in response tothis comment and to reduce compliancecosts and burden, these nal regulations in-clude a de minimis rule that allows taxpay-ers using the MSPM to allocate 100 percentof capitalizable mixed service costs to pre-production or production additional section263A costs if 90 percent or more of themixed service costs would otherwise be al-located to that amount. 5.Property Produced for the Taxpayer Under a Contract and PropertyAcquired for Resale The proposed regulations did not pro- vide explicit rules for the treatment ofcosts related to property produced for thetaxpayer under a contract with anotherparty that is treated as property producedby the taxpayer, as described in \u00a7 1.263A-2(a)(1)(ii)(B) (property produced under acontract), and property acquired for resaleunder the MSPM. One commenter suggested that all costs related to property produced under acontract and property acquired for resaleshould be included in the pre-productionabsorption ratio under the MSPM. TheTreasury Department and the IRS agreethat generally costs related to propertyproduced under a contract and propertyacquired for resale are best treated as pre-production costs because costs related tosuch property are primarily purchasing,storage, and handling costs, which are thecosts frequently attributable to propertythat has not entered production. Accord-ingly, these nal regulations adopt thissuggestion and provide that additionalsection 263A costs properly allocable toproperty produced under a contract andproperty acquired for resale are generallyincluded in pre-production additional costs under larly, section 471 costs for property pro-duced under a contract and propertyacquired for resale are generally includedin pre-production section 471 costs underthe MSPM. One commenter also suggested that the nal regulations clarify the treatment ofcosts related to property produced under acontract when the property is used in anadditional production activity of the tax-payer. These nal regulations adopt thissuggestion and clarify that for purposes of the MSPM, direct material costs includeproperty produced under a contract thatare direct material costs for the taxpayerto be used in an additional productionprocess of the taxpayer. These costs areincluded in pre-production section 471costs. 6.Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Method Taxpayers Using the MSPM The proposed regulations provided that LIFO method taxpayers using the MSPMmust multiply an inventory increment by acombined absorption ratio to determinethe amount of additional section 263Acosts that must be added to the taxpayers'increment for the year. The proposed reg-ulations dened the numerator of the com-bined absorption ratio as total additionalsection 263A costs allocable to eligibleproperty remaining on hand at year endand the denominator as the total section471 costs remaining on hand at year end.The proposed regulations also specicallyrequested comments on how the MSPMshould apply to taxpayers using the LIFOmethod. One commenter suggested that LIFO- method taxpayers should be allowed touse the same two absorption ratios as tax-payers using the rst-in, rst-out (FIFO)method of accounting for inventories,rather than a combined absorption ratio, todetermine the amount of additional sec-tion 263A costs that must be added to theinventory increment for the year. Thissuggestion is not adopted because itwould require LIFO-method taxpayers todivide their inventory increments and dec-rements into raw material and productioncomponents, which would add unneces-sary complexity and administrability chal-lenges to the LIFO method and the MSPM. One commenter suggested that LIFO- method taxpayers should be allowed tochoose between annual absorption ratiosand shorter-term ratios, and base theshorter-term ratios on the taxpayer'smethod of determining the current-yearcost of the items in ending inventory andthe value of any inventory increments.This suggestion is not adopted because itignores the fact that indirect costs are fre-quently incurred outside of the periodused for determining current-year cost,and use of a shorter-term ratio could causedistortions. One commenter suggested that the - nal regulations provide special rules fortaxpayers that have elected to apply theLIFO method only to raw materials, in-cluding raw materials that have entered orcompleted the production process (the rawmaterial content LIFO method). Speci-cally, the commenter suggested that nalregulations provide that the combined ab-sorption ratio should be applied to anyLIFO increment of a taxpayer using theraw material content LIFO method withthe pre-production and production absorp-tion ratios applied separately to non-LIFOinventory. The Treasury Department andthe IRS agree that the combined, pre-production, and production absorption ra-tios could all apply in the case of a tax-payer using the raw material content LIFOmethod and believe this point is suf-ciently clear in these nal regulations. One commenter stated that the deni- tion of the combined absorption ratio wasambiguous because it did not indicatewhether the combined absorption ratiowas determined on a LIFO basis. TheTreasury Department and the IRS in-tended that the combined absorption ratiobe determined on a non-LIFO basis; ac-cordingly, this point is claried in thesenal regulations. 7.Denition of Section 471 Costs The proposed regulations provided one denition of section 471 costs that appliedto taxpayers using the SRM, SPM, orMSPM, regardless of whether those tax-payers were in existence before the effec-tive date of section 263A. The proposedregulations generally provided that a tax- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 960payer's section 471 costs were the costs, other than interest, that the taxpayer cap-italized to its inventory or other eligibleproperty in its nancial statements. Theproposed regulations also provided, con-sistent with the IRS's established admin-istrative practice, that taxpayers must in-clude all direct costs in section 471 costsregardless of the treatment of the costs intheir nancial statements. These nal regulations clarify that a taxpayer's section 471 costs are the typesof costs capitalized to property producedor property acquired for resale in the tax-payer's nancial statement. These nalregulations also clarify that a taxpayer de-termines the amounts of its section 471costs by using the amounts of those coststhat are incurred in the taxable year forfederal income tax purposes. These nalregulations also generally retain the pro-posed regulations' requirement that sec-tion 471 costs must include all direct costsof property produced and property ac-quired for resale. However, the Treasury Department and the IRS understand that maintainingseparate nancial statement and federalincome tax cost accounting systems oradjusting the amounts of costs capitalizedusing the taxpayer's nancial statementmethods for federal income tax purposescan be costly and burdensome. Therefore,these nal regulations provide an alterna-tive method that certain taxpayers mayuse to determine the amounts of their sec-tion 471 costs. This alternative method isavailable to a taxpayer that is permitted toinclude negative adjustments in additionalsection 263A costs to remove section if statementis described or(iii) (for example, a nancial statementrequired to be led with the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC); a certiedaudited nancial statement used for a sub-stantial non-tax purpose; or a nancialstatement (other than a tax return) re-quired to be provided to the government).This method is not available to a taxpayerif the taxpayer's nancial statement a purpose).The use of this alternative method is lim-ited to taxpayers that have certain nan-cial statements in order to provide ade-quate safeguards for the use of nancial statement amounts in the simplied methodformulas. A taxpayer that uses the alterna-tive method determines the amounts of allof its section 471 costs by using the amountsof costs capitalized to property produced orproperty acquired for resale in the taxpay-er's nancial statement using the taxpayer'snancial statement methods of accounting.A taxpayer using the alternative methodmay not include any nancial statementwrite-downs, reserves, or other nancialstatement valuation adjustments when de-termining the amounts of its section 471costs. In order to limit potential distortions in the simplied methods' absorption ra-tios, these nal regulations require a tax-payer that uses the alternative method toconsistently apply the method to all of itssection 471 costs, including any directcosts required to be included in section471 costs, any costs used for purposes ofapplying the de minimis direct costs rules,any costs included in additional section 263A costs after applying the de minimisdirect costs rules and the safe harbor rulefor certain variances and under or over-applied burdens, and any costs removedfrom section 471 costs because such costsare not required to be, or are not permittedto be, capitalized under section 263A. Inaddition, a taxpayer using the alternativemethod includes in additional section263A costs all negative adjustments toremove section 471 costs and all permit-ted positive and negative book-to-tax ad-justments. A taxpayer using the alterna-tive method, and the burden rate orstandard cost methods described in\u00a7 1.263A-1(f)(3), determines the book-to-tax adjustments required to be made as aresult of differences in nancial statementand tax amounts by comparing the actualamount of the cost incurred in the taxableyear for federal income tax purposes tothe actual amount of the cost incurred inthe taxable year in its nancial statementusing the taxpayer's nancial statementmethods of accounting, treats its variances or underor over-applied burdens. One commenter noted that the pro- posed regulations do not specify how tax-payers must account for differences be-tween their nancial statement methodsand the tax methods used to determine thevalue of ending inventory. These differ- ences include special tax methods, such asthe lower of cost or market method andthe retail inventory method, as well asspecial nancial statement methods, suchas write-downs or reserves for slow-moving goods. The nal regulations donot change the current requirement that ataxpayer must value its ending inventoryby applying its tax methods of accounting,and provide that a taxpayer using thealternative method to determine theamounts of its section 471 costs may notinclude any nancial statement write-downs, reserves, or other nancial state-ment valuation adjustments when deter-mining the amounts of its section 471costs. 8.Financial Statement Hierarchy and Record Keeping Requirements forFinancial Statements The proposed regulations did not pro- vide any guidance as to which nancialstatement a taxpayer uses to determine itssection 471 costs. For clarity and consis-tency, these nal regulations provide thatfor purposes of section 263A, a taxpayer'snancial statement is its nancial state-ment of the highest priority, in accordancewith the list of categories of nancialstatements, in order of priority, providedin these nal regulations. For example, inorder to determine its types of section 471costs, a taxpayer uses the types of costscapitalized in its nancial statement withthe highest priority within the categoriesdescribed in these nal regulations. These nal regulations do not impose any specic record keeping requirementsfor a taxpayer's identication of costs assection 471 or additional section 263Acosts, or for a taxpayer's determination ofthe amounts of section 471 costs. How-ever, the regulations under section 6001require a taxpayer to keep books and re-cords sufcient to establish the amount ofgross income, deductions, credits, or othermatters required to be shown in an incometax return, which includes the identica-tion of costs as section 471 or additionalsection 263A costs and the determinationof the amounts of section 471 costs. Thisrequirement also includes any books andrecords sufcient to establish a taxpayer'scalculation of variances and under or Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 961over-applied burdens used for nancial statement purposes. 9.De Minimis Exceptions for Certain Direct Costs in Section 471 Costs a.Direct Labor Costs As noted previously, the proposed reg- ulations provided, consistent with theIRS's established administrative practice,that taxpayers must include all direct costsin section 471 costs regardless of the treat-ment of the costs in their nancial state-ment. Both commenters stated that sometaxpayers do not capitalize certain directlabor costs (for example, holiday pay, sickleave pay, shift differential, and payrolltaxes) to inventory for nancial statementpurposes, and that the proposed regula-tions' requirement to include all directcosts in section 471 costs would forcethese taxpayers to create or purchase andmaintain a second inventory costing sys-tem for tax purposes only. These nal regulations generally retain the proposed regulations' requirement thatsection 471 costs must include all directcosts of property produced and propertyacquired for resale. However, to reducecompliance costs, burden, and administra-tive complexity, these nal regulationsprovide a de minimis direct labor costsrule to allow taxpayers using the SRM,SPM, or MSPM to include in additionalsection 263A costs, and exclude from sec-tion 471 costs, certain direct labor coststhat are not capitalized to property pro-duced or property acquired for resale inthe taxpayer's nancial statement (uncap-italized direct labor costs). However, ataxpayer cannot use this de minimis directlabor costs rule to include in additionalsection 263A costs basic compensation orovertime or the types of costs included inthe taxpayer's standard cost or burden ratemethods used for section 471 costs. Under this de minimis direct labor costs rule, a taxpayer includes in addi-tional section 263A costs, and excludesfrom section 471 costs, the total amount ofall direct labor costs that are incurred inthe taxable year that are uncapitalized di-rect labor costs, if the total amount ofthose costs is less than ve percent of totaldirect labor costs incurred in the taxableyear (whether or not capitalized for nan-cial statement purposes). The de minimis direct labor costs rule requires that anyamounts that constitute a reduction tocosts be treated as positive amounts forpurposes of determining whether the tax-payer's uncapitalized direct labor costsmeet the ve percent test. For a taxpayerusing the alternative method to determinethe amounts of its section 471 costs, theve percent test and the amount includedin additional section 263A costs are basedon the amount of uncapitalized direct la-bor costs and total direct labor costs thatare incurred in the taxable year in thetaxpayer's nancial statement using thetaxpayer's nancial statement methods ofaccounting. The alternative-method tax-payer includes in additional section 263Acosts any negative or positive adjustmentrequired to be made as a result of differ-ences in nancial statement and taxamounts of the taxpayer's de minimis di-rect labor costs. A taxpayer using a historic absorption ratio (HAR) that uses the de minimis di-rect labor costs rule during its test periodor updated test period could treat a partic-ular direct labor cost as an additional sec-tion 263A cost in one year of the testperiod or updated test period, and as asection 471 cost in a different year of thetest period or updated test period. The deminimis direct labor costs rule provides aspecial rule that requires this taxpayer touse the SRM, SPM, or MSPM and HARduring the qualifying period or extendedqualifying period in a manner that is mostconsistent with the treatment of the directlabor costs during the test period or up-dated test period. Under this rule, the tax-payer determines whether direct laborcosts are included in any of its section 471costs remaining on hand at year end dur-ing its qualifying period or extended qual-ifying period consistent with how thosedirect labor costs were classied in at leasttwo of the three years of the taxpayer'sapplicable test period or updated test pe-riod. b.Direct Material Costs The preamble to the proposed regula- tions stated that the proposed regulationsgenerally prohibited treating cash or tradediscounts as negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs under any of thesimplied methods. The proposed regula- tions expressly prohibited treating cash ortrade discounts as negative adjustments inadditional section 263A costs under theMSPM and the SRM, inadvertently omit-ting taxpayers using the SPM from theprohibition. The operative rule in the pro-posed regulations also specically re-quested comments on reasonable methodsof allocating cash or trade discounts thattaxpayers do not capitalize for nancialstatement purposes between ending inven-tory and cost of goods sold. In addition,the Treasury Department and the IRS areaware that some taxpayers do not capital-ize for nancial statement purposes cer-tain direct material costs (for example,transportation and other necessary chargesincurred to acquire possession of goods). One commenter stated that the pro- posed regulations' treatment of cash andtrade discounts would impose an admin-istrative burden on taxpayers that do nottreat any or all of their cash and tradediscounts as negative purchase or produc- tion costs for nancial statement purposes.The commenter suggested that, if the nalregulations preclude a taxpayer fromtreating cash and trade discounts as nega-tive additional section 263A costs, thentaxpayers should be allowed to allocatecash and trade discounts between endinginventory and costs of goods sold usingsome type of averaging convention. In general, cash and trade discounts related to section 471 costs, and transpor-tation and other necessary charges in-curred to acquire possession of goods, aretreated as adjustments to the underlyingsection 471 costs, and cannot be includedas a negative adjustment in additional sec-tion 263A costs. However, to reduce com-pliance costs, burden, and administrativecomplexity, these nal regulations pro-vide a de minimis direct material costsrule to allow taxpayers using the SRM,SPM, or MSPM to include in additionalsection 263A costs, and exclude from sec-tion 471 costs, certain material coststhat are uncapitalized nancial statementcosts. This de minimis direct materialcosts rule can be used for certain directmaterial costs that are not capitalized toproperty produced or property acquiredfor resale in a taxpayer's nancial state-ment (uncapitalized direct material costs)such as cash discounts, trade discounts, December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 962and freight-in costs. However, a taxpayer cannot use this de minimis direct materialcosts rule to include in additional section263A costs the types of costs that areincluded in the taxpayer's standard costmethod used for section 471 costs (includ-ing cash and trade discounts). Under this de minimis direct material costs rule, a taxpayer includes in addi-tional section 263A costs, and excludesfrom section 471 costs, the total amount ofall direct material costs incurred in thetaxable year that are uncapitalized directmaterial costs, if the amount of those costsin total comprise less than ve percent oftotal direct material costs incurred in thetaxable year (whether or not capitalizedfor nancial statement purposes). The deminimis direct material costs rule requiresthat any amounts that constitute a reduc-tion to costs, such as cash and trade dis-counts, be treated as positive amounts forpurposes of determining whether the tax-payer's uncapitalized direct material costsmeet the ve percent test. The de minimisdirect material costs rule operates simi-larly to the de minimis direct labor costsrule for an alternative method taxpayer,and for a taxpayer using a HAR. Becauseany direct material costs included in addi-tional section 263A costs after applyingthe de minimis direct material costs ruleare excluded from section 471 costs, suchdirect material costs are not treated assection 471 costs for any purpose, includ-ing as section 471 costs that are directmaterial costs in the modied simpliedproduction method formula. 10.Variances and Under- or Over- Applied burdens Both commenters stated that some tax- payers do not capitalize certain variancesrelated to direct costs to inventory fornancial statement purposes, and that theproposed regulations' requirement to in-clude all direct costs in section 471 costswould force these taxpayers to create orpurchase and maintain a second inventorycosting system for tax purposes only. TheIRS's established administrative practicerequires taxpayers to treat positive andnegative cost variances and under or over-applied burden amounts related to directand indirect section 471 costs as adjust-ments to the underlying section 471 costs.However, to reduce compliance costs, burden, and administrative complexity,these nal regulations provide a safe har-bor rule for taxpayers using the SRM,SPM, or MSPM to include in additionalsection 263A costs, and from sec-tion 471 costs, certain variances and underor over-applied burdens that are not cap-italized to property produced or propertyacquired for resale in the nan-cial statement (uncapitalized variances oruncapitalized under or over-applied bur-dens). Under this safe harbor rule, a taxpayer includes in additional section 263A costs,and excludes from section 471 costs, thesum of the amounts of all of those uncap-italized variances and uncapitalized underor over-applied burdens for that taxableyear, if such sum is less than ve percentof the taxpayer's total section 471 costsfor all items for which the taxpayer uses astandard cost or burden rate method toallocate costs. For purposes of this rule,total section 471 costs for all items for which the taxpayer uses a standard cost orburden rate method to allocate costs arecomputed before application of the safeharbor method, and must reflect the actualamounts incurred by the taxpayer on theseitems, which therefore include variancesand under or over-applied burdens. If thesum of the amounts of all of those uncap-italized variances and uncapitalized underor over-applied burdens in a taxable yearare not less than ve percent for the tax-able year, the taxpayer must reallocatesuch uncapitalized amounts to or amongunits of property as required by \u00a7 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i)(C) or (f)(3)(ii)(B), respectively. Under this safe harbor rule, all vari- ances and under or over-applied burdensare treated as positive amounts for pur-poses of determining whether the taxpay-er's uncapitalized variances and uncapi-talized under or over-applied burdensmeet this ve percent test. Additionally,this safe harbor rule applies to any vari-ances on cash or trade discounts that areincluded in the taxpayer's standard cost, ifthose discounts are capitalized as part ofthe taxpayer's standard cost method usedfor section 471 costs. An eligible taxpayermust consistently apply the safe harbormethod to all items for which the taxpayeruses a standard cost or burden rate methodto allocate costs. However, the safe harborrule only applies taxpayer's uncapi- underor over-applied burdens. ataxpayer using this safe harbor rule is notpermitted to treat uncapitalized variancesand uncapitalized under or over-appliedburdens that are not signicant as not al-locable to property produced or propertyacquired for resale under \u00a7 1.263A-1(f)(3)(i)(C) and (f)(3)(ii)(B), respec-tively. Finally, for taxpayers using either the SRM or MSPM, allocation rules are pro-vided to help taxpayers allocate these un-capitalized costs between storage and han-dling costs and current year purchasingcosts, in the case of the SRM, and pre-production and production costs, in thecase of the MSPM. 11.Smaller Taxpayers Using the SPM The proposed regulations allowed tax- payers with average annual gross receiptsof $10,000,000 or less for the three previ-ous taxable years to include negative ad-justments in additional section 263A costsunder the SPM. One commenter stated that average an- nual gross receipts of $10,000,000 or lessdoes not accurately represent a \"small tax-payer.\" The commenter suggested usingthe average aggregate value of ending in-ventory, rather than gross receipts, toidentify this group of taxpayers. Bothcommenters also stated that small taxpay-ers would have difculty complying withthe MSPM. The Treasury Department and the IRS do not believe that an average aggregatedending inventory value accurately identi-es smaller taxpayers because inventoryvalue can fluctuate greatly within the tax-able year, or from year to year. Accord-ingly, this suggestion is not adopted.However, to reduce compliance costs andburden for smaller taxpayers using theSPM and minimize the difculty thatsmaller taxpayers may face complyingwith the MSPM, these nal regulationsallow taxpayers with average annual grossreceipts of $50,000,000 or less for thethree previous taxable years to includenegative adjustments in additional section263A costs under the SPM. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 96312.Comments Regarding the HAR and the MSPM The proposed regulations provided that a taxpayer using the MSPM could makethe HAR election. Under the proposedregulations, a non-LIFO-method taxpayerusing the MSPM with the HAR electioncalculates both a pre-production HAR anda production HAR, to be used for eachtaxable year within a qualifying period (inplace of the actual pre-production absorp-tion ratio and actual production absorptionratio). In the rst taxable year followingthe close of a qualifying period\u2014the re-computation year\u2014if the taxpayer's ac-tual pre-production absorption ratio or ac-tual production absorption ratio is notwithin one-half of one percentage point(plus or minus) of the correspondingHAR, the taxpayer must use actual ab-sorption ratios during an updated test pe-riod, and the qualifying period is not ex-tended. A LIFO-method taxpayer usingthe MSPM with the HAR election, how-ever, calculates a combined HAR to beused for each taxable year within a qual-ifying period (in place of the actual com-bined absorption ratio). In the recomputa-tion year, if the LIFO-method taxpayer'sactual combined absorption ratio is notwithin one-half of one percentage point(plus or minus) of the combined HAR, thetaxpayer must use an actual combined ab-sorption ratio during an updated test pe-riod, and the qualifying period is not ex-tended. One commenter suggested that the rules for determining whether a qualifyingperiod is extended for LIFO taxpayersshould also apply to non-LIFO-methodtaxpayers, and therefore, in the recompu-tation year, all taxpayers should use acombined HAR to compare to an actualcombined absorption ratio. This sugges-tion is not adopted because calculating combined absorption ratios does notmatch the ratios required to be calculatedby a non-LIFO-method taxpayer using theMSPM. A non-LIFO-method taxpayer us-ing the MSPM is required to calculateseparate absorption ratios, even when us-ing the HAR. The proposed regulations also speci- cally requested comments on transitionrules for taxpayers currently using theSPM with the HAR election that changeto the MSPM, including comments on how the regulations should apply to tax-payers within a qualifying period as de-scribed in \u00a7 1.263A-2(b)(4)(ii)(C). Onecommenter suggested allowing taxpayerscurrently using the HAR that are changingto the MSPM with the HAR election toopen a new test period. Additionally, onecommenter suggested that taxpayers bepermitted to make the change using a sec-tion 481(a) adjustment instead of a cut-offmethod. Except as otherwise expressly pro- vided by the Code or the regulationsthereunder, section 446(e) and \u00a7 1.446-1(e)(2) require a taxpayer to secure theconsent of the Commissioner beforechanging a method of accounting for fed-eral income tax purposes. Section 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) authorizes the Commissioner toprescribe administrative procedures set-ting forth the terms and conditions neces-sary for a taxpayer to obtain consent to achange in method of accounting. RevenueProcedure 2015-13, 2015-5 IRB Proc. 2017-59,2017-48 IRB 543, provides the generalprocedures by which a taxpayer may ob-tain automatic consent of the Commis-sioner to a change in method of account-ing described in Rev. Proc. 2018-31,2018-22 IRB 637. The automatic consentprocedures reduce ling requirements,waive user fees, and extend ling dead-lines normally associated with a requestfor change in method of accounting. Simultaneously with the publication of these nal regulations, the Treasury De-partment and the IRS are issuing RevenueProcedure 2018-56 (2018-50 IRB) tomodify Rev. Proc. 2018-31 and providethe procedures by which a taxpayer mayobtain automatic consent to make certainmethod changes to conform to these nalregulations, such as a change to theMSPM by a taxpayer using the HAR. 13.Procedural Requirements for Changing Section 471 Costs orChanging to the MSPM The proposed regulations did not pro- vide procedural rules for taxpayers chang-ing to comply with the nal regulations.One commenter suggested that the auto- matic change procedures apply or thatprocedures be implemented allowing thechange to be made on an expedited basis. Simultaneously with the publication of these nal regulations, the Treasury De-partment and the IRS are issuing RevenueProcedure 2018-56 to modify Rev. Proc.2018-31 and provide the procedures bywhich a taxpayer may obtain automaticconsent to make certain method changesto conform to these nal regulations, suchas a change to comply with the new def-inition of section 471 costs or a change tothe MSPM. Effective Date These nal regulations are generally effective as of November 20, 2018 andapply for taxable years beginning on orafter November 20, 2018. For any taxableyear that both begins before November20, 2018 and ends after November 20,2018, the IRS will not challenge returnpositions consistent with all of these nalregulations. Special Analyses Regulatory Planning and Review - Economic Analysis Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 di- rect agencies to assess costs and benetsof available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatoryapproaches that maximize net benets (in-cluding potential economic, environmental,public health and safety effects, distributiveimpacts, and equity). Executive Order13563 emphasizes the importance of quan-tifying both costs and benets, reducingcosts, of harmonizing rules, and of promot-ing flexibility. These nal regulations have been des- ignated by the Ofce of Information andRegulatory Affairs (OIRA) as Signicantunder Executive Order 12866 and section1(b) of the Memorandum of Agreement(April 11, 2018) between the TreasuryDepartment and the Ofce of Manage-ment and Budget (OMB) regarding re-view of tax regulations and thereby sub-ject to review under Executive Order12866. Accordingly, these nal regula-tions have been reviewed by OIRA. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 964A.Overview These nal regulations provide taxpay- ers with computational and denitionalguidance regarding the application of sec-tion 263A under the simplied methods.Specically, they provide guidance fortaxpayers to determine the amount of ad-ditional section 263A costs to capitalizeand make several changes regarding theapplication of section 263A under thesimplied methods to reduce compliancecosts, burden, and administrative com-plexity. This economic analysis describesthe economic benets and costs of thesenal regulations. B.Economic Analysis of the Final Regulations 1. Background For a discussion of the background of these nal regulations, see the Back-ground sections of this preamble and theproposed regulations. 2. Anticipated Benets and Costs of the Final Regulations a. Baseline The Treasury Department and the IRS have assessed the benets and costs ofthese nal regulations against a status quobaseline that reflects projected tax-relatedand other behavior in the absence of thesenal regulations and includes the effect ofNotice 2007-29. Notice 2007-29 allowstaxpayers to include negative adjustmentsin computing additional costs under sec-tion 263A and allows aggregate negativeadditional section 263 costs. b. Anticipated Benets The Treasury Department and the IRS expect that the certainty and clarity pro-vided by these nal regulations as well asthe substantive contribution of the regula-tions will enhance economic efciencyrelative to the baseline. In developing these nal regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRShave generally aimed to apply the princi-ple that an economically efcient tax sys-tem would treat income derived from sim-ilar economic decisions similarly, to the extent consistent with the Code and con-siderations of administrability of the taxsystem. An economically efcient tax system would generally allow businesses to de-duct from income taxes an amount meantto capture the economic cost of their cap-ital investments. Under this principle,rules for capitalization and deductions aremost efcient when they most closelymimic true economic depreciation. Thisconclusion is complicated by a large num-ber of real world factors, including thateconomic depreciation is endogenous anddifcult to measure and that the tax sys-tem itself will affect true depreciation.Furthermore, the principles from whichthe true-economic-depreciation prescrip-tion is derived are themselves based on a\"pure\" tax system rather than the complexreal world tax code. The Treasury Depart-ment and the IRS do not anticipate sub-stantial changes to the aggregate cost ofgoods sold, the aggregate tax bases of other produced assets, or the depreciationdeductions that will be generated underthe new simplied method, the MSPM,relative to the baseline. Therefore thesenal regulations should not materially af-fect aggregate tax revenues or aggregateinventory investment relative to the base-line. There may be some modest increasein investment in inventory. For example,investment in raw materials inventorymay increase under these nal regulationsbecause the relative tax cost of buying andcarrying raw materials under the MSPM isgenerally less than under the SPM. Treat-ment of inventory under the simpliedmethods generally remains the same. Be-cause the tax system requires a periodicdetermination of inventory, there was andstill is, an incentive to minimize inventoryas of that date, usually the end of thetaxable year. The increased investment inraw materials inventory under the MSPMis due to the fact that inventory as of thedetermination date may be divided intopre-production and production inventoryand a specic rate is applied to estimateoverhead for each category. While underthe SPM the inventory as of the determi-nation date is not divided and one rate isused to estimate overhead for all inven-tory. There may also be a modest shiftingof investment between different types ofinventory because the MSPM should im- prove the measurement of certain types ofnal inventory and improved precisionwould generally lead to small adjustmentsin inventory amounts. Though no specictypes of inventory are treated favorably,the modest shifting of investment is ex-pected because the reduced carrying costassociated with maintaining raw materialsinventory may encourage or allow sometaxpayers to carry a larger quantity of rawmaterials for business purposes. c. Anticipated Impacts on Administrative and Compliance Costs The Treasury Department and the IRS expect that the certainty, clarity, and sim-plifying changes regarding the applicationof section 263A provided by these nalregulations, relative to the baseline, willreduce annual compliance costs, burden,and administrative complexity. Absentthese nal regulations, different partieswould continue to take different positionsregarding the inclusion of negative adjust-ments in computing additional costs undersection 263A and the permissibility of ag-gregate negative additional section 263Acosts. More uniform positions by taxpay-ers will in general reduce the costs of taxadministration. For taxpayers, the major cost savings of these nal regulations derive from thereduction in the computational andrecord-keeping burdens involved with theuse of the simplied methods for calculat-ing end-of-year inventory. These burdensare reduced because taxpayers will nowgenerally be able to use their own currentnancial accounting methods to determinetheir section 471 costs, albeit using costamounts determined under tax law. Tax-payers with audited nancial statements,or those who le regulatory nancialstatements, will also be able to use costamounts determined according to nan-cial accounting rules. In addition, taxpay-ers using a simplied method will be ableto make positive and negative adjustmentsto their additional section 263A costs incases where their section 471 costs, deter-mined using nancial accounting meth-ods, either do not capitalize all actualcosts or over-capitalize those costs. Fi-nally, taxpayers using the SRM or theMSPM, and smaller taxpayers (those with Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 965average gross receipts of $50 million or less) using the SPM will be able to makenegative adjustments to their additionalsection 263A costs in cases where thecapitalization of certain costs is either op-tional or not permitted under the tax law.It is anticipated that larger taxpayers usingthe SPM who desire such treatment willswitch from using the SPM to the MSPMin order to continue to make these nega-tive adjustments. In addition, absent these nal regula- tions, taxpayers and the IRS would: (1)Continue to be required to use denitionsbased on a taxpayer's accounting prac-tices used in 1986; (2) continue to berequired to use tax accounting rules, ratherthan their own nancial accounting rules,to determine the allocation of certain cap-italized amounts; (3) not be able to use theMSPM to more precisely determine thelump-sum of costs to capitalize; (4) not beable to use the new safe-harbors for directlabor and direct material costs not capital-ized on a taxpayer's nancial statements;and (5) not be able to use the de minimis rules for variances and under- or over-applied burden not capitalized on a tax-payer's nancial statements. The changesin each of these directions under the nalregulations will generally reduce taxpayercompliance costs. For example, underthese nal regulations, one denition ofsection 471 costs applies to all taxpayers,regardless of when the taxpayer came intoexistence. Previously, taxpayers in exis-tence when section 263A was enactedwere required to use denitions based ontheir actual tax cost accounting practices as of enactment. However, taxpayers thatwere not in existence when section 263Awas enacted were required to use deni-tions based on what their tax cost account-ing practices would have been as of en-actment under the law at that time. Underthese nal regulations, all taxpayers usetheir present nancial statement cost ac-counting practices. Moreover, taxpayersusing the simplied resale method or sim-plied production method will benetfrom no longer being required to adjusttheir section 471 costs incurred during thetaxable year to reflect tax adjustments intheir respective simplied method for-mula. Rather, these simplied method tax-payers may use an alternative method thatpermits them to use their nancial state-ment amounts for their section 471 costsincurred during the taxable year and maketax adjustments to these costs by usingnegative adjustments to their section263A costs. The most recently available Statistics of Income (SOI) indicates that approxi-mately 30,000 taxpayers were subject tosection 263A in 2015 and would be im-pacted by these nal regulations. Whilethe number of affected taxpayers will in-crease with growth in the economy, theTreasury Department and the IRS do notexpect that these nal regulations willchange the portion of affected taxpayersthat use a simplied method because thosetaxpayers not using a simplied methodwill likely continue to allocate capitaliz-able costs to specic items of propertyunder their present method, and taxpayers using a simplied method are not likely tobegin capitalizing costs to specic itemsof property due to these nal regulations.The IRS's Ofce of Research, AppliedAnalytics, and Statistics (RAAS) estimatethat 30,000 taxpayers spent approx-imately 315,000 hours and $26 million($2015) annually to comply with the sim-plied methods, as implemented underNotice 2007-29. The dollar burden is de-rived from RAAS's Business TaxpayerBurden model that relates time and out- of-pocket costs of business tax prepara-tion, derived from survey data, to assetsand receipts of affected taxpayers alongwith other relevant variables, and con-verted by the Treasury Department to$2015. See Tax Compliance Burden (JohnGuyton et al, July 2018) at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/d13315.pdf. TheTreasury Department and IRS then usedthis framework to estimate the taxpayerburden associated with section 263A com-pliance under the nal regulations. Theseestimates reflect the Treasury Depart-ment's and IRS's estimate that becausethese nal regulations implement an ap-proach substantially consistent with cur-rent practice, but also offer taxpayers ad-ditional compliance simplications, thesenal regulations will result in a reductionin the aggregate annual taxpayer compli-ance burden of approximately ten percent.The estimated reduction in annual compli-ance burden for impacted taxpayers issummarized below. Estimated Reduction in Annual Compliance Burden (2015 levels) Baseline Final Regulations Burden Reduction Taxpayers 30,000 30,000 - Hours 315,000 283,500 31,500Cost ($2015) $26,000,000 $23,400,000 $2,600,000 C.Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information in these nal regulations is in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(4)(i).The collection of information in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(4)(i) only applies to taxpayers using theMPSM with HAR. The burden for the col-lection of information contained in thesenal regulations is reflected in the burdenfor \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-2(b)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) and1.263A-3(d)(4)(iii)(A) and (B) and is notexpected to change the previously deter- mined estimated annual burden per respon-dent, the estimated annual burden per re-cordkeeper, or the estimated number ofrespondents because (i) taxpayers could pre-viously use a simplied method with HAR,(ii) these nal regulations do not make asimplied method with HAR more or lessdesirable, and (iii) only those taxpayers pre-viously using a simplied method withHAR are likely to do so under these nalregulations. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)),the reporting burden associated with\u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(4)(i) will be reflected in theIRS Form 14029, Paperwork Reduction ActSubmission, associated with Form 1120(OMB control number atwww.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 966D.Executive Order 13771 These nal regulations are expected to be an Executive Order 13771 deregulatoryaction. Details on the estimated effects ofthis rule can be found in the rule's eco-nomic analysis. E.Regulatory Flexibility Analysis It is hereby certied that these nal regulations will not have a signicant eco-nomic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This certication is basedon the fact that: (1) many small businesstaxpayers are no longer required to capi-talize costs under section 263A if theiraverage annual gross receipts are less than $25,000,000; (2) a taxpayer withaverage annual gross receipts of lessthan $50,000,000 may continue to usethe simplied production method andthe simplied production method with ahistorical absorption rate (HAR) withnegative amounts in additional section263A costs; and (3) a relatively smallnumber of taxpayers use a simpliedmethod with HAR compared to a sim-plied method without HAR and, there-fore, it is expected that few small busi-ness taxpayers will use the modiedsimplied production method withHAR. Thus, a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis under the Regulatory Flexibil-ity Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) is not re-quired. F.Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires that agenciesassess anticipated costs and benets andtake certain other actions before issuing anal rule that includes any Federal man-date that may result in expenditures in anyone year by a state, local, or tribal gov-ernment, in the aggregate, or by the pri-vate sector, of $100 million in 1995 dol-lars, updated annually for inflation. In2018, that threshold is approximately$150 million. This rule does not includeany Federal mandate that may result inexpenditures by state, local, or tribal gov-ernments, or by the private sector in ex-cess of that threshold.G.Executive Order 13132: Federalism Executive Order 13132 (entitled \"Fed- eralism\") prohibits an agency from pub-lishing any rule that has federalism impli-cations if the rule either imposessubstantial, direct compliance costs onstate and local governments, and is notrequired by statute, or preempts state law,unless the agency meets the consultationand funding requirements of section 6 ofthe Executive Order. This rule does nothave federalism implications and does notimpose substantial direct compliancecosts on state and local governments orpreempt state law within the meaning ofthe Executive Order.

( 1 )***S e e however, the simplied production method, the modied simpli-ed production method, and the simpliedresale method (c)and 471 costs general . Except as otherwise provided in para-graphs (d)(2)(ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of thissection, for purposes of section 263A, ataxpayer's section 471 costs are the typesof costs, other than interest, that a tax-payer capitalizes to property produced orproperty acquired for resale in its nancialstatement. Thus, although section 471 ap-plies only to inventories, section 471 costsinclude any non-inventory costs, otherthan interest, that a taxpayer capitalizes to,or includes in acquisition or productioncosts of, property produced or propertyacquired for resale in its nancial state-ment. Except as otherwise provided inparagraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, a tax-payer determines the amounts of section471 costs by using the amounts of suchcosts that are incurred in the taxable yearfor federal income tax purposes. (ii)Inclusion of direct costs -(A) In general . Notwithstanding the last sen- tence of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, ataxpayer's section 471 costs must includeall direct costs of property produced andproperty acquired for resale, whether ornot a taxpayer capitalizes these costs toproperty produced or property acquiredfor resale in its nancial statement. Seeparagraph (e)(2) of this section for a de-scription of direct costs of property pro-duced and property acquired for resale. (B)Allocation of direct costs . Except for any direct costs that are treated asadditional section 263A costs under para-graphs (d)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, ataxpayer's direct costs of property pro-duced and property acquired for resale must be allocated using a method pro-vided in paragraph (f) of this section. (iii) Alternative method to determine amounts of section 471 costs by usingtaxpayer's nancial statement -(A) In general . In lieu of determining the amounts of section 471 costs under para-graph (d)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayerdescribed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of thissection may determine the amounts ofsection 471 costs by using the amounts ofsuch costs that are incurred in the taxableyear in its nancial statement using the taxpayer's nancial statement methods ofaccounting if taxpayer's nancial state-ment is described in paragraph (d)(6)(i), (ii),or (iii) of this section. If the taxpayer's -nancial statement is described only in para-graph (d)(6)(iv) of this section, the taxpayermay not use the alternative method de-scribed in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) and mustuse the method described in paragraph(d)(2)(i) of this section to determine itsamounts of section 471 costs. A taxpayer using the alternative method described inthis paragraph (d)(2)(iii) must remove allsection 471 costs described in paragraph(d)(2)(vi) of this section, if any, by in- cluding negative adjustments in addi-tional section 263A costs. A taxpayerusing the alternative method describedin this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) applies themethod to all of its section 471 costs,including costs described under para-graphs (d)(2)(ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) ofthis section. (B) Book-to-tax adjustments . A tax- payer using the alternative method de-scribed in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) mustinclude as additional section 263A costsall negative and positive adjustments re-quired to be made as a result of differ-ences in the book and tax amounts of thetaxpayer's section 471 costs, including ad-justments for direct costs required to beadded to section 471 costs under para-graph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, and section 471 costs underparagraphs (d)(2)(vi) and (d)(3)(ii)(B) ofthis section. In addition, the taxpayer mustinclude as additional section 263A costsall negative and positive adjustments re-quired to be made as a result of differ-ences in the book and tax amounts ofsection 471 costs that are treated as addi-tional section 263A costs (for example, deminimis direct costs described in para- graph (d)(2)(iv) of this section and certainvariances and under or over-applied bur-dens described in paragraph (d)(2)(v) ofthis section). For purposes of determiningthe negative and positive adjustments re-quired to be made as a result of differ-ences in book and tax amounts for a tax-payer using the burden rate or standardcost methods described in paragraph (f)(3)of this section, the taxpayer compares theactual amount of the cost incurred in thetaxable year for federal income tax pur-poses to the actual amount of the costincurred in the taxable year in its nancialstatement using the taxpayer's nancialstatement methods of accounting, regard-less of how the taxpayer treats its vari-ances or under or over-applied burdens. (C) Exclusion of certain nancial statement items . A taxpayer that deter- mines the amounts of section 471 costsunder this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) may notinclude any nancial statement reserves, or other nancial state-ment valuation adjustments when deter-mining the amounts of its section 471costs. (D)Changes in method of accounting . The use of this method to determine theamounts of section 471 costs under thisparagraph (d)(2)(iii) is the adoption of, ora change in, a method of accounting undersection 446 of the Internal Revenue Code. (E)Examples . The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(2)(iii): (1)Example 1-Alternative-method taxpayer us- ing de minimis direct labor costs rule . Taxpayer P uses the modied simplied production method de-scribed in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c) and determines its amountsof section 471 costs by using the alternative methodunder paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. Addition-ally, P uses the de minimis direct labor costs ruleunder paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. P doesnot capitalize vacation pay or holiday pay to prop-erty produced or property acquired for resale in itsnancial statement but does capitalize all other directlabor costs to such property in its nancial statement.On its 2018 nancial statement, P incurs $3,500,000of total direct labor costs, including $110,000 ofvacation pay costs and $10,000 of holiday pay costs.For federal income tax purposes, P incurs $150,000of vacation pay costs and $18,000 of holiday paycosts in the taxable year. P's uncapitalized directlabor costs are $120,000 ($110,000 of vacation payplus $10,000 of holiday pay). For purposes of theve percent test in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of thissection, P's uncapitalized direct labor costs are3.43% of total direct labor costs ($120,000 dividedby $3,500,000). Accordingly, under paragraph(d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, P includes $120,000 in Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 969its additional section 263A costs and excludes that amount from its section 471 costs in the taxable year.Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) ofthis section, P includes in additional section 263Acosts a positive book-to-tax adjustment of $40,000for vacation pay costs ($150,000 tax amount -$110,000 book amount) and a positive book-to-taxadjustment of $8,000 for holiday pay costs ($18,000tax amount - $10,000 book amount). (2)Example 2-Alternative-method taxpayer with under and over-applied burdens that uses safe har-bor rule for certain variances and under or over-applied burdens . Taxpayer X uses the modied sim- plied production method described in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c) and determines its amounts of section 471 costsby using the alternative method under paragraph(d)(2)(iii) of this section. In 2018, X uses a burdenrate method for book purposes to allocate costs toProducts A and B, and does not capitalize any underor over-applied burdens to property produced orproperty acquired for resale in its nancial statement.X does not allocate costs to any other products usinga burden rate method, and X does not allocate coststo any products using a standard cost method. On its2018 nancial statement, using X's burden rate, thetotal amount of predetermined indirect costs forProduct A is $545,000 and the total amount of actualindirect costs incurred for Product A is $550,000;accordingly, X has an under-applied burden of$5,000 for Product A. For federal income tax pur-poses, the actual indirect costs incurred in 2018 forProduct A is $560,000. Additionally, on its 2018nancial statement, using X's burden rate, the total amount of predetermined indirect costs for ProductB is $250,000 and the total amount of actual indirectcosts incurred for Product B is $225,000; accord-ingly, X has an over-applied burden of $25,000 forProduct B. For federal income tax purposes, theactual indirect costs incurred in 2018 for Product Bis $240,000. X uses the safe harbor rule for certainvariances and under or over-applied burdens. Prior tothe application of this safe harbor rule, X's totalsection 471 costs for 2018 for Products A and B (theonly items to which X allocates costs using a stan-dard cost method or burden rate method) are$2,000,000, which includes $550,000 actual indirectcosts for Product A, $225,000 actual indirect costsfor Product B, and $1,225,000 of other section 471costs for Products A and B that are not allocatedunder X's burden rate method. For purposes of de-termining the amount of uncapitalized variances anduncapitalized under or over-applied burdens for theve percent in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of thissection, X's under and over-applied burdens forProducts A and B are treated as positive amounts.Consequently, the sum of X's uncapitalized burden forProduct B). Accordingly, under paragraph(d)(2)(v)(A) of this section, the sum of X's uncapi-talized variances and uncapitalized under or over-applied burdens is 1.5% of X's total section 471costs for all items to which it allocates costs using astandard cost method or burden rate method($30,000 divided by $2,000,000), and X includes apositive $5,000 under-applied for Product Aand a negative $25,000 over-applied burden forProduct B in its additional section 263A costs, and excludes those amounts from its section 471 costs.Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, X includes in its additional section 263Acosts a positive book-to-tax adjustment of $10,000for Product A ($560,000 actual cost tax amount -$550,000 actual cost book amount) and a positivebook-to-tax adjustment of $15,000 for Product B($240,000 actual tax amount cost - $225,000 actualbook amount cost) in the taxable year. (iv) De minimis rule exceptions for certain direct costs \u2014(A) In general . Not- withstanding paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of thissection, a taxpayer that uses the simpliedresale method, the simplied productionmethod, or the modied simplied pro-duction method, and that does not capital-ize certain direct costs to property pro-duced or property acquired for resale in itsnancial statement (uncapitalized directlabor costs or uncapitalized direct materialcosts), may use either or both the de mi-nimis direct labor costs rule or the deminimis direct material costs rule to in-clude in additional section 263A costs,and exclude from section 471 costs, cer-tain uncapitalized direct labor costs or un-capitalized direct material costs that areincurred in the taxable year as provided inparagraphs (d)(2)(iv)(B) and (C) of thissection, respectively. The use of the deminimis rules described in paragraphs(d)(2)(iv)(B) and (C) of this section is theadoption of, or a change in, a method ofaccounting under section 446 of the Inter-nal Revenue Code. (B)De minimis rule for certain direct labor costs . A taxpayer described in para- graph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section thatuses the de minimis rule described in thisparagraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) includes in addi-tional section 263A costs, and excludesfrom section 471 costs, the sum of theamounts of all of those uncapitalized direct labor costs that are incurred in the taxableyear, if that sum is less than ve percent oftotal direct labor costs incurred in the tax-able year (whether or not capitalized in thetaxpayer's nancial statement), anotheramount specied in other published guid-ance ( see\u00a7 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). For purposes of determining the amount ofuncapitalized direct labor costs for this vepercent test, any amounts that constitute areduction to costs are treated as a positiveamount. The amounts of uncapitalized di-rect labor costs used for the ve percent test, and the amounts of uncapitalizeddirect labor costs included in additionalsection 263A costs under this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B), must not include amountsrelating to basic compensation or over-time, or the types of costs included inthe taxpayer's standard cost or burdenrate methods used for section 471 costs(but see paragraphs (d)(2)(v) and(f)(3)(i)(C) of this section for for certain variances and under orover-applied burdens). (C)De minimis rule for certain direct material costs . A taxpayer described in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section thatuses the de minimis rule described in thisparagraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) includes addi- tional section 263A costs, and excludesfrom section 471 costs, the sum of theamounts of all of those uncapitalized directmaterial costs that are incurred in the taxableyear, if that sum is less than ve percent oftotal direct material costs incurred in thetaxable year (whether or not capitalized inthe taxpayer's nancial see\u00a7 601.601(d)(2) of chap- For purposes of determining theamount of uncapitalized direct materialcosts for this ve percent test, any amountsthat constitute a reduction to costs, such ascash and trade discounts, are treated as apositive amount. The amounts of uncapital-ized direct material costs used for the vepercent test, and the amounts of uncapital-ized direct material costs included in addi-tional section 263A costs under this para-graph (d)(2)(iv)(C), must not include thetypes of costs included in the taxpayer'sstandard cost method used for section 471costs (but see paragraphs (d)(2)(v) and(f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for special rulesfor certain variances). (D)Taxpayers using a historic absorp- tion ratio . A taxpayer that uses the historic absorption ratio provided in \u00a7 1.263A-2(b)(4) or (c)(4) or \u00a7 rule described inparagraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section duringits test period or updated test period, de-termines whether direct labor costs or di-rect material costs, as applicable, are in-cluded in any of its section 471 costsremaining on hand at year end during itsqualifying period or extended qualifyingperiod according to how those direct laborcosts or direct material costs, respectively,are identied in at least two of the threeyears of the taxpayer's applicable test pe- December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 970riod or updated test period. If a taxpayer described in this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(D)is required to revise any of its actual ab-sorption ratios for its test period or up-dated test period as a result of a change ina method of accounting, the taxpayer de-termines whether direct labor costs or di-rect material costs, as applicable, are in-cluded in any of its section 471 costs onhand at year end during a qualifying pe-riod or extended qualifying period accord-ing to how those direct labor costs or direct material costs, respectively, areidentied in the taxpayer's revised actualabsorption ratios during its applicable testperiod or updated test period. (E)Examples . The following examples illustrate this paragraph (d)(2)(iv): (1)Example 1-Taxpayer using de minimis direct material costs rule . Taxpayer R uses the modied simplied production method described in\u00a7 1.263A-2(c) and the de minimis method of ac-counting under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) of this sec-tion. In 2018, R does not capitalize freight-in costs ortrade discounts to property produced or propertyacquired for resale in its nancial statement but doescapitalize all other direct material costs to such prop-erty in its nancial statement. R incurs total direct material costs of $3,105,000, which represents invoiceprice of $3,000,000 on goods purchased, plus $120,000of freight-in costs, less $15,000 for trade discounts. Forpurposes of determining the amount of uncapitalizeddirect material costs for the ve percent test in para-graph (d)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, R's trade discountsare treated as a positive amount. Consequently, R'suncapitalized direct material costs for purposes of theve percent test are $135,000 ($120,000 of freight-inplus $15,000 of trade discounts). Accordingly, underparagraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, R's uncapital-ized direct material costs are 4.35% of total directmaterial costs ($135,000 divided by $3,105,000), and a positive $120,000 of freight-in and a nega-tive $15,000 of trade discounts in its additional section263A costs and excludes those amounts from its sec-tion 471 costs in the taxable year. (2)Example 2-Taxpayer using de minimis direct labor costs rule and historic absorption ratio . Tax- payer S uses the historic absorption ratio provided in\u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(4). S uses the de minimis method ofaccounting under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B). S ex-cludes certain uncapitalized direct labor costs fromits section 471 costs (and includes them in additionalsection 263A costs) under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) ofthis section in Years 1 and 3 of its applicable testperiod. Because S excluded direct labor costs fromits section 471 costs in at least two of the three yearsof its applicable test period, S must exclude thosesame costs from its pre-production and productionsection 471 costs remaining on hand at year endduring its qualifying period or extended qualifyingperiod. (v)Safe harbor method for certain variances and under or bur-dens\u2014(A) In general . Notwithstandingparagraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii), (f)(3)(i)(C), (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayerthat uses the simplied resale method, thesimplied production method, or the mod-ied simplied production method, mayuse the safe harbor method described inthis paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) for all of itsvariances and under or over-applied bur-dens that are not capitalized to propertyproduced or property acquired for resalein its nancial statement (uncapitalizedvariances and uncapitalized under or over-applied burdens). A taxpayer using thissafe harbor method must include in addi-tional section 263A costs, and excludefrom section 471 costs, the sum of theamounts of all of those uncapitalized vari-ances and uncapitalized under or over- applied burdens for the taxable year, if thatsum is less than ve percent of the taxpay-er's total section 471 costs for all items towhich it allocates costs using a standard costmethod or burden rate method, or anotherpercentage specied in other publishedguidance ( see\u00a7 601.601(d)(2) uncapitalized variancesand uncapitalized under or over-applied bur-dens is not less than this ve percent thresh-old, the taxpayer may not exclude such un-capitalized variances and uncapitalizedunder or over-applied burdens from section471 costs, must reallocate such uncap-italized variances and uncapitalized under orover-applied burdens to or among the unitsof property to which the costs are allocablein accordance with paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(C)and (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but see para-graph (d)(2)(v)(B) of this section for a rulethat a taxpayer using the safe harbor methoddescribed in this paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A)may not use the methods of accounting de-scribed in paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(C) and(f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section to treat certainuncapitalized variances and certain uncapi-talized under or over-applied burdens as notallocable to property). For purposes of de-termining the amounts of uncapitalized vari-ances and uncapitalized under or over-applied burdens for this ve percent test, allvariances and under or over-applied burdensare treated as positive amounts. Addition-ally, for purposes of this ve percent test, ataxpayer's total section 471 costs for allitems to which it allocates costs using astandard cost method or burden rate methodare determined before application of the safeharbor method described in this paragraph(d)(2)(v)(A), and therefore this amount must reflect the actual amounts incurred by thetaxpayer for those items during the taxableyear, which includes variances and under orover-applied burdens. The variances de-scribed in this paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) in-clude any variances on cash or trade dis-counts, if those discounts are capitalized aspart of the taxpayer's standard cost methodused for section 471 costs. (B)Consistency requirement . A tax- payer using the safe harbor method de-scribed in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of thissection must use the method consistentlyfor all items to which it allocates costsusing a standard cost method or burdenrate method and may not use the methodsof accounting described in paragraphs(f)(3)(i)(C) and (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this sectionto its uncapitalized un-capitalized or are not in amount relativeto the taxpayer's total indirect costs in-curred with respect to production and re-sale activities for the year as not allocable to property produced or property acquiredfor resale. (C)Allocation of variances and under or over-applied burdens between produc-tion and preproduction costs under themodied simplied production method .I n the case of a taxpayer using the modiedsimplied production method and the safeharbor method described in paragraph(d)(2)(v)(A) of this section, uncapitalizedvariances and uncapitalized under or over-applied burdens treated as additional sec-tion 263A costs under the safe harbormethod must be allocated between pro-duction additional section 263A costs, asdescribed in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(3)(ii)(D)( 1), pre-production additional section263A costs, as described in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(3)(ii)(B)( 1), using any reasonable method. In the case of a taxpayer using themodied simplied production methodand the safe harbor method described inparagraph of this section, un-capitalized variances and uncapitalizedunder or over-applied burdens that are notexcluded from section 471 costs must beallocated between production section471 costs, as described in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(3)(ii)(D)( 3), and pre-production sec- tion 471 costs, as described in \u00a7 1.263A-2(c)(3)(ii)(B)( 2) based on the taxpayer's reallocation of such uncapitalized vari- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 971ances and uncapitalized under or over- applied burdens to or among the units ofproperty to which the costs are allocablein accordance with paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(C)and (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, as de-scribed in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of thissection. (D)Allocation of variances and under or over-applied burdens between storageand handling costs absorption ratio andpurchasing costs absorption ratio underthe simplied resale method . In the case of a taxpayer using the simplied resalemethod, any uncapitalized variances anduncapitalized under or over-applied bur-dens treated as additional section 263Acosts under the safe harbor method de-scribed in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of thissection must be allocated between storageand handling costs, as described in\u00a7 1.263A-3(d)(3)(i)(D)( 2), and current year's purchasing costs, as described in\u00a7 1.263A-3(d)(3)(i)(E)( 2), using any rea- sonable method. (E)Method of accounting . The use of the safe harbor method described in thisparagraph (d)(2)(v) is the adoption of, or achange in, a method of accounting undersection 446 of the Internal Revenue Code. (vi) Removal of section 471 costs .A taxpayer must remove those costs in-cluded in its section 471 costs that are notpermitted to be capitalized under eitherparagraph (c)(2) or (j)(2)(ii) of this sectionand those costs included in its section 471costs that are eligible for capitalizationunder paragraph (j)(2) of this section thatthe taxpayer does not elect to capitalizeunder section 263A. Except as otherwiseprovided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of thissection, a taxpayer must remove costs pur-suant to this paragraph (d)(2)(vi) by ad-justing its section 471 costs and may notremove the costs by including a negativeadjustment in its additional section 263Acosts. A taxpayer that removes costs pur-suant to this paragraph (d)(2)(vi) by ad-justing its section 471 costs must use areasonable method that approximates themanner in which the taxpayer originallycapitalized the costs to its property pro-duced or property acquired for resale in itsnancial statement. (vii) Method changes . A taxpayer us- ing the simplied production method,simplied resale method, or the modiedsimplied production method and thatchanges its nancial statement practices for a cost in a manner that would changeits section 471 costs is required to changeits method of accounting for federal in-come tax purposes. A taxpayer maychange its method of accounting for de-termining section 471 costs only with theconsent of the Commissioner as requiredunder section 446(e) and the correspond-ing regulations. (3)Additional section 263A costs \u2014(i) In general . Additional section 263A costs are the costs, other than interest, that arenot included in a taxpayer's section 471costs but that are required to be capital-ized under section 263A. Additional sec-tion 263A costs generally do not includethe direct costs that are required to beincluded in a taxpayer's section 471 costsunder paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section;however, additional 263A costsmust include any direct costs excludedfrom section 471 costs under paragraphs(d)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section. For ataxpayer using the alternative method de- scribed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this sec-tion, additional section 263A costs mustalso include any negative or positive ad-justments required to be made as a resultof differences in the book and tax amountsof the taxpayer's section 471 costs. (ii)Negative adjustments \u2014(A) eral. Except as otherwise provided by reg- ulations or other published guidance ( see \u00a7 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), a tax-payer may not include negative adjust-ments in additional section 263A costs.However, for a taxpayer using the alter-native method described in paragraph(d)(2)(iii) of this section, see paragraph(d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section for negativeor positive adjustments required to bemade as a result of differences in the bookand tax amounts of the taxpayer's section471 costs. (B)Exception for certain taxpayers re- moving costs from section 471 costs . Not- withstanding paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) and(d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, and except asotherwise provided in paragraphs(d)(3)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, thefollowing taxpayers may, but are not re-quired to, include negative adjustments inadditional section 263A costs to removethe taxpayer's section 471 costs that aredescribed in paragraph (d)(2)(vi) of thissection (costs that are not required to be,or are not permitted to be, capitalized un- der section 263A): (1) A taxpayer using the simplied production method under \u00a7 1.263A-2(b)if the taxpayer's (or its predecessor's) av-erage annual gross receipts for the threeprevious taxable years (test period) do notexceed $50,000,000, or another amountspecied in other published guidance ( \u00a7 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). The rulesof \u00a7 1.263A-3(b) apply for purposes ofdetermining the amount of a taxpayer'sgross receipts and the test period; (2) A taxpayer using the modied sim- plied production method under \u00a7 1.263A-2(c); and (3) A taxpayer using the simplied re- sale method under \u00a7 1.263A-3(d). (C)No negative adjustments for cash or trade discounts . A taxpayer may not include negative adjustments in additionalsection 263A costs for cash or trade dis-counts described in \u00a7 1.471-3(b). How-ever, see paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(C) of thissection for a de minimis rule for certain direct material costs that may be includedin additional section 263A costs and para-graph (d)(2)(v) of this section for certainvariance amounts that may be included inadditional section 263A costs. (D)No negative adjustments for cer- tain expenses . A taxpayer may not include negative adjustments in additional section263A costs for an amount which is of atype for which a deduction would be dis-allowed under section 162(c), (e), (f), or(g) and the regulations thereunder in thecase of a business expense. (E)Consistency requirement for nega- tive adjustments . A taxpayer that is per- mitted to include negative adjustments inadditional section 263A costs to removesection 471 costs under paragraph(d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section and that in-cludes negative adjustments to removesection 471 costs must use that method ofaccounting to remove all section 471 costsrequired to be removed under paragraph(d)(2)(vi) of this section. *****(5)Classication of costs . A taxpayer must classify section 471 costs, additionalsection 263A costs, and any permitted ad-justments to section 471 or additional sec-tion 263A costs, using the narrower of theclassications of costs described in para-graphs (e)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 972whether or not the taxpayer is required to maintain inventories, or the classicationsof costs used by a taxpayer in its nancialstatement. If a cost is not described inparagraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section,the cost is to be classied using the clas-sication of costs used in the taxpayer'snancial statement. (6)Financial statement . For statementlisted in paragraphs (iv)of this section that has the highest priority,including within paragraphs (d)(6)(ii) and(iv) of this section. The nancial state-ments are, in descending priority: (i) A nancial statement required to be led with the Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) (the 10-K or the An-nual Statement to Shareholders); (ii) A certied audited nancial state- ment that is accompanied by the report ofan independent certied public accountant(or in the case of a foreign entity, by thereport of a similarly qualied independentprofessional) that is used for: (A) Credit purposes;(B) Reporting to shareholders, part- ners, or similar persons; or (C) Any other substantial non-tax pur- pose; (iii) A nancial statement (other than a tax return) required to be provided to thefederal or a state government or any fed-eral or state agency (other than the SEC orthe Internal Revenue Service); or (iv) A nancial statement that is used for: (A) Credit purposes;(B) Reporting to shareholders, part- ners, or similar persons; or (C) Any other substantial non-tax pur- pose. *****( f )*** ( 1 )***I n addition, in lieu of a facts- and-circumstances allocation method, tax-payers may use the simplied methodsprovided in \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-2(b) and (c) and1.263A-3(d) to allocate direct and indirectcosts to eligible property produced or el-igible property acquired for resale; seethose sections for denitions of eligibleproperty.* * * *****( h )***(9)Separate election . A taxpayer may elect the simplied service cost method inconjunction with any other allocationmethod used at the trade or business level,including the simplied methods de-scribed in \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-2(b) and (c) and1.263A-3(d). However, the election of thesimplied service cost method must bemade independently of the election to usethose other simplied methods. *****( l )***(5)Denitions of section 471 costs and additional section 263A costs . Paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section apply fortaxable years beginning on or after No-vember 20, 2018.

Notwithstanding the requirements provided in paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section regarding revoca-tions of the historic absorption ratio dur-ing a qualifying period, a taxpayer will bepermitted to revoke the historic absorptionratio in their rst, second, or third taxableyear ending on or after November 20,2018, under such administrative proce-dures and with terms and conditions pre-scribed by the Commissioner. *****(c) Modied simplied production method -(1) Introduction . This paragraph (c) provides a simplied method for de-termining the additional section 263A costs properly allocable to ending inven-tories of property produced and other eli-gible property on hand at the end of thetaxable year. (2)Eligible property -(i) In general . Except as otherwise provided in para-graph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the modi-ed simplied production method, ifelected for any trade or business of a pro-ducer, must be used for all production andresale activities associated with any of thecategories of property to which section263A applies as described in paragraph(b)(2)(i) of this section. (ii)Election to exclude-self-constructed assets . A taxpayer using the modied sim- plied production method may elect to from applica-tion of the modied simplied productionmethod by following the same rules appli-cable to a taxpayer using the simplied pro-duction method provided in paragraph(b)(2)(ii) of this section. (3) Modied simplied production method without historic absorption ratioelection -(i)General allocation formula - (A)In general . Except as otherwise pro- vided in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this sec-tion, the additional section 263A costsallocable to eligible property remainingon hand at the close of the taxable yearunder the modied simplied production Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 973method are computed as follows: (B) Effect of allocation . The pre- production and production absorption ra-tios generally are multiplied by the pre-production and production section 471costs, respectively, remaining in endinginventory or otherwise on hand at the endof each taxable year in which the modiedsimplied production method is applied.The sum of the resulting products is theadditional section 263A costs that areadded to the taxpayer's ending section471 costs to determine the section 263Acosts that are capitalized. See, however,paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section for special rules applicable to LIFO taxpay-ers. Except as otherwise provided in thissection or in \u00a7 1.263A-1 or \u00a7 1.263A-3,additional section 263A costs that are al-located to inventories on hand at the closeof the taxable year under the modiedsimplied production method of this para-graph (c) are treated as inventory costs forall purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. (ii) Denitions -(A) Direct material costs . For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, direct material costs has thesame meaning as described in \u00a7 1.263A- 1(e)(2)(i)(A). For purposes of paragraph(c) of this section, direct material costsinclude property produced for the tax-payer under a contract with another partythat are direct material costs for the tax-payer to be used in an additional produc-tion process of the taxpayer. (B) Pre-production absorption ratio . Under the modied simplied Pre-production costs section 263A costs described in\u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(3) that are pre-productioncosts, as described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)of this section, that a taxpayer incurs dur-ing its current taxable year, includingcapitalizable mixed service costs allocableto pre-production additional section 263Acosts, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)of this section, that a taxpayer incurs dur-ing its current taxable year: (i) Plus additional section 263A costs properly allocable to property acquired forresale that a taxpayer incurs during itscurrent taxable year; and (ii) Plus additional section 263A costs properly allocable to property producedfor the taxpayer under a contract withanother party that is treated as property produced by the taxpayer, as described inparagraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, thata taxpayer incurs during its current tax-able year. (2)Pre-production section 471 costs . Pre-production section 471 as the section 471 costs described in\u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2) that are direct materialcosts that a taxpayer incurs during its cur-rent taxable year plus the section 471costs for property acquired for resale ( see \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(2)(ii)) that a taxpayer in-curs during its current taxable year, in-cluding property produced for the tax-payer under a contract with another partythat is acquired for resale. (C)Pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end . Pre- production section 471 costs remaining onhand at year end means the pre-production section 471 costs, as dened in paragraph(c)(3)(ii)(B)( 2) of this section, that a tax- payer incurs during its current taxableyear which remain in its ending inventoryor are otherwise on hand at year end,excluding the section 471 costs that aredirect material costs that have entered orcompleted production at year end (for ex-ample, direct material costs in endingwork-in-process inventory and ending n-ished goods inventory). For LIFO inven-tories of a taxpayer, see paragraph(c)(3)(iv) of this section. (D)Production absorption ratio . Un- der the modied simplied productionmethod, the production absorption isdetermined as follows: additional section 263A costs . Production additional section 263A costs are dened as the additional section263A costs described in \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(3)that are not pre-production additional sec-tion 263A costs, as dened in paragraph(c)(3)(ii)(B)( 1) of this section, that a tax- payer incurs during its current taxableyear, including capitalizable mixed ser- vice costs not allocable to section 263A costs, as de- scribed in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this sec-tion, that a taxpayer incurs during its cur-rent taxable year. For example, productionadditional section 263A costs includepost-production costs, other than post-production costs included in section 471costs, as described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)of this section.(2)Residual pre-production additional section 263A costs . Residual 263A costsare dened inparagraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)( 1) of this section, that a taxpayer incurs during its currenttaxable year less the product of the pre-production absorption ratio, as determined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 974and the pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end, as denedin paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section. (3)Production section 471 section costs described in\u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2) that a taxpayer incursduring its current taxable year less pre-production section 471 costs, as dened inparagraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)( 2) of this section, that a taxpayer incurs during its currenttaxable year. (4)Direct materials adjustment . The direct materials adjustment is dened asthe section 471 costs that are direct mate-rial costs, including property produced fora taxpayer under a contract with anotherparty that are direct material costs for thetaxpayer to be used in an additional pro-duction process of the taxpayer, that hadnot entered production at the beginning ofthe current taxable year: (i) Plus the section 471 costs that are direct material costs incurred during thecurrent taxable year (that is, direct mate- rial purchases); and (ii) Less the section 471 costs that are direct material costs that have not enteredproduction at the end of the current tax-able year. (E)Production section 471 costs re- maining on hand at year end . Production section 471 costs remaining on hand atyear end means the section 471 costs, asdened in \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2), that a tax-payer incurs during its current taxableyear which remain in its ending inventoryor are otherwise on hand at year end, lessthe pre-production section 471 costs re-maining on hand at year end, as describedin paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.For LIFO inventories of a taxpayer, seeparagraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. (F)Costs allocated to property sold . The terms dened in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)of this section do not include costs de-scribed in \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii) or costreductions allocates entirely toproperty that has been sold. (iii)Allocable mixed service costs -(A) In general . If a taxpayer using the modi- ed simplied production method deter-mines its capitalizable mixed service costsusing a method described in \u00a7 1.263A-1(g)(4), the taxpayer must use a reason-able method to allocate the costs (for ex-ample, department or activity costs) between production and pre-productionadditional section 263A costs. If the tax-payer's \u00a7 1.263A-1(g)(4) method allo-cates costs to a department or activity thatis exclusively identied as production orpre-production, those costs must be allo-cated to production or pre-production ad-ditional section 263A costs, respectively. (B)Taxpayer using the simplied ser- vice cost method . If a taxpayer using the modied simplied production methoddetermines its capitalizable mixed allo-cation formula in \u00a7 1.263A-1(h)(3)(i), al-located to and included in pre-productionadditional section 263A costs in the ab-sorption ratio described in paragraph(c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section is determinedbased on either of the following: The pro-portion of direct material costs to totalsection 471 costs that a taxpayer incurs during its current taxable year or the pro-portion of pre-production labor costs tototal labor costs that a taxpayer incursduring its current taxable year. The tax-payer must include the capitalizablemixed service costs that are not allocatedto pre-production additional section 263Acosts in production additional section263A costs in the absorption ratio de-scribed in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of thissection. A taxpayer that allocates capital-izable mixed service costs based on laborunder this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) mustexclude mixed service labor costs fromboth labor costs totallabor costs. (C)De minimis rule . Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of thissection, if 90 percent or more of a taxpay-er's capitalizable mixed service costs de-termined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) or(B) of this section are allocated to pre-production additional section 263A costsor production additional section 263Acosts, the taxpayer may elect to allocate100 percent of its capitalizable mixed ser-vice costs to that amount. For example, if90 percent of capitalizable mixed servicecosts are allocated to production additional section 263A costs based on the labor coststhat are pre-production costs in total laborcosts incurred in the taxpayer's trade orbusiness during the taxable year, then 100 percent of capitalizable mixed service costsmay be allocated to production additionalsection 263A costs. An election to allocatecapitalizable mixed service costs under thisparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) is the adoption of, ora change in, a method of accounting undersection 446 of the Internal Revenue Code. (iv)LIFO taxpayers electing the mod- ied simplied production method \u2014(A) In general . Under the modied simplied production method, a taxpayer using aLIFO method must calculate a particularyear's index (for example, under \u00a7 1.472-8(e)) without regard to its additional sec-tion 263A costs. Similarly, a taxpayer thatadjusts current-year costs by applicableindexes to determine whether there hasbeen an inventory increment or decrementin the current year for a particular LIFOpool must disregard the additional section263A costs in making that determination. (B)LIFO increment \u2014(1)In general .I f the taxpayer determines there has been aninventory increment, the taxpayer must state the amount of the increment in termsof section 471 costs in current-year dol-lars. The taxpayer then multiplies thisamount the combined absorption ratio,as dened in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)( 2)o f this section. The resulting product is theadditional section 263A costs that must beadded to the taxpayer's increment in termsof section 471 costs in current-year dollarsfor the taxable year. (2)Combined absorption ratio dened . For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)( 1) of this section, the combined absorptionratio is the additional section 263A costsallocable to eligible property remainingon hand at the close of the taxable year, asdescribed in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of thissection, determined on a non-LIFO basis,divided by the pre-production and produc-tion section 471 costs remaining on handat year end, determined on a non-LIFObasis. (C)LIFO decrement . If the taxpayer determines there has been an inventorydecrement, the taxpayer must state theamount of the decrement in dollars appli-cable to the particular year for which theLIFO layer has been invaded. The addi-tional section 263A costs incurred in prioryears that are applicable to the decrementare charged to cost of goods sold. Theadditional section 263A costs that are ap- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 975plicable to the decrement are determined by multiplying the additional section263A costs allocated to the layer of thepool in which the decrement occurred bythe ratio of the decrement, excluding ad-ditional section 263A costs, to the section471 costs in the layer of that pool. (v)De minimis rule for producers with total indirect costs of $200,000 or less . Paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, whichprovides that the additional section 263Acosts allocable to eligible property re-maining on hand at the close of the tax-able year are deemed to be zero for pro-ducers with total indirect costs of $200,000 or less, applies to the modiedsimplied production method. (vi)Examples . The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the follow-ing examples: (A) Example 1\u2014FIFO inventory method .(1) Taxpayer P uses the FIFO method of accounting forinventories valued at cost. P's beginning inventoryfor 2018 (all of which is sold during 2018) is$2,500,000, consisting of $500,000 of pre-production section 471 costs (including $400,000 ofdirect material costs and $100,000 of property ac-quired for resale), $1,500,000 of production section471 costs, and $500,000 of additional section 263Acosts. During 2018, P incurs $2,500,000 of pre-production section 471 costs (including $1,900,000 of direct material costs and $600,000 of propertyacquired for resale), $7,500,000 of costs. P's additionalsection 263A costs include capitalizable mixed ser-vice costs under the service cost method.P's pre-production and production section 471 costsremaining in ending inventory at the end of 2018 are$1,000,000 (including $800,000 of direct materialcosts and $200,000 of property acquired for resale)and $2,000,000, respectively. P computes its pre-production absorption ratio for 2018 under para-graph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, as follows: (2) Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D)( 2) of this sec- tion, P's residual pre-production additional section263A costs for 2018 are $120,000 ($200,000 ofpre-production additional section costs less$80,000 (the 8% pre-production ab-sorption ratio and the $1,000,000 of pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end)). (3) Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D)( 4) of this sec- tion, P's direct materials adjustment for 2018 is$1,500,000 ($400,000 of direct material costs inbeginning raw materials inventory, plus $1,900,000of direct material costs incurred to acquire raw ma- terials during the taxable year, less $800,000 directmaterial costs in ending raw materials inventory). (4) P computes its production absorption ratio for 2018 under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, asfollows: (5) Under the modied simplied production method, P determines the additional section 263Acosts allocable to its ending inventory under para-graph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section by multiplying thepre-production absorption ratio by the pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand atyear end and the production absorption ratio by theproduction section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end, as follows: Additional section 263A costs /H11005(8% x $1,000,000) /H11001(10.22% x /H11005$284,400 (6) adds this $284,400 to the $3,000,000 of section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end tocalculate its total ending inventory of $3,284,400.The balance of P's additional section 263A costs incurred during 2018, $715,600 ($1,000,000 less$284,400), is taken into account in 2018 as part ofP's cost of goods sold. (7) P's computation is summarized in the follow- ing table: Beginning Inventory Reference Amount Direct material costs a $400,000Property acquired for resale b 100,000Pre-production section 471 costs c /H11005a/H11001b 500,000 Production section 471 costs d 1,500,000 Additional section 263A costs e 500,000Total f/H11005c/H11001d/H11001e 2,500,000 Incurred During 2018 Direct material costs g 1,900,000Property acquired for resale h 600,000Pre-production section 471 costs i /H11005g/H11001h 2,500,000 Production section 471 j 7,500,000 Pre-production additional section 263A costs additional section 263A costs l 800,000Total m/H11005i/H11001j/H11001k/H11001l 11,000,000 December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 976Ending inventory Reference Amount Direct material costs n 800,000Property acquired for resale o 200,000Pre-production section 471 costs p /H11005n/H11001o 1,000,000 Production section 471 costs q 2,000,000 Section 471 costs r /H11005p/H11001q 3,000,000 Additional section 263A k 200,000Pre-production section 471 costs 2,500,000Pre-production absorption ratio u /H11005k/i 8.00% Pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end p 1,000,000Pre-production additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory v /H11005u*p 80,000 Production additional section 263A costs l 800,000 Residual pre-production additional section 263A costsw/H11005k- (u*p) 120,000 Production section 471 costs j 7,500,000Direct adjustment x /H11005a/H11001g-n 1,500,000 Production absorption ratioy/H11005(l/H11001w)/ (j/H11001x) 10.22% Production section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end q 2,000,000Production additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory z /H11005y*q 204,400 Summary Pre-production additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory v 80,000Production additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory z 204,400Additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory s 284,400 Section 471 costs r 3,000,000Total Ending Inventory t 3,284,400 (B)Example 2\u2014FIFO inventory method with alternative method to determine amounts of section471 costs .(1) The facts are the same as in Example 1of paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section, except that P uses the alternative method to determineamounts of section 471 costs by using its nancialstatement under \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2)(iii) rather taxamounts under 2018, P'sproduction section 471 costs exclude $40,000 of tax depreciation in excess of nancial statement depre-ciation and include $50,000 of nancial statementdirect labor in excess of tax direct labor. These areP's only differences in its book and tax amounts. (2) Under \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2)(iii)(B), the positive $40,000 depreciation adjustment and the negative$50,000 direct labor adjustment must be included inadditional section 263A costs. Accordingly, P's pro- duction additional section 263A costs are $790,000($800,000 plus $40,000 less $50,000). (3) P computes its production absorption ratio for 2018 under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, asfollows: (4) Under the modied simplied production method, P determines the additional section 263Acosts allocable to its ending inventory under para-graph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section by multiplying thepre-production absorption ratio by the pre-production section 471 costs remaining on hand atyear end and the production absorption ratio by the production section 471 costs remaining on hand atyear end, as follows:Additional costs /H11005(8.00% x x (5) adds this $282,200 to the $3,000,000 of section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end tocalculate its total ending inventory of $3,282,200.The balance of P's additional section 263A costsincurred during 2018, $717,800 ($1,000,000 less$282,200), is taken into account in 2018 as part of P's cost of goods sold. (C)Example 3\u2014LIFO inventory method .(1) The facts are the same as in Example 1 of paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section, except that P uses adollar-value LIFO inventory method rather than theFIFO method. P's 2018 LIFO increment is$1,500,000. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 977(2) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)( 1) of this sec- tion, to determine the additional section 263A costsallocable to its ending inventory, P multiplies thecombined absorption ratio by the $1,500,000 ofLIFO increment. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)( 2)o f this section, the combined absorption ratio is 9.48%($284,400 additional section 263A costs allocable toending inventory, determined on a non-LIFO basis,divided by $3,000,000 of section 471 costs on handat year end, determined on a non-LIFO basis). Thus,P's additional section 263A costs 9.48%). This $142,200 is added to to determine a total 2018 LIFO incre-ment of $1,642,200. The balance of P's additionalsection 263A costs incurred during 2018, $857,800($1,000,000 less $142,200), is taken into account in2018 as part of P's cost of goods sold. (3) In 2019, P sells one-half of the inventory in its 2018 increment. P must include in its cost ofgoods sold for 2019 the amount of additional section263A costs relating to this inventory, $71,100 (one-half of the $142,200 additional section 263A ending inventory). (D)Example 4\u2014Direct materials-based alloca- tion of mixed service costs .(1) Taxpayer R computes its capitalizable mixed service costs using the sim-plied service cost method described in \u00a7 1.263A-1(h). During 2018, R incurs $200,000 of capitaliz-able mixed service costs, computed using the generalallocation formula in \u00a7 1.263A-1(h). During incurs $8,000,000 of total section 471 costs,including $2,000,000 of direct material costs. (2) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, R determines its capitalizable mixed service costsallocable to pre-production additional section 263Acosts based on the proportion of direct material costsin total section 471 costs. R's direct material costsare 25% of total section 471 costs ($2,000,000 ofdirect material costs incurred during the year dividedby $8,000,000 of total section 471 costs incurredduring the year). Thus, R allocates $50,000 (25% x$200,000) of mixed service costs to costs. R includes the re-maining $150,000 ($200,000 less $50,000) of capi-talizable mixed production addi-tional section 263A costs. (E)Example 5\u2014Labor-based allocation of mixed service costs .(1) Taxpayer S computes its capitaliz-able mixed service costs using the simplied service cost method described in \u00a7 1.263A-1(h). During2018, S incurs $200,000 of capitalizable using the general in \u00a7 1.263A-1(h). During 2018, S also in-curs $10,000,000 of total labor costs (excluding anylabor costs included in mixed service costs), includ-ing $1,000,000 of labor costs that are pre-productioncosts as described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of thissection (excluding any labor costs included in mixedservice costs). (2) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, S determines its capitalizable mixed service costs allocable to pre-production additional section 263Acosts based on the proportion of labor costs that arepre-production costs in labor costs. S's pre-production labor costs are 10% of labor costs($1,000,000 of labor costs incurred during the yearthat are pre-production costs (excluding any laborcosts included in mixed service costs), divided by$10,000,000 of total labor costs incurred during theyear (excluding any labor costs included in mixedservice costs). Thus, S allocates $20,000 (10% x$200,000) of mixed service costs to costs. S includes the remain-ing $180,000 ($200,000 less $20,000) of capitaliz-able additionalsection 263A costs. (F)Example 6\u2014De minimis rule for allocation of mixed service costs . The facts are the same as in Example 5 in paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(E) of this section, except that S uses the de minimis rule for mixedservice costs in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this sec-tion. Because 90% or more of S's capitalizablemixed service costs are allocated to production ad-ditional section 263A costs, under the de minimisrule, S allocates all $200,000 of capitalizable mixedservice costs to production additional section 263Acosts. None of the capitalizable mixed service costsare allocated to pre-production additional section263A costs. (4) Modied simplied production method with historic absorption ratioelection \u2014(i) In general . This paragraph (c)(4) generally permits taxpayers usingthe modied simplied productionmethod to elect a historic absorption ratioin determining additional section 263A costs allocable to eligible property re-maining on hand at the close of their tax-able years. A taxpayer may only make ahistoric absorption ratio election underthis paragraph (c)(4) if it has used themodied simplied production methodfor three or more consecutive taxableyears immediately prior to the year ofelection and has capitalized additionalsection 263A costs using an actual pre-production absorption ratio, as dened inparagraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, andan actual production absorption ratio, as dened in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of thissection, or an actual combined absorption ratio, as dened in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B)( 2) of this section, for its three most recent con-secutive taxable years. This method is notavailable to a taxpayer that is deemed to havezero additional section 263A costs under para-graph (c)(3)(v) of this section. The historicabsorption ratio is used in lieu of the actualabsorption ratios computed under paragraph(c)(3)(ii) of this section or the actual combinedabsorption ratio computed under paragraph(c)(3)(iv) and is based on costs capitalized bya taxpayer during its test period. If elected, the historic absorption ratio must be used for eachtaxable year within the qualifying period de-scribed in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this sec-tion. Except as otherwise provided in this para-graph (c)(4), paragraph (b)(4) of this sectionapplies to electionunder the modied simplied productionmethod. (ii)Operating rules and . The pre-production absorp- tion is computed as follows: (1) Pre-production additional section 263A costs incurred during the test periodare dened as the pre-production addi-tional section 263A costs described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B)( 1) of this section that the taxpayer incurs during the test perioddescribed in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

(iii) LIFO taxpayers his- toric ratio election \u2014(A) Ingeneral . Instead of the pre-production and production historic absorption ratios de-ned in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this sec-tion, a LIFO taxpayer making the historicabsorption ratio election under the modi-ed simplied production method calcu-lates a combined historic absorption ratiobased on costs the taxpayer capitalizesduring its test period. (B)Combined historic absorption ra- tio. The combined historic absorption ra- tio is computed as follows: (1)Total allocable additional section 263A costs incurred during the test pe-riod. Total allocable additional section 263A costs incurred during the test periodare the sum of the total additional section263A costs allocable to eligible propertyon hand at year end as described in para-graph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, deter-mined on a non-LIFO basis, for all taxableyears in the test period. (2)Total section 471 costs remaining on hand at each year end of the test pe-riod. Total section 471 costs remaining on hand at each year end of the test period arethe sum of the total pre-production section471 costs remaining on hand at year endas described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) ofthis section and the total production sec-tion 471 costs remaining on hand at yearend as described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E)of this section, determined on a non-LIFObasis, for all taxable years in the test pe-riod.(iv)Extension of qualifying period .I n the rst taxable year following the closeof each qualifying period (for example,the sixth taxable year following the testperiod), a taxpayer must compute the ac-tual absorption ratios under paragraph(c)(3) of this section (pre-production andproduction absorption ratios or, for LIFOtaxpayers, the combined absorption ratio).If the actual combined absorption ratio orboth the actual pre-production and pro-duction absorption ratios, as applicable,computed for this taxable year (the recom-putation year) is within one-half of onepercentage point, plus or minus, of thecorresponding historic absorption ratio orratios used in determining capitalizablecosts for the qualifying period (the previ-ous ve taxable years), the qualifying pe-riod is extended to include the recompu-tation year and the following ve taxableyears, and the taxpayer must continue touse the historic absorption ratio or ratiosthroughout the extended qualifying pe-riod. If, however, the actual combined his- toric absorption ratio or either the actualpre-production absorption ratio or produc-tion absorption ratio, as applicable, is notwithin one-half of one percentage point,plus or minus, of the corresponding his-toric absorption ratio, the taxpayer mustuse the actual combined absorption ratioor ratios beginning with the recomputa-tion year and throughout the updated testperiod. The taxpayer must resume usingthe historic absorption ratio or ratiosbased on the updated test period in the third taxable year following the recompu-tation year. (v)Examples . The provisions of this paragraph (c)(4) are illustrated by the fol-lowing examples: (A) Example 1\u2014HAR and FIFO inventory method .(1) Taxpayer S uses the FIFO method of accounting for inventories valued at cost and for2021 elects to use the historic absorption ratio withthe modied simplied production method. S iden-ties the following costs incurred during the testperiod: 2018 2019 2020 Pre-production additional section 263A costs $100 $200 $300 Production additional section 263A costs 200 350 450Pre-production section 471 costs 2,000 2,500 3,000Production section 471 costs 2,500 3,500 4,000Residual pre-production additional section 263A costs 60 136 220Direct materials adjustments 2,700 3,200 3,700 (2) Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, S computes the pre-production historic absorptionratio as follows: Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 979(3) Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, S computes the production historic absorption ratioas follows: (4) In 2021, S incurs $10,000 of section costs of which $1,000 pre-production section 471costs and $2,000 inventory. Under the modied simplied pro-duction method using a historic absorption ratio, Sdetermines the pre-production additional section263A costs allocable to its ending inventory by mul-tiplying its pre-production historic absorption ratio(8.00%) by the pre-production section 471 costsremaining on hand at end ($1,000). Thus, Sallocates $80 of pre-production additional section263A costs to its ending inventory (8.00% x $1,000).S determines the production additional section 263Acosts allocable to its ending inventory by multiplyingits production historic absorption ratio (7.22%) by the production section 471 costs remaining on handat year end ($2,000). Thus, S allocates $144 ofproduction additional 263A costs to its end-ing inventory (7.22% x $2,000). (5) Under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, S's total additional section 263A costs allocable to end-ing inventory in 2021 are $224, sum allocable costs ($144). S's ending inventory in2021 is $3,224, which is the sum of S's additionalsection 263A costs allocable to ending inventory andS's section 471 costs remaining in ending inventory($224 /H11001$3,000). The balance of S's additional section 263A costs incurred during 2021 is takeninto account in 2021 as part of S's cost of goods sold. (B) Example 2\u2014HAR and LIFO inventory method .(1)(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1in paragraph (c)(4)(v)(A) of this section, except that S uses a dollar-value LIFO inventory methodrather than the FIFO method. S calculates additionalsection 263A costs incurred during the taxable yearand allocable to ending inventory under paragraph(c)(4)(iii) of this section and identies the followingcosts incurred during the test period: 2018 2019 2020 Additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year allocable to ending inventory $90 $137 $167 Section 471 costs incurred during the taxable year that remain in ending inventory 1,000 1,400 2,100 (ii) In 2021, the LIFO value of S's increment is $1,500.(2) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, S computes a combined historicabsorption ratio as follows: (3) S's additional section 263A costs to its LIFO increment beginningLIFO increment x 8.76% combined historic absorp-tion ratio). S adds the $131 to the $1,500 LIFOincrement determine incrementof $1,631. ***** ( g )***(3) Paragraph (c) of this section applies for taxable years beginning on or afterNovember 20, 2018.

Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous Update for Weighted Average Interest Rates,Yield Curves, and SegmentRates Notice 2018-86 This notice provides guidance on the corporate bond monthly yield curve, thecorresponding spot segment rates used un-der \u00a7 417(e)(3), averagesegment rates of theInternal Revenue Code. In addition, thisnotice provides guidance as to the interestrate on 30-year Treasury securities under\u00a7 417(e)(3)(A)(ii)(II) as in effect for planyears beginning before 2008 and the 30-year Treasury weighted average rate un-der \u00a7 431(c)(6)(E)(ii)(I). YIELD CURVE AND SEGMENT RATES Section 430 species the minimum funding requirements that apply to single-employer plans (except for CSEC plansunder \u00a7 414(y)) pursuant to \u00a7 412. Section430(h)(2) species the interest rates that must be used to determine a plan's targetnormal cost and funding target. Under thisprovision, present value is generally de-termined using three 24-month average interest rates (\"segment rates\"), each ofwhich applies to cash flows during speci-ed periods. To the extent provided under\u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iv), these segment ratesare adjusted by the applicable percentage of the 25-year average segment rates for theperiod ending September 30 of the yearpreceding the calendar year in which theplan year begins. 208However, an election may be made under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(D)(ii) touse the monthly yield curve in place of thesegment rates. Notice 2007-81, 2007-44 I.R.B. 899, provides guidelines for determining themonthly corporate bond yield curve, andthe 24-month average corporate bond seg-ment rates used to compute the target nor-mal cost and the funding target. Consis-tent with the methodology specied inNotice 2007-81, the monthly corporatebond yield curve derived from October2018 data is in Table 2018-10 at the endof this notice. The spot rst, second, and third segment rates for the month of Oc-tober 2018 are, respectively, 3.33, 4.39,and 4.72. through(iii) must be adjusted pursuant to \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C)(iv) to be within the applicable mini-mum and maximum percentages of the cor-responding 25-year average segment rates.For plan years beginning before 2021, theapplicable minimum percentage is 90% andthe applicable maximum percentage is110%.

Section431(c)(6)(B) species a minimum amountfor the full-funding limitation described in\u00a7 431(c)(6)(A), based on the plan's current liability. Section 431(c)(6)(E)(ii)(I) providesthat the interest rate used to calculate currentliability for this purpose must be no morethan 5 percent above and no more than 10percent below the weighted average of therates of interest on 30-year Treasury securi-ties during the four-year period ending onthe last day before the beginning of the plan year. Notice 88-73, 1988-2 C.B. 383,provides guidelines for determining theweighted average interest rate. The rate ofinterest on 30-year Treasury securities forOctober 2018 is 3.34 percent. The Servicedetermined this rate as the average of thedaily determinations of yield on the 30-year 208Pursuant the 3rdsegment rate determined under \u00a7 430(h)(2)(C) is used to determine the current liability of a CSEC plan (which is used to calculate the minimum amount of the full funding limitation under \u00a7 433(c)(7)(C)).

PURPOSE This notice contains the Required Amendments List for 2018 (2018 RAList). Section 5 of Rev. Proc. 2016-37,2016-29 I.R.B. 136, provides that, in thecase of an individually designed plan, theremedial amendment period for a disqual-ifying provision arising as a result of achange in qualication requirements gen-erally is extended to the end of the secondcalendar year that begins after the issu-ance of the Required Amendments List(RA List) in which the change in quali-cation requirements appears. There are noentries listing changes in qualication re-quirements on the 2018 RA List. II. BACKGROUND Section 401(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) provides a remedial amend-ment period during which a plan may beamended retroactively to comply with thequalication requirements under \u00a7 401(a).Section 1.401(b)-1 describes the disqual-ifying provisions that may be amendedretroactively and the remedial amendmentperiod during which retroactive amend-ments may be adopted. Those regulationsalso grant the Commissioner the discre-tion to designate certain plan provisions asdisqualifying provisions and to extend theremedial amendment period. Sections 5.05(3) and 5.06(3) of Rev. Proc. 2016-37 extend the remedialamendment period for individually de-signed plans to correct disqualifying pro-visions that arise as a result of a change inqualication requirements. Under section5.05(3), the remedial amendment periodfor a plan that is not a governmental plan(as dened in \u00a7 414(d)) is extended to theend of the second calendar year that be-gins after the issuance of the RA List onwhich the change in qualication require-ments appears. Section 5.06(3) provides aspecial rule for governmental plans that could further extend the remedial amend-ment period in some cases. Section 8.01 of Rev. Proc. 2016-37 provides that the plan amendment dead-line with respect to a disqualifying provi-sion described in section 5 of Rev. Proc.2016-37 is the date on which the remedialamendment period ends with respect tothat disqualifying provision. Section 9 of Rev. Proc. 2016-37 pro- vides that the Department of the Treasury(the Treasury Department) and the Inter-nal Revenue Service (IRS) intend to pub- lish an RA List annually. In general, achange in qualication requirements willnot appear on an RA List until guidancewith respect to that change (including, incertain cases, model amendments) hasbeen provided in regulations or in otherguidance published in the Internal Reve-nue Bulletin. However, in the discretionof the Treasury Department and the IRS, achange in qualication requirements maybe included on an RA List in other cir-cumstances, such as in cases in which astatutory change is enacted and the Trea-sury Department and the IRS anticipatethat no guidance will be issued. III. CONTENT OF RA LIST In general, an RA List includes statu- tory and administrative changes in quali-cation requirements that are rst effec-tive during the plan year in which the listis published. 209However, an RA List does not include guidance issued or legislationenacted after the list has been preparedand also does not include: Statutory changes in qualication re- quirements for which the Treasury De-partment and the IRS expect to issueguidance (which would be included onan RA List issued in a future year); Changes in qualication requirements that permit (but do not require) op-tional plan provisions (in contrast tochanges in the qualication require-ments that cause existing plan provi-sions, which may include optionalplan provisions previously adopted, tobecome disqualifying provisions); 210 or Changes in the tax laws affecting qual- ied plans that do not change the qual-ication requirements under \u00a7 401(a)(such as changes to the tax treatmentof plan distributions, or changes to thefunding requirements for qualiedplans). Annual, monthly, or other periodic changes to (1) the various dollar limitsthat are adjusted for cost of living in-creases as provided in \u00a7 415(d) or other Code provisions, (2) the spot segment ratesused to determine the applicable interest rateunder \u00a7 417(e)(3), and (3) the applicablemortality table under \u00a7 417(e)(3), are treatedas included on the RA List for the year inwhich such changes are effective eventhough they are not directly referenced onthat RA List. The Treasury Department andthe IRS anticipate that few plans have lan-guage that will need to be amended on ac-count of these changes. IV. 2018 REQUIRED AMENDMENTS LIST There are no entries listing changes in qualication requirements on the 2018RA List. V.

PURPOSE This revenue procedure provides the procedures by which a taxpayer may ob-tain the automatic consent of the Commis-sioner of Internal Revenue (Commis- 209RA Lists also may include changes in qualication requirements that were rst effective in a prior year that were not included on a prior RA List under ce rtain circumstances, such as changes in qualication requirements that were issued or enacted after the prior year's RA List was prepared. 210The remedial amendment period and plan amendment deadline for discretionary changes to the terms of a plan are governed by sections 5.05(2), 5.06(2), and 8.02 of Rev. Proc. 2016-37, and are not affected by the inclusion of a change in qualication requirements on an RA List. Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 985sioner) to change to certain methods of accounting provided in \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-1, -2,and -3 of the Income Tax Regulations forcosts allocable to certain property pro-duced or acquired for resale by the tax-payer. This revenue procedure modiesRev. Proc. 2018-31, 2018-22 I.R.B. 637. SECTION 2. BACKGROUND .01 Concurrently with the release of this revenue procedure, the Department of Trea-sury (Treasury Department) and the InternalRevenue Service (Service) are issuing nalregulations amending \u00a7\u00a7 1.263A-1, -2, and-3 (T.D. 9843) (the nal regulations). Thenal regulations are intended to reduce dis-tortions, compliance costs, burden, and ad-ministrative complexity under \u00a7 263A of theInternal Revenue Code (Code) by (1) pro-viding rules for the treatment of negativeadjustments related to certain costs requiredto be capitalized to property produced oracquired for resale; (2) providing a newsimplied method of accounting, the modi-ed simplied production method, for de-termining the additional section 263A coststhat must be capitalized to ending inventoryor other property on hand at the end of theyear; and (3) redening how certain types ofcosts are categorized for purposes of thesimplied methods for determining the ad-ditional section 263A costs that must becapitalized to ending inventory or otherproperty on hand at the end of the year. .02 Sections 1.263A-2(b), 1.263A-2(c), and 1.263A-3(d) provide the simplied simpliedproduction method, and the simplied resalemethod, respectively, which are the simpli-ed methods for determining the additionalsection 263A costs that must be capitalizedto ending inventory (or to the current-yearincrement in the case of a taxpayer using thelast-in, rst-out (LIFO) inventory method)or other property on hand at the end of theyear. Under the simplied productionmethod and the simplied resale method, ataxpayer determines the additional section263A costs (as dened in \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(3))that must be capitalized to ending inventoryor other property on hand at the end of theyear by multiplying the section 471 costs (asdened in \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2)) remaining onhand at year end (or reflected in the current-year increment in the case of a taxpayerusing the LIFO inventory method) by anabsorption ratio. In general, these absorptionratios are total additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year divided bytotal section 471 costs incurred during thetaxable year. Under the modied simpliedproduction method, a taxpayer determinesthe additional section 263A costs that mustbe capitalized to ending inventory or otherproperty on hand at the end of the year byadding the results of (1) the pre-productionsection 471 costs remaining on hand at yearend multiplied by a pre-production absorp-tion ratio, and (2) the production section 471costs remaining on hand at year end multi-plied by a production absorption ratio. .03 Sections 1.263A-2(b)(4), 1.263A- 2(c)(4), and 1.263A-3(d)(4) permit a tax-payer to or using the simpliedproduction method, the modied simpli-ed production method, or the simpliedresale method, respectively, to elect to usea historic absorption ratio in lieu of anactual absorption ratio. However, a tax-payer may make a historic absorption ra-tio election only if it has used the simpli-ed production method, the modied simplied production method, or the sim-plied resale method for each of the threepreceding taxable years. .04 Sections 1.263A-2(b)(4)(v)(B) and 1.263A-3(d)(4)(v)(B) provide transitionrules for a taxpayer that has elected to usethe simplied production method with ahistoric absorption ratio election or thesimplied resale method with a historicabsorption ratio election, respectively, torevoke its historic absorption ratio elec-tion in its rst, second, or third taxableyear ending on or after November 20,2018, under such terms and conditions asmay be prescribed by the Commissioner. .05 Except as otherwise expressly pro- vided by the Code or the regulationsthereunder, \u00a7 446(e) and \u00a7 1.446-1(e)(2)require a taxpayer to secure the consent ofthe Commissioner before changing amethod of accounting for federal incometax purposes. Section 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii)authorizes the Commissioner to prescribeadministrative procedures setting forth theterms and conditions necessary for a tax-payer to obtain consent to a change inmethod of accounting. Revenue Proce-dure 2015-13, 2015-5 Proc. 2017-59,2017-48 I.R.B. 543, provides the general procedures by which a taxpayer may ob-tain automatic consent of the Commis-sioner to a change in method of account-ing described in Rev. Proc. 2018-31. .06 Section 12.01 of Rev. Proc. 2018-31 provides automatic changes for areseller or reseller-producer, such as achange to a \"UNICAP Section 12.02 Rev. Proc. 2018-31 provides certain automatic changes for aproducer or reseller-producer, such as achange to a \"UNICAP regulations.\" Seesection of modies Rev. Proc. 2018-31 to provide addi-tional automatic method changes under\u00a7 1.263A-1, -2, and -3 to assist taxpay-ers in complying with the nal regula-tions. For example, sections 12.01 and12.02 of Rev. Proc. 2018-31 are modi-ed to expand the methods of account-ing that are included in the list of UNI-CAP methods specically described inthe regulations and to temporarily per-mit automatic changes in methods ofaccounting for certain taxpayers chang-ing from a simplied method with ahistoric absorption ratio election to adifferent simplied method without ahistoric absorption ratio election, a spe-cic identication method, a burden ratemethod, or a standard cost method. Inaddition, Rev. Proc. 2018-31 is modi-ed to add new section 12.17, whichprovides an automatic change in methodof accounting for taxpayers using a sim-plied method or changing to a simpli-ed method to recharacterize costs inaccordance with the characterization re-quirements \u00a7 1.263A-1(d)(2) and(d)(3), and a new section 12.18, whichtemporarily permits taxpayers to makean automatic change in method of ac-counting to revoke a taxpayer's historicabsorption ratio election. SECTION 3. CHANGES IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING .01In general .

PURPOSE AND NATURE OF CHANGES .01 This revenue procedure provides an updated list of time-sensitive acts, the per-formance of which may be postponed un-der sections 7508 and 7508A of the Inter-nal Revenue Code (Code). Section 7508postpones specied acts for individualsserving in the Armed Forces of the UnitedStates or serving in support of suchArmed Forces in a combat zone or servingwith respect to a contingency operation(as dened in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(a)(13)).Section 7508A permits ofthe time to perform specied acts for tax-payers affected by a federally declareddisaster or a terroristic or military action.The list of acts in this revenue proceduresupplements the list of postponed acts insection 7508(a)(1) and \u00a7 301.7508A-1(c)(1)(vii) of the Procedure and Admin-istration Regulations. Rev. Proc. 2007-56,2007-2 C.B. 388, is superseded. .02 This revenue procedure does not, by itself, provide any postponements un-der section 7508A. In order for taxpayersto be entitled to a postponement of any actlisted in this revenue procedure, the Inter-nal Revenue Service (IRS) generally willpublish a notice or issue other guidance(including an IRS News Release) provid-ing relief with respect to a federally de-clared disaster, or a terroristic or militaryaction. See section 4.01 of this revenueprocedure. .03 For purposes of section 7508, this revenue procedure sets forth a list of suchother acts that are postponed as contem-plated by section 7508(a)(1)(K). Unlikesection 7508A, when a taxpayer qualiesunder section 7508, all of the acts listed insection 7508(a)(1) are postponed. There-fore, when a taxpayer qualies under sec-tion 7508, the acts listed in this revenueprocedure are also postponed for that tax-payer, regardless of whether the IRS pub-lishes a notice or issues other guidance..04 This revenue procedure will be up- dated as needed if the IRS determines thatadditional acts should be included in thelist of postponed acts or that certain actsshould be removed from the list. Also,taxpayers may recommend that additionalacts be considered for postponement un-der sections 7508 and 7508A. See section18 of this revenue procedure. .05 When a federally declared disaster occurs, IRS guidance usually postponesthe time to perform the acts listed in\u00a7 301.7508A-1(c)(1) as well as in thisrevenue procedure. However, because theacts listed in the regulations under thedisaster relief provision are only post-poned when disaster relief is provided, when an individual qualies for relief byvirtue of service in a combat zone, thetime for performing the acts listed in theregulations is not postponed. Thus, to en-sure that individuals serving in or servingin support of the Armed Forces in a com-bat zone or contingency operation receivea postponement of time to perform theacts listed in the regulations, this revenueprocedure includes these acts. SECTION 2. BACKGROUND .01 Section 7508(a)(1) of the Code per- mits a postponement of certain time-sensitive acts for individuals serving inthe Armed Forces of the United States, orserving in support of such Armed Forces,in an area designated by the President as acombat zone under section 112(c)(2), or serving with respect to a contingencyoperation (as dened in 10 U.S.C.\u00a7 101(a)(13)). Among these acts are theling of certain returns, the payment ofcertain taxes, the ling of a UnitedStates Tax Court petition for redetermi-nation of a deciency, and the ling of arefund claim. In the event of service in acombat zone or service with respect toa contingency operation, the acts speci-ed in section 7508(a)(1) are automati-cally postponed. This revenue proceduresets forth a list of such other acts that arealso automatically postponed as contem-plated by section 7508(a)(1)(K). In ad-dition, the IRS may include acts notlisted in this revenue procedure in anyother published guidance (including anIRS News Release) related to the com-bat zone or contingency operation. December 10, 2018 Bulletin No. 2018-50 990.02 Section 7508A provides that cer- tain acts performed by taxpayers and thegovernment may be postponed if the tax-payer is affected by a federally declareddisaster or a terroristic or military action.Prior to 2008, section 7508A(a) referredto a \"Presidentially declared disaster,\" de-ned in section 1033(h)(3). The Tax Ex-tenders and Alternative Minimum TaxRelief Act of 2008 (2008 Act), P.L. 110-343, Division C, \u00a7 706(a)(2)(D)(vii),amended 165(h)(3)(C)(i). Section 706(a)(1)of the 2008 provide the denition of a \"federallydeclared disaster.\" Effective December19, 2014, the Tax Technical CorrectionsAct of (2014 Act), P.L. 113-295,\u00a7 221(a)(27), of\"federally declared tion 165(h)(3) and placed it in section165(i)(5). However, the 2014 Act didnot amend section 7508A(a) with cross-reference for the denition \"federally declared 401(b)(10) amended a \"federally de-clared disaster\" in section 165(i)(5)(A).However, the regulations under section7508A have yet to be revised to changethe reference to the denition of a fed-erally declared disaster. \"terroristic ormilitary action\" is dened in section692(c)(2). Section 301.7508A-1(d)(1)denes seven types of affected taxpay-ers, including any individual whoseprincipal residence (for purposes of sec-tion 1033(h)(4)) is located in a \"covereddisaster area\" and any business entity orsole proprietor whose principal place ofbusiness is located in a \"covered disas-ter area.\" Postponements under section7508A are not available simply becausea disaster or a terroristic or military ac-tion has occurred. Generally, the IRSwill publish a notice or issue other guid-ance (including an IRS News Release)authorizing the postponement. See sec-tion 4.01 of this revenue procedure. SECTION 3. SCOPE This revenue procedure applies to in- dividuals serving in the Armed Forces ofthe United States in a combat zone, or serving in support of such Armed Forces,individuals serving with respect to contin-gency operations, affected taxpayers byreason of federally declared disasterswithin the meaning of \u00a7 301.7508A-1(d)(1), or taxpayers whom the IRS deter-mines are affected by a terroristic or mil-itary action. Section 17 of this revenueprocedure also applies to transferors whoare not affected taxpayers but who areinvolved in a section 1031 like-kind ex-change transaction and are entitled to re-lief under section 17.02(2) of this revenueprocedure. SECTION 4. APPLICATION .01 As provided by \u00a7 301.7508A-1(e), in the event of a federally declared disas-ter or terroristic or military action, the IRSwill issue a news release, or other guid-ance, authorizing the postponement ofacts described in this revenue procedure,that denes which taxpayers are consid-ered \"affected taxpayers,\" and describes the acts postponed, the duration of thepostponement, and the location of thecovered disaster area. See, for example,IR-2018-199 (summarizing the reliefprovided for Hurricane Michael). Theguidance may provide for postponementof only certain acts listed in this revenueprocedure based on the time when thedisaster occurred, its severity, and otherfactors. Unless the notice or other guid-ance for a particular disaster providesthat the relief is limited, the guidancewill generally postpone allof the acts listed in the regulations and this revenueprocedure. .02 Provisions of the internal revenue laws requiring the timely performance ofspecied acts postponed under sections7508 and 7508A are listed in the tablesbelow. In addition, section 17 of this rev-enue procedure expands the categories oftaxpayers qualifying for relief to includetransferors of certain property and pro-vides additional postponements of dead-lines solely with respect to section 1031like-kind exchange transactions that areaffected by a federally declared disaster. Ifan IRS News Release or other guidance isissued with respect to a specic federallydeclared disaster and authorizes postpone-ment of acts in this revenue procedure,affected taxpayers may use the postpone-ment rules provided in section 17 of this revenue procedure in lieu of section 6 ofthis revenue procedure. Transferors whoare covered by the like-kind exchangerules of section 17 of this revenue proce-dure, but who are not \"affected taxpayers\"as dened by the IRS News Release, otherguidance, or 301.7508A-1(d)(1) are noteligible for relief under section 7508A orother sections of this revenue procedure. .03 The following tables may, but do not necessarily include, acts specied insections 7508 or 7508A and the regula-tions thereunder. Thus, for example, nomention is made in the following tables ofthe ling of tax returns or the payment oftaxes (or an installment thereof) becausethese acts are already covered by sections7508 and 7508A and the applicable regu-lations. Also, the following tables gener-ally do not refer to making elections re-quired to be made on tax returns orattachments thereto, or the ling of anyform required to be attached to the return,because postponement of the ling of a tax return automatically postpones thetime for making any election required tobe made on the return or an attachmentthereto, or the ling of any form requiredto be attached to the return. For example,the Form 5471, \"Information Return ofU.S. Persons With Respect to Certain For-eign Corporations\" is required to be at-tached to the taxpayer's tax return (or, ifapplicable, partnership or exempt organi-zation return). Accordingly, the Form5471 is not included in this revenue pro-cedure because the postponement of theling of the tax return (or other return)automatically postpones the time to leForm 5471. In addition, these tables gen-erally do not refer to the ling of infor-mation returns or furnishing of statements.However, postponed acts relating to infor-mation reporting (other than year-enddeadlines) are set forth in section 14.02 ofthis revenue procedure. This revenue procedure, however, does include acts that are postponed under\u00a7 301.7508A-1(c)(1). The regulation listsacts that may be postponed when there hasbeen a federally declared disaster, butdoes not apply to postpone acts for indi-viduals serving in, or serving in sup port of, the Armed Forces of the UnitedStates in a combat zone or contingencyoperation. For example, \u00a7 301.7508A- Bulletin No. 2018-50 December 10, 2018 9911(c)(1)(iii) provides a postponement for certain contributions to and distributionsfrom qualied retirement plans. Thisrevenue procedure also includes theseacts to reflect that they are postponed forindividuals serving in, or serving in sup-port of, the Armed Forces of the UnitedStates in a combat zone or contingencyoperation..04 The following tables refer only to postponement of acts performed by tax-payers. Additional guidance will be pub-lished in the Internal Revenue Bulletin if adecision is made that acts performed bythe government may be postponed undersection 7508A. See, for example, Notice2005-82, 2005-47 I.R.B. 978. Additionalguidance will also be published if a deci-sion is made to provide some form of relief in connection with a federally de-clared disaster other than a postponementof acts.

PURPOSE This revenue procedure provides a safe harbor that allows taxpayers to treat certain infrastructure trades or businesses asreal property trades or businesses solelyfor purposes of qualifying as an electingreal property trade or business undersection 163(j)(7)(B) of the Internal Rev-enue Code. SECTION 2. BACKGROUND .01 On December 22, 2017, section 163(j) was amended by the Tax Cuts andJobs Act, Pub. L. 115-97 (TCJA). Section163(j), as amended by the TCJA, providesnew rules limiting the amount of businessinterest expense that can be deducted fortaxable years beginning after December31, 2017. SeeTCJA \u00a7 13301(a). .02 Under section 163(j)(1), the amount allowed as a deduction for business interestexpense is limited to the sum of: (1) thetaxpayer's business interest income (as de-ned in section 163(j)(6)) for the taxable year; (2) 30 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted tax-able income (as dened in section 163(j)(8))for such taxable year; and (3) the taxpayer'sfloor plan nancing interest (as dened in sec-tion 163(j)(9)) for such taxable year. .03 The limitation under section 163(j) on the deductibility of business interestexpense applies to all taxpayers with busi-ness interest (as dened in section163(j)(5)), except for certain taxpayers(other than tax shelters under section448(a)(3)) that meet the gross receipts testin section 448(c). .04 Section 163(j)(5) generally pro- vides that the term \"business interest\"means any interest properly allocable to atrade or business. Section 163(j)(7)(A)(ii)provides that, for purposes of the limita- tion on the deduction for business interest,the term \"trade or business\" does not in-clude an \"electing real property trade orbusiness.\" Thus, for purposes of section163(j), interest expense that is properlyallocable to an electing real property tradeor business is not properly allocable to atrade or business, and is not business in-terest expense that is subject to section163(j)(1). .05 The term \"electing real property trade or business\" under section 163(j)(7)(B) means any trade or business that isdescribed in section 469(c)(7)(C) that makesan election to be an electing real propertytrade or business. .06 Section 168(g)(1)(F) provides that an electing real property trade or business(within the meaning of section 163(j)(7)(B))must use the alternative depreciation systemfor property described in section 168(g)(8).Seesection 163(j)(10)(A). .07 Section 469(c)(7)(C) denes a real property trade or business as any real prop- erty development, redevelopment, construc-tion, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion,rental, operation, management, leasing, orbrokerage trade or business. .08 The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the InternalRevenue Service (IRS) are aware thatthere may be uncertainty as to whethercertain infrastructure arrangements be-tween private persons and governmentalentities under which private persons main-tain or provide other services with respectto core infrastructure property such asroads, bridges, or other similar propertyare included in the denition of a realproperty trade or business under section469(c)(7)(C). .09 In light of the concerns relating to certain infrastructure arrangements in thecontext of section 163(j), this revenue pro-cedure provides a safe harbor that allowstaxpayers to treat certain trades or busi-nesses that are conducted in connectionwith the designing, building, managing,operating, or maintaining of certain coreinfrastructure projects as real propertytrades or businesses for purposes of qual-ifying as an electing real property trade orbusiness under section 163(j)(7)(B) (infra-structure safe harbor). .10 The infrastructure safe harbor in this revenue procedure is based on the proposedeligibility parameters for public infrastruc- ture projects for purposes of the private ac-tivity bond nancing proposals described inthe \"Legislative Outline for Rebuilding In-frastructure in America,\" which the WhiteHouse released publicly and transmitted on February 12, 2018.

Thus, ifan earlier ruling held that a principle ap-plied to A, and the new ruling holds thatthe same principle also applies to B, theearlier ruling is amplied. (Compare withmodied , below). Claried is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling isbeing made clear because the languagehas caused, or may cause, some confu-sion. It is not used where a position in aprior ruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously pub-lished ruling and points out an essentialdifference between them. Modied is used where the substance of a previously published position is beingchanged. Thus, if a prior ruling held that aprinciple applied to A but not to B, and thenew ruling holds that it applies to both Aand B, the prior ruling is modied because it corrects a published position. (Comparewith amplied andclaried , above). Obsoleted describes a previously pub- lished ruling that is not considered deter-minative with respect to future transac-tions. This term is most commonly used ina ruling that lists previously published rul-ings that are obsoleted because of changesin laws or regulations. A ruling may alsobe obsoleted because the substance hasbeen included in regulations subsequentlyadopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published rulingis not correct and the correct position isbeing stated in a new ruling. Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more thanrestate the substance and situation of apreviously published ruling (or rulings).Thus, the term is used to republish underthe 1986 Code and regulations the sameposition published under the 1939 Codeand regulations. The term is also usedwhen it is desired to republish in a singleruling a series of situations, names, etc.,that were previously published over a pe-riod of time in separate rulings. If the newruling does more than restate the sub-stance of a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modied and superseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published rulingis being changed in part and is continuedwithout change in part and it is desired torestate the valid portion of the previouslypublished ruling in a new ruling that isself contained. In this case, the previouslypublished ruling is rst modied and then,as modied, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names ofcountries, is published in a ruling and thatlist is expanded by adding further namesin subsequent rulings. After the originalruling has been supplemented severaltimes, a new ruling may be published thatincludes the list in the original ruling andthe additions, and supersedes all prior rul-ings in the series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulingswill not be applied pending some futureaction such as the issuance of new oramended regulations, the outcome ofcases in litigation, or the outcome of aService study.
