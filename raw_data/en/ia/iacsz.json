They are consciously crafted using the best natural ingredients from the US and around the world. Since 1979, Earth Animal has been helping dogs and cats live long, healthy lives through a holistic approach. Founded by veterinarian, Bob Goldstein and his wife, Susan, Earth Animal is pioneering a more human and sustainable way. Proprietary Wellness Blends Medicinal herbs with naturally occurring beneficial properties are included in each Natural Remedies formula. These medicinal herbs help by supporting the immune system. Remedies and Supplements Since 2002, Dr. Bob Goldstein has worked with master herbalist Kristy Haley of Crystal Garden Herbs in Bethel, VT to capture the ancient medicinal power of wild crafted herbs to support true holistic wellness. After selecting the most beneficial herbs and mixing them with flower essences, the blends soak for over 30 days. They are then extracted and poured into a light sensitive tincture, crafting a remedy that addresses conditions dogs and cats suffer from day to day. Earth Animal believes that what goes around, comes around. That is why they dedicate 1% of their annual net sales to industry stewardship, mission-driven efforts and organizations focused on the environment. Their goal is to go beyond sustainability and support efforts that preserve and enhance the quality of life for animals, people and the Earth. I have 'outdoor' cats (they are actually feral, but fed by me and spayed), one of whom it seems can never fully get over symptoms caused by worms/parasites. This has made it so I can keep her medicated - without making her sick from too much - and symptom free. I highly recommend it for pets who you suspect may have issues with worms or parasites. At least as a possible step before a vet visit. There is no way I would get either one to come with me, much less get her to the vet. Our 6 month old rat terrier puppy takes this wormer quite easily and when we mix it with one egg she eats it all up! Babe is her name and she is an outside farm dog and curious about every inch of this farm, including dead rodents and the ones she kills (mostly rabbits). So far 'Babe' has been on this liquid wormer (all natural, no synthetics) for over 2 weeks, we plan to lower her dosage to once a day now and continue throughout the summer and fall and into the winter, we know this wormer is safe and it works. Thunder did not seem to mind this med. She is doing well now. "}
