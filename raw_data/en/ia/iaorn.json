INTRODUCTION Introduction to the Manual Department of Public Health Policy and Procedure Approval Georgia Immunization Office Central Staff Immunization Office Consultants District Immunization Coordinators Request for Immunization Forms -- Form 3184 Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health Introduction To Manual 12/2017 1 The Georgia Immunization Manual is intended to prov ide District and County personnel with up-to-date information and guidance. The Georgia I mmunization Program Manual is based primarily on the Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The ACIP Recommendations are located at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.htm l . The Georgia Immunization Program Manual and ACIP recommendation s should be utilized together as the basis for formulating policies and procedures for adminis tering vaccines and providing immunization services. The Department of Public Health also rec ognizes the Red Book (Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases) of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Another important reference is the package insert supplied by the manufacturer of the vaccine. This manual and the ACIP recommendations represent official state policies and standards, and the recommended policies and procedures for adm inistering vaccines, providing immunization services, and documenting and evaluating quality as surance. In addition, the Georgia Immunization Program Manual and ACIP Recommendations serve as an annex to the Standard Operations Procedures (SOP) of the Department of Public Health (DPH), and Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). Districts should utilize the Georgia Immuni zation Program Manual and the ACIP recommendations as the district's written Policies and Procedures f or Administering Vaccines by Registered and Licensed Practical Nurses. Each dis trict is responsible for having written policies an d procedures for the administration of travel vaccine s that have been reviewed and signed annually by the health director or their designee if applicable . In addition, districts may utilize the Quality Assurance (QA) document included in this manual as a tool to document and evaluate the credentialing, policies, training, administration o f vaccine and provision of immunization services. I f a district chooses to utilize their own QA instrument , it should include all elements in the QA document in this manual. Constructive criticism, questions a nd notification of apparent error will be welcomed, but deviation from state policy should not be under taken lightly. Statements made in this manual take precedence over contradictory policy statements or memos that predate the manual pages. Occasionally, due to ongoing research and evaluatio n, ACIP recommendations may differ from the manufacturer's package insert or the infor mation in the Red Book, which is published every three years. When this occurs, the State Immunizat ion Program utilizes the most current ACIP recommendations. Frequently, the ACIP publishes provisional guidelin es prior to receiving final approval from the Director of the CDC and the Secretary of the Depart ment of Health and Human Services (HHS). To facilitate the administration of newly licensed vac cines, the Georgia Immunization Program will utiliz e these provisional recommendations when necessary in developing guidelines. From time to time, children present at DPH clinics with requests or orders from private physicians to administer vaccines under unusual cir cumstances. When the request clearly falls outside the ACIP Recommendations, such as using red uced dosage schedules, it simply should not be honored. When a child has a history or condition which calls for careful judgment as to whether it might be a contraindication and the physician assur es that vaccine may be given safely, the District Health Director must make a decision whether to imm unize or refer the child back to the physician. Each subject in the manual is dated. When changes are made, appropriately indexed pages will be made available on the program website to re place outdated material. Transmittal letters should be logged and filed in the Memo section in t he manual. When recommendation changes occur between the annual manual updates, health dis tricts will be notified by memos from the State Immunization Program. The Immunization Program Manu al will be updated at least annually to include the recommended changes. Health districts are responsible for developing and implementing INTRODUCTION TO THE MANUAL Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health Introduction To Manual 12/2017 2 a plan to ensure that all memos and manual revision s are distributed, discussed, and implemented within a month of receipt with all appropriate clin ics and staff. When questions arise that are not covered adequately anywhere in the manual, the Immu nization Program personnel are eager to field them and provide or obtain clarification. A staff person is available for on-call questions Monday through Friday, from 8:00 A.M. until 5:00 P.M. The Immunization Program telephone numbers may be found in Section 1 of this manual.

Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 11/2017 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 1 A. Standards for Administration The Georgia Immunization Program recommends that all DPH clinics follow the current Recommended Childhood Immunization Schedule that is developed and published annually by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). A copy of the most current schedule, including the footnotes, is inserted in this section of the manual. Additional charts and tables are included to provide assistance in further defining and clarifying the recommended schedule. Also included is a recommended infant/child screening questionnaire to assist providers in identifying possible contraindications and precautions for administering vaccines. The Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule and a Screening Questionnaire for Adults are also included in this section. The charts and tables are meant to serve as standards and provide quick references for individuals assessing immunization records and administering vaccines. Detailed information regarding vaccines and vaccine administration policies should be obtained from the most current ACIP Recommendations. These recommendations may be accessed from CDC's web site (see Immunization Resources in Section 13, Attachment A of this manual). It is imperative that all those who administer vaccines follow the standards put forth in the General Recommendations on Immunization ACIP statement1, the Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (the \"Pink Book\"),2 as well as those found in this manual in Chapter 13, Quality Assurance. The following principles are merely a summary of these recommendations and are not meant to be all-inclusive: 1. Ascertain the client's need for the recommended immunizations to avoid drawing up vaccine that will not be used. 2. Select correct needle size for vaccine, route, and size of client. 3. Double-check the vial label and expiration date before AND after drawing up vaccine. 4. If preparing multiple vaccinations, label each syringe or use labeled tray in order to correctly identify vaccines before administration. 5. Use aseptic technique throughout vaccine preparation, administration, and disposal of syringes and other materials. 6. Avoid prefilling syringes because of the risk for administration errors. Other problems that could be associated with this practice are vaccine wastage and possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not contain a preservative. In addition, syringes other than those that are prefilled by the manufacturer are designed for immediate administration, not for vaccine storage. 7. If it is necessary to reconstitute more than one vaccine dose, as for a large influenza clinic, only prefill a FEW syringes at a time, which you can administer while someone else is prefilling a few syringes they will administer. Any syringes left at the end of the clinic day should be discarded . 8. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should MMR, MMRV, Zoster or varicella vaccine ever be reconstituted and drawn prior to the immediate need for the vaccines. These live virus vaccines are unstable and begin to deteriorate as soon as they are reconstituted with diluent. Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 11/2017 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 2 9. All providers who administer vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope (fainting) after vaccination and take appropriate measures to prevent it. Thus, clinicians should (1) make sure that people who are being vaccinated are always seated; (2) be aware of symptoms that precede fainting (weakness, dizziness, pallor, etc.); and (3) take appropriate measures to prevent injuries if such symptoms occur.3 Vaccine providers should strongly consider observing vaccinated people for 15 minutes after vaccination.4 This is particularly important when vaccinating adolescents and young adults. 10. When children present at DPH clinics with requests or orders from private physicians to administer vaccines under unusual circumstances and the request clearly falls outside the ACIP Recommendations it simply should not be honored. When a child has a history or condition which calls for careful judgment as to whether it might be a contraindication and the physician assures that vaccine may be given safely, the District Health Director must decide whether to immunize or refer the child back to the physician. B. Guidelines for Eligibility for VFC and State-Supplied Vaccines Eligibility criteria are outlined in each of the Immunization Program Vaccine Guidelines in this section. In addition, the table following this document outli nes the eligibility criteria for vaccines provided by the Vaccines for Children Office (VFC) and by the Georgia Immunization Program. All clinics are responsible for screening and docume nting a person's eligibility for receiving state supplied vaccines. For the purposes of these documents, a child is defined as a person from 0 through 18 years of age. An adult is anyone 19 years of age or older. The following mandates should be utilized when conducting eligibility screening for either group: I. Eligibility Criteria for Children A. All children 0 through 18 years of age should be screened to determine VFC eligibility using the following terms and definitions: 1. Medicaid---is eligible for Medicaid services. 2. American Indian/Alaska Native---self-reported by the patient. 3. Uninsured children---have no health insurance. 4. Underinsured children---have insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit.5 Example: An insurance company may not cover certain vaccines, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The child will qualify for VFC for that particular vaccine only. Example: An insurance company may cover immunizations up to a certain age. Up to that age, the child is fully insured. After that age, the child is considered underinsured (has insurance but vaccines are not a covered benefit). Example: An insurance company may only provide $100.00 per year to cover the costs of immunizations. The child is fully insured up to $100.00. Once this amount is exhausted, the child is then eligible to receive VFC vaccine. 5. PeachCare for Kids---has a current PeachCare for Kids card at the time of service.5 B. Any child who has insurance coverage for immunizations is not eligible to receive state-supplied vaccines. This is the case even when the insured has a high deductible --- the child is considered fully insured. These children should be: 1. referred to their private provider; or 2. administered vaccine purchased by the district. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Guidelines - 11/2017 Immunization Standards For DPH Clinics 3II. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by VFC for minors presenting for services without proof of insurance. Please use the following guidance: A. Unaccompanied minors through the age of 18 who are being seen in a public health STD or Family Planning clinic, and who present without proof of insurance, may be immunized using VFC vaccine. 1. Hep A, Hep B, and HPV are the only vaccines that may be administered to someone under the age of 18 based on their own consent. 2. Be aware that you may come across an 18-year-old patient who is still covered by their parent's insurance, but is unable to access it. Because the patient is 18 she or he may legally consent for additional vaccines, all of which should be included on the Title X form. B. To document eligibility screening, records should reflect 'Uninsured' for this population. C. Complete Title X log sheet for any minor receiving vaccine in this category. III. Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults (Refer to table on following pages.) C. Standards for Documentation All public health clinics should be utilizing the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS) for reviewing and documenting the immunization status of all clients. Public health clinics should have the technological capability and staff trained to ensure that, regardless of the individual software system used, immunizations administered will be entered into the GRITS system within 2 business days. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , December 1, 2006, Vol. 55, RR-15, pg. 13. 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The intent of these tables: IS NOT to determine which children, adolescents and/or adults should be immunized, but IS to define which groups can be immunized with federally funded VFC, federally funded Section 317, or CHIP purchas ed vaccines . For specific vaccine guidelines refer to Section 2, Recommended Schedules and Guidelines, of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. The vaccine must be provided at no cost to the patient . Vaccine administration fees for self -pay clients are capped at $ 21.93 per injection for both non-Medicaid VFC and Section 317 funded vaccine. No client should be refused vaccination with VFC, Section 317 , or CHIP vaccine due to inability to pay the administration fee.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 1 Georgia Department of Public Health Immunization Program Vaccine Standards COMBINATION VACCINES The purpose of these standards is to provide public health clinics with a summary of the current Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for each of the vaccines supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program. These standards were developed from the pertinent Vaccine Resolutions from the Vaccines for Children Program and the references below and will be updated as needed. These standards should serve as a quick reference for clinics administering currently available combination vaccines which include: (A) TwinRix\u00ae (Hepatitis A Inactivated [Havrix\u00ae] & Vaccine B\u00ae \u00ae (Diphtheria Recombinant] and combined) (F) MenHibrix\u00ae (Meningococcal groups C and Y and Haemophilus b tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine . The standards are not all inclusive and when more information is needed, the following publications should be referenced: \"Notice to readers: Licensure No. RR-46 \"Notice to Readers: FDA Licensure of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Absorbed, Hepatitis B (Recombinant), and Poliovirus Vaccine Combined, (PEDIARIX) for Use in Infants,\" MMWR , March 14, 2003, Vol. 52, No. RR-10 \"Notice to Readers: Updated Recommendations for Use of Haemophilus influenzae Type b (Hib) Vaccine: Reinstatement of the Booster Dose at Ages 12-15 Months\", MMWR , June 26, 2009, Vol. 58, No. RR-24 The VFC Resolution \"Vaccines to Prevent Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis,\" Resolution No. 10/12.1 \"License of a Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and acellular Pertussis Absorbed Inactivated Poliovirus vaccine and Guidance for use as a Booster Dose,\" MMWR, October 3, 2008, Vol. 57, No. RR-39 The 2015 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases published by the American Academy of Pediatrics Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, 13th ed, 2015 \"General Recommendations on Immunization: Recommendations of the ACIP\", MMWR, January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, No. RR-2 \"Use of Combination Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Vaccine Recommendations of the ACIP\", MMWR, May 7, 2010, Vol. 59, No. RR-3 2015 Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases published by the American Academy of Pediatrics \"Infant Meningococcal vaccination: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommendations and Rationale', MMWR, January 25, 2013, Vol.62, No. RR-3 Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 2 General Standards for the Use of Combination Vaccines1 To minimize the number of injections children receive, parenteral combination vaccines should be used, if licensed and indicated for the patient's age, instead of their equivalent component vaccines. Recommended intervals and ages for single antigen vaccines, when used in combination series, should be observed. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines, in either monovalent or combination formulations from the same or different manufacturers, are interchangeable for sequential doses in the vaccination series. Using the same acellular pertussis vaccine product from the same manufacturer is preferable for at least the first three doses. However, if the brand is not known, ACIP recommends to vaccinate the child using the DTaP vaccine that is available. When patients have already received the recommended vaccinations for some of the components in a combination vaccine, administering the extra antigen(s) in the combination is often permissible if doing so will reduce the number of injections required and if the other components are not contraindicated. To avoid recording errors and ambiguities in the names of vaccine combinations, extra care should be taken to record exactly what was given. 1 General Recommendations on Immunization, MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, No. RR-2 A. TWINRIX\u00ae Vaccine Description TwinRix\u00ae is a bivalent inactive vaccine containing the antigenic components used in producing Havrix\u00ae (Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated) and Engerix-B\u00ae [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)]. A 1 mL dose contains 720 ELISA Units (ELU) of inactivated hepatitis A virus (pediatric dose of Havrix\u00ae) and 20 mcg. of recombinant HBsAg protein (adult dose of Engerix-B\u00ae). The advantage of using this vaccine over single antigen vaccines is that it reduces the number of shots. The time to complete the series is the same. TwinRix Junior\u00ae is licensed in other countries but not in the United States and consists of 360 ELU hepatitis A antigen and 10 mcg. of hepatitis B antigen usually given in a 3 dose series at 0,1, and 6 months for children <18 years of age.

It contains Infanrix\u00ae, Engerix-B\u00ae, and the same strains and quantity of inactivated poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3 as IPV from a different manufacturer (IPOL\u00ae, Sanofi Pasteur). Brand Names & Manufacturer Vaccine Manufacturer Pediarix\u00ae GlaxoSmithKline Eligible Groups for State Supplied Vaccine For Adults, Children, and Adolescents, see \"Eligibility for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults\" located in the front of this section. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 6 Recommended Vaccine Schedule1 Pediarix\u00ae is recommended for the primary series of DTaP, hepatitis B, and IPV vaccination (Doses 1-3). It should not be given before 6 weeks of age or after the child turns 7 years old. This vaccine is not approved for booster doses. To complete the DTaP and IPV series, use those individual vaccines. Pediarix\u00ae is not approved for hepatitis B vaccine doses given at birth or at 1 month of age. Consequently, for those infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is positive or unknown and who should therefore receive the first 2 doses of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and age 1 month, this vaccine would be inappropriate. It may be used for the 3rd dose of hepatitis B if given at the recommended 6 months of age. Dose 1 Dose 22 Dose 3 Booster 2 months of age 4 months of age 6 months of age Not approved for booster doses 1 This reflects the routinely recommended schedule. However, the vaccine may be administered as a primary series (Doses 1, 2, and 3) at any time between 6 weeks and 7 years of age. Conditional Pediarix Vaccine Schedule for Infants This conditional Pediarix schedule only validates the Pediarix dose given as the 3rd dose in the series at age 4 months. This allows the series to be completed in 4 doses starting with a routine single antigen hepatitis B vaccine birth dose and the 2nd and 4th dose being any Hepatitis B antigen containing vaccine. This Pediarix hepatitis B series is considered acceptable as long as the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given at or after age 6 months. The Hepatitis B series algorithm highlights are listed below. Dose 1* Dose 2 Dose 3 Dose 4 Birth dose 2 months of age 4 months of age 6 months of age Highlights: Doses given at 0*, 2M, 4M, 6M Dose 3 given at age 4M must be Pediarix and the trade name must be entered to be valid Dose 4 given on or after age 6M will be valid if there is at least a 28 day interval from Dose 3; 56 day interval from Dose 2; and 112 day interval from Dose 1. *This special series is conditional on the use of Pediarix after that routine birth dose Minimum Age and Dose Intervals1 Dose Minimum Age Time Interval to Dose 2 Time Interval to Dose 32 1 6 weeks 4 weeks3 8-12 weeks3 1 If the Pediarix\u00ae series is not completed until after age 4, the IPV series would be considered to be complete. However, an additional dose of DTaP would still be needed. 2Though Pediarix\u00ae cannot be used for a 4th or 5th booster dose, the intervals to the 4th or booster Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 7 doses of any of the component vaccines (DTaP, hepatitis B, and IPV) should reflect the minimum interval for each of those vaccines. (Refer to individual Vaccine Guidelines for DTaP, hepatitis B, and IPV found in this sec tion.) Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered intramuscularly NOTE: Do not give in gluteal area. Use only deltoid or vastus lateralis (antero-lateral aspect of thigh). Contraindications and Precautions A. Contraindications Anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of vaccine or to a dose of any of the component vaccines, or to a vaccine component including yeast, neomycin, and polymyxin B. (See \"Contraindications and Precautions\" section for each component vaccine under that Vaccine Guideline found in this section.) Administration at age less than 6 weeks or 7 years and older Encephalopathy within 7 days of administration of a previous dose of DTP or DTaP Progressive neurologic disorder. Defer DTaP until neurologic status is clarified and stabilized. Do not give for birth dose or at age 1 month for any infant. Infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive or whose status is unknown should receive single antigen hepatitis B vaccine for the birth dose and for Dose 1 when it is given at 1 month of age. A. Precautions: Fever of 105\u00b0 F ( 40.5\u00b0 C.) 48 hours after vaccination with a previous dose of DTP or DTaP, or a combination vaccine that contains DTP or DTaP Collapse or shock like state in same circumstances as #1 Seizure occurring 3 days after receiving a previous dose of DTP or DTaP or combination vaccine that contains DTP or DTaP Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours and occurring 48 hours after vaccine containing DTP or DTaP Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever Guillain-Barre' syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks after a previous dose of tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely.

Pro-Quad\u00ae Vaccine Description ProQuad\u00ae (MMRV) is live virus vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. In September, 2005 it was licensed by the FDA for use in children ages 12 months through 12 years. It is a lyophilized preparation of the components of M-M-R II\u00ae (measles, mumps and rubella Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 13 combination vaccine); and Varicella (Oka/Merck) Virus Vaccine Live. This vaccine contains no preservative and comes packaged as single dose vials with separate vials of sterile water diluent. Special storage and handling guidelines include: o MMRV must be transported and stored at temperatures of 50 F. or colder. o It cannot be stored at refrigerator temperatures and must be used within 30 minutes of being reconstituted and cannot be refrozen.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 14 Recommended Vaccine Schedule1 Dose 1 Dose 2 12-15 months 4-6 years 12-47 months 2 15-12 years 3 48 months and older 3 1 MMRV should only be used when both of the component vaccines (MMR and varicella) are indicated and the child is 12 months through 12 years of age. Routinely recommended ages for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccination are 12 through 15 months of age for dose 1 and 4 through 6 years of age for dose 2. 2 Dose 1 at Ages 12 through 47 Months * For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at ages 12 through 47 months, either MMR and varicella vaccines or MMRV vaccine can be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Compared with use of MMR and varicella vaccines at the same visit, use of MMRV vaccine results in one fewer injection but is associated with a higher risk for fever and febrile seizures 5 through 12 days after the first dose among children aged 12 through 23 months* (about one extra febrile seizure for every 2,300-2,600 MMRV vaccine doses). Use of MMR and varicella vaccines avoids this increased risk for fever and febrile seizures following MMRV vaccine. Providers who face barriers to clearly communicating these benefits and risks for any reason (e.g., language barriers) should administer MMR and varicella vaccines. 3 Dose 1 at Ages 48 Months and Older and Dose 2 at any Age For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at ages 48 months and older and for dose 2 at any age (15 months through 12 years), use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR and varicella vaccines). Considerations should include provider assessment, patient preference, and the potential for adverse events. * The 47-month cut-off was chosen on the basis of the epidemiology of febrile seizures: first febrile seizures are uncommon after ages 4 years, approximately 94% of febrile seizures occur in children aged less than 4 years. Minimum Age and Dose Intervals Dose Minimum Age Time Interval to Dose 2 1 12 months 3 months Spacing and timing of MMRV from individual component vaccines (MMR and varicella): At least 1 month should elapse between a dose of a measles-containing vaccine and a dose of MMRV. At least 3 months should elapse between a dose of varicella vaccine and a dose of MMRV. However, if a 2nd dose was administered after at least 28 days following the 1st dose, the 2nd dose does not need to be repeated. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards---2/2016 Combination Vaccines 15 Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously Contraindications A. Contraindications Anaphylactic reaction to a prior dose of any of the vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella) or to the vaccine components Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever Altered immune status due to such things as malignancy, immunodeficiency, or immunosuppressive therapy Receipt of blood products or immune globulins---consult Appendix A of the listed reference for a table denoting the spacing of live virus vaccines and blood products and immune globulins. Steroid therapy---doses of systemic prednisone or equivalent at a dose of >2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day Persons receiving ongoing salicylate therapy, avoid using salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, there is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccinees in which vaccine-related rash develops, particularly healthcare workers and household contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid contact with susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. Pregnancy and lactation Cancer Untreated, active TB MMRV should not be administered to HIV infected persons who are severely immunocompromised. Consult Appendix A of the \"Pink Book,\" 13th edition , for directions on administration of single antigen live virus vaccines to immunocompromised persons. B. Precaution A personal or family (i.e., sibling, parent) history of seizures is a precaution for MMRV vaccination. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with children who do not have such histories. Children with a personal or family history of seizures generally should be vaccinated with MMR and varicella vaccines because the risks of using MMRV vaccine in this group of children generally outweigh the benefit of MMRV vaccine. Use caution in children with anaphylaxis or immediate hypersensitivity to eggs or contact hypersensitivity to neomycin Use caution in children with a history of cerebral injury or seizures or any other condition in which stress due to fever should be avoided Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2.

DT If the child begins the series at <1 year of age, follow the schedule outlined above. If the child is 12 months of age at the time the 1 st dose of DT is administered, a 2 nd dose should be administered 4-8 wks later, followed by a 3 rd dose given 6-12 months after the 2nd dose. This completes primary vaccination with DT. A booster dose should be given at 4-6 years of age. C. Tdap use in adolescents and adults- based on ACIP guidelines for use of Tdap in adolescents and the guidelines for use of Tdap in a dults. A (one-time dose) is recommended for persons 11 years of age through adulthood, providing they have previously completed the recomm ended DTP/DTaP/Td series and have not already received a dose of Td: Give in place of Td at the 11-12 year old healthca re visit. For those older adolescents or adults who have not already received a dose of Td. Can be given one time for tetanus prophylaxis in w ound management, if a dose of Tdap has not previously been given. Can be used as any one of the 3 doses when adminis tering a primary Td series to a person in the licensed age groups. Adults aged 65 years and older (e.g., grandparents , child-care providers, and health- care practitioners) who have or who anticipate havi ng close contact with an infant less than 12 months of age and who previously have not received Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis an d reduce the likelihood of transmission. For other adults aged 65 years and ol der, a single dose of Tdap vaccine may be given instead of Td vaccine, in persons who have not previously received Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval sin ce the last tetanus- or diphtheria- toxoid containing vaccine.

Tdap use in pregnancy ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal ca re implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. A dose of Tdap should be ad ministered during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of rece iving Tdap. Special situations o Tdap may be administered any time during pregnancy , but vaccination earlier during the third trimester (between 27 and 36 weeks gestation) would provide the highest concentration of maternal antibodies to be transferred closer to birth. o If Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. E. Td (refer to Tdap guidelines above for situations when that vaccine would be recommended instead of a dose of Td.) If administering as a primary series at 7 years of age, give at 0, 1, and 6 months.

Tdap is preferred over Td as ad olescents are susceptible to pertussis due to wanin g immunity, though Td may be indicated rather than Td ap in special situations (more information is avail able at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6702a1.htm ). Adolescents who did not receive Tdap at age 11 o r 12 should receive a single dose of Tdap in place of a single Td booster dose. Tdap can be administered re gardless of interval since the last tetanus of diphtheria co ntaining vaccine. 7 Tdap for Person without a History of DTP or DTaP All adolescents and adults should have documentati on of having received a series of DTaP, DTP, DT or Td Persons without documentation should receive a ser ies of 3 vaccinations One dose should be Tdap, preferably the first Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, 13th edition. 8 the ACIP Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Resolut ion for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC), (Resolution No. 6/11-2) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 2.

Inadvertent Administration of Tdap or Pediatric DTaP To help prevent inadvertent administration of Tdap when pediatric DTaP is indicated or pediatric DTaP when Tdap is indicated, vaccine providers should review product labels before administering these vaccines; the packaging might appear similar. Tdap is not indicated for children aged <10 years. Tdap contains lower amounts of diphtheria toxoid and lower amounts of some pertussis antigens compared with pediatric DTaP. Studies of the immune responses to Tdap among infants have not been conducted. Pediatric DTaP is not indicated for persons aged >7 years; the increased diphtheria toxoid content is associated with higher rates of adverse reactions in older persons ( 24-28 ). Guidance on the best approach to vaccination following inadvertent administration of Tdap or pediatric DTaP is based primarily on expert opinion. The family should be informed of any inadvertent vaccine administration. Adverse events associated with inadvertent vaccine administration can be reported to VAERS (see Reporting of Adverse Events after Vaccination). If Tdap is inadvertently administered instead of pediatric DTaP to a child aged <7 years as any one of the first three doses of the tetanus-diphtheria- pertussis vaccination series, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid, and a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP should be administered. If the inadvertent administration is discovered while the child is in the office, the pediatric DTaP can be administered during the same visit. If the child has left the office, some experts suggest administering the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within approximately 72 hours, or administering it 4 weeks later to optimize the child's immune response to the antigens in pediatric DTaP. This practice helps ensure that the child stays on the primary series schedule and has adequate protection against diphtheria and pertussis. However, the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered as soon as feasible at any interval after the inadvertent Tdap dose. The remaining doses of the pediatric DTaP series should be administered on the routine schedule, with at least a 4 week interval between the replacement dose of pediatric DTaP and the next dose of pediatric DTaP. For example, if an 8-week week old infant inadvertently received a dose of Tdap instead of the first dose of pediatric DTaP and does not receive a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP within a bout 72 hours, a replacement dose of pediatric DTaP can be administered 4 weeks after the inadvertent Tdap dose (age 12 weeks). The routine schedule of pediatric DTaP can then be resumed 4 weeks after the pediatric DTaP replacement dose (age 16 weeks) with the other recommended vaccines ( 1,23 ). If Tdap is inadvertently administered as the fourth or the fifth dose in the tetanus-diphtheria- pertussis vaccination series to a child aged <7 years, the Tdap dose should be counted as valid and does not need to be repeated; the child who received Tdap as a fourth dose should complete the pediatric DTaP schedule ( 23 ). The routine adolescent Tdap vaccination recommendations would apply when this child becomes an adolescent. For example, a child who inadvertently receives Tdap at age 5 years instead of the fifth dose of pediatric DTaP should receive a second dose of Tdap at age 11-12 years. If Tdap or pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administered to a child aged 7-9 years instead of Td as part of catch-up vaccination or for wound management, this dose can be counted as the adolescent Tdap dose, or the child can later receive an adolescent booster dose of Tdap according to the interval guidance used for Td to Tdap (see Routine Tdap Vaccination [section 1-A] and Pertussis Outbreaks and Other Settings with Increased Risk for Pertussis or its Complications [section 3-C]). In either case, the child should receive a dose of vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids no longer than 10 years after the inadvertent Tdap or pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix E). If pediatric DTaP is inadvertently administere d to an adolescent aged 11-18 years, the dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap booster. The adolescent should receive the next dose of a vaccine containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids 10 years after the inadvertent pediatric DTaP dose or according to the guidance for catch-up vaccination (Appendix D). * Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 2.

(For a complete listing of components, see package insert.) 2. Acute, moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever Precautions: 1. Pregnancy. The safety of hepatitis A vaccination given during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine is produced from inactivated HAV, the theoretical risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low. The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in women who may be at high risk for exposure to HAV. 1For Twinrix\u00ae Contraindications and Precautions see \"Combination Vaccine Guidelines\" in this section. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Hepatitis A vaccine may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, A Immunoprophylaxis (see January 2, 2008 Memorandum, \"New Policy for Hepatitis A Postexposure Prophylaxis\" located at the end of these guidelines) A. Immune Globulin (IG) Hepatitis A Immunoprophylaxis with Immune Globulin (IG) is routinely recommended in 2 situations: 1. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for international travel; and 2. Post-exposure prophylaxis for persons <12 months of age or >40 years of age who are contacts to acute cases of hepatitis A The provision of IG is available from the Epidemiology Branch for hepatitis A postexposure prophylaxis. The State Office of Pharmacy no longer stocks an IG supply. To obtain IG for this purpose, contact: 1. The appropriate designated district epidemiology personnel; and 2. Hepatitis epidemiology staff in the state office at (404) 657-3158 or (404) 657-2588. (When calling to request IG, please have on hand the necessary information regarding name of hepatitis A case and number of contacts, with some descriptive information [i.e., ages].) Supplies of IG given for pre-exposure prophylaxis, i.e. international travel, should be purchased by districts. The guidelines below are only a minimum reference and any decision to use IG should be prefaced by further research using available resources, including medical providers. For more specific information, please see Chapter 6, \"Surveillance and Reporting\" in this manual, the ACIP Hepatitis A statement and the 2012 Red Book references cited in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A.\" Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 5 Pre-exposure Prophylaxis For persons traveling to certain parts of the world where hepatitis A has high or intermediate endemicity, immunoprophylaxis is indicated. For persons 1 years of age, vaccine is preferable over IG. However, for children under 1 year of age, and for those whose travel plans are imminent and therefore do not allow enough time for vaccine to provide adequate protection, IG may be the better choice. (Not supplied by the State) Post-exposure Prophylaxis for persons <12 months of age or >40 years of age Household and sexual contacts of persons with acute hepatitis A. Administration of IG should take place within 2 weeks of most recent exposure, and is not indicated if that period of time has already elapsed. IG should be administered as age appropriate to all previously unvaccinated staff and attendees of child care centers or homes if 1) one or more cases of hepatitis A are recognized in children or employees, or 2) cases are recognized in two or more households of center attendees. If a food handler is diagnosed with hepatitis A, IG should be administered to other food handlers at the same establishment. In the event of a common-source outbreak, IG should NOT be administered to exposed patrons after cases have begun to occur because the 2-week period during which IG is effective will have been exceeded. For children aged <12 months, immunocompromised persons, persons who have had chronic liver disease diagnosed, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated, IG should be used. NOTE: IG would not routinely be recommended for: School settings, unless transmission within the school is documented. Hospital personnel caring for patients with hepatitis A disease, unless an outbreak among patients or between patients and staff is documented B. Hepatitis A Vaccine1,2 For healthy persons ages 12 months through 40 years, single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred to IG for post-exposure prophylaxis to hepatitis A infection because of vaccine advantages that include long-term protection and ease of administration.

Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 6 Recommended IG1 Dosage and Route Time Since Exposure2 Age of Patient Recommended Prophylaxis 2 weeks <12 months of age or >40 years of age3 IG, 0.02 mL/kg4 > 2 weeks All ages No prophylaxis 1 This product does NOT contain thimerosal. 2 Because hepatitis A cannot be reliably diagnosed on clinical presentation alone, serologic confirmation of HAV infection in index patients by IgM anti-HAV testing is recommended before postexposure treatment of contacts. 3 Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis for persons ages 12 months of age through 40 years of age. 4Immune Globulin should be administered deep into a large muscle mass (deltoid, gluteus, or in children under 24 months of age, the anterolateral thigh muscle.) Ordinarily, no more than 5 mL should be administered in 1 site in an adult or large child; lesser amounts (maximum 3 mL) should be given to small children and infants in one site. Contraindications and Precautions to IG Contraindications: 1. Persons with IgA deficiency. Anaphylaxis has been reported after repeated administration of IG to these persons. 2. Pregnancy or lactation is NOT a contraindication to IG use. Precautions: 1. IG can interfere with the response to live injected vaccines, such as MMR, varicella, and LAIV. Administration of live vaccines should be delayed for at least 3 months after administration of IG (See Table 4 of ACIP \"General Recommendations on Immunization\" for more specific guidelines.) 2. Unless the benefits of IG prophylaxis exceed the benefits of vaccination, IG should not be administered for 2 weeks after measles-, mumps-, and rubella-containing vaccines, and for 3 weeks after vaccination with varicella vaccine. If IG is given during this period, the person should be revaccinated with the live vaccine, but not sooner than 3 months after administration of IG. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule and Standards\u20147/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis A 7 Simultaneous Administration of IG with Vaccines Immune Globulin does not interfere in general with inactivated vaccines or to yellow fever vaccine. It may be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, Hib, hepatitis PPSV23, HPV, MCV4, MPSV4. Seroconversion rates are not impaired by simultaneous administration of IG with the first dose of Hepatitis A vaccine, but lower serum antibody concentrations may be achieved. This decreased immunogenicity is not likely to be clinically important.

Vaccine Description Licensed zoster vaccine live is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of zoster vaccine, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. To maintain potency, lyophilized zoster vaccine must be stored frozen at an average temperature of 5 F (-15C) until it is reconstituted for injection. On October 20, vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with novel adjuvant (ASO1 B), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults aged 50 years.

These guidelines are for informational purposes only. ACIP Recommendations for Administration of Zostavax\u00ae1 Zoster vaccine live (ZVL) is recommended for all persons aged >60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions . Zoster vaccination live is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), or to treat ongoing PHN. Vaccination of Persons who have received Varicella Vaccine Zoster vaccination live (ZVL) is not recommended for persons of any age who have received varicella vaccine. However, health-care providers do not need to inquire about varicella vaccination history before administrating zoster vaccine live because virtually all persons currently or soon to be in the recommended age group have not received varicella vaccine. In the United States, varicella vaccination began in 1995. Since that time, few adults aged 40 years would have been susceptible to varicella and thus eligible to receive varicella vaccine. The number of persons eligible for zoster vaccine who have received varicella vaccine is extremely small and will remain so for at least a decade.

Persons undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) Precautions: 1. Moderate to severe illness 2. Current treatment with an antiviral drug active against herpesviruses, such as acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir3 1 The package insert implies that zoster vaccine should not be administered to anyone who has ever had leukemia or lymphoma. However, ACIP recommends that persons whose leukemia or lymphoma is in remission and who have not received chemotherapy or radiation for at least 3 months can be vaccinated. 2 High dose corticosteroid therapy is defined as 20 milligrams or more per day of prednisone or equivalent lasting two or more weeks. Zoster vaccination should be deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. 3 Persons taking these drugs should discontinue them at least 24 hours before administration of zoster vaccine, and the drugs should not be taken for at least 14 days after vaccination. Special Groups and CircumstancesSpecial Groups and CircumstancesSpecial Groups and CircumstancesSpecial Groups and Circumstances 1. Persons with a reported history of zoster can be vaccinated 2.

RZV is recommended for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications for immunocompetent adults who previously received zoster vaccine live (ZVL). RZV is preferred over ZVL for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications. These recommendations serve as a supplement to the existing recommendations for the use of ZVL in immunocompetent adults aged 60 years. Vaccination of Persons who have received Varicella Vaccine RZV may be used in adults aged 50 years, irrespective of prior receipt of varicella vaccine or ZVL, and does not require screening for a history of chickenpox (varicella). ZVL remains a recommended vaccine for prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults aged 60 years.

Recommended Schedule and Standards---02/2018 Vaccines to Prevent Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Disease 5 Contraindications and Precautions Contraindications: 1. RZV should not be administered to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any component of this vaccine. Precautions: 1. For Current herpes zoster infection RZV is not a treatment for herpes zoster or postherpetic neuralgia and should not be administered during an acute episode of herpes zoster. 2. For pregnancy and breastfeeding there is no available data to establish whether RZV is safe in pregnant or lactating women and there is currently no ACIP recommendation for RZV use in this population. Consider delaying vaccination with RZV in such circumstances. Special Populations: 1. Adults with a history of herpes zoster should receive RZV. If a patient is experiencing an episode of herpes zoster, vaccination should be delayed until the acute stage of the illness is over and symptoms abate. Studies of safety and immunogenicity of RZV in the population is ongoing. 2. Adults with medical conditions (e.g., chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pulmonary disease) should receive RZV. 3. As with ZVL, the ACIP recommends the use of RZV in persons taking low- dose immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., <20mg/day of prednisone or equivalent or using inhaled or topical steroids) and persons anticipating immunosuppression or who have recovered from immunosuppression or who have recovered from immunocompromising illness. Whereas RZV is licensed for all persons aged 50 years, immunocompromised persons and those on moderate to high doses of immunosuppressive therapy were excluded from the efficacy studies (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70), and thus, ACIP has not made recommendations regarding the use of RZV in these patients. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of Herpes Zoster Vaccines. MMWR, January 26, 2018 / 67(3);103-108 Simultaneous Vaccine Administration May be administered simultaneously with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: Tdap, Td, MMR, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Polio, Influenza, MCV4, MPSV4, Hib, PPSV23 and PCV13 If simultaneous administration is not possible, Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) can be administered at any time before or after an inactivated vaccine, but at least 4 weeks before or after another live, attenuated vaccine. CDC's general best practice guidelines for immunization advise that recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vaccines. The safety and efficacy of administration of two adjuvanted vaccines (e.g., RZV and adjuvanted Fluad), either concomitantly or at other intervals have not been evaluated.

HPV typ es 16 and 18 cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer. Types 6 and 11 cause approxima tely 90% of genital wart cases. This product does not contain a preservative or ant ibiotics. After thorough agitation, it is a white, cloudy liquid. Gardasil 9 is a non-infectious 9-valent vaccine whi ch contains HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. 9vHPV targets five additional c ancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 9vHPV can be used fo r routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who h ave not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series.

It is important to emphasize these points: Females should continue to have routine cervical c ancer screening as recommended by their healthcare provider. Females do not need to get an HPV test or Pap test before receiving vaccine. If the person is already infected, the tests cannot tell w hich type of HPV she has. There are many types of HPV and vaccination would provide protection against infection with those types not already acquired. The vaccine will not have a therapeutic effect on existing HPV infection, genital warts or cervical lesions. There is no ACIP recommendation for additional 9-v alent HPV vaccine doses for persons who started the series with quadrivalent or bivalent HPV vaccine and completed the series with 9-valent HPV vaccine.

Recommended Schedule and Standards---02/2018 Vaccines to Prevent Influenza Vaccine Standards Influenza Vaccination for Persons with a History of Egg Allergy For the 2017-18 Influenza Season. ACIP recommends the following: 1. Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only urticarial (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Any licensed and recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV or RIV) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status may be used. 2. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticarial (hives), such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, may similarly receive any licensed and recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV or RIV) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient's age and health status. The selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices). Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions. 3. A previous severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine, regardless of the component suspected of being responsible for the reaction, is a contraindication to future receipt of the vaccine. No period of postvaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients for 15 minutes following administration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur. Persons who are able to eat lightly cooked egg (e.g., scrambled egg) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic. Egg-allergic persons might tolerate egg in baked products (i.e., bread or cake). Tolerance to egg-containing foods does not exclude the possibility of egg allergy. Egg allergy can be confirmed by a consistent medical history of adverse reactions to eggs and egg- containing foods, plus skin and/or blood testing for immunoglobulin E directed against egg proteins. Flublok is manufactured without the use of eggs and are egg-free. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 6 2.

The possibility of fetal harm appears remote. B Either animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are not controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal-reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester and there is no evidence in later trimesters. C Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus and there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. D There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective). X Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of IIV and LAIV. However, ACIP recommends that any licensed, recommended, and appropriate IIV or RIV may be administered to persons with egg allergy of any severity (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). *Immunization providers should check Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information for 2017-18 influenza vaccines for the most complete and updated information, including (but not limited to) indications, contraindications, and precautions.

Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously 'Evidence of Immunity' Requirements for Healthcare Personnel Adequate presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps for persons who work in health care facilities: Measles: Documented administration of two doses of live measles virus vaccine or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957123 Rubella Documented administration of one dose of live rubella virus vaccine or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957 (except women of childbearing age who could become pregnant)123 Mumps Documented administration of two doses of live mumps virus vaccine or Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or Born before 1957123 1 May vary depending on current state or local requirements. 2 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with two doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---2/2018 Vaccines to Prevent Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 4 mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. 3 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend two doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050577.htm Contraindications and Precautions A. Contraindications 1. Previous anaphylactic reactions to any vaccine component (i.e. gelatin or gelatin- containing products, or to topically or systemically administered neomycin), or following a previous dose of MMR vaccine 2. Moderate or severe illness with or without fever 3. Pregnancy - Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, women of childbearing age should receive MMR or its component vaccines only if they state they are not pregnant and are counseled not to become pregnant for 4 weeks after vaccination. However, MMR or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccination inadvertently given during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to consider interruption of pregnancy. 4. Known altered immunocompetence - Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune deficiency diseases and in persons with immunosuppression. Severe immunosuppression may be caused by many disease conditions (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, hematologic or generalized malignancy) and by therapy with immunosuppressive agents, including large doses of corticosteroids. The degree to which affected persons are immunocompromised can depend on the disease, its severity, and the treatment stage. Ultimately, the patient's physician must assume responsibility for determining whether the patient is severely immuno-compromised based on clinical and laboratory assessment. Contraindications and Precautions (cont'd) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---2/2018 Vaccines to Prevent Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 5 B. Precautions 1. Thrombocytopenia---Persons who have an episode of thrombocytopenic purpura within 6 weeks of vaccination with MMR should weigh the risk versus the benefit of receiving a 2nd dose. Serologic testing of immunity should be considered in lieu of MMR vaccination. 2. Recent receipt of blood, plasma, or immune globulin (in past 3-11 months) --- Blood and other antibody containing blood products, including immune globulin (IG) preparations, can diminish the immune response to MMR or its individual component vaccines. MMR or its component vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks before administration of an immune globulin or blood or blood-containing product or deferred until 3 or more months after administration of such preparations. (See Table 4 in this chapter for more specific guidelines regarding the time to wait before administering vaccine.) 3. Tuberculin skin tests --- MMR vaccine may interfere with the response to a tuberculin test. If such testing is otherwise indicated, it can be done either on the same day as MMR vaccine is administered or 4-6 weeks later. 4. Corticosteroid therapy --- Such therapy usually does not contraindicate the administration of live virus vaccines such as MMR when therapy is: a) short term (i.e. <14 days) low-to-moderate dose; b) low-to-moderate dose administered daily or on alternate days; c) long term alternate day treatment with short-acting preparations; d) physiologic maintenance doses (replacement therapy); or e) administered topically (skin or eyes), by aerosol, or by intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection. Doses that are considered to be immunosuppressive are those equivalent to or greater than a prednisone dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight per day or a total of 20 mg per day. (For further information on this precaution, see the ACIP Recommendations Statement listed in the introductory paragraph.)

These guidelines are meant to provide information f or those districts and clinics that administer this vaccine using privately purchased stock. ACIP Recommendations for Administration of MPSV4 ACIP recommends that MPSV4 should be used for adult s age 56 and older who are at risk for meningococcal disease. For adults who have received MenACWY previously, limited data demonstrate a higher antibody response after a subs equent dose of MenACWY compared with a subsequent dose of MPSV4. For meningococcal vacci ne-na\u00efve persons aged 56 years who anticipate requiring a single dose of meningococcal vaccine (e.g., travelers and persons at risk as a result of a community outbreak), MPSV4 is pref erred. For persons now aged 56 years who were vaccinated previously with MenACWY and are recommended for revaccination or for whom multiple doses are anticipated (e.g., persons with asplenia and microbiologists), MenACWY is preferred. The following high risk popul ations in that age group are recommended to be vaccinated with MPSV4, if not vaccinated prev iously with MenACWY: Persons who are traveling to countries in which N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local po pulation will be prolonged Persons with terminal complement deficiencies and t hose with anatomic or functional asplenia Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2.

Persons who previo usly were vaccinated at ages 2 months --6 years and are at prolonged increased risk shoul d be revaccinated 3 years after their previous meningococcal vaccine with MCV 4. Persons at prolonged increased risk for meningococcal disease include 1) persons with incre ased susceptibility such as persistent complement component deficiencies (e.g., C3, properdin, Factor D, and late complement component deficiencies), 2) persons with anatomic or functional asplenia, and 3) persons who have prolonged exposure (e.g., m icrobiologists routinely working with Neisseria meningitidis, or travelers to or resident s of countries where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic.

Vaccination with PCV13 is contraindicated among persons known to have severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of PCV13 or PCV7, or any diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. 2. Moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine can be administered to persons with minor illness, such as diarrhea; mild upper respiratory tract infection, with or without low grade fever; or other illnesses with low grade fever. Persons with an illness associated with a moderate or severe fever should be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. 3. Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including PCV13, to infants born prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual infant's medical status and potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination.

Guidance for Assessment of Poliovirus Vaccination S tatus and Vaccination of Children Who Have Received Poliovirus Vaccine Outsi de the United States Weekly / January 13, 2017 / 66(01);23-25 Vaccine Description Trivalent oral polio vaccine was the vaccine of ch oice in the U.S. from the time it was licensed in 1963. Since wild virus-induced paralyt ic polio was essentially eliminated in the western hemisphere by 1979, vaccine-induced paralyt ic polio (VAPP) became the greater risk. Therefore, in order to further the goal of e liminating any paralytic polio in the U.S., the ACIP recommended that inactivated polio vaccine be used exclusively, beginning in 2000. Oral polio vaccine is no longer available in the U. S. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced in the U.S. in 1955 but was largely replaced by OPV in the 1960's. Enhanced-potency IPV (e-IPV) was licensed in 1987 and is now the preferred polio vaccine. Georgia Department of Public Health Immunization Program Vaccine Standards Georgia Immunization Program Manual Departme nt of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards----2/2017 Vaccines to Prevent Polio 2 Guidance regarding assessment of poliovirus vaccina tion status and vaccination of children who have received polioviru s vaccine outside the United States . Only trivalent OPV (tOPV) counts toward the U.S. va ccination requirements (tOPV was used for routine poliovirus vaccination in all OPV- using countries until April 1, 2016) Previous poliovirus vaccination is valid if documen tation indicates receipt of used for ro poliovirus vaccination before April 1, 2016 in all OPV-using countries. Th erefore, if a child has documentation of receipt of an OPV dose (rather tha n \"tOPV\") before April 1, 2016, this represents a tOPV dose and should be cou nted towards the U.S. vaccination schedule, unless specifically notated t hat it was administered during a vaccination campaign.* Consistent with the polio eradication strategy, doses of OPV administered on or after April 1, 2016 are either bOPV (used in routine vaccination and campaigns), or mOPV (used i n a type-specific outbreak response); these doses do not count towards the U.S . vaccination requirements for protection against all three polio virus types. If both OPV and IPV were administered as part of a series, the total number of doses needed to complete the series is the same as that r ecommended for the U.S. IPV schedule. A minimum interval of 4 weeks should sepa rate doses in the series, with the final dose administered on or after the fourth birt hday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. If only OPV was administered, and all doses were gi ven before age 4 years, 1 dose of IPV should be given at 4 years or older and at leas t 6 months after the last OPV dose. This 6-month period is a change from the current fo otnote which indicates the period is 4 weeks after the last OPV dose.

However, vaccination should not be deferred because the product used for a previous dose(s) is not available or unknown. Continue or complete the series with product available. NOTE: Infants who have had rotavirus gastroenteritis befo re receiving the full course of rotavirus vaccinations should still initiate or com plete the 3-dose schedule because the initial infection frequently provides only partial immunity .

Intussusception---the current rotavirus vaccine has shown no evidence of an association with intussusception. However, additio nal post-licensure surveillance data are required to confirm that the vaccine is not associated with intussusception. Until post-licensure data on safety of rotavirus vaccine are available, the risks and benefits of vaccinatio n should be considered when vaccinating infants with a previous episode of intussusception. Until further safety data is available, vaccination of th ese infants with rotavirus vaccine should be delayed. 5. Altered immunocompetence---providers should cons ider the potential risks and benefits of administering rotavirus vaccine in this situation. Shedding of the vaccine virus may be possible, particularly after administr ation of the first dose. Caution is advised when considering whether to administer rota virus vaccine to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts. No safety or efficacy data are available for the administration of this vaccine to infants who a re potentially immunocompromised including: a. Infants with blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphom as of any type or other malignant neoplasms b. Infants on immunosuppressive therapy (including high-dose systemic corticosteroids) c. Infants with primary and acquired immunodeficien cy states d. Infants who are HIV-exposed or infected. However , two considerations support vaccination of HIV-exposed or infected infa nts: first, the HIV diagnosis might not be established in infants born to HIV-infected mothers before the age of the first rotavirus vaccine and s econd, vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated.

If a child is 15 months or older an d has not had the disease, the child should be immunized at the earliest opportunity. Vaccine Dose 2 Age (for routine vaccinat ion) 3 Varicella 1 12-15 months 2 4-6 years In addition, varicella vaccination is recommended i n the following situations: A 2 nd dose catch-up for all children, adolescents, and a dults who previously had received one dose. Vaccination should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T- lymphocyte percentage 15% and may be considered for adolescents and adult s in with CD4+ T-lymphocyte count 200 cells/ \u00b5L. DO NOT use MMRV vaccine for these persons. For postpartum women whose prenatal assessment ind icated susceptibility to varicella disease, the 1st dose of vaccine should be administ ered before discharge from the healthcare facility and the 2 nd dose scheduled at an appropriate interval. During a varicella outbreak, a 2 nd dose of vaccine should be given to those who had previously only received 1 dose, provided the appro priate minimum interval has elapsed since the first dose. 3 Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---6/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 3 Recommended Varicella Vaccine Schedule (cont'd) Other adults who should receive special considerat ion for varicella vaccine if determined not to be immune: o Healthcare providers o Household contacts of immunocompromised persons o Persons in environments where transmission of VZV is likely, such as teachers, childcare employees, persons in institutional setti ngs, college students, staff and inmates of correctional institutions, and military personnel. o Nonpregnant women of childbearing age o Adolescents and adults living in households with c hildren o International travelers 1 See Guidelines for Documentation of Immunity below. 2 Doses of varicella may be given as MMRV if the chil d is 12 months through 12 years of age, and a dose of MMR is also indicated. See \"Combination Vacci ne\" guidelines in this section for more information . 3 Minimum interval from dose 1 to 2: 3 mon ths if 1 st dose is given at <13 years of age 4 wee ks if 1 st dose is given at 13 years of age NOTE: Varicella vaccine is effective in preventing illnes s or modifying varicella severity if it is administered within 3 days and possibly up to 5 day s after exposure. Standards for Public Health Clinics Documentation of Varicella Immunity These standards are to be used by nurses in public health clinics to document varicella immunity. This documentation will be for issuing a \"Certificate of Immunization\" for childcare and school attendance. 1. Documentation of age-appropriate vaccination: Ages 12 months through preschool----1 dose Kindergarten through adulthood---2 doses 2. Laboratory evidence of immunity or confirmation of disease 3. Born in the US before 1980. (For healthcare prov iders, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons' birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity. 4. Healthcare provider diagnosis of disease or docu mentation of history of disease Typical case history o Recollection of an itchy, blister-like rash that l asted about a week with o History of known exposure to shingles or a typical case of chickenpox (fever and maculopapular rash with successive crops of vesicul ar lesions in different stages) o Documentation should be made by licensed medical p ersonnel (e.g., physician, public health nurse, physician's assistant, or nurs e practitioner); however, the Immunization Certificate must be signed by a physic ian, advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant licensed in Georgia or by a Public Health Official.

However, regardless of the child's age, if the 2 nd dose was administered after at least 28 days follo wing the 1 st dose, the 2 nd dose does not need to be repeated. Recommended Dosage and Route 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---6/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 5 Contraindications and Precautions A. Contraindications and Precautions 1. Allergy to vaccine components Anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine or a cons tituent of the vaccine (e.g., gelatin or neomycin) 2. Moderate or severe illnesses with or w ithout fever Varicella vaccine can be administered to persons with minor illness, such as diarrhea; mild upper respiratory tract infection, with or without low grade fever; or other illnesses with low grade fever. Persons wi th an illness associated with a moderate or severe fever should be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. Although no data exist as to whether varicella or live varicella virus vaccine exacerbates tubercul osis, vaccination is not recommended for persons who have untreated, active tuberculosis . Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for varicella vaccinatio n. 3. Altered immune status Altered immune status due to: a malignant conditi on (blood dyscrasia, leukemia, 1 lymphoma, or other neoplasms affecting the bone m arrow or lymphatic system); primary or acquired immune deficiency, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other clinical manifestations of HIV infection, cellular immunodeficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia, and dy sgammaglobulinemia; family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficienc y, unless immune competence of possible vaccine recipient is demonstrated; and i ndividuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy. See ACIP statement ci ted in the opening paragraph of \"Vaccines to Prevent Varicella.\" 4. Receipt of blood products Varicella virus vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months after receipt of blood (except washed red blood cells) or plasma transfus ions, Immune Globulin (IG), or Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG). In additi on, IG and VZIG should not be administered for 3 weeks after vaccination unless the benefits of receiving the IG or VZIG exceed the benefits of vaccination. 5. Steroid therapy Receiving doses of systemic prednisone or its equi valent at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight per day or 20 mg/day. 6. Exposure of immunocompromised persons t o vaccinees In persons who develop a rash post-vaccination, th ere is a minimal risk of transmission of vaccine virus to close contacts. Thus, vaccine es in whom vaccine-related rash develops, particularly health care workers and hou sehold contacts of immunocompromised persons, should avoid contact wi th susceptible persons who are at high risk of serious complications. 7. Salicylates Due to the association between wild varicella zoste r infection, salicylates, and Reye syndrome, if feasible, vaccine recipients should a void using salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving varicella virus vaccine. Vaccination wi th subsequent close monitoring should be considered for children who have conditions req uiring therapeutic aspirin because the risk for serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom natural varicella disease develop s than in children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated varicella zoster vir us. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---6/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 6 8. Pregnancy Theoretically, it is best not to administer varicel la vaccine to pregnant women. Woman who are not pregnant but are of childbearing age wh o receive the vaccine should be advised not to become pregnant for at least 1 month after each injection. Merck and the CDC have established a hotline to monitor the m aternal/fetal outcomes of women who are vaccinated with varicella 3 months before o r at any time during the pregnancy. The phone number is (800) 986-8999. 9. Nursing mothers Whether attenuated varicella (VZV) vaccine is excre ted in human milk and, if so, whether the infant could be infected, are not known. Most live vaccines have not been demonstrated to be secreted in human milk. Therefo re, varicella vaccine may be considered for a nursing mother. 1 Except under research protocol Note: A prior history of chicken pox is not a contraindic ation to varicella vaccination. Simultaneous Vaccine Administration Varicella vaccine may be administered simultaneousl y with any of the following routinely recommended vaccines: DTaP, Tdap, Td, MMR, Hib, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis PPSV23, Influenza, HPV, MPSV4 and MCV4 Tuberculin Skin Testing: While no data are availab le regarding the effect of varicella vaccination on tuberculin reactivity, it is prudent to apply th e same precautions as with MMR when using the varicella vaccine. See guidelines for simultaneous tuberculin skin testing (TST) and the administration of live virus vaccines in the ACIP s tatement, \"General Recommendations on Immunization,\" MMWR , January 28, 2011, Vol. 60, RR-2, page 24. CDC Recommendations for Use of VariZIG- varicella z oster immune globulin The decision to administer VariZIG depends on three factors: 1) Whether the patient lacks evidence of immunity to varicella, 2) Whether the exposure is likely to result in in fection, and 3) Whether the patient is at greater risk for var icella complications than the general population. For high-risk patients who have additional exposure s to varicella-zoster virus 3 weeks after initial VariZIG administration, another dose of VariZIG should be considered. Timing of VariZIG administration CDC recommends administration of VariZIG as soon as possible after exposure to varicella-zoster virus and within 10 days. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 2. Recommended Schedule & Standards---6/2015 Vaccines to Prevent Varicella 7 Patient groups for whom VariZIG is recommended Immunocompromised patients without evidence of immunity. Newborn infants whose mothers have signs and sy mptoms of varicella around the time of delivery (i.e., 5 days before to 2 days after). Hospitalized premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh 1,000 g at birth, regardless of their mothers' evid ence of immunity to varicella. Pregnant women without evidence of immunity. VariZIG Administration VariZIG is supplied in 125-IU vials and should be a dministered intramuscularly as directed by the manufacturer. The recommended dose is 125 IU/10 kg of body weight, up to a maximum of 625 IU (five vials). The minimum dose is 62.5 IU (0.5 vial) for patients weighing 2.0 kg and 125 IU (one vial) for patients weighing 2.1- 10.0 kg Patients who become eligible for vaccination, varic ella vaccine should be administered 5 months after VariZIG administration. Because vari cella zoster immune globulin might prolong the incubation period by 1 week, any patient who receives VariZIG should be observed closely for sig ns and symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure.

Use of licensed combination vaccines is generally preferred to separate injections of their equivalent component vaccines. When administering combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest age for any of the individual components (exception: the minimum age for the first dose of MenHibrix is 6 weeks) . The minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individual components. 2 Information on travel vaccines including typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, is available at www.cdc.gov/travel . Information on other vaccines that are licensed in the US but not distributed , including anthrax and smallpox, is available at https://emergency.cdc.gov/bioterrorism/ . 3 \"Months\" refers to calendar months. 4 A hyphen used to express a range (as in \"12 -15 months\") means \"through.\" 5 Combination vaccines containing a hepatitis B component (Pediarix and Twinrix) are available. These vaccines should not be administered to infants younger than 6 weeks because of the other components (i.e., Hib, DTaP, HepA, and IPV). 6 The minimum recommended interval between DTaP -3 and DTaP -4 is 6 months. However, DTaP -4 need not be repeated if administered at least 4 months after DTaP -3. This is a special grace period of 2 months, which can be used when evaluating records retrospectively. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. 7 Children receiving the first dose of Hib or PCV 13 vac cine at age 7 months or older require fewer doses to complete the series. 8 If PedvaxHib i s administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required. The minimum age for the final dose is 12 months. 9 HepB -3 should be administered at least 8 weeks after HepB -2 and at least 16 weeks after HepB -1, and should not be administered before 24 weeks of age. 10 Herpes zoster vaccine is recommended as a single dose for persons 60 years of age and older. 11 Gardasil and Gardasil 9 are approved for males and females 9 through 26 years of age. The minimum age for HPV -3 is based on the baseline minimum age for the first dose (i.e., 9 years) and the minimum interval of 5 months between the first and third dose. Dose 3 need not be repeated if it is administered at least 5 months after the first dose, and if the intervals between doses 1 and 2, and doses 2 and 3, are 4 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. 12 A two -dose HPV vaccine schedule is recommended for most persons who begin the series before the 15th birthday. See www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/pdfs/mm6549a5.pdf for det ails. 13 One dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for most people. Some children younger than 9 years of age should receive 2 doses in a single season. See current influenza recommendations for details . 14 The minimum age for inactivated influenza vaccine varies by vaccine manufacturer. See package inserts for vaccine-specific minimum ages. 15 Combination MMRV vaccine can be used for children 12 months through 12 years of age. See www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5903.pdf for details. 16 Revaccination with meningococcal vaccine is recommended for previously vaccinated persons who remain at high risk f or meningococcal disease. See www. cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf for details. 17 High-risk children can receive Menactra as young as 9 months and Menveo as young as 2 months. MenHibrix is given as a four -dose series at 2, 4, 6, and 12-18 months. It can be given as young as 6 weeks for high-risk children. 18 For routine, non-high risk adolescent vaccination, the minimum age for the booster dose is 16 years. 19 A second dose of PPSV23 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons < 65 years of age at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection, and for those who are likely to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal antibody concentration. See www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4608.pdf for details. 20 A fourth dose is not needed if the third dose was administered on or after the 4th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous dose. 21 The first dose of rotavirus must be administered no earlier than 6 weeks and no later than 14 weeks 6 days. The vaccine series should not be started for infants 15 weeks 0 days or older. Rotavirus vaccine should not be administered to children older than 8 months 0 days, regardless of the number of doses received before that age. If two doses of Rotarix are administered as age appropriate, a third dose is not necessary. 22 Only one dose of Tdap is recommended. Subsequent doses should be given as Td. For management of a tetanus -prone wound in a person who has received a primary series of a tetanus -toxoid containing vaccine, the minimum interval after a previous dose of any tetanus -containing vaccine is 5 years. 23 A special grace period of 2 months, based on expert opinion, can be applied to the minimum interval of 3 months, when evaluat ing records retrospectively, which results in an acceptable minimum interval of 4 weeks. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. 24 A special grace period of 2 months, based on expert opinion, can be applied to the minimum age of 15 months when evaluating records retrospectively, which will result in an acceptable minimum age of 13 months. An additional 4 days should not be added to this grace period. Adapted from Table 3-1, ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization.

Unvaccinated persons might not be fully protected against measles during the entire recommended interval, and additional doses of IG or measles vaccine might be indicated after measles exposure. Concentrations of measles antibody in an IG preparation can vary by manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody clearance after receipt of an IG preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are extrapolated from an estimated half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg. 1 Does not include zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine may be given with antibody- containing blood products. 2 Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL. 3 Measles vaccination is recommended for children with mild or moderate immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and varicella vaccination may be considered for children with mild or moderate immunosuppression from HIV, but both are contraindicated for persons with severe immunosuppression from HIV or any other immunosuppressive disorder. 4 Contains antibody only to respiratory syncytial virus . 5 Licensed VariZIG is a purified human IG preparation made from plasma containing high levels of anti -varicella antibodies (IgG ).

If you answer \"yes\" to any question, it does not necessarily mean your child should not be vaccinated. It just means additional questions must be asked. If a question is not clear, please ask your healthcare provider to explain it. 1. Is the child sick today? 2. Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? 5. If the child to be vaccinated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told he or she has had intussusception? 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system problems? 8. Does the child or a family member have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problems? 9. In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that affect the immune system such as prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs; drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis; or had radiation treatments? 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? 11. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? form completed by date form reviewed by date Did you bring your immunization record card with you? yes no It is important to have a personal record of your child's vaccinations. If you don't have one, ask the child's healthcare provider to give you one with all your child's vaccinations on it. Keep it in a safe place and bring it with you every time you seek medical care for your child. Your child will need this document to enter day care or school, for employment, or for international travel. 1. Is the child sick today? [all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events.1,2 However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2 . Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] An anaphylactic reaction to latex is a contraindication to vaccines that contain latex as a compo - nent or as part of the packaging (e.g., vial stoppers, prefilled syringe plungers, prefilled syringe caps). If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer vaccines containing gel- atin. A local reaction to a prior vaccine dose or vaccine component, including latex, is not a con - traindication to a subsequent dose or vaccine containing that component. For information on vaccines supplied in vials or syringes containing latex, see reference 3; for an extensive list of vaccine components, see reference 4. People with egg allergy of any severity can receive any rec - ommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV or RIV) that is otherwise appropriate for the patient's age. For people with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg involving any symptom other than hives (e.g., angioedema, respiratory distress), or who required epinephrine or another emer- gency medical intervention, the vaccine should be administered in a medical setting, such as a clinic, health department, or physician office. Vaccine administration should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions . 5 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine com - ponent is a contraindication for subsequent doses.1 History of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Pre - cautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [MMR, MMRV, LAIV] A history of thrombocytopenia is a precaution to MMR and MMRV vaccines. The safety of live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children and teens with lung, heart, kidney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), or a blood disorder has not been established. These conditions, including asthma in children ages 5 years and older, should be con - sidered precautions for the use of LAIV.

If the child to be vaccinated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children ages 2 through 4 years who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given LAIV. Instead, these children should be given IIV. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP.

Does the child or a family member have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, and LAIV) are usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR is recom - mended for asymptomatic HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe immuno - suppression. Likewise, varicella vaccine should be considered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage at 15% or greater, or for children 6-7 years with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cell/\u00b5L. Varicella vaccine may be con- sidered for HIV-infected children with age-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Varicella and MMR vaccines should not be given to a child or teen with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., par - ents, siblings) unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient has been clini - cally substantiated or verified by a laboratory. Immunosuppressed children should not receive LAIV. Infants who have been diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) should not be given a live virus vaccine, including rotavirus (RV) vaccine. Other forms of immunosup - pression are a precaution, not a contraindication, to rotavirus vaccine. For details, consult ACIP recommendations. 1,6,7,8 9 . In the past 3 months, has the child taken medications that affec t the immune system such as prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs; drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's psoriasis; or had radiation vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement.1 Some immune mediator and immune modulator drugs (especially the antitumor-necrosis factor agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) may be immuno - suppressive. The use of live vaccines should be avoided in persons taking these drugs.1 To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 9. LAIV, when recommended, can be given only to healthy non-pregnant people ages 2 through 49 years. 10. In the past year, has the child received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, MMRV, varicella) may need to be deferred, depend- ing on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations or the current Red Book for the most current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines.1,2 1 1. Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she could become pregnant during the next month? [HPV, IPV, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. 1,2 Sexually active young women who receive a live virus vaccine should be instructed to practice careful con- traception for one month following receipt of the vaccine.7,10 On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of exposure is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic areas) and immediate protection is needed. Inac - tivated influenza vaccine and Tdap are both recommended during pregnancy. HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. 12. Has the child received vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, MMRV, VAR, yellow fever] Children who were given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, MMRV, vari - cella, yellow fever) should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inacti - vated vaccines may be given at the same time or at any spacing interval.

[all vaccines] There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events.1,2 However, as a precaution with moderate or severe acute illness, all vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved. Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vaccination. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking antibiotics. 2 . Does the child have allergies to medications, food, a vaccine component, or latex? [all vaccines] An anaphylactic reaction to latex is a contraindication to vaccines that contain latex as a compo - nent or as part of the packaging (e.g., vial stoppers, prefilled syringe plungers, prefilled syringe caps). If a person has anaphylaxis after eating gelatin, do not administer vaccines containing gel- atin. A local reaction to a prior vaccine dose or vaccine component, including latex, is not a con - traindication to a subsequent dose or vaccine containing that component. For information on vaccines supplied in vials or syringes containing latex, see reference 3; for an extensive list of vaccine components, see reference 4. People with egg allergy of any severity can receive any rec - ommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV or RIV) that is otherwise appropriate for the patient's age. For people with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg involving any symptom other than hives (e.g., angioedema, respiratory distress), or who required epinephrine or another emer- gency medical intervention, the vaccine should be administered in a medical setting, such as a clinic, health department, or physician office. Vaccine administration should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic conditions . 5 3. Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in the past? [all vaccines] History of anaphylactic reaction (see question 2) to a previous dose of vaccine or vaccine com - ponent is a contraindication for subsequent doses.1 History of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP is a contraindication for further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Pre - cautions to DTaP (not Tdap) include the following: (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous crying for 3 or more hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of a previous dose. There are other adverse events that might have occurred following vaccination that constitute contraindications or precautions to future doses. Under normal circumstances, vaccines are deferred when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community pertussis outbreak). 4. Has the child had a health problem with lung, heart, kidney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), asthma, or a blood disorder? Is he/she on long-term aspirin therapy? [MMR, MMRV, LAIV] A history of thrombocytopenia is a precaution to MMR and MMRV vaccines. The safety of live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children and teens with lung, heart, kidney, or metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), or a blood disorder has not been established. These conditions, including asthma in children ages 5 years and older, should be con - sidered precautions for the use of LAIV. Children on long-term aspirin therapy should not be given LAIV; instead, they should be given IIV. 5. If the child to be vaccinated is 2 through 4 years of age, has a healthcare provider told you that the child had wheezing or asthma in the past 12 months? [LAIV] Children ages 2 through 4 years who have had a wheezing episode within the past 12 months should not be given LAIV. Instead, these children should be given IIV. 6. If your child is a baby, have you ever been told that he or she has had intussusception? [Rotavirus] Infants who have a history of intussusception (i.e., the telescoping of one portion of the intestine into another) should not be given rotavirus vaccine. 7. Has the child, a sibling, or a parent had a seizure; has the child had brain or other nervous system [DTaP, in children who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP. An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution to the use of DTaP and Tdap. For children with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for children with a family history of seizures, vaccinate as usual (exception: children with a personal or family [i.e., parent or sibling] history of seizures generally should not be vaccinated with MMRV; they should receive separate MMR and VAR vaccines).

Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neuro - logic problem is a precaution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (IIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with IIV if at increased risk for severe influenza complications. 8.

Do you have a long-term health problem with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, kidney disease, metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes), anemia, or other blood disorder? [MMR, LAIV] A history of thrombocytopenia or thrombcytompenic purpura is a precaution to MMR vaccine. The safety of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in people with these conditions has not been established. These conditions, includ - ing asthma in adults, should be considered precautions for the use of LAIV. 5. Do you have cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, or any other immune system problem? [LAIV, MMR, people. However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR vaccine is recommended and varicella vaccine should be considered for adults with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of greater than or equal to 200 cells/\u00b5L. Immunosuppressed people should not receive LAIV. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations.4,5,6 6. In the past 3 months, have you taken medications that affect your immune system, such as cortisone, prednisone, other steroids, or anticancer drugs; drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis; or have you had radiation treatments? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) should be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term high-dose steroid therapy has ended. For details and length of time to postpone, consult the ACIP statement.1,5 Some immune mediator and immune modulator drugs (especially the antitumor-necrosis factor agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) may be immunosuppressive. The use of live vaccines should be avoided in persons taking these drugs ( MMWR 2011;60 [RR-2]:23). To find specific vaccination schedules for stem cell transplant (bone marrow transplant) patients, see reference 7. LAIV can be given only to healthy non-pregnant people ages 2 through 49 years.Information for Healthcare Professionals about the Screening Checklist for Contraindications to Vaccines for Adults Are you interested in knowing why we included a certain question on the screening checklist?

Have you had a seizure or a brain or other nervous system problem? [influenza, Td/Tdap] Tdap is contraindicated in people who have a history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTaP given before age 7 years. An unstable progressive neuro - logic problem is a precaution to the use of Tdap. For people with stable neurologic disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination, or for people with a family history of seizure, vaccinate as usual. A history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a consideration with the following: 1) Td/Tdap: if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a tetanus-containing vaccine and decision is made to continue vaccination, give Tdap instead of Td if no history of prior Tdap; 2) Influenza vaccine (IIV/LAIV): if GBS has occurred within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine, vaccinate with IIV if at increased risk for severe influenza complications. 8. During the past year, have you received a transfusion of blood or blood products, or been given immune (gamma) globulin or an antiviral drug? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS] Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., LAIV, MMR, VAR, ZOS) may need to be deferred, depending on several variables. Consult the most current ACIP recommendations for current information on intervals between antiviral drugs, immune globulin or blood product administration and live virus vaccines.1 9. For women: Are you pregnant or is there a chance you could become pregnant during the next month? [HPV, IPV, MMR, LAIV, VAR, ZOS] MMR, VAR, ZOS, LAIV) are contraindicated one month before and during pregnancy because of the theoretical risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active women in their childbearing years who receive live virus vaccines should be instructed to practice careful contraception for one month follow - ing receipt of the vaccine. On theoretical grounds, inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during pregnancy; however, it may be given if risk of exposure is imminent and immediate protection is needed (e.g., travel to endemic areas). Inacti - vated influenza vaccine and Tdap are both recommended during pregnancy. Both vaccines may be given at any time during pregnancy but the preferred time for Tdap administration is at 27-36 weeks' gestation. HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy.1,4,5,6,8,9 10. Have you received any vaccinations in the past 4 weeks? [LAIV, MMR, VAR, yellow fever, ZOS] People who were given either LAIV or an injectable live virus vaccine (e.g., MMR, VAR, ZOS, yellow fever) should wait 28 days before receiving another vaccination of this type. Inactivated vaccines may be given at any spacing interval if they are not administered simultaneously. references 1. CDC. General best practice guidelines for immuni - zation.

Some of these changes include expansion of vaccination services offered by pharmacists and other community immunization providers both during and since the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic; vaccina - tion at the workplace; increased vaccination by providers who care for pregnant women; and changes in the health-care system, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires first-dollar coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines for people with certain private insurance plans, or those who are beneficiaries of expanded Medicaid plans.5 The ACA first-dollar provision is expected to increase the number of adults who will be insured for vaccines. Other changes include expanding the inclusion of adults in state immunization information systems (IISs) (i.e., registries) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements, which mandate provider reporting of immunizations to registries, including reporting of adult vaccination in states where such reporting is allowed.6 For the purposes of this report, provider refers to any individual who provides health-care services to adult patients, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other health-care professionals. While previous versions of the adult immunization standards have been published, recommendations for adult vaccination are published annually, and many health-care organizations have endorsed routine assessment and vaccina - tion of adults, vaccination among adults continues to be low.7-15 Several barriers to adult vaccination include: Lack of health-care provider and patient knowledge about the need for vaccinating both healthy and high-risk adults. Medical management of acute and chronic illnesses, which usually receives priority over preventive services. Some providers not offering vaccines or offering only a subset of vaccines recommended for adults, and many adult patients unaware of their rec - ommended vaccines.116 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129 Private and public payer payment for vaccines complicated for providers, and not all those who vaccinate adults are recognized as providers by third-party payers. Medicare setting limits on coverage for vaccines based on the type of plan. For example: \u00b0 Fully reimbursed vaccines through Medi - care Part B are limited to vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus-diphtheria (Td) (as part of wound management but not routine booster doses), and hepatitis B (for certain intermediate and high-risk groups such as patients with end-stage renal failure or diabetes).16 \u00b0 Medicare Part D provides limited coverage for the remainder of vaccines recommended for adults, often requiring significant out-of- pocket costs to patients (e.g., zoster vaccine; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine; and routine booster doses of Td vaccines).16 \u00b0 Vaccines included in Medicare Part D plans are pharmacy or drug benefits rather than medical benefits. Because most medical pro - viders are not enrolled as pharmacy providers, receiving reimbursement for these vaccines is a challenge. Many providers, both medical and nonmedical, experience complexities in dealing with billing processes and the level of payment for Part D claims. Pharmacist vac - cinators are established providers for Part D vaccines but are still challenged by coverage variability in insurance plans. Medicaid vaccination coverage and authorized vaccines vary by state, with some states cover - ing only a subset of vaccines recommended for adults by ACIP. Medicaid coverage of ACIP- recommended vaccines is further complicated by the Supreme Court decision allowing states to opt out of increased Medicaid coverage.17 Out-of-pocket costs to patients are a known bar- rier. For example: \u00b0 While the ACA removed out-of-pocket costs for many privately insured people, not all provid - ers and patients are likely to be aware of this provision. \u00b0 Some providers may not be eligible for reim - bursement under some health insurance plans because they are not authorized as in-network providers for vaccination services. \u00b0 Many adults remain uninsured.

The presence of multiple providers of health services may complicate coordination of care and reduce the likelihood that patients' vaccination needs are routinely assessed and needed vaccines are offered. Despite these barriers, a number of strategies have been shown to improve receipt of adult immunizations. One of the most important predictors of vaccination receipt among adults is a health-care provider's recom - mendation and offer of vaccine during the same visit. The importance of a provider recommendation for vac - cination has been demonstrated repeatedly.18-22 Other approaches shown to increase vaccination coverage include patient and provider reminder/recall systems; provider assessment and feedback about vaccination practices; use of standing orders or protocols; reduc - ing patient out-of-pocket costs; worksite interventions with promoted vaccination services; other community-based and health-care system-based interventions implemented in combination.21 The need to review and revise earlier standards is based on several factors: Emphasis on the role of all providers, even non- vaccinating providers, to assess immunization status and recommend needed vaccines was not included in earlier adult immunization standards documents and is generally not included in clini - cal training programs. Community vaccinators and pharmacists are increasingly recognized as integral to achieving higher adult vaccination rates. Reliance on electronic health records (EHRs) is increasing and there are meaningful use incen - tives for eligible medical providers to enter patient immunization information into IISs for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive payments. A change in communication strategies for educat - ing and contacting patients, with the availability of the Internet and social media, is underway. New opportunities are afforded by the ACA to provide vaccination within the shifting landscape of vaccine financing. There is also a shift in pay - ment models away from fee-for-service toward payment for better outcomes of care. Federal funds for immunization programs that had been used for underinsured children may become available for purchasing vaccines for uninsured adults as the number of children insured for vaccines increases due to implemen - tation of the ACA. As such, the NVAC recommends that the Assistant Secretary for Health promote the use of the 2013 updated NVAC Standards for Adult Immunization Prac - tice by all health-care professionals and payers in the public and private sectors who provide care for adults. STANDARDS FOR ADULT IMMUNIZATION PRACTICE Every health-care provider, in all settings, has a funda - mental responsibility to ensure that all patients are up- to-date with respect to recommended immunizations. The purpose of the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice, which are summarized in the Figure, is to provide guidance to adult health-care providers across the spectrum of health care.

Summary of 2013 National Vaccine Advisory Committee's standards for adult immunization practices Audience Summary of standards All providers Incorporate immunization needs assessment into every clinical encounter. Strongly recommend needed vaccine(s) and either administer vaccine(s) or refer patient to a provider who can immunize. Stay up-to-date on, and educate patients about, vaccine recommendations. Implement systems to incorporate vaccine assessment into routine clinical care. Understand how to access immunization information systems (i.e., immunization registries). Non-immunizing providers Routinely assess the immunization status of patients, recommend needed vaccine(s), and refer patient to an immunizing provider. Establish referral relationships with immunizing providers. Follow up to confirm patient receipt of recommended vaccine(s). Immunizing providers Ensure professional competencies in immunizations. Assess immunization status in every patient care and counseling encounter and strongly recommend needed vaccine(s). Ensure that receipt of vaccination is documented in patient medical record and immunization registry. Professional health-care- related organizations/ associations/health-care systems Provide immunization education and training of members, including trainees. Provide resources and assistance to implement protocols and other systems to incorporate vaccine needs assessment and vaccination or referral into routine practice. Encourage members to be up-to-date on their own immunizations. Assist members in staying up-to-date on immunization information and recommendations. Partner with other immunization stakeholders to educate the public. Seek out collaboration opportunities with other immunization stakeholders. Collect and share best practices for immunization. Advocate policies that support adult immunization standards. Insurers/payers/entities that cover adult immunization services should assure their network is adequate to provide timely immunization access and augment with additional vaccine providers if necessary. Public health departments Determine community needs, vaccination capacity, and barriers to adult immunization. Provide access to all ACIP-recommended vaccinations for insured and uninsured adults and work toward becoming an in-network provider for immunization services for insured adults. Partner with immunization stakeholders and support activities and policies to improve awareness of adult vaccine recommendations, increase vaccination rates, and reduce barriers. Ensure professional competencies in immunizations. Collect, analyze, and disseminate immunization data. Provide outreach and education to providers and the public. Work to decrease disparities in immunization coverage and access. Increase immunization registry access and use by vaccine providers for adult patients.

Promote adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and standards among adult immunization stakeholders. ACIP 5 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices roles of all providers with regard to immunizations, including the role of all providers to conduct routine assessment of vaccination needs for their patients, recommend needed vaccines, and either administer needed vaccines or, for providers who currently do not stock all recommended vaccines, refer patients to places where they can get recommended vaccines. NVAC Update on Standards for Adult Immunization Practice 119 Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 1291. Standards for all providers, including those who do and do not provide immunization services Part of routine clinical care for all providers should include an assessment of their patients' immunization status and a recommendation to the patient and/or the patient's caregiver for needed vaccines. Assessment and recommendation can be accomplished through the following practices: a. Emphasize the importance of immunizations during patient encounters, incorporate patient assessment of vaccine needs into routine clini - cal practice, and document vaccination status in patient medical records. IISs and EHRs should be referenced as sources of data about a patient's vaccine history. b. Strongly recommend all immunizations that patients need. c. Provide all recommended vaccines to patients who need them at the time of the visit. If the vaccines are not given or, if the provider does not have the vaccines in stock, refer the patient to a vaccine provider known to be able to provide the recommended vaccinations. Because vaccine uptake is much higher among patients when the vaccine is recommended and offered at the same visit, providers who are able to stock vaccines for their patients are strongly encouraged to do so.18 d. Ensure that they, and their practice staff, are up-to-date on their own vaccinations per ACIP health-care personnel vaccine recommendations23 and consistent with professional guidelines. Examples of current professional association guidelines include the following: i. The American Nurses Association (ANA) has a longstanding policy supporting immu - nizations for nurses and all people across the life span. ANA believes that nurses have a professional and ethical obligation to be immunized because it protects both the health of the nurse and the health of his/ her patients and community.8 ii. The National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) urges health-care employers and local health departments to require influenza vaccina - tion for all staff members as a condition of employment.9 iii. The American Pharmacists Association rec - ommends that its members be up-to-date on immunizations as a professional standard.10 iv. The American Medical Association's policy supports the vaccination of health-care pro - fessionals against communicable diseases to prevent transmission to their patients.11 v. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that all health-care workers be fully immunized according to ACIP recommendations.12 vi. The American Academy of Physicians Assistants recommends that physician assis - tants (PAs) should be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases for which health providers are at high risk. Doing so not only protects PAs, but also protects patients by preventing provider-to-patient transmission.13 vii. The American College of Physicians rec - ommends that all health-care providers be College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that College Fellows have an ethical obligation to follow recommendations for vaccination themselves and other safety policies put into place by their local or national public health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACOG.15 e. Implement systems to: i. Incorporate vaccination assessment into routine care for outpatients. ii. Identify patients for needed vaccines based on age, risk factor indications for vaccina - tion, and prior vaccination history. iii. Incorporate vaccination assessment and appropriate vaccination of hospitalized patients and those in long-term care facili - ties with recommended vaccines, especially influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. iv. Ensure follow-up for needed vaccinations after hospital discharge. f. Educate patients about vaccines they need using understandable language, including the vaccine information statements for those vaccines covered by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.120 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129g. For providers in states that include adult immu - nization records in their state IIS or registry, understand how to access the IIS as a source to check for vaccines that a patient has already received or should have received. Checking the IIS at each patient encounter reduces the likeli - hood of unnecessary vaccinations and provides information about receipt of other vaccines and whether the patient has appropriately completed the vaccination series as recommended. 2. Standards for non-immunizing providers Because data show that ( 1) patients are more likely to get vaccinated when vaccines are recommended by trusted health-care professionals and ( 2) vaccine uptake is higher when vaccine is provided at the same time, primary care providers are strongly urged to stock and provide all recommended adult vaccines. Providers whose facilities are unable to provide certain immunizations (e.g., medical specialists' offices, which do not routinely provide vaccines for adults) still have a significant role in ensuring that their patients receive needed vaccines. Non-vaccinating providers should: a. Routinely assess whether their patients are up- to-date on recommended vaccinations, strongly recommend said vaccines, and refer patients to vaccine providers for needed vaccines. b. Establish patient referral relationships with vac - cine providers in their area. i. Ensure that referral location does not create other barriers for the patient. 1. Ensure that the vaccine provider offers the recommended vaccines, and that the provider is eligible for payment by patient's insurer to minimize out-of- pocket costs for the patient and any delay in vaccination. 2. Provide information to the patient dur - ing the visit about which vaccines are needed, including a prescription when necessary and the contact information for the vaccination referral location. ii. Ensure appropriate follow-up of vaccine receipt by the patient at the patient's next visit, and encourage the vaccine provider to document vaccination (e.g., in the IIS and/or the patient's medical record) and with the patient's primary care provider, if known.3. Standards for immunizing providers All providers who have a role as a primary source of health care for patients should stock all ACIP-recom - mended vaccines for adults. Standards for all providers who immunize adults include ensuring professional competencies in knowledge of vaccine recommenda - tions, vaccine needs assessment, vaccine administra - tion, vaccine storage and handling, documentation of vaccination, and communicating information about vaccination to the patient's medical home. a. Observe professional competencies regard - ing immunizations by ensuring that vaccine providers: i. Are up-to-date on current ACIP vaccine recommendations, appropriate vaccine administration techniques, and vaccine storage and handling guidelines. ii. Have up-to-date, culturally competent materials for patient counseling about the benefits and risks of vaccinations. iii. Are knowledgeable regarding valid contra - indications, adverse events, and reporting of adverse events. iv . Use correct vaccine administration techniques. v. Are knowledgeable about which vaccines may be administered at the same visit to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination. vi. Have systems in place and training for appropriate response to adverse event(s) that may occur after vaccination, including severe allergic reactions. vii. Have staff who are educated in appropriate vaccine storage and handling systems and vaccine monitoring in their practice. b. Assess and strongly recommend vaccinations dur - ing every patient care and counseling encounter. i. Written vaccination assessment protocols are available and implemented after appro - priate staff training. ii. Protocols or standing orders are used (when appropriate for the setting and patient type) to administer routinely recommended vac - cines, and protocols are kept up-to-date. iii. Staff competencies in vaccine needs assess - ment, counseling, and vaccine administra - tion as part of standing orders or protocols are periodically assessed. iv. Reminder recall systems are in place to remind providers and patients about NVAC Update on Standards for Adult Immunization Practice 121 Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129needed vaccines and to ensure that vaccine series are completed to optimize vaccination benefits. c. Ensure receipt of vaccination is documented. i. Record receipt of vaccination in the patient's EHR. ii. Provide a record of vaccines administered to patients, either written or electronic. iii. Use the IIS to record administered vaccines in states that allow adult vaccination infor - mation to be entered into the registry. iv. If the vaccinator is not the patient's primary care provider, then communicate vaccine receipt with the patient's primary care provider, if known. 4. Standards for professional health-care-related organizations, associations, and health-care systems Standards with respect to immunizations include: a. Integrate educational information on immuniza - tions into professional training, including training of students in undergraduate and postgraduate training programs. This training includes support for incorporating modules on immunization into medical, nursing, and pharmacy schools, as well as allied health profession curricula. b. Provide resources and assistance for providers to implement protocols or standing orders, where feasible, and other systems changes to improve routine assessment of vaccine needs and vaccination. c. Encourage their members, trainees, and students to ensure that their own vaccinations are up-to- date as a standard of the profession. d. Assist their members, employees, trainees, and students in remaining current regarding ACIP immunization recommendations by providing updates through routine communications and continuing education. e. Make educational materials for patients regard - ing vaccine recommendations available to their memberships. f. Partner with community organizations, such as immunization coalitions or vaccine advocacy groups, to improve public awareness of adult immunizations. g. Participate in collaboration opportunities with other members of the immunization community (including public health, public and private medical, nursing and pharmacy services provid -ers, patient advocacy, health systems, and other entities). h. Offer modules to help providers assess and improve adult vaccination coverage of their patients as a measure of quality improvement within clinical practices. i. Provide resources to assist providers in imple - menting and operationalizing immunization services within their practices, including helping providers understand the payment for vaccines based on insurance type and benefit design (e.g., private insurance, Medicare Part B, or Medicare Part D). j. Provide resources (i.e., forms and other tools) for collecting and sharing best practices among adult immunization stakeholders. k. Advocate public policies that support these adult immunization standards. l. Insurers/payers/entities that cover adult immuni - zation services should ensure that their networks are adequate to provide timely immunization access and augment with additional vaccine providers, if necessary (e.g., public health depart - ments, pharmacists, and worksites). 5. Standards for public health departments Public health departments may provide vaccination services and, in that role, public health professionals should adhere to the standards of their profession. Additionally, the professional associations that rep - resent public health professionals and public health departments (e.g., Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, NACCHO, Association of Immuniza - tion Managers, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists) should promote adherence to the standards of the public health profession, particularly as they relate to adult immunizations. Public health has additional roles in assessing immunization program needs and the impact of vaccination programs, includ - ing educating the public and providers about immuni - zations. These additional roles include the following: a. Determine community needs and capacity for adult immunization administration and barriers for patient access. i. Work toward decreasing disparities in immunization access based on factors such as race/ethnicity, insurance status, poverty, and location (e.g., rural areas or medically underserved areas). b. Develop policies and/or regulations (legislation) that promote high vaccination rates and reduce 122 Reports and Recommendations Public Health Reports / March-April 2014 / Volume 129immunization barriers for adult patients and their providers. c. Immunization programs should collaborate with existing public health programs that provide clini - cal services, such as sexually transmitted disease control programs, substance abuse treatment ser - vices, and tuberculosis control programs to incor - porate vaccine administration and recordkeeping. d. Ensure professional competency by providing or supporting education to adult health-care provid - ers on routine adult immunizations. e. Maintain surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases to recognize potential disease outbreaks or problems with vaccines and to assist in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the event of outbreaks. f. Collect, analyze, and disseminate available data on vaccine coverage to the public and health-care providers in their jurisdiction to identify and address gaps in coverage. g. Provide resources and assistance for vaccine providers to implement protocols or standing orders, where feasible, and other systems changes to improve routine assessment of vaccine needs and vaccination. h. Provide best practice examples to health-care providers and collaborate with providers in implementing these best practices. i. Provide subject-matter expertise to train and edu- cate vaccine providers and their staff on vaccine recommendations, proper storage and handling, and proper vaccine administration. j. Collaborate with providers to assist in implement - ing and operationalizing immunization services within their practices. k. Partner with professional medical, pharmacy, nursing, and other provider organizations; health- care networks; community organizations; and advocacy groups (e.g., mental health services, dia - betes educators, asthma educators, correctional facilities, and substance abuse providers) to: i. Increase awareness and knowledge of adult immunizations and methods to reach rec - ommended target populations for immuni - zation; and ii. Educate their members and trainees regard - ing immunizations. l. Provide outreach and education to the public and providers about vaccines. i. Collaborate with professional medical, pharmacy, nursing, and other provider organizations; health-care networks; com - munity organizations; business and civic groups; and advocacy groups (e.g., mental health services, diabetes educators, asthma educators, correctional facilities, and sub - stance abuse providers) to: 1. Increase public awareness and knowl - edge of adult immunizations and reach recommended target populations for immunization. 2. Provide culturally competent public education through appropriate venues, including the use of social media and ethnic media. m. Work toward including adults in all state IISs, reduce barriers to including adult vaccination records in IISs, and ensure that IISs meet new standards of EHR interoperability to track and maintain adult vaccination records. n. Expand access to and provide training for IISs to all adult health-care providers. o. Provide access to all ACIP-recommended vaccinations. i. Ensure capacity to provide all ACIP-recom - mended vaccines and immunization services for insured and uninsured adults. ii. Work toward becoming an in-network pro - vider for immunization services for insured adults. p. Ensure preparedness for, and investigate and work to control, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases when they occur. Managing these out - breaks should include activities such as creating, maintaining, and practicing emergency prepared - ness plans for vaccine responses to outbreaks such as pandemic influenza. q. Demonstrate accountability and good stewardship of public financing for vaccines. r. Communicate information about vaccine short - ages, when they occur, to providers and the public. s.

NVAC recommends that the Assistant Secretary for Health promote the use of these updated Standards for Adult Immunization Practices by all health-care professionals and health-care systems in the public and private sectors who provide and pay for care for adults. NVAC firmly advocates that all providers follow these Standards and believes that these Standards will be useful to inform immunization practice and immunization policy development. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) voted in favor of this report at the September 10, 2013, NVAC meeting. Initial drafts of this document were developed by a National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit writing commit - tee including Anu Bhatt, Carolyn Bridges, Karen Donoghue, Columba Fernandez, Rebecca Gehring, Hall, and LaDora Woods.

Informed Request Policy - 11/2017 Informed Request Policy 1 INFORMED REQUEST POLICY As providers of immunizations, it is important to f urnish the vaccinee (or the parents/legal guardians of minors) with objective information on vaccine safety and the disease that the vaccine protects against, thereby making them activ e participants in decisions affecting their health or the health of their children. Vaccine In formation Statements (VISs) are standardized to provide objective information about vaccine benefits and adverse events. What are VISs? VISs are developed by the staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and undergo intense scrutiny by panels of experts f or accuracy. Each VIS provides information to properly inform the adult vaccinee o r, in the case of a minor, the child's parent or legal representative about the risks and benefit s of each vaccine. VISs are not meant to replace interactions with health care providers who should attempt to answer questions and address concerns that the vaccinee or the parent/gu ardian may have. VIS use is mandatory! Before a health care provider (public or private) v accinates a child or adult with a dose of any recommended childhood vaccine (DTaP, DT , Td, Tdap, MMR, MMRV, and i nfluenza both Inactivated and Live, Intranasal vaccines), the pro vider is required by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to provide the most curr ent copy of the VIS to either the adult vaccinee or the child's parent/legal guardian. If there is not a single VIS for a combination vaccine (e.g., Hib/hepatitis B), use the VISs for a ll the component vaccines. A VIS is also available for the pneumococcal polysa ccharide vaccine. Its use is not required by the National Childhood Injury Act, but is strong ly encouraged-------and it must be used when giving vaccines purchased through a CDC contra ct (i.e. VFC vaccines). State or local health departments or individual pro viders may place identifiers (such as form numbers) on the VISs but any other changes must be approved by CDC's National Immunization Program. What to do with the VISs: Some of the legal requirements concerning the use o f VISs are as follows: 1) Before a routine vaccine is administered to anyo ne (including adults), you must give the patient or the parent/guardian a copy of the mo st current VIS available for that vaccine. Make sure you give your patient time to r ead the VIS prior to the administration of the vaccine and review the VIS wi th them. 2) Record on your patient's chart which VIS was giv en and the date that it was given. 3) Record on the patient's chart the publication da te of the VIS (a date which appears on the lower right-hand corner of the VIS). How to get VISs: VISs are available upon request from the Immunizati on Action Coalition (IAC) and CDC websites.

Informed Request Policy - 11/2017 Informed Request Policy 2 INFORMED REQUEST POLICY Required Documentation : Georgia law requires that vaccines administered to individuals of all ages must be documented in the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS). This legal requirement is referenced in the \"Requir ements of Law\" section of the Immunization Program Manual under the Official Code of Georgia. Written documentation is required in the vaccine recipient's medical record (or in a permanent office file or log) of each immunization and the receipt by vaccine recipients (or their parents or legal representatives) of the appropriate VIS. The documentation shall co nsist of the following: vaccine administration date vaccine manufacturer and lot number name, title, and address of the person administeri ng the vaccine (i.e., address where the medical record will be maintained ) which VIS is given date printed on the appropriate VIS date the VIS was given to the vaccine recipient (o r the parent/legal guardian) date vaccine was given, appropriate notation of th e preparation given and date of administration should be provided on ei ther an existing or newly issued Personal Immunization Record It is recommended that Form 3199/3196, \"After the S hots\", or an equivalent description of common side effects be given to the patient or pare nt/guardian, along with a telephone number that may be called in the case of adverse ev ents. A copy of form 3199/3196 is included in this section of the manual or can be downloaded at http://www.immunize.org/handouts/discussing-vaccine s-parents.asp It is also recommended that each vaccine be recorde d on a client's personal immunization record. Personal Immunization Records may be order ed from the GA Immunization Program utilizing form 3184, the Request for Immunization F orms (see section 1). In addition, GRITS may be utilized to document an immunization record and can print out the clients' immunization history. In Georgia, (in public health clinics) a parent or legal representative must sign an informed consent for vaccinations. VISs are not consent forms. In Georgia, the legal definition of a person authorized to make a request for immunizatio n is very broad. Pertinent excerpts from the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Title 31, Chapter 9, 12/2001 cited as the Georgia Medical Consent Law are reproduced below: Official Code of Georgia, Annotated 2002 31-9-2 (a) In addition to such other persons as may be aut horized and empowered, any one of the following persons is authorized and empowered to co nsent, either orally or otherwise, to any surgical or medical treatment or procedures not prohibited by law which may be suggested, recommended, prescribed, or directed by a duly licensed physician: (1) Any adult, for himself, whether by living will or otherwise (1.1) Any person authorized to give such consent fo r the adult under a health care GA Immunization Program Manual Divisi on Of Public Health 3.

After the Shot s... Your child may need extra love and care after getting vaccinated. Some vaccinations that protect children from serious diseases also can cause discomfort for a while. Here are answers to questions many parents have after their children have been vac\u00ad cinated. If this sheet doesn't answer your questions, call your healthcare provider. Vaccinations may hurt a littl e... but disease can hurt a lot!What to do if your child has discomfort I think my child has a fever. What should I do? Check your child's temperature to find out if there is a fever. An easy way to do this is by taking a temperature in the armpit using an electronic ther - mometer (or by using the method of temperature-taking your healthcare provider recommends). If your child has a temperature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Here are some things you can do to help reduce fever: n Give your child plenty to drink. n Dress your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly. n Give your child a fever- or pain-reducing medicine such as acetamino - phen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin). The dose you give your child should be based on your child's weight and your heathcare provider's instructions. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. Recheck your child's temperature after 1 hour. Call your healthcare provider if you have questions. My child has been fussy since getting vaccinated. What should I do? After vaccination, children may be fussy because of pain or fever. To reduce discomfort, you may want to give your child a medicine such as acetami n- ophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. If your child is fussy for more than 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child's leg or arm is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do? n Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the sore area for comfort. n For pain, give a medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. See the dose chart on page 2. Do not give aspirin. n If the redness or tenderness increases after 24 hours, call your healthcare provider. My child seems really sick. Should I call my healthcare provider? If you are worried at all about how your child looks or feels, call your health - care provider! healthcare provider: please fill in the information below. If your child's temperature is \u00b0F or \u00b0C or higher, or if you have questions, call your healthcare provider. Healthcare provider phone number:[ ]Call your healthcare provider right away if you answer \"yes\" to any of the following questions: Does your child have a temper- ature that your healthcare provider has told you to be concerned about? Is your child pale or limp? Has your child been crying for more than 3 hours and just won't quit? Is your child's body shaking, twitching, or jerking? Is your child very noticeably less active or responsive? Please see page 2 for information on the proper amount of medicine to give your child to reduce pain or fever. s Technical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Saint Paul, Minnesota or children's liquid children's junior age 80 mg in each 0.8 mL 160 mg in each 5 mL ( 1 tsp) chewables strength Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 80 mg in each tab 160 mg in each tab 6-11 lbs (2 .7-5 kg) 0-3 mos Advised dose* 12-17 lbs (5.5- 7.7 kg) 4-11 mos 12 teaspoon or 2.5 mL 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos 34 teaspoon or 3.75 mL 24-35 lbs (10.9- 15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 2 tablets 36-47 lbs (16.4- 21.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 3 tablets 48-59 lbs (2 1.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 4 tablets 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (2 7.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 5 tablets 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32 .7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 6 tablets 3 tablets child's weight child's infants' drops children's liquid children's age 50 mg in each 1.25 mL 100 mg in each 5 mL (1 tsp) chewables Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. 50 mg in each tab 100 mg in each tab less than 11 lbs (5 kg) 0-5 mos 12-17 lbs (5.5- 7.7 kg) 6-11 mos 1.25 mL Advised dose* 18-23 lbs (8.2-10.5 kg) 12-23 mos 1.875 mL Advised dose* 24-35 lbs (10.9- 15.9 kg) 2-3 yrs 1 teaspoon or 5 mL 1 tablet 36-47 lbs (16.4-2 1.4 kg) 4-5 yrs 112 teaspoon or 7.5 mL 112 tablets 48-59 lbs (2 1.8-26.8 kg) 6-8 yrs 2 teaspoons or 10 mL 2 tablets 60-71 lbs (2 7.3-32.3 kg) 9-10 yrs 212 teaspoons or 12.5 mL 212 tablets 72-95 lbs (32.7-43.2 kg) 11 yrs 3 teaspoons or 15 mL 3 tabletsChoose the proper medicine, and measure the dose accurately. 1. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist which medicine is best for your child. 2. Give the dose based on your child's weight. If you don't know your child's weight, give the dose based on your child's age. Do not give more medicine than is recommended. 3. If you have questions about dosage amounts or any other concerns, call your healthcare provider. 4. Always use a proper measuring device. For example: When giving acetaminophen liquid (e.g., Tylenol), use the device enclosed in the package. If you misplace the device, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice. Kitchen spoons are not accurate measures. When giving ibuprofen liquid (e.g., Advil, Motrin), use the device enclosed in the package. Never use a kitchen spoon! Take these two steps to avoid causing a serious medication overdose in your child. 1. Don't give your child a larger amount of acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin, Advil) than is shown in the table below. Too much of any of these medicines can be extremely dangerous. 2. When you give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen, don't also give them over-the-counter cough or cold medicines. This can cause a medication overdose because cough and cold medicines often contain acetamino- phen or ibuprofen. In fact, to be safe, don't ever give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to your child unless you talk to your child's healthcare provider first. Acetaminophen ( Tylenol or another brand): How much to give? Give every 4 to 6 hours, as needed, no more than 5 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider). Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or another brand): How much to give? Give every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, no more than 4 times in 24 hours (unless directed to do otherwise by your healthcare provider).

In an attempt to reduce the confu - sion over different strengths that have been blamed for past overdoses, some manufacturers are voluntarily offer - ing only the less concentrated version for all children. Until now, liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants has only been available in a stronger concentration that doesn't require giving the infants as much liquid with each dose. But right now both concentrations of liquid acetaminophen are in cir - culation. Before giving the medica - tion, parents and caregivers need to know whether they have the less con - centrated version or the older, more concentrated medication. FDA is con - cerned that infants could be given too much or too little of the medicine if the different concentrations of acet - aminophen are confused. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen\" says Carol Holquist, director of FDA's Division of Medical Error Prevention and Analysis. Here's what the agency wants par - ents and caregivers to do: Read the Drug Facts label on the package very carefully to identify the concentration of the liquid acetaminophen, the correct dosage, and the directions for use. Do not depend on a banner proclaiming that the product is \"new.\" Some medicines with the old concentration also have this headline on their packaging. Use only the dosing device provided with the purchased product in order to correctly measure the right amount of liquid acetaminophen. Consult your pediatrician before giving this medication and make sure you're both talking about the same concentration. Overdosing Has Been a Risk An April 2011 report from FDA's Cen - ter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) found that confusion caused by the different concentrations of liq - uid acetaminophen for infants and children was leading to overdoses that made infants seriously ill, with some dying from liver failure. So to avoid dosing errors, some manufacturers voluntarily changed the liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants from 80 mg per 0.8mL or 80 mg per 1 mL to be the same con - centration as the liquid acetamino - phen marketed for children\u2014160 mg per 5mL. This less concentrated liquid acetaminophen marketed for infants now has new dosing directions and 2 / FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration DECEMBER 2 011 Consumer Health Information www.fda.gov/consumer Find this and other Consumer Updates at www.fda.gov/ ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates Sign up for free e-mail subscriptions at www.fda.gov/ consumer/consumerenews.htmlmay have a new dosing device in the box, such as an oral syringe. But this is a voluntary change and some of the older, stronger concen - trations of acetaminophen marketed for infants are still available and may remain available. \"There is still some on store shelves; there is still some in homes; and there is still some in distribution,\" says Holquist. Why does this pose a danger? If a pediatrician prescribes a 5 mL dose of the less concentrated liq - uid acetaminophen, but the parents administer a 5 mL dose of the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen, the child can receive a potentially fatal overdose during the course of therapy, Holquist explains. Conversely, if a physician pre - scribes a dose based on the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen and the less concentrated medication is used, the child might not receive enough medication to fight a fever, she says. FDA has issued a Drug Safety Communication ( www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DrugSafety/ucm284741.htm ) with more information for consumers about how to avoid confusion and potential dosing errors with the different con - centrations of liquid acetaminophen. What Should You Do? Adding to the confusion is the fact that that the box and the bottle may look much the same for both old and new versions of the medication, Holquist says. Read the Drug Facts label to tell the difference between the two liquid acetaminophen products: Look for the \"Active ingredient\" section of the Drug Facts label usually printed on the back of an over-the-counter medication package. If the package says \"160 mg per 5 mL\" or \"160 mg (in each 5 mL)\", then this is the less concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This medication should come with an oral syringe to help you measure the dose. If the package says \"80 mg per 0.8 mL\" or \"80 mg per 1 mL,\" then this is the more concentrated liquid acetaminophen. This product may come with a dropper. If the dosing instructions provided by your healthcare provider differ from what is on the label, check with a healthcare professional before admin - istering the medication. Do not rely on dosing information provided from other sources such as the Internet, old dosing charts, or family members.It is important to understand that there is no dosing amount specified for children younger than 2 years of age. If you have an infant or child younger than 2 years old, always check with your healthcare provider for dosing instructions. Acetaminophen is marketed for infants under brand names such as Little Fevers Infant Fever/Pain Reliever, Pedia Care Fever Reducer Pain Reliever and Triaminic Infants' Syrup Fever Reducer Pain Reliever. There are also store brands on the shelves. \"Be very careful when you're giving your infant acetaminophen.\" Despu\u00e9s de las vacunas... la Si hijo tiene temperatura su profesional o envuelva manera n Dele a su el ni\u00f1o su No casillero abajo).

GENERAL INFORMATION yVAERS (www.vaers.hhs.gov) is a national vaccine safety monitoring system that collects information about adverse events (possible reactions or problems) that occur during or after administration of vaccines licensed in the United States. yVAERS protects patient identity and keeps patient identifying information confidential. yThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule permits reporting of protected health information to public health authorities including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b)). yVAERS accepts all reports without judging the importance of the adverse event or whether a vaccine caused the adverse event. yAcceptance of a VAERS report by CDC and FDA does not constitute admission that the vaccine or healthcare personnel caused or contributed to the reported event. yThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The VICP is separate from the VAERS program and reporting an event to VAERS does not constitute filing a claim for compensation to the VICP (see www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html ). yKnowingly filing a false VAERS report with the intent to mislead the Department of Health and Human Services is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment. yOther (specify) (specify) yUnknown For arm yLeft arm yArm (side unknown) yNose yMouth Frequently Asked Questions About VAERS (Remove from manual) (Update go to Link https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html ) 1 Vaccine Injury Table Applies Only to Petitions for Compensation Filed under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program on or after March 21, 2017 (a) In accordance with section 312(b) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, title III of Public Law 99 -660, 100 Stat. 3779 (42 U.S.C. 300aa- 1 note) and section 2114(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 300aa -14(c)), the following is a table of vaccines, the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths resulting from the administration of such vaccines, and the time period in which the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths is to occur after vaccine administration for purposes of receiving compensation under the Program.

(1) Any acute complication or sequela, including death, of the illness, disability, injury, or condition listed in paragraph (a) of this section (and defined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section) qualifies as a Table injury under paragraph (a) except when the definition in paragraph (c) requires exclusion. (2) In determining whether or not an injury is a condition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Court shall consider the entire medi cal record. (3) An idiopathic condition that meets the definition of an illness, disability, injury, or condition set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be considered to be a condition set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. (c) Qualifications and aids to interpretation. The following qualifications and aids to interpretation shall apply to, define and describe the scope of, and be read in conjunction with paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section: (1) Anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is an acute, severe, and potentially lethal systemic reaction that occurs as a single discrete event with simultaneous involvement of two or more organ systems. Most cases resolve without sequela. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hour s after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, with stridor and dyspnea. There are no specific pathological findings to confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. (2) Encephalopathy. A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy if an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy occurs within the applicable time period and results in a chronic encephalopathy, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (i) Acute encephalopathy. (A) For children less than 18 months of age who present: (1) Without a seizure, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a significantly decreased level of consciousness that lasts at least 24 hours. (2) Followin g a seizure, an acute encephalopathy is demonstrated by a significantly decreased level of consciousness that lasts at least 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state\u2014from a seizure or a medication. 5 (B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute encephalopathy is one that persists at least 24 hours and is characterized by at least two of the following: (1) A significant change in mental status that is not medication related (such as a confusional state, delirium, or psychosis); (2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and (3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness. (C) The following clinical features in themselves do not demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of consciousness: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual screaming, poor feeding, persistent inconsolable crying, bulging fontanelle, or symptoms of dementia. (D) Seizures in themselves are not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy and in the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy seizures shall not be viewed as the first symptom or manifestation of an acute encephalopathy. (ii) Exclusionary criteria for encephalopathy. Regardless of whether or not the specific cause of the underlying condition, systemic disease, or acute event (including an infectious organism) is known, an encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if it is shown that the encephalopathy was caused by: (A) An underlying condition or systemic disease shown to be unrelated to the vaccine (such as malignancy, structural lesion, psychiatric illness, dementia, genetic disorder, prenatal or perinatal central nervous system (CNS) injury); or (B) An acute event shown to be unrelated to the vaccine such as a head trauma, stroke, transient ischemic attack, complicated migraine, drug use (illicit or prescribed) or an inf ectious disease. (3) Encephalitis. A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered encephalitis if an injury meeting the description below of acute encephalitis occurs within the applicable time period and results in a chronic encephalopathy, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. (i) Acute encephalitis. Encephalitis is indicated by evidence of neurologic dysfunction, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section, plus evidence of an inflammatory process in the brain, as described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. (A) Evidence of neurologic dysfunction consists of either: (1) One of the following neurologic findings referable to the CNS: Focal erve abnormalities; visual defects; abnormal presence of primitive reflexes (such as Babinski's sign or sucking reflex); or cerebellar dysfunction (such as ataxia, dysmetria, or nystagmus); or (2) An acute encephalopathy as set forth in paragraph (c) (2)(i) of this section. (B) Evidence of an inflammatory process in the brain (central nervous system or CNS inflammation) must include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (>5 white blood cells (WBC)/mm 3 in children >2 months of age and adults; >15 WBC/mm 3 in children <2 months of age); or at least two of the following: 6 (1) Fever (temperature 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit); (2) Electroencephalogram findings consistent with encephalitis, such as diffuse or multifocal nonspecific background slowing and periodic discharges; or (3) Neuroimaging findings consistent with encephalitis, which include, but are not limited to brain/spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displaying diffuse or multifocal areas of hyperintense signal on T2- weighted, diffusion -weighted image, or fluid- attenuation inversion recovery sequences. (ii) Exclusionary criteria for encephalitis. Regardless of whether or not the specific cause of the underlying condition, systemic disease, or acute event (including an infectious organism) is known, encephalitis shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if it is shown that the encephalitis was caused by: (A) An underlying malignancy that led to a paraneoplastic encephalitis; (B) An infectious disease associated with encephalitis, including a bacterial, parasitic, fungal or viral illness (such as herpes viruses, adenovirus, enterovirus, West Nile Virus, or human immunodeficiency virus), which may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing; or (C) Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Although early ADEM may have laboratory and clinical characteristics similar to acute encephalitis, findings on MRI are distinct with ADEM displaying evidence of acute demyelination (sc attered, focal, or multifocal areas of inflammation and demyelination within cerebral subcortical and deep cortical white matter; gray matter involvement may also be seen but is a minor component); or (D) Other conditions or abnormalities that would explain the vaccine recipient's symptoms. (4) Intussusception. (i) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, intussusception means the invagination of a segment of intestine into the next segment of intestine, resulting in bowel obstruction, diminishe d arterial blood supply, and blockage of the venous blood flow. This is characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain that may be manifested by anguished crying, irritability, vomiting, abdominal swelling, and/or passing of stools mixed with blood and mucus. (ii) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following shall not be considered to be a Table intussusception: (A) Onset that occurs with or after the third dose of a vaccine containing rotavirus; (B) Onset within 14 days after an infectio us disease associated with intussusception, including viral disease (such as those secondary to non- enteric or enteric adenovirus, or other enteric enteric bacteria (such as Campylobacter jejuni), or enteric parasites (such as Ascaris lumbricoides), which may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing; (C) Onset in a person with a preexisting condition identified as the lead point for intussusception such as intestin al masses and cystic structures (such as polyps, tumors, Meckel's diverticulum, lymphoma, or duplication cysts); (D) Onset in a person with abnormalities of the bowel, including congenital anatomic abnormalities, anatomic changes after abdominal surgery, and other anatomic bowel abnormalities caused by mucosal 7 hemorrhage, trauma, or abnormal intestinal blood vessels (such as Henoch Scholein purpura, hematoma, or hemangioma); or (E) Onset in a person with underlying conditions or systemic diseases associated with intussusception (such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, or Kawasaki disease). (5) Chronic arthritis. Chronic arthritis is defined as persistent joint swelling with at least two additional manifestations of warmth, tenderness, pain with movement, or limited range of motion, lasting for at least 6 months. (i) Chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the 3 years prior to vaccination of arthropathy (joint disease) on the basis of: (A) Medical documentation recorded within 30 days af ter the onset of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between 7 and 42 days after a rubella vaccination; and (B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years after the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6 months following vaccination; and (C) Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus. (ii) The following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic necrotizing vasculitis and vasculopathies and Sjogren's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (whether by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic d isorders, bone and cartilage disorders, and arthritis associated with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's Syndrome, blood disorders, or arthralgia (joint pain), or joint stiffness without swelling. (6) Brachial neuritis. This term is defined as dysfunction limited to the upper extremity nerve plexus (i.e., its trunks, divisions, or cords). A deep, steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of the condition. The pain is typically f ollowed in days or weeks by weakness in the affected upper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits, but is generally a less notable clinical feature. Atrophy of the affected muscles may occur. The neuritis, or plexopathy, may be present on the same side or on the side opposite the injection. It is sometimes bilateral, affecting both upper extremities. A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered brachial neuritis as a Table injury if such recipient manifests all of the following: (i) Pain in the affected arm and shoulder is a presenting symptom and occurs within the specified time-frame; (ii) Weakness; (A) Clinical diagnosis in the absence of nerve conduction and electromyographic studies requires weakness in muscles supplied by more than one peripheral nerve. (B) Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyographic (EMG) studies localizing the injury to the brachial plexus are required before the diagnosis can be made if weakness is limited to muscles supplied by a single peripheral nerve. 8 (iii) Motor, sensory, and reflex findings on physical examination and the results of NCS and EMG studies, if performed, must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction is attributable to the brachial plexus; and (iv) No other condition or abnormality is present that would explain the vaccine recipient's symptoms. (7) Thrombocytopenic purpura. This term is defined by the presence of clinical manifestations, such as petechiae, significant bruising, or spontaneous bleeding, and by a serum platelet count less than 50,000/mm 3 with normal red and white blood cell indices. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with other causes such as hypersplenism, autoimmune disorders (including alloantibodies f rom previous transfusions) hemolytic uremic syndrome. Thrombocytopenic cases of immune (formerly called idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura that are mediated, for example, by viral or fungal infections, toxins or drugs. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections. Viral infections include, for example, those infections secondary to Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and B, human immunodeficiency virus, adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viral infection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not be confirmed by culture or serologic testing. However, if culture or serologic testing is performed, and the viral illness is attributed to the vaccine- strain measles virus, the presumption of causation will remain in effect. Bone marrow examinati on, if performed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal marrow. (8) Vaccine -strain measles viral disease. This term is defined as a measles illness that involves the skin and/or another organ (such as the brai n or lungs). Measles virus must be isolated from the affected organ or histopathologic findings characteristic for the disease must be present. Measles viral strain determination may be performed by methods such as polymerase chain reaction test and vaccine -specific monoclonal antibody. If strain determination reveals wild- type measles virus or another, non- vaccine - strain virus, the disease shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. If strain determination is not done or if the strain cannot be identified, onset of illness in any organ must occur within 12 months after vaccination. (9) Vaccine -strain polio viral infection. This term is defined as a disease caused by poliovirus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should be det ermined to be the vaccine- strain by oligonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not sufficient to establish a tissue specific infection or disease caused by vaccine- strain poliovirus. (10) Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA). SIRVA manifests as shoulder pain and limited range of motion occurring after the administration of a vaccine intended for intramuscular administration in the upper arm. These symptoms are thought to occur as a result of unintended injection of vaccine antigen or trauma from the needle into and around the underlying bursa of the shoulder resulting in an inflammatory reaction. SIRVA is caused by an injury to the musculoskeletal structures of the shoulder ( e.g. tendons, ligaments, bursae, etc.). SIRVA is not a neurological injury and abnormalities on neurological examination or nerve conduction studies (NCS) and/or electromyographic (EMG) studies would not support SIRVA as a diagnosis (even if the condition causing the neurol ogical abnormality is not known). A vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered SIRVA if such recipient manifests all of the following: (i) No history of pain, inflammation or dysfunction of the affected shoulder prior to intramuscular vaccine administration that would explain the alleged signs, symptoms, examination findings, and/or diagnostic studies occurring after vaccine injection; (ii) Pain occurs within the specified time- frame; 9 (iii) Pain and reduced range of motion are limited to the shoulder in which the intramuscular vaccine was administered; and (iv) No other condition or abnormality is present that would explain the patient's symptoms ( e.g. NCS/EMG or clinical evidence o ther vaccine- strain viral disease. Disseminated varicella vaccine- strain viral disease is defined as a varicella illness that involves the skin beyond the dermatome in which the vaccination was given and/or disease caused by vaccine- strain varicella in another organ. For organs other than the skin, the disease must be demonstrated in the involved organ and not just through mildly abnormal laboratory values. If there is involvement of an organ beyond the skin, and no virus was identified in that organ, the involvement of all organs must occur as part of the same, discrete illness. If strain determination reveals wild- type varicella virus or another, non- vaccine- strain virus, the viral disease shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. If strain determination is not done or if the strain cannot be identified, onset of illness in any organ must occur 7- 42 days after vaccination. (12) Varicella vaccine- strain viral reactivation disease. Varicella va ccine -strain viral reactivation disease is defined as the presence of the rash of herpes zoster with or without concurrent disease in an organ other than the skin. Zoster, or shingles, is a painful, unilateral, pruritic rash appearing in one or more sensor y dermatomes. For organs other than the skin, the disease must be demonstrated in the involved organ and not just through mildly abnormal laboratory values. There must be laboratory confirmation that the vaccine- strain of the varicella virus is present in the skin or in any other involved organ, for example by oligonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction. If strain determination reveals wild- type varicella virus or another, non- vaccine -strain virus, the viral disease shall not be considered to be a conditio n set forth in the Table. (13) Vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope (also sometimes called neurocardiogenic syncope) means loss of consciousness (fainting) and postural tone caused by a transient decrease in blood flow to the brain occurring after the admi nistration of an injected vaccine. Vasovagal syncope is usually a benign condition but may result in falling and injury with significant sequela. Vasovagal syncope may be preceded by symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and/or pallor. Vas ovagal syncope may be associated with transient seizure- like activity, but recovery of orientation and consciousness generally occurs simultaneously with vasovagal syncope. Loss of consciousness resulting from the following conditions will not be considere d vasovagal syncope: organic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmias, transient ischemic attacks, hyperventilation, metabolic conditions, neurological conditions, and seizures. Episodes of recurrent syncope occurring after the applicable time period are not considered to be sequela of an episode of syncope meeting the Table requirements. (14) Immunodeficient recipient. Immunodeficient recipient is defined as an individual with an identified defect in the immunological system which impairs the body's ability to f ight infections. The identified defect may be due to an inherited disorder (such as severe combined immunodeficiency resulting in absent T lymphocytes), or an acquired disorder (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome resulting from decreased CD4 cell c ounts). The identified defect must be demonstrated in the medical records, either preceding or postdating vaccination. (15) Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). (i) GBS is an acute monophasic peripheral neuropathy that encompasses a spectrum of four clinicopatho logical subtypes described below. For each subtype of GBS, the interval between the first appearance of symptoms and the nadir of weakness is between 12 hours and 28 days. This is followed in all subtypes by a clinical plateau with stabilization at the nad ir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse. Death may occur without a clinical plateau. Treatment related fluctuations in all subtypes of GBS can occur within 9 weeks of GBS symptom onset and recurrence of symptoms after this tim e-frame would not be consistent with GBS. 10 (ii) The most common subtype in North America and Europe, comprising more than 90 percent of cases, is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), which has the pathologic and electrodiagnostic features of focal demyelination of motor and sensory peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Another subtype called acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is generally seen in other parts of the world and is predominated by axonal damage that primarily affects motor nerv es. AMAN lacks features of demyelination. Another less common subtype of GBS includes acute motor and sensory neuropathy (AMSAN), which is an axonal form of GBS that is similar to AMAN, but also affects the sensory nerves and roots. AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN are typically characterized by symmetric motor flaccid weakness, sensory abnormalities, and/or autonomic dysfunction caused by autoimmune damage to peripheral nerves and nerve roots. The diagnosis of AIDP, AMAN, and AMSAN requires: (A) Bilateral flaccid lim b weakness and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes in weak limbs; (B) A monophasic illness pattern; (C) An interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days; (D) Subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse; however, death may occur without a clinical plateau); and, (E) The absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis. (iii) Fisher Syndrome (FS), also known as Miller Fisher Syndrome, is a subtype of GBS characterized by ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia, and overlap between FS and AIDP may be seen with limb weakness. The diagnosis of FS requires: (A) Bilateral ophthalmoparesis; (B) Bilateral reduce d or absent tendon reflexes; (C) Ataxia; (D) The absence of limb weakness (the presence of limb weakness suggests a diagnosis of AIDP, AMAN, or AMSAN); (E) A monophasic illness pattern; (F) An interval between onset and nadir of weakness between 12 hours and 28 days; (G) Subsequent clinical plateau (the clinical plateau leads to either stabilization at the nadir of symptoms, or subsequent improvement without significant relapse; however, death may occur without a clinical plateau); (H) No alteration in cons ciousness; (I) No corticospinal track signs; and (J) The absence of an identified more likely alternative diagnosis. (iv) Evidence that is supportive, but not required, of a diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS includes electrophysiologic findings consistent w ith GBS or an elevation of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein with 11 a total CSF white blood cell count below 50 cells per microliter. Both CSF and electrophysiologic studies are frequently normal in the first week of illness in otherwise typical cases of G BS. (v) To qualify as any subtype of GBS, there must not be a more likely alternative diagnosis for the weakness. (vi) Exclusionary criteria for the diagnosis of all subtypes of GBS include the ultimate diagnosis of any of the following conditions: chronic immune demyelinating polyradiculopathy myelitis, spinal cord infarct, spinal cord compression, anterior horn cell diseases such as polio or West Nil e virus infection, subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, cauda equina compression, metabolic conditions such as hypermagnesemia or hypophosphatemia, tick paralysis, heavy metal toxicity (such as arsenic, gold, or t hallium), drug- induced neuropathy (such as platinum compounds, neuropathy, dermatomyositis, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia. The above list is not exhaustive. (d) Glossary for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section\u2014(1) Chronic encephalopathy. (i) A chronic encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neurologic status, first manifested during the applicable Table time period as an acute encephalopathy or encephalitis, persists for at least 6 months from the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of significant aggravation of an acute encephalopathy or encephalitis. (ii) Individuals who return to their baseline neurologic state, as confirmed by clinical findings, within less than 6 months from the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of significant aggravation of an acute encephalopathy or encephalitis shall not be presumed to have suffered residual neurologic damage from that event; any subsequent chronic encephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopa thy or encephalitis. (2) Injected refers to the intramuscular, intradermal, or subcutaneous needle administration of a vaccine. (3) Sequela means a condition or event which was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table. (4) Signific antly decreased level of consciousness is indicated by the presence of one or more of the following clinical signs: (i) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli); (ii) Decreased or absent eye c ontact (does not fix gaze upon family members or other individuals); or (iii) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognize familiar people or things). (5) Seizure includes myoclonic, generalized tonic -clonic (grand mal), and sim ple and complex partial seizures, but not absence (petit mal), or pseudo seizures. Jerking movements or staring episodes alone are not necessarily an indication of seizure activity. 12 (e) Coverage provisions. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8) of this section, this section applies only to petitions for compensation under the program filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims on or after February 21, 2017.

Copies are also posted on the Immunization Program web site under the school resources section. The following is a s ummary of policies that relate to the law and rules . For more detailed information, please refer to the copies of the law and rules. I. Georgia Law and DPH Rules A. Georgia Law (Official Code of Georgia, Annotated , Section 20-2-771, Section 49-4-182 and Section 49-4-183) defines the target population for which immunity to specified diseases is required and sets standards for the use of immuniza tion certificates. B. The law also charges the Department of Public He alth (DPH) with responsibility for specifying which immunizations are required and the standards for the same. These are defined in the immunization section (Chapter 511-2- 2) of the Rules of the Department of Public Health. C. The DPH Rules define terms such as \"Immunization ,\" \"Physician,\" and \"Health Authority,\" list the diseases for which immunity is required, and st ate the standards for issuing certificates of immunization based on the current ACIP Recommend ed Childhood Immunization Schedule. D. Standards for the Georgia Department of Public H ealth (DPH) Certificates of Immunization are also defined on the GA DPH Certificate of Immun ization (Form 3231) and the accompanying Policy Guide 3231REQ and Policy Guide 3231INS. E. Georgia law requires immunization of a preschool age child as a condition of receipt of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) bene fits. The implementation of the law is the responsibility of the Department of Human Servi ces (DHS) and it is administered by DHS Division of Family and Children Services. Proof of compliance will be provided on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231). F. Any county school superintendent, school princip al, or a chief operating officer of a school or public or private daycare center or nursery who does not enforce the requirements or any parent or guardian who intentionally does not compl y with the immunization requirements is subject to penalties as outlined in Subsection (h) of the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 20-2-771. G. When persons in charge of child care facilities fail to improve unacceptable levels of compliance with the law, despite repeated requests by public health officials, Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learnin g (DECAL) should be notified. H. Any infant/child who is under the age of four an d is attending child care must be age appropriately immunized with the required vaccines during the time of attendance. This means that the certificate for every child under fo ur years of age must be marked with an expiration date that indicates the date the next im munization is due. Once a child is four years of age or older and has met the entry require ments for school, [kindergarten (5 year)], a copy of the Immunization Certificate which has be en marked as \"Complete for 6th grade\" or \"Complete for 7 th Grade or higher and includes the vaccine administr ation dates, or dates of immunity through disease history or serology, ma y be utilized as documentation for both GA Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Heal th SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 12/2017 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgi a Law 2school and child care facilities. I. Children attending school (kindergarten through twelfth grade, or children ages five through nineteen if grade divisions are not used) or a chil dcare facility must be age appropriately immunized with all the required vaccines at the tim e of first entry into a school or facility in Georgia. \"New entrant\" is defined as any child ent ering a Georgia school or facility for the first time, or entering after having been absent fo r 12 months or 1 school year. This means that if a child is not \"up-to-date\" at the time of entry, he/she may attend school provided the certificate is marked with a current expiration dat e indicating that the child is in the process of receiving the required vaccines and doses. Once all grade level entry requirements have been met, the certificate must be replaced with a c ertificate marked \"Complete for School Entry.\" (DPH Rules Chapter 511-2-2) J. Children, who are entering a school or child car e facility, may be granted a 30 day waiver of the certification requirement for a justified reaso n to accommodate the obtaining of immunization records. If necessary, this waiver ma y be extended from the date of first admittance or first attendance whichever is earlier for up to 90 calendar days for children transferring into the school system from out-of-sta te or entering kindergarten or the school system from out-of-state, provided the parent/guard ian can show documentation from their provider or public health clinic that the child is in the process of receiving the required immunizations. A school or child care facility shou ld maintain a file of those children who have been granted a 30 day waiver, and any extensio n of that waiver and should keep the file current. Children who have not submitted an Im munization Certificate by the end of the 30 day grace period should be excluded from further attendance until the appropriate Immunization Certificate is submitted. II. Immunization Certificates A. Physicians, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants [as authorized by O.C.G.A \u00a7 43-34-23 (b)] and qualified employees of a local h ealth department or the State Immunization Program are responsible for cert ifying that a child has met all the immunization requirements for attendance to school/ day care as stipulated by the DPH rules. This certification is documented by their s ignature. B. Schools and child care facilities are responsibl e for filing and maintaining current certificates. C. A Certificate of Immunization must be on file fo r each child attending any child care facility or school in Georgia, whether public or pr ivate. The certificates must be on site and available for inspection by health officials. D. If a child attends more than one school/facility , a photocopy of the form must be submitted to the second school/facility. GA Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Heal th SUMMARY OF IMMUNIZATION POLICIES RELATIVE TO GEORGIA LAW 5. Requirements of School/Childcare Law - 12/2017 Summary Of Immunization Policies Relative To Georgi a Law 3E. When a provider utilizes computerized versions o f the Immunization Certificate (Form 3231), it is the responsibility of that provider to have these versions approved by the Georgia Immunization Program. The certificates must include all the information that is illustrated on the hard copy of these forms. In ad dition, when the Georgia Immunization Program makes updates to these certificates, it is the responsibility of the provider to update their computerized versions to reflect these changes and have them approved by the state office. F. Certificates should be marked as \"Complete for K through 6th Grade\" with or without an expiration date depending on child's age when certificate is issued or marked as \"Complete for K through 6 th Grade\" and \"Complete for 7th Grade or higher\" once all requirements have been met. G. A certificate marked as \"Complete for 7th Grade or higher\" does not expire. H. A certificate marked with a \"Date of Expiration\" expires on the date indicated. A current certificate must be submitted within 30 days after the expiration date or the child must be excluded from attendance until a current certificat e is submitted. III. Immunization Reports By law, an annual report is required for each facil ity. This report indicates the percentage of adequately immunized children attending that facili ty. A. For child care facilities, district or local hea lth personnel must conduct inventories (audits) at least once per year. Licensed child care facili ties should maintain at least a 100% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with facilities to obtain and maintain this compliance level. The State Immuniza tion Program will provide district health personnel with a listing of all child care f acilities known to Bright from the Start, Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECA L). Completed Child Care Facilities Status Review forms should be submitted to the State Immunization Program according to the time frame assigned to each distri ct. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually validate the results of t he audits. B. For schools, inventories (audits) of immunizatio n records of all kindergarten and seventh grade students must be conducted at least once per year by health departments. Schools should maintain at least a 100% compliance level. Health Districts are responsible for working with schools to obtain and maintain this compliance level. Health Districts may establish their own methodologies for collection of information, utilizing school or other designated personnel, but they are ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the reports. If a hea lth district collaborates with schools or other agencies to conduct the inventory, they ar e responsible for the training of the individuals who perform and complete the forms. The information must be summarized on the Immunization Inventory for Georgia Schools f orm and must be submitted to the State Immunization Program. Inventories must be co mpleted so that reports will be received at the State Program office by the date sp ecified by Program. State Immunization Program Consultants will annually vali date the results of the audits.

Exemptions Exemptions: Georgia Law (Section 20-2-771) provide s for two (2) types of exemptions from immunization requirements. A. Medical: A medical exemption for a vaccine shoul d be completed on the GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) only when there is a ph ysical disability or condition that contraindicates immunization for that vaccine. O.C. G.A. \u00a7 20-2-771 (d) There must be an annual review of the medical exemption and certific ates must be reissued with or without indication of the medical exemption. B. Religious: For a child to be exempt from immuni zations on religious grounds, the parent or legal guardian must furnish the school/facility wit h Affidavit of Religious Objection to Immunization (DPH Form 2208). The affidavit must b e signed by the parent/legal guardian, notarized, dated, and signed by a Notary Public, kept on file in lieu of GA DPH Certificate of Immunization (Form 3231) and does not expire.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Diphtheria Fact Sheet United States, diphtheria is an uncommon inf ection of the upper respiratory tract. Respiratory diphtheria is insidi ous and initial symptoms include a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, malaise, and low-grade fever . The hallmark of respiratory diphtheria is the presence of an exudate that organizes into a tough, grayish-white pseudo-membrane over the tonsils, the pharynx or larynx. The pseudo-membrane is strongly adherent to the underlying tissue, and attempts to dislodge it usually results in bleeding. Inflammation of cervical lymph nodes and surrounding soft-tissue swelling of the n eck result in a \"bull-neck\" appearance and are a sign of moderate to severe disease. The membr ane may progressively extend into the larynx and trachea and cause airway obstruction, wh ich, if left untreated, can be fatal. Absorption of diphtheria toxin from the site of inf ection can cause systemic complications, including damage to the myocardium, nervous system and kidneys . Asymptomatic nasopharyngeal infection (carriage) occurs in the g eneral population despite vaccination. In the United States, severe diphtheria infection has been documented to occur more frequently in American Indian and homeless populations. Areas with Endemic Diphtheria*: REGION COUNTRIES Africa Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Zambia, and other sub-Saharan countries Americas Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecua dor, Haiti, and Paraguay Asia/South Pacific Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Chin a, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua Ne w Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam Middle East Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turke y, and Yemen Eastern Europe Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Geo rgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Taj ikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan *Although diphtheria disease is rare in the United States, it appears that C. diphtheria continues to circulate in areas of the country with previously endemic diphtheria. In 1996, 10 iso lates of C. diptheriae were obtained from persons i n a Native American community in South Dakota. Eight of these isolates were toxigenic. The last case of diphtheria in the U.S. occurred in New York State in 2012. The last case prior to t hat was in 2003 in a traveler returned to Pennsylvania from Haiti. Reservoir: Human carriers are the reservoir for C. diphtheri a and are usually asymptomatic. Mode of Transmission: Transmission is most often person-to-person via re spiratory tract droplets from an infected patient or carrier. Rarel y, transmission may occur from skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of inf ected persons (fomites). Incubation Period: 2 to 5 days (range, 1 - 10 days). Period of Communicability: Transmission may occur as long as virulent bacilli are present in discharges and lesions. The time is variable, but w ithout antibiotics, organisms usually persist 2 weeks or less and seldom more than 4 weeks. Chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 2months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy prompt ly terminates shedding. Chronic carriers are rare but may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Temporal Pattern: In temperate areas, diphtheria most frequently occ urs during winter and spring. Case Classification: Probable: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an uppe r respiratory tract illness with an adherent membrane of the nose, phar ynx, tonsils, or larynx; and absence of laboratory confirmation; and lack of epi demiologic linkage to a laboratory- confirmed case of diphtheria. Confirmed : An upper respiratory tract illness with an adhere nt membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx; and any of the f ollowing: isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheria from the nose or throat; or histopathologic diagno of diphtheria; or epidemiologic a laborator y-confirmed case of diphtheria. An epidemiologically linked case is one in which th e patient has had contact with one or more persons who have or had the disease, and tr ansmission of the agent by the usual modes of transmission is plausible. A case ma y be considered epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case if at least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory confirmed. Carrier: An asymptomatic person with laboratory confirmed C. diphtheria isolated from the nasopharynx. Comment: Cutaneous diphtheria should not be reported. Respir atory disease caused by nontoxigenic C. diphtheria should be reported as diphtheria. All diphtheria is olates, regardless of association with disease, should be sent to the Dip theria Laboratory, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), CDC. Laboratory testing: Diagnostic tests used to confirm infection include isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture and toxigenicity testing. Although no other tests for d iagnosing diphtheria are commercially available, CDC can perform a polymerase chain react ion (PCR) test on clinical specimens to confirm infection with a toxigenic strain. PCR is p articularly useful if nonviable C. diphtheriae organisms are present in clinical speci mens that are obtained from a patient after antibiotic therapy has been initiated. Isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture Isolation of C. diphtheriae by culture is essential for confirming diphtheria. However, even if the patient's culture is negative, isolatio n of C. diphtheriae from close contacts may help confirm the diagnosis of the case. Clinica l specimens for culture should be taken from the nose or nasopharynx, and throat from all persons with suspected diphtheria and their close contacts. If possible, s wabs also should be taken from beneath Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 3the membrane, or a piece of the membrane should be removed. Specimens for culture should be obtained as soon as diphtheria (involving any site) is suspected, even if treatment with antibiotics has already begun. After C. diphtheriae has been isolated toxigenicity testing should be p erformed to determine whether the organisms produce diphtheria toxin. Demonstration of toxin production confirms a case of diphtheria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing Isolation of C.diphtheriae may not always be possible because many patients w ill have received antibiotics before diagnosis of diphtheria is considered. PCR allows for detection of the regulatory gene for toxin producti on and the diphtheria toxin gene on nonviable organisms. Additional clinical specimens (nasophyrangeal and throat swabs, pieces of membrane, biopsy tissue) for PCR testing should be collected when specimens are being collected for culture. NOTE: PCR does not demonstrate production of diphtheria toxin but only detection of the diphtheria toxin gene. A positive PCR test in t he absence of a positive culture does not meet the laboratory criteria for classifying a case as confirmed diphtheria. MALDI-Tof Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of -flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-Tof) is an additional technology that can be used to rap idly identify bacterial species such as C. diphtheriae . The technique requires an isolate in order to ide ntify the protein composition of microbial cells. However, this form of testing only confirms the bacterial species, does not confirm diphtheria toxin producti on, and is not available at the CDC Pertussis and Diphtheria Laboratory. Diagnostic Testing: *Diphtheria culture and PCR testing at the Georgia P ublic Health Laboratory and/or CDC is available by special arrangement only. To receiv e pre-approval and make arrangements for either diphtheria culture or PCR t esting, the District Health office or Georgia Department of Public Health must be contact ed at 404-657-2588 or 1-866-PUB- HLTH after business hours.

For more specific laboratory testing information, p lease see: http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/dip-collect ion.pdf Vaccination: Primary diphtheria immunization with diphtheria-tet anus toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all per sons at least 6 weeks old but less than7 years of age and without a history of contraindicat ions. DTaP is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the infant and childhood vaccination serie s (including completion of the series in children who have received one or more doses of who le-cell DTP). The primary vaccination with DTaP series consists of a three-dose series, a dministered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between the first thr ee doses. The fourth dose (first booster) is Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 5recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adeq uate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years o f schooling. Adolescents 11-18 years of age should receive a sin gle dose of Tdap instead of Td for booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertu ssis if they have completed the recommended childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series. Thereafter, routine booster doses of Td vaccine should be given at 10-year intervals. Adole scents and adults who have never been vaccinated against diphtheria should receive a prim ary series of three doses of Td. The first dose should be administered at least 4 weeks apart, and the third dose 6-12 months after the second dose. For added protection against pertussis , Tdap can substitute for any one dose in the 3-dose primary series. For added protection against pertussis, adults 19 y ears and older should receive a single dose of Tdap (ADACEL\u00ae, BOOSTRIX\u00ae) to replace a single ro utine booster dose of Td, if they received their last dose of Td 10 or more years ear lier and have not previously received a dose of Tdap. Treatment of infected people: Diphtheria antitoxin (of equine origin) should be given when diphtheria is suspected, without waiting for laboratory confirmation . The recommended dosage and route of administration depend on the ex tent and duration of disease. Detailed recommendations can be obtained from the Georgia De partment of Public Health and CDC. Antitoxin is only available for treatment of clinic al cases through CDC. The responsible health- care provider should contact the State Epidemiology Section at (404) 657-2588, or if after hours 1-800 PUB-HLTH, to request antitoxin, obtain author ization for its release and make arrangements for transport. Antimicrobial therapy is also required to eradicate carriage of C. diphtheria, to limit transmission, and to halt further production of diphtheria toxin. However, it is not a substitute for antitoxin in clinical cases of diphtheria . Treatment with erythromycin or penicillin is admi nistered as a 14- day course. Care of Close Contacts: Close contacts of a persons suspected to have respi ratory diphtheria should be identified promptly. CDC's \"Information for Close Contacts\" fo und at http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/downloads/close-conta cts.pdf can be used to identify and interview close contacts. Contact tracing should be gin in the household and can usually be limited to household members and other people with a history of direct, habitual close contact (including kissing or sexual contacts, healthcare w orkers exposed to nasopharyngeal secretions, people sharing utensils or kitchen faci lities, and people taking care of children. For close contacts (regardless of their immunizatio n status) the following measures should be taken: 1. Surveillance for 10 days for evidence of disease ; antitoxin should be given at the first sign(s) of illness. 2. Perform nose and throat cultures for C. diphther ia to identify carriers Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health DIPHTHERIA FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Diphtheria Fact Sheet 63. Oral erythromycin* (40-50 mg/kg/day) for 10 days (maximum 2g/day) or a single IM injection of benzathine penicillin G (600,000 U for children <30 kg and 1.2 million U for children >30 kg and adults). 4. Immunization, as appropriate (complete primary s eries if <3 doses and give booster if last dose >5 years ago). *Persons who cannot be relied upon to complete the oral course of erythromycin or who cannot be kept u nder surveillance should receive benzathine penicillin G and a dose of DTaP or Tdap depending on their age. Treatment of carriers: Close contacts found by culturing to be carriers sh ould have received antibiotics and vaccine as per the recommendations for close contacts above. Those who need to complete the vaccine series should receive follo w-up to ensure completion of the series. Follow-up cultures should be performed as per the C DC recommendations. Investigation: Additional guidelines for investigating a suspecte d case and for managing contacts are published and are referenced below. M anagement of close contacts of suspected cases should include screening for possible respira tory or cutaneous diphtheria, obtaining nasopharyngeal cultures for C. diphtheriae , administering prophylactic antibiotics, treatment and follow-up of carriers, assessing diphtheria vaccina tion status, and administering any necessary vaccinations. Reporting: Report all suspect, probable, and confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the State Epidemiology Section at 404-657- 2588.

Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) Brief Description: An acute infectious disease with onset of any sign or symptom consistent with viral hepatitis, such as fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes ). The disease varies widely in severity ranging from asymptomatic to a mild illness without jaundice lasting one to two we eks in children, to severe debilitating illness and lasting several weeks with prolonged convalescence in adults. Recovery is generally complete and without complication. Reservoir: Humans are the only natural reservoir. Mode of Transmission: The prima ry mode of transmission is by the fecal -oral route. This includes ingestion of fecally contaminated water or ice; raw or undercooked shellfish; fruits, vegetables, and other foods eaten uncooked that may have become contaminated during handling. Contact w ith stool from infected infants and toddlers during diaper changes that is not immediately followed by thorough hand washing is a common means of spread to daycare and household contacts. Waterborne transmission of hepatitis A is more common in places wit h inadequate sewage disposal and water treatment, such as can be found in developing nations. Sexual contact can spread the virus. In rare cases bloodborne transmission occurs. Incubation Period: Average 28 -30 days; Range 15 -50 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice, dark urine or elevated serum aminotransferase levels (ALT >200 IU/L) Laboratory criteria for diagnosis: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti -HAV) positive. Note that a person may remain IgM positive for six months or longer after infection, which makes it difficult to determine the timing of infection in a person who has been asymptomatic. Diagnostic Testing: Serology Outfit 0500 3. Lab s Anti-HAV Anti-HAV 5. Lab: State Immunology (GPHL) 6. Transport requirements: All specimens should be centrifuged and transported as soon as possible. Refrigerate if specimen must be held overnight. In extremely hot weather, transport on ice packs. Specimens >14 days old or hemolyzed will be rejected. Case Classification : Confirmed : A case that m eets the clinical case definition and is laboratory confirmed -or- A case that m eets the clinical case definition and occurs in a person who has an epidemiologic link to a person who has laboratory -confirmed hepatitis A (i.e., daycare, household or sexual contact with an infected person during the 15 -50 days before the onset of symptoms). Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 2 Period of Communicability: Hepatitis A virus is highly infective , requiring only a few virus particles to cause infection. The virus is present in the highest quantity in stool duri ng the latter half of the incubation period (7 -14 days prior to onset of illness). Most cases are not infectious after the first week of jaundice. Vaccine: Three inactivated vaccines are currently available to protect against infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) . Protection begins two to four weeks after the first dose of hepatitis A vaccine. A second dose is considered necessary for long -term protection. Two vaccines, HAVRIX \u00ae and VAQTA \u00ae, are currently licensed for persons 12 months of age and older a nd are available in two formulations based on the recipient's age. The third vaccine, TWINRIX \u00ae, is a hepatitis A and hepatitis B combination vaccine licensed for persons 18 years of age or older. Pre-exposure hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at 12 to 23 months of age, persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate rates of hepatitis A , close contacts of newly arriving international adoptees, persons with chronic l iver disease or clotting factor disorders, men who have sex with men, users of injection and noninjection drugs, persons who work with HAV -infected primates or with HAV in laboratory settings , and any person who wishes to be immune to hepatitis A . Infants 6-11 months of age traveling to countries outside the United States for which protection against hepatitis A is recommended should receive a single dose of hepatitis A vaccine. After they reach 12 months of age, the full 2-dose vaccine series should be adm inistered as recommended. Post-exposure vaccine use is listed below. For more detailed vaccination information, see Hepatitis A Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: No specific therapy for HAV infection is available, other than sup portive care . Hepatitis A is usually self -limiting. Post -exposure Prophylaxis of Contacts: Depending on age of contact, i mmune globulin (IG) or hepatitis A vaccine should be offered after exposure to hepatitis A , if it can be given within 14 days of last exposure to the case as indicated below: Unvaccinated p ersons who live in the same household, or who are intimate and/or sex partners of a diagnosed case Daycare center -associated cases as follows: Unvaccinated c hildren who attend the same room as a diagnosed case Susceptible w orkers who change diapers in a daycare center with a diagnosed case Inmates in the same cell in a detention center Foodhandlers who work with the acute case When a food worker has acute infection, consideration may be given to prophylaxis of patrons if prophylaxis can be given within 14 days of last exposure and the case worked while having diarrhea and/or having questionable hygienic practices, combined with having contact with ready -to-eat foods. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657 -2588 promptly in these instances. For contacts younger than 12 months of age , older than 40 years of age , those who are immunocompromised, and persons with chronic liver disease , give IG as a singl e dose of 0.1 ml per kilogram of body weight within 14 days after exposure to hepatitis A. Immune globulin is NOT recommended for hepatitis A exposure for business, office or school contacts, or household visitors (e.g., neighbors and relatives) who do not meet the above criteria. When Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 3 IG is not readily available, hepatitis A vaccine can be given to contacts older t han 40 years of age. Investigation: Complete the hepatitis case report in SendSS (State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) at https://sendss.state.ga.us to aid in the investigation. Conduct an as sessment of the patient for high -risk activities (food handler, daycare attendee/provider, healthcare provider) and hygienic practices such as hand washing. Determine whether the case worked while experiencing diarrhea. Assess the need for immune globulin (IG) or vaccine as indicated above for contacts of the case patient, and educate case contacts regarding the risk of hepatitis A virus transmission. Investigate the source of the infection. Attention should be paid to sanitation and potential fecal cont amination via food or water. Advise hepatitis A vaccine for international travelers, men who have sex with men, persons with chronic liver disease, and others who will be at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A in the future. Special evaluation is indicated for outbreaks in institutional settings and hepatitis in food handlers. Consult the Epidemiology Section at (404) 657 -2588 promptly in these instances. Reporting: Report acute, laboratory -confirmed cases IMMEDIATELY by phone to the local health department, District Health Office, or the Epidemiology Section at 404 -657-2588. If calling after regular business hours, reports can be made to 1 -866-PUB-HLTH (782 -4584).

Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inflammation) in humans. Prior to 2006, several hundred cases were reported in Georgia each year , with the last large outbreak occurring in 2003 . Who gets hepatitis A? Anyone who has not previously been infected with or vaccinated against hepatitis A can become infected. Certain persons at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A include: Children and employees of child care centers where a child or employee has hepatitis A Persons who share a household or have sexual contact with someone with hepatitis A Travelers to developing countries where hepatitis A is common and where clean water and proper sewage disposal are not readily available; and Residents and staff of institutions for disabled children where a resident or an employee has hepatitis A. How is the hepatitis A virus spread? The hepatitis A virus enters through the mouth, multiplies in t he body and is passed in the feces. The virus is fairly hardy and can be carried on an infected person's hands and spread by direct contact, or by consuming food or drink that has been handled by the individual. In some cases, consuming untreated or inade quately treated water contaminated with improperly treated sewage can spread it. Eating raw or undercooked shellfish (e.g., mussels, oysters, and clams ) is another way one can become infected. What are the symptoms of hepatitis A? Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS A FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis A Fact Sheet 5 In outbreak settings, three of every four persons infected with hepatitis A virus have symptoms. When the symptoms are present, they usually develop suddenly and may include fatigue, poor appetite, fever and vomiting. Urine may become darker in color, and then jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. The disease is rarely fatal and most people recover in a few weeks without any complications. Infants and young children tend to be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and are less likely to develop jaundice than are older children and adults. Not everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms, but adults are more likely to have symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms usually begin to appear three to four weeks after exposure, but the onset of symptoms may range from two to seven weeks after exposure. When and for how long is an infected person able to spread the virus? The contagious period begins one to two weeks before the symptoms appear and may extend up to a week after illness or jaundice (a yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes) begins. Does past infection with hepatitis A make a person immune? Yes. Once an individual recovers from hepatitis A, h e or she is immune for life and does not continue to carry the virus. Additionally, vaccination against hepatitis A is thought to provide lifelong protection against infection. What is the treatment for hepatitis A? There are no special medicines to trea t a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest is all that is needed. Occasionally an ill person with severe vomiting and/or diarrhea is hospitalized for rehydration. How can hepatitis A be prevented? An important way to prevent spread of hep atitis A is careful handwashing after using the toilet. Infected people should not handle foods served to others during the contagious period. Household members or others who have not been immunized, but are in close contact with an infected person, shoul d promptly call a doctor or the health department to determine whether a shot of immune globulin or hepatitis A vaccine can decrease their chance s of becoming ill. There are three effective vaccines that protect against infection with hepatitis A virus. Persons in higher risk groups (e.g. travelers to developing countries) may wish to consider being vaccinated. All children should be vaccinated at 12 months of age. Adults ages 18 years and older who are susceptible to both hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the combination vaccine, Twinrix\u00ae. Please contact the Georgia Immunization Program at (404) 657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations. Where can I get additional information on hepatitis A? Contact the Georgia Department of Public Health, Epidemiology Section at 404-657-2588 .

Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Brief Description: Exposure to HBV may result in transient or chronic infections, either of which can be asymptomatic. Hepatitis B ca n present as an acute infectious disease with fever, malaise, loss of appetite, vague abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, sometimes arthralgia and rash, often progressing to jaundice. Liver enzyme levels are markedly elevated. Fever may be absent or mild. Sever ity ranges from asymptomatic cases detectable only by liver enzyme tests, to fatal cases of acute hepatic necrosis. The likelihood of developing a chronic HBV infection is affected by age at time of infection. Fewer than 5% of acutely infected adults in the U.S. develop chronic infection after the acute phase , compared with 25% (with HBeAg -negative mothers) to 90% (HBeAg -positive mothers) of perinatally infected infants. Chronically infected person s are at increased risk for developing cirrhosis and/or primary hepatocellular carcinoma , leading to end -stage liver disease later in life. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: HBV is usually transmitted by contact with the blood, semen, or vaginal secretions of an infected person. HBV may also be found in saliva and other body fluids. The virus must be introduced through broken skin or come into contact with mucous membranes for infection to occur. In addition, percutaneous transmission of HBV c an occur through blood or blood product transfusion, needle sharing, hemodialysis, acupuncture, tattooing, and needlesticks. Indirect inoculation of HBV can also occur via inanimate objects , as the virus can remain viable outside the body for at least 7 d ays. Incubation Period: Varies from 45 -180 days - usually between 60 and 90 days. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness with: Discrete onset of symptoms, and Jaundice or elevated serum levels (ALT >200 Documented seroco nversion (negative to positive HBsAg) in the previous 12 months .

Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 3 Case Classification Confirmed: A case that meets the clinical case definition is laboratory confirmed , and is not known to have chronic hepatitis B . Persons who have chronic hepatitis or persons identified as HBsAg positive should not be reported as having acute viral hepatitis unless they have evidence of an acute illness compatible with viral hepatitis or documented seroconversion. Comment: Also reportable (in addition to acute hepatitis B) : (1) all newly identified HBsAg - positive infections , (2) all HBsAg -positive pregnant women. Period of Communicability: All persons who are HBsAg positive are potentially infectious. Blood can be infective many weeks before the first onset of symptoms and remain infective through the acute clinical course of the disease. For chronically infected people, the infectivity varies from highly infectious (HBeAg positive) to potentially infectious (anti -HBe posit ive). Vaccination: Three vaccines are currently available to protect against infection with HBV. Two vaccines, E NGERIX -B\u00ae and RECOMBIVAX HB \u00ae, are currently licensed for persons of all ages, beginning at birth. The third vaccine, TWINRIX \u00ae, is a hepatitis A and hepatitis B combination vaccine licensed for adults 18 years of age or older. Vaccination is recommended for all infants as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. The series is comprised of 3 doses at 0, 1-2, and 6 -18 months. (Monovalen t HepB vaccine should be used for doses given before age 6 weeks.) Dose one : within 2 4 hours of birth for medically stable infants weighing >2,000 grams (for infants <2,000 grams, administer 1 dose at chronological age 1 month or hospital discharge). Dose two : between 1 month and 4 months ( minimum 4 weeks after 1st dose) Dose three : between 6 months and 18 months ( minimum 16 weeks after 1st dose, and 8 weeks after 2nd dose, but no earlier than 24 weeks of age). For more detailed vaccination informatio n, see Hepatitis B Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. All children should be vaccinated by 11 -12 years of age. Risk of hepatitis B infection increases in the adolescent years, so catch -up vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents and young adults, especially in certain sub -populations, such as Alaska Natives , Asian and Pacific Islanders, and immigrants from countries with high HBV prevalence . In addition, the following categories of high -risk adults should be immunized: 1. Heterosex uals with >1 sex partner in the last 6 months, or who have a sexually transmitted disease 2. Men who have sex with men (MSM) 3. Household contacts and sex partners of HBsAg -positive people 4. Injection drug users (IDU) 5. Healthcare personnel, and others with occup ational risk of infection through exposure to blood (including but not limited to public safety workers, trainees in medicine, dentistry, nursing, and laboratory technology) 6. Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons. 7. Staff of n on-residential child care and school programs attending to HBsAg -positive developmentally disabled children . 8. Hemodialysis patients 9. Patients with bleeding disorder s. 10. Household members of adoptees who are HBsAg positive 11. International travelers to areas with high or intermediate rates of HBV infection Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 4 12. Inmates of juvenile detention centers or long -term correctional facilities 13. Persons with HIV infection 14. Persons with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state -supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Although recommended in infancy, the vaccine series can be given at any time. A lapse in immunization does not require restarting the series. Studies have demonstrated vaccine efficacy with one -year intervals between doses. Vaccine should be given intramuscularly. The deltoid (arm) is recommended for persons >18 months old, and anterolateral thigh for infants and children 18 months or younger . Administrati on in the buttocks or by the intradermal route is not recommended at any age. Treatment: No specific therapy for acute HBV infection is available , other than supportive care . Several drugs are licensed for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in the USA. Post -exposure Prophylaxis: Passive immunization with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine are both used to prevent infection . To be effective, HBIG must be given as soon as possible after exposure (within 7 days after blood exposure and 14 days after sexual exposure) . HBIG is available commercially and may be provided by the Georgia Immunization Program under certain specific cond itions. (See Chapter 2 for table entitled, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the GA Immunization Program for Children, Adolescents, and Adults.\") Consult with the Hepatitis Program in the Epidemiology Section to verify whether HBIG is warrante d. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in the following situations: 1. Perinatal exposure to HBsAg -positive mother 2. Percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood 3. Sexual exposure to a HBsAg -positive individual 4. Known exposure to an acute hepatitis B case Investigation: Collect information about possible exposures, including high -risk behavior during the period 45 -180 days before the onset of illness. Particular emphasis should be placed on 60 -90 days before symptom onset. Investigators should id entify contacts that could benefit from hepatitis B vaccination or HBIG. Special attention should be paid to the presence of hepatitis B among women of childbearing age, since post -exposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG soon after birth is 90-95% effective in preventing infection in the infant with attendant likelihood of chronic disease (see Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines section for complete details). Follow -up: All new cases of hepatitis B should be re -tested for HBsAg aft er six months to determine whether infection has cleared or a chronic infection is present . Those persons still HBsAg -positive are considered confirmed chronic carriers and should be counseled accordingly and referred for maintenance care . Refer to the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines for detailed follow -up recommendations of HBsAg -positive women, their infants, and sexual and household contacts. Reporting: Report all cases of acute hepatitis B, newly identified HBsAg -positive carriers, and HBsAg -positive pregnant women WITHIN SEVEN DAYS electronically through the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System ( SendSS ) at Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6.

Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by a specific virus. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of several viruses known to cause hepatitis (liver inflammation) in humans. HBV is completely unrelated to the viruses that cause hepatitis A, C, or other non -A, non-B, non-C hepatitis. The HBV may cause mild illness or result in no symptoms, but can also cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. Who gets hepatitis B? All people, regardless of age or residence , may be at risk for hepatitis B. Those at greatest risk include: Healthcare and public safety workers with risk for contact with blood and blood - contaminated body fluids Current or recent inject ion drug users (IDU) Men who have sex with men (MSM) Sexually active persons not in a long -term, mutually monogamous relationship (more than one partner in past 6 months) Patients seeking evaluation or treatment for STDs Sex partners and household contacts of people infected with HBV Residents and staff of facilities for the developmentally disabled Persons with HIV infection Persons with end -stage renal disease Persons with diabetes mellitus Infants born to mothers who ar e infected with HBV Children of individuals born in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Amazon Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, and the Middle East International travelers to endemic regions Persons who have spent time in correctional facilities If you are at risk for HBV infection, ask your health care provider about hepatitis B vaccine. How is hepatitis B virus spread? Hepatitis B virus can be found in the blood , semen and, to a lesser extent, saliva and other body fluids of an infected person. It is spread by direct contact with infected body fluids, usually by Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 3/2018 Hepatitis B Fact Sheet 7 needlestick injury or sexual contact. The virus can also be transmitted from mother to baby at birth. HBV is not spread by casual contact. What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? The symptoms of hepatitis B include fatigue, poor appetite, fever, vomiting, and occasionally joint pain, hives or rash. Urine may become darker in color, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) may appear. Some individuals may experi ence few or no symptoms. How soon do symptoms appear? The symptoms may appear two to six months after exposure, but usually within three months. When and for how long is a person able to spread the virus? The virus can be found in blood and other body fluids several weeks before symptoms appear, and it generally persists for several months afterwards. Some people with HBV infection may become long -term carriers of the virus, and may be able to spread the v irus over many years. What is the hepatitis B carrier state? Some persons infected with HBV never fully recover and carry the virus for the rest of their lives. These persons have chronic infection and are sometimes referred to as carriers. They can infect other household and sexual contacts throughout their lives. Among adolescents and adults who get hepatitis B, 5 %-10% develop a lifelong infection. When young children are infected , the risk of lifelong infection is much higher (up to 90%) . An estimated one million people have lifelong hepatitis B virus infections in the United States today. Why is hepatitis B a problem for pregnant women and their babies? Pregnant women may have HBV in their blood without knowing it and can pass it on t o their babies at birth, if their infants are not vaccinated at birth. If unvaccinated, m any of these babies develop lifelong HBV infections and can pass the virus on to others throughout their lives. At first, babies may not look or feel sick, but as th ey grow up, they may have liver damage. About 25% of babies who develop lifelong HBV infections die prematurely of liver disease or liver cancer. What is the treatment for acute hepatitis B infection ? There are no special medicines that can be used to t reat a person once the symptoms appear. Generally, bed rest as needed is recommended for acute hepatitis B infection. What precautions should hepatitis B chronic carriers take? Hepatitis B carriers should follow standard hygienic practices to ensure that their blood and other body fluids do not directly contaminate close contacts. Carriers must not share razors, toothbrushes, glucose monitors, insulin needles, or any other object that may become contaminated with blood. Susceptible household members, pa rticularly sex partners, should be immunized with hepatitis B vaccine. It is important for carriers to inform their dentist s and health care providers. Medications are available to treat persons with chronic hepatitis B, but they don't work for everyone. Persons with c hronic HBV infection should be monitor ed and referred to a specialist for management of the disease, if indicated. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Preventing hepatitis B is important because of the risk of lifelong infection leading to s erious liver problems. A vaccine has been used since 1982 to prevent hepatitis B. The vaccine is usually given in a series of three shots. Hepatitis B vaccine is safe, effective , and is recommended for All babies, beginning at birth Everyone 18 years of age and younger Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health HEPATITIS B FACT SHEET 6.

Surveillance and Reporting - 03/2017 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Haemophilus influenzae is a bacterium often found in the upper respirator y tract of humans. H. influenzae is divided into several strains based on the prese nce of a polysaccharide capsule virulence factor. Encapsula ted strains are considered \"typeable\" (types A, B, C, D, E, and F), while non-encapsulated strai ns are non-typeable. Brief Description: H. influenzae causes a variety of illnesses. Typeable strains, especially type B (\"Hib\") and type F, have been commonly associated with invasive disease, including meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, septic arthrit is, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, pericarditis, and Historically, type B was a common, dev astating pathogen, especially in children; however, since the widespread use in the U.S. of co njugate vaccines against Hib, cases caused by Hib have decreased drastically. Non-typeable H. influenzae is occasionally associated with otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, aggravation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neonatal and maternal sepsis, and bacterem ia. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Spread occurs through airborne droplets or by dire ct contact with infectious secretions. Between 30% and 80% of peop le are carriers of non-typeable H. influenzae , while approximately 2% are carriers of types A, C , D, E, and F and less than 1% carry type B (in a vaccinated population). Illness may occur in carriers when host immunity is compromised for some reason. Incubation Period: Unknown, possibly 2-4 days. Period of Communicability: As long as organisms are present, which may be for a prolonged period even without nasal discharge. Cases are con sidered non-infectious 24-48 hours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Temporal Pattern: Several studies in the prevaccine era described a bimodal seasonal pattern in the United States, with one peak during Septembe r through December and a second peak during March through May. Case Classification: Probable : Meningitis WITH detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b antigen in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Confirmed : Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae from a normally sterile body site (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], blood, joint flui d, pleural OR Detection of Haemophilus influenzae -specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g., cerebrospi nal fluid [CSF], blood, joint fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid), using a validate d polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INVASIVE DISEASE FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 03/2017 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 2Comment : Positive antigen detection test results from urin e or serum samples are unreliable for diagnosis of H. influenza disease. Laboratory Testing: Isolation of H. influenzae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid or, less commonly, joint, pleur al, or pericardial fluid); or detection of Haemophilus influenzae -specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood or CSF), using a validated p olymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay; or . Detection of Haemophilus type in cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Diagnostic Testing: 1. Specimen: Blood, CSF, or other sterile site for culture; pure specimen for serotyping. 2. Outfits: Sterile vial for isolation and identifi cation; culture referral order #0505 for serotyping. 3. Lab Form: Form 3583. 4. Lab Performed: Bacterial isolation and iden tification; H. influenzae serotyping. 5. Lab Performing Test: Isolation and identificatio n is usually performed at hospital or private labs; serotyping is performed at the GPHL B acteriology Section in Decatur. Vaccination: A conjugate vaccine for Hib has been licensed for use in the U.S. since the mid- 1980s. Children should get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not requir ed). Children over 5 years of age usually do not need Hib vaccine. Older children or adults wit h sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing c hemotherapy should also receive Hib vaccine. For more detailed vaccination information, see Haemophilus Influenzae Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment : The 2015 Red Book recommends a third-generation c ephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for initial treatment. T he patient should be given rifampin before discharge from the hospital to ensure elimination o f the organism if a regimen other than ceftriaxone or cefotaxime was used to treat illness . Prophylaxis and Follow-Up of Contacts [disease caus ed by type B (Hib) only]: Observe contacts under 4 years old (especially inf ants) for indications of illness and provide prompt medical attention should signs and s ymptoms appear. Rifampin prophylaxis is warranted for all househol d contacts, including adults, in households with: a. One or more infants <12 months of age who has no t received the primary series b. A child 1-3 years of age who is unimmunized or i ncompletely immunized c. An immunocompromised child. When two or more cases of invasive disease have oc curred within 60 days at a day care facility or school which un-immunized or under -immunized children attend, administration of rifampin to all attendees and sup ervisory personnel is controversial. Efforts should be made to ensure that all day care attendees under 5 years of age are fully vaccinated. Dosage of rifampin for prophylaxis: a. Age <1 month: 10 mg/kg once daily for 4 days; b. Age 1 month: 20 mg/kg once daily for 4 days, maximum da ily dose 600 mg. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INVASIVE DISEASE FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 03/2017 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Disease Fact Sheet 3c. For adults, each dose is 600 mg. d. Rifampin can be administered to infants and chil dren suspended in simple syrup or as a dry powder mixed with applesauce. Investigation: Identification of young children who are close con tacts of cases and assessment of their vaccination status may help identify perso ns who should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis and who need to be immunized. In parti cular, household and day care classroom contacts should be immediately identified. Reporting: Report all confirmed cases of invasive H. influenzae IMMEDIATELY electronically though the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surv eillance System (SENDSS) at http://sendss.state.ga.us .

Surveillance and Reporting - 03/2017 Haemophilus Influenzae Invasive Questions & Answers 5 What is invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease is a serious disease caused by bacteria. Before Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, Hib disease was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among children under 5 years old in the United States. Today invasive disease is less common, and is more often caused by serotypes that are not prevented by the Hib vaccine (types A, C, D, E, F, and non-typeable). Who gets invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Before the introduction of the Hib vaccine, almost all invasive infections were among children under 5 years of age and were caused by serotype B. Two-thirds of cases were among children less than 18 months of age. Due to high vaccinatio n rates, Hib invasive disease is now less common among children, although invasive disease du e to all serotypes continues to occur at low levels in children and adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions. How is Haemophilus influenzae spread? The bacteria spread from person to person via airbo rne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions. If the bacteria stay in th e person's nose and throat, the person probably will not get sick. Sometimes the bacteria spread i nto the lungs or the bloodstream, and then Haemophilus influenzae can cause serious problems. What are the symptoms of invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease can affect different organ systems of the body. The most common types of disease include meningitis (in fection of the brain and spinal cord coverings, which can lead to lasting brain damage a nd deafness); pneumonia; severe swelling in the throat, which makes it difficult to breathe; infections of the blood, joints, bones, and covering of the heart; and death. How soon after contact could illness develop? This is uncertain. The period is probably short, fr om 2-4 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread Haemophilus influenzae ? As long as the bacteria are present, which could be for a prolonged period of time. Within 24-48 hours after beginning treatment with appropriate an tibiotics, a person should no longer be able to spread the infection. How can a person find out if he or she has invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? A doctor may take a sample of blood or spinal fluid from an ill person to conduct laboratory tests. What is the treatment for invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease? Hospitalization is generally necessary. A doctor w ill prescribe antibiotics for treatment. How can invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease be prevented? For type B Haemophilus influenzae , the Hib vaccine can prevent disease. Children sho uld get Hib vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age (if the PRP-OMP vaccine is used, the dose at 6 months is not required). If a dose is missed, the next dose should be given as soon as possible; there is no need to start over. Hib vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Children over 5 years old usually do not need Hib v accine. Older children or adults with sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, removal of the spleen, bone marrow transplant, or undergoing Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE INVASIVE DISEASE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6.

Vaccines have not yet been developed to prevent disease caused by other serotypes of H. influenzae. Other ways to prevent invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease include regular handwashing, good hygiene, and disposal of soiled tissues after use.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 1 Prior to the introduction of vaccine in 1963 measle s was a common childhood illness in the U.S., and most people developed natural immunity before a dulthood. As a result, persons born in the U.S. prior to 1957 are considered to have presumpti ve immunity to measles. Following the adoption of a two dose immunization schedule with M MR vaccine in 1989, measles incidence declined to record low levels, and in 2000 measles was declared no longer endemic in the U.S. Cases of measles continue to occur in the U.S. as a result of importation of the virus from other countries, with occasional secondary spread most of ten among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated persons. Immunity must remain high in a population if an absence of endemic transmission of measles is to be sustained. However , in addition to maintaining high vaccination rates, prompt recognition, reporting, and investiga tion of cases and contacts is essential to halt the spread of imported disease. Agent: Measles virus (paramyxovirus) Brief Description: Measles begins with a prodrome which lasts 2-4 days and is characterized by fever, malaise, cough, coryza (runny nose and wa tery eyes), and conjunctivitis (eye inflammation and redness). Small spots with white or bluish white centers on an erythematous (red) base in the mouth (buccal mucosa or soft pala te) called Koplik spots are specific for measles and may be seen on oral exam between day 2 and 6. A characteristic red, blotchy, palpable (maculopapular) rash appears on the third to the seventh day and typically begins on the face (at the hairline) and spreads over the bod y (may include the palms and soles), becoming generalized, and may coalesce in areas. T he rash lasts 4 to 7 days and is typically not itchy. Complications that may result include di arrhea, otitis media (middle ear infection), pneumonia, and encephalitis (inflammation of the br ain and/or spinal cord). Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Measles is transmitted person to person by respira tory droplets and through direct contact with nasal and throat secret ions or items freshly soiled with these secretions. Airborne transmission via aerosolized d roplet nuclei can also occur in enclosed areas up to two hours after an infected person has occupied the area. Measles is one of the most communicable infectious diseases. Incubation Period: Commonly10 to 12 days from exposure to prodrome (r ange, 7 to 21 days). The rash usually appears approximately 14 days afte r exposure. Period of Communicability: Measles is highly infectious, with greater than 90 % secondary attack rates among persons who are susceptible. Mea sles can be transmitted from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. Temporal Pattern: In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primari ly in late winter or spring. Clinical Case Definition: An acute illness characterized by: generalized, maculopapular rash lasting 3 days; and temperature 101.0 o F (38.3 o C); and Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 2 cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis. Case Classification: Probable: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an illn ess that meets the clinical description with o no epidemiologic linkage to a laboratory-confirmed measles case; and o no measles laboratory testing. Confirmed: An acute febrile rash illness with: o isolation of measles virus from clinical specimen; or o detection of measles virus-specific nucleic acid f rom a clinical specimen using polymerase chain reaction; or o IgG seroconversion or a significant rise in measle s immunoglobulin M antibody; or o direct epidemiologic linkage to a case confirmed b y one of the methods above. *Comment: Two probable cases that are epidemiologi cally linked would be considered confirmed cases, even in the absence of laboratory confirmation. Epidemiologic classification of internationally-imp orted and U.S.-acquired Internationally imported case: An internationally imported case is defined as a case in which measles results from exposure to meas les virus outside the United States as evidenced by at least some of the exposur e period (7-21 days before rash onset) occurring outside the United States and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering the United States and there is no known ex posure to measles in the U.S. during that time. All other cases are considered U.S.-acquired U.S.-acquired case: An U.S.-acquired case is defin ed as a case in which the patient had not been outside the United States during the 2 1 days before rash onset or was known to have been exposed to measles within the Un ited States. Genotype identification by a WHO reference laborato ry (CDC or a public health laboratory that has vali dated their measles virus sequence analysis) is required to dis tinguish wild type from vaccine strain if vaccinate d within 18 days of rash onset. U.S.-acquired cases are sub-classified into four mu tually exclusive groups: o Import-linked case: Any case in a chain of transmission that is epidemiologically linked to an internationally impo rted case. o Imported-virus case: a case for which an epidemiol ogic link to an internationally imported case was not identified, b ut for which viral genetic evidence indicates an imported measles genotype, i. e., a genotype that is not Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 3occurring within the United States in a pattern ind icative of endemic transmission. An endemic genotype is the genotype of any measles virus that occurs in an endemic chain of transmission (i.e., lasting 12 months). Any genotype that is found repeatedly in U.S.-acquired cases should be t horoughly investigated as a potential endemic genotype, especially if the cas es are closely related in time or location. o Endemic case: a case for which epidemiological or virological evidence indicates an endemic chain of transmission. Endemic transmission is defined as a chain of measles virus transmission that is co ntinuous for 12 months within the United States. o Unknown source case: a case for which an epidemiol ogical or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission within th e United States cannot be established after a thorough investigation. These c ases must be carefully assessed epidemiologically to assure that they do n ot represent a sustained U.S.-acquired chain of transmission or an endemic c hain of transmission within the United States. Note: Internationally imported, import-linked, and imported-virus cases are considered collectively to be import-associated cas es. Note: U.S.-acquired cases may be classified further into two mutually exclusive groups: o Out-of-state importation: an out-of-state imported case is defined as a case in which measles resulted from exposure to measles virus outside of the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the ex posure period (at least 7- 21 days before rash onset) occurring outside of Geo rgia and rash onset occurring within 21 days of entering Georgia, and t here is no known exposure to measles in Georgia. . o In-state acquired: an in-state case is defined as a case in which mea sles resulted from exposure to measles virus within the state of Georgia, as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period ( at least 7-21 days before rash onset) occurring in Georgia. Laboratory testing: Laboratory confirmation is essential for all outbre aks and all sporadic measles cases. Diagnostic tests used to confirm infection include isolation o f the measles virus by culture; polymerase chain reaction (PCR); and serologic testing. Detect ion of measles-specific IgM antibody and measles RNA by real-time RT-PCR are the most common methods for confirmation of measles infection. Efforts should be made to obtain a serum sample and throat swab (or nasopharyngeal swab) from suspected cases at first contact. Urine samples may also contain virus and when feasible to do so, collection of both respiratory a nd urine samples can increase the likelihood of Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 4detecting virus. DPH staff is available for consult ation and can assist with confirmatory testing as needed for measles. Because measles is a rare disease in the United Sta tes, even with the excellent laboratory tests available, false positive results for measles IgM w ill occur. To minimize the problem of false positive laboratory results, it is important to res trict case investigation and laboratory tests to patients most likely to have measles (i.e., those w ho meet the clinical case definition, especially if they have risk factors for measles, such as bein g unvaccinated, recent history of travel abroad, without an alternative explanation for symp toms, for example epi-linked to known parvovirus case) or those with fever and generalize d maculopapular rash with strong suspicion of measles. During a measles investigation when community aware ness is increased, many cases of febrile rash illness may be reported as suspected measles, and the magnitude of the situation may be exaggerated if these cases are included in the abse nce of laboratory confirmation. This is particularly important as the investigation is endi ng; at that point, laboratory confirmation should be sought for all suspected cases. Rarely, suspecte d cases may include vaccinated individuals. For these cases, laboratory confirmation may be cha llenging. An overview of diagnostic tools is described below. Virus isolation and measles RNA detection (RT-PCR) Clinical specimens for real-time polymerase chain r eaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation should be collected at the same time as s amples taken for serologic testing. The preferred specimens for virus isolation or RT-P CR are throat or nasopharyngeal swabs, but urine may also contain virus. Virus isol ation and RNA detection are more likely to be successful when the specimens are coll ected early (ideally within three days of rash onset, but up to ten days post rash ma y be successful). Isolation of measles virus in culture or detection of measles RN A by RT-PCR in clinical specimens confirms the diagnosis of measles. Howeve r, a negative culture or negative RT-PCR results do not rule out measles bec ause both methods are much affected by the timing of specimen collection and t he quality and handling of the clinical specimens. Successful isolation of measles virus in culture or direct detection of measles RNA by RT-PCR in the clinical sample is particularly he lpful for case confirmation when serology results are inconclusive Serologic testing The GDPH can provide guidance regarding available l aboratory services. At the direction of the GDPH, health care providers and st ate and local health departments may send serum specimens from suspected measles cas es to the CDC measles laboratory.

Immunity: Acceptable presumptive evidence of measles immunity includes at least one of the following: 1. Written documentation of adequate vaccination: r eceipt of one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool- age children and adults not at high risk, and two d oses of measles-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk for exposure transmission (i.e., health care personnel, international travele rs, and students at post-high school educational institutions); or Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 62. Laboratory evidence of immunity; or 3. Birth before 1957 (for healthcare providers this does not suffice as evidence of immunity) 4. Laboratory confirmation of disease Vaccination: The current recommendation is a two-dose schedule. The first dose should be given at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at four through six years (school entry). Both doses can be given as MMR or MMRV vacc ine. For any child older than six who has not received one or both doses, any opportunity to immunize should be utilized. Travel Recommendations: Children aged 6-11 months who travel international ly should receive one dose of MMR vaccine optimally at least two weeks prior to travel. Because serologic response to the measles component of the vaccine varies among infants aged 6-11 months, children vaccinated before age 12 months sh ould receive two additional doses of MMR or MMRV vaccine on or after the first birthday acco rding to the routine recommended schedule. Children aged 12 months and adults who plan to travel outside the United States should receive two doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at l east 28 days. Other presumptive evidence of immunity includes laboratory evidence, or birth before 1957, or laboratory confirmation of disease. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Measles vaccine is effective in preventing infecti on or modifying the severity of illness if given within 72 hours of exposure. Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modify disease and provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of exposure. Transmission is likely in households, schools, and other institutions. Immune globulin (IG) may be especially indicated for susceptible contacts in these settings, particularly contacts younger than 1 year of age and immunocompromised contacts. Treatment: Supportive care only. Investigation: Measles and rubella must be ruled out whenever illn ess involving fever and rash are reported. The investigation must be started immediately when a potential case is identified. Essential components of the case investigation incl ude the following: a. Obtain a detailed history of illness progression and a rash description b. Obtain a detailed travel history c. Establish a diagnosis by obtaining laboratory sp ecimens for serology, viral isolation and PCR as early as possible (consult with GDPH regarding the case before collecting and submitting specimens) d. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization his tory. e. Identify the source of infection and transmissio n setting. f. Assess potential transmission and identify conta cts. g.

Do not wait for laboratory confirmation to fax the report. Outbreak Control Strategy: All reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated rapidly. Control activities should not be delayed until la boratory results on suspected cases are received. A measles outbreak exists in a community whenever there is one confirmed case of measles. Once this occurs, preventing disseminatio n of measles depends on promptly vaccinating susceptible persons and limiting the nu mber of exposures to infectious cases. All persons who cannot readily provide documentation of measles immunity (see ACIP Statement on Measles Prevention, dated 5/22/98) should be vac cinated or excluded from the setting (e.g. school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination is provided. Persons who have been exempted from measles vaccina tion for medical or religious reasons should be excluded from the outbreak area for at le ast 21 days after the onset of rash in the last case of measles. Institution-based outbreaks During outbreaks in day care centers, elementary, m iddle, junior and senior high schools, colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of mandatory revaccination with MMR vaccine should be conducted in the affected schools. Revaccination should include all students and their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentat ion of receipt of two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of measles immunity. Students and personnel receiving their first dose as part of an outbreak control program may be immediately readmit ted to school. A second dose should be given in 28 days. If there is an unconfi rmed but clinically compatible case in a school, the response should be phased in. Rei mmunization should be recommended but not mandatory until the case is con firmed. Proceed with the epidemiologic work on the case. Search for a sourc e, immunize siblings and close contacts when appropriate, ensure an adequate suppl y of vaccine and begin to prepare for a school-based clinic. At this point, i t is very important to implement daily active surveillance of absenteeism of two or more d ays and any rashes should be followed up on immediately. New cases signal the i mmediate need for school-based clinics and the exclusion of children and staff who do not have two documented doses of measles vaccine. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) FACT SHEET 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Fact Sheet 9 Outbreaks among preschool-age children The risk of complications from measles is high amon g infants less than one (1) year of age. Therefore, considering the benefits and ri sks, vaccination with measles vaccine is recommended for infants as young as six (6) months of age when exposure to measles is considered likely. MMR may be used in children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily available. Infants vaccinated before the first birthday should be reva ccinated when they are 12 months old and at school entry to ensure adequate protecti on. Exposed children less than six months of age should receive measles IG. Individual s who receive MMR vaccine or IG as PEP should be monitored for signs and symptom s consistent with measles for at least one incubation period. Please consult GDPH prior to making post- exposure prophylaxis recommendations. Medical Settings If an outbreak occurs in a healthcare facility, all employees (including volunteers, trainees, nurses, physicians, technicians, receptio nists, and other clerical and support staff) are at an increased risk of exposure to measles, and all persons who work in such facilities in any capacity should be i mmune to measles to prevent any potential outbreak. All employees who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation of receipt of two doses of measles va ccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity to measles s hould receive a dose of measles vaccine. Personnel born before 1957 without docume ntation of measles immunity should receive one dose of MMR. Serologic screening of healthcare workers during an outbreak to determine measles immunity is not re commended, because stopping measles transmission requires the rapid vaccination of susceptible healthcare workers, which can be impeded by the need to screen and wait for results. Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the 5th to the 21st day after the expo sure, regardless of whether they received vaccine or immunoglobulin after the exposu re. Those who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for seven d ays after they develop a rash.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Questions & Answers 12 MEASLES Q&A What is measles? Measles, also known as rubeola, is a highly contagi ous viral infection. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles typically begins with a fever, followed by cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or red, watery eyes. Two or three days after symptoms begin , tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin a ra sh appears. The rash begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and s pread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. The spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the rest of the body. When the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 10 4 oF. After a few days, the fever subsides and the rash fades. Is measles still common in the U.S.? Measles was declared eliminated from the United Sta tes in 2000. This was possible thanks to a highly effective vaccination program and better mea sles control in the Americas. However, measles is still common in many other countries and may be brought into the U.S. by unvaccinated travelers. Keeping U.S. measles immuni zation levels high is critical to preventing measles outbreaks. Who gets measles? People who have never received a measles-mumps-rube lla (MMR) vaccine or who are not up- to-date on their MMR have the highest risk of acqui ring measles. Particularly, children less than 12 months of age, who are not old enough to receive MMR, and immunocompromised persons have an increased risk. What complications are associated with measles? Complications from measles are more common among ch ildren less than 5 yrs. of age and adults 20 yrs. of age and older and are highest in infants, unimmunized pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons. Diarrhea, mid dle ear infection, and pneumonia are the most commonly reported complications. More seve re, but less common complications include inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), s eizures and death. How is measles spread? Measles is spread by air-borne droplets when an inf ected person coughs or sneezes, and through direct contact with respiratory secretions or items freshly soiled with these secretions. Airborne spread can also occur up to two hours afte r an infected person has occupied an enclosed area. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Questions & Answers 13 Can a person who had measles get measles again? No. Permanent immunity is acquired after getting th e disease. How long is a person with measles contagious? A person with measles can spread it to others from four days before their rash appears to four days after it appears. How long can a person have measles? Generally, the fever resolves after 2 to 4 days, an d the rash resolves in 5 to 6 days. The length of recovery depends on whether other com plications are associated with the illness. How is measles treated? There is no specific treatment for measles. Treatme nt for measles is mainly supportive. People with measles need bed rest, fluids, and control of fever. Children with complications need specific treatment and should be under the care of a physician. What tests are available to diagnose measles? A diagnosis of measles should be confirmed through laboratory testing by your physician, and reported to the health department right away. This requires the collection and testing of blood, urine and/or throat samples. Results are most accur ate if testing occurs during the beginning stages of the disease. Is there a vaccine for measles? Yes. The measles vaccination is usually combined wi or mumps, rubella, should receive two doses of MMR vaccine: the first at 12 to 15 months of age and the second at 4 to 6 years of age. (During a me asles outbreak, children may receive the second dose as soon as four weeks after the fir st dose, no matter how old they are.) All adults who have not had measles or a measles s hot should receive MMR vaccine, particularly if they were born in 1957 or later. Certain adults (such as healthcare workers) should receive two doses of measles/MMR vaccine to make sure they're protected. My child has been exposed to measles, what should I do? If you think your child has been exposed to measles contact your doctor immediately. If your child has not been vaccinated, measles vaccine may prevent disease if given within 3 days after exposure. Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modif y disease and provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of exposure in pe rsons who cannot have the vaccine. Is it okay to take my child to public places (i.e. grocery store, daycare, playground)? Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) QUESTIONS & ANSWERS 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Questions & Answers 14 If your child has been diagnosed with measles you s hould keep your child at home and away from public places until the disease has resolved (approximately 4 days after rash onset). All contact with persons who lack measles immunity, ar e immunocompromised, or pregnant should be avoided. Note: Call your physician's offi ce ahead of time to inform them that you are bringing in a child that has possibly been exposed to measles or has measles. This will allow the office to take precautions to assure no other c hildren are exposed. How can measles be prevented? Routine vaccination is the best way to prevent meas les. However, additional steps to prevent the spread of disease may include: Avoiding close contact with others who are coughin g or ill Washing hands often Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or cough and sneeze into your sleeve Stay home if ill Seek medical attention if measles-like symptoms de velop GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MEASLES (RUBEOLA) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Measles Specimen Collection and Submission Guidelin es 15 A case of measles is a public health emergency . Contact public health immediately when the diagnosis of measles is suspected.. A clinical diag nosis of measles is unreliable; suspect cases of measles must be laboratory confirmed. Confirmati on of acute infection can be determined by the presence of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM), a fou r-fold rise (IgG) titer and convalescent phase sp ecimens, a positive PCR, and/or the isolation of measles virus from a throat or urine s pecimen. The Georgia Division of Public Health strongly reco mmends the collection of serum for measles IgM/IgG AND collection of a throat swab and urine specimen to confirm a measles case . To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgi a Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions Serologic Testing: Collect as soon as possible when measles infection is suspected, preferably at the onset of rash. Collect 7-10 ml of blood in a red top or serum sep arator tube (SST) Acute must be centrifuged and the serum transf erred into a transport tube for shipment. Keep specimens cold (4 o C or 39 o F) and ship overnight service. Do not freeze serum samples. Viral Testing: Collect a urine and throat swab at t he same time as serology. Virus is most frequently recovered within the first 3 days follow ing rash onset, but up to 7 days after rash onset is acceptable. If a few days have passed sinc e resolution of the rash collect only a urine specimen. Throat Swabs Use a viral transport kit if possible (such as that used to isolate influenz a or herpes simplex virus) Collect a throat swab by rubbing the posterior oro pharynx with a dry sterile cotton swab Place swab in a tube containing 2-3 mls of viral t ransport medium or other sterile isotonic solution (phosphate buffered saline or cell culture medium). Keep samples cold (4 o C or 39 o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ic e*. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Urine Specimens Collect 10-15 ml of urine in a screw top sterile c ontainer Keep samples cold (4 o C or 39 o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ic e*.

A positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or r einfection. As with any lab test, there can be false positive test results. o IgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtain both an acute (can be done as soon after onset as the patient is seen, but ideall y four to five days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from two to four weeks after onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four -fold rise in IgG antibody titer has occurred (e.g., from 1:40 to 1:320). In vaccina ted persons it may not be possible to detect a four-fold rise in measles IgG antibody titer in paired serum samples (acute and convalescent). In such persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposure and infection. At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and obviate the 4fold rise observed in the convalescent serum s pecimen. PCR o Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR product derived fro m a virus isolate or from clinical material confirms a presumptive positive P CR result and provides epidemiologically important information Viral Culture o Isolation of measles virus from any clinical speci men constitutes laboratory confirmation of measles GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 1 Agent: Mumps virus. Brief Description: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilat eral swelling of the parotid gland or other salivary gland(s) (parotitis), and w ithout other apparent cause. Symptoms such as myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-gr ade fever may precede parotitis by several days. Asymptomatic infections also occur; parotiti s is present in only 30-40% of infected persons. Not all cases of parotitis - especially s poradic ones - are due to mumps infection; however, mumps is the only known cause of epidemic parotitis. Complications can include meningitis, arthritis, inflammation of the testicle s or ovaries, inflammation of the pancreas and deafness. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Airborne, by droplet spread, or by direct contact with saliva of an infected person. Incubation Period: 14 to 18 days, (range 14-25 days) Period of Communicability: Persons with mumps are usually considered infectio us from 2 days before until 4 days after onset of parotitis. However, virus has been isolated from saliva from 7 days before parotitis and 9 days after onset of illness. Clinical Case Definition: An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilate ral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary gland(s), lasting greater than or equal to 2 days, and without other apparent cause. Case Classification: Suspected: o parotitis, acute salivary gland swelling, orchitis , or oophoritis unexplained by another more likely diagnosis, or o a positive lab result with no mumps clinical sympt oms (with or without epidemiological linkage to a confirmed or probable case). Probable: o Acute parotitis or other salivary gland swelling l asting at least 2 days, or orchitis or oophoritis unexplained by another more likely di agnosis, in: /square4 a person with a positive test for serum anti-mumps IgM antibody, or /square4 a person with epidemiologic linkage to another pro bable or confirmed case or linkage to a group/community defined by pub lic health during an outbreak of mumps. Confirmed : o A positive mumps laboratory confirmation for mumps virus with RT-PCR or culture in a patient with an acute illness characte rized by any of the following: /square4 Acute parotitis or other salivary gland swelling, lasting at least 2 days GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen import status Internationally imported case: An internationally imported case is defined as a c ase in which mumps results from exposure to mumps virus ou tside the United States as evidenced by at least some of the exposure period ( 12-25 days before onset of parotitis or other mumps-associated complications) occurring outside the United States and the onset of parotitis or other mumpsassociated complic ations within 25 days of entering the United States and no known exposure to mumps in the U.S. during that time. All other cases are considered U.S.-acquired cases. U.S.-acquired case : A U.S.-acquired case is defined as a case in which the patient had not been outside the United States during the 25 da ys before onset of parotitis or other mumps-associated complications or was known to have been exposed to mumps within the United States. U.S.-acquired cases are sub-classified into four mu tually exclusive groups: o Import-linked case : Any case in a chain of transmission that is epide miologically linked to an internationally imported case. o Imported-virus case: A case for which an epidemiologic link to an inter nationally imported case was not identified but for which vira l genetic evidence indicates an imported mumps genotype (i.e., a genotype that is n ot occurring within the United States in a pattern indicative of endemic transmiss ion). An endemic genotype is the genotype of any mumps virus that occurs in an e ndemic chain of transmission (i.e., lasting 12 months). Any genotype that is found repeatedly i n U.S.-acquired cases should be thoroughly investigat ed as a potential endemic genotype, especially if the cases are closely relat ed in time or location. o Endemic case : A case for which epidemiological or virological e vidence indicates an endemic chain of transmission. Endemic transmission is defined as a chain of mumps virus transmission continuous for 12 months within the United States. o Unknown source case: A case for which an epidemiological or virological link to importation or to endemic transmission within the U .S. cannot be established after a thorough investigation. These cases must be carefully assessed GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 3epidemiologically to assure that they do not repres ent a sustained U.S.-acquired chain of transmission or an endemic chain of transm ission within the U.S. Laboratory testing: If mumps is suspected, laboratory testing should be performed. Acute mumps infection can be detected by the presence of serum mumps IgM, a sign ificant rise in IgG in acute and convalescent-phase serum specimens, IgG serocon version, positive mumps virus culture, or detection of virus by real-time reverse transcri ptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). However, in both unvaccinated and vaccinated person s, false positive results can occur because assays may be affected by other diagnostic entities that cause parotitis. In addition, laboratory confirming the diagnosis of mumps in hig hly vaccinated populations may be challenging, and serologic tests should be interpre ted with caution because false negative results in vaccinated persons (i.e., a negative ser ologic test in a person with true mumps) are common. With previous contact with mumps virus eith er through vaccination (particularly with two doses) or natural infection, serum mumps IgM te st results may be negative; IgG test results may be positive at the initial blood draw; and vira l detection in RT-PCR or culture may have low yield if the buccal swab is collected more than thr ee days after parotitis onset. Therefore, mumps cases should not be ruled out by negative lab oratory results. These challenges are discussed in more detail below. Virus detection (real-time RT-PCR and culture) Mumps virus can be detected from fluid collected fr om the parotid duct, other affected salivary gland ducts, the throat, from uri ne, and from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Parotid duct swabs yield the best viral samp le. This is particularly true when the salivary gland area is massaged approximately 3 0 seconds prior to swabbing the buccal/parotid duct, so that the specimen contains the secretions from the parotid or other salivary duct glands. Efforts should be made to obtain the specimen as soon as possible after onset of parotitis or meningitis. Cl inical specimens should ideally be obtained within three days and not more than eight days after parotitis onset. Urine samples are less likely than oral specimens t o contain sufficient virus copies or virus infected cells for culture or detection by mo lecular methods, and therefore are not preferred. o Unvaccinated persons: Virus may be isolated from t he buccal mucosa until 11-14 days after salivary enlargement; however, viral iso lation is most likely to be successful just prior to and within the first three days of parotitis onset. o Vaccinated persons: In order to optimize virus yie ld, emphasis should be placed on obtaining mumps clinical specimens from buccal m ucosa within 1 to 3 days after onset of symptoms (usually parotitis). In the case of specimens for virus culture or PCR a ssay, immediately place specimens in a cold storage container and transport to the laboratory. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 4 Serologic testing The serologic tests available for laboratory confir mation of mumps acute infection and confirmation of previous exposure to mumps vary among laboratories. At the initial visit, a serum specimen should be ob tained to test for mumps IgM antibodies. o If the acute-phase specimen is positive for IgM, a second specimen is not necessary. o A second negative IgM does not rule out mumps unle ss the IgG result is also negative. Paired serum specimens may also be used to demonstr ate seroconversion from negative to positive from acute to convalescent, wh ich is considered a positive diagnostic result for mumps. In unvaccinated indivi duals, a four-fold increase in IgG titers is also considered a positive diagnostic res ult for mumps, but these are rarely done. Tests for IgM antibody Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): a highly specific test fo r diagnosing acute mumps infection. The use of the IgM capture EIA is prefer red over the Immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Immunofluorescence assay (IFA): a test that is rela tively inexpensive and simple, but the IFA format is particularly susceptible to inter ference by high levels of mumps- specific IgG. Reading the test requires considerabl e skill and experience since this nonspecific staining may cause false positive readi ngs if the serum is not treated with an agent to remove human IgG antibody. Note: Commercially available EIA kits and IFA antibody as says for detection of mumps IgM are not currently FDA-approved. Therefore , each laboratory must validate these tests independently. Serum collection and timing of the mumps IgM respon se Unvaccinated persons: IgM antibody is detectable wi thin 5 days after onset of symptoms, reaches a maximum level about a week afte r onset, and remains elevated for several weeks or months. If an acute-phase serum sample collected 3 days after parotitis onset is negative for IgM, tes ting a second sample collected 5-7 days after symptom onset is recommended since the I gM response may require more time to develop. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health MUMPS (INFECTIOUS PAROTITIS) SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 5Vaccinated persons: Patients that mount a secondary immune response to mumps, as seen in most previously vaccinated persons, may not have an IgM response or it may be transient and not detected depending on the timing of specimen collection. Because of this, a high number of false negative re sults may occur in previously vaccinated individuals. False positive IgM results may also occur and appear to be more prevalent with certain IgM test formats, such as the IFA. There is some evidence that serum collected 10 days after parotitis onset may improve the abili ty to detect IgM among persons who have received one o r two doses of MMR vaccine. However, persons with a history of mumps vaccinatio n may not have detectable mumps IgM antibody regardless of the timing of spec imen collection. Tests for IgG antibody Tests for IgG antibody may be used for mumps diagno sis or for testing mumps immunity. A variety of tests for IgG antibodies to mumps are available and include EIA, IFA, and plaque reduction neutralization. The specific criteria for documenting an increase in titer depend on the test. Diagnosis of Mumps with IgG IgG testing for laboratory confirmation of mumps re quires the demonstration of seroconversion from negative to positive by EIA or a four-fold rise in the titer of antibody against mumps as measured in plaque-reduct ion neutralization assays or similar quantitative assays. The tests for IgG anti body should be conducted on both acute- and convalescent-phase specimens at the same time. The same type of test should be used on both specimens. EIA values are no t titers, and increases in EIA values do not directly correspond to titer rises. Unvaccinated persons: In unvaccinated persons, IgG antibody increases rapidly after onset of symptoms and is long lasting. Vaccinated persons: In vaccinated persons, the IgG may already be quite elevated in the acute-phase blood sample which frequently preve nts detection of a four-fold rise in IgG titer in the convalescent serum specimen. Testing Mumps Immunity IgG A single serum sample tested for mumps-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosing acute mumps infections. The presence of mumps-speci fic IgG, as detected using a serologic assay (EIA or IFA), is considered evidenc e of mumps immunity but does not necessarily predict the presence of neutralizin g antibodies or protection from mumps disease.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Mumps Specimen Collection & Submission Guidelines 6Vaccination: Live attenuated mumps virus vaccine is recommende d for persons > 12 months of age unless medically contraindicated or unless a person is immune as defined by documentation of 1) immunization with at least one dose of live mumps vaccine on or after the first birthday, 2) serological evidence of mumps im munity, 3) physician diagnosis of mumps, or 4) birth before 1957. Under the current 2-dose sch edule, most children and adolescents receive two doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Mumps vacci ne, as MMR or MMRV, is recommended at 12-15 months of age and 4-6 years of age. For mo re detailed vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in C hapter 2 of this manual. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: There is no evidence that giving mumps vaccine pro vides protection to those already exposed. However, in t hose susceptible persons who were exposed but not infected, the vaccine will provide future i mmunity, and its use in these situations is not contraindicated. Treatment: Supportive only. Investigation: . The investigation must be started immediately wh en a potential case is identified. Essential components of the case investigation incl ude the following: a. Obtain a detailed history of illness progression and description of parotid swelling b. Obtain a detailed travel history c. Establish a diagnosis by obtaining laboratory sp ecimens for serology, viral isolation and PCR as early as possible (consult with GDPH regarding the case before collecting and submitting specimens) d. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization his tory. e. Identify the source of infection and transmissio n setting. f. Assess potential transmission and identify conta cts. g. For symptomatic contacts, obtain specimens for s erology, virus isolation and PCR if mumps is suspected. Initial response to the report of suspected mumps: 1.

Surveillance And Reporting -03/2017 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus that can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, but is most often as sociated with meningitis. Meningococcal serogrouping is based on the antigenic structure of the polysaccharide capsule, with five serogroups causing the majority of disease: A, B, C , Y, and W-135. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Spread through respiratory droplets, normally requi ring direct contact with saliva and respiratory secretions. Up to 5%-10% of people may be asymptomatic carriers with nasopharyngeal colonizat ion. Incubation Period: 2 to 10 days, commonly 3-4 days Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: Isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or less co mmonly, joint fluid). Invasive disease may take a variety of forms, including septicemia, meni ngitis, pneumonia, or septic arthritis. Gram stain of CSF showing gram-negative diplococci sugge sts meningococcus, and rt-PCR Neisseria meningitidis DNA. Serotype testing: 1. Specimen: Blood, CSF, or other sterile site for culture; pure specimen for typing 2. Outfits: sterile vial for isolation and identifi cation; culture referral order #0505 for serotyping 4. Performing Test: Special Bacteriology Labor atory; Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) in Decatur Classification: Suspected: clinical purpura fulminans in the absen ce of a positive blood culture or gram-negative diplococci (not yet identified) isola ted from a normally sterile body site Probable: Detection of N. meningitidis in formalin-fixed tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in CSF by latex agglu tination Confirmed: Isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally sterile site or from purpuric lesions; or Detection of N. meningitidis -specific nucleic acid in a specimen obtained from a normally sterile body site (e.g., blood or C SF), using a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay Period of Communicability: As long as organisms are present in discharge from the nose and mouth. Cases are considered non-infectious 24 h ours after starting effective antibiotic therapy. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 6. Surveillance And Reporting -03/2017 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet is caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria. These bacteria are found only in humans. These are multiple meningococ cal serogroups (types), but the most important of these are A, B, C, Y, & W-135. The two most common forms of meningococcal disease are: meningitis, a bacterial infection of t he fluid and covering of the spinal cord and brain; and septicemia (meningococcemia), an infecti on of the bloodstream. Who is at risk? Household and other close contacts exposed to a per son with meningococcal disease within 7 days before onset of illness are at high risk and should receive antibiotic prophylaxis (see \"Investigation\" below). Outbreaks have occurred amo ng college students and in daycares, however only 5% of cases are associated with outbre ak with the rest being sporadic cases. In addition to routine vaccination of adolescents, ACIP also recommends vaccination for people who have complement component deficiencies, people without a functioning spleen, microbiologists who routinely are exposed to isolat es of N. meningitidis , military recruits, and people who travel to or reside in areas in which me ningococcal disease is epidemic. Rates of meningococcal disease are highest during infancy, t hen fall during childhood, rising again during adolescence. How are meningococcal bacteria spread? The bacteria are transmitted from person-to-person in secretions from the nose and throat. Exposure to oral secretions may occur during close social contact such as kissing or sharing utensils, or to medical personnel through unprotect ed contact during intubation or mouth-to- mouth resuscitation. They are not spread by casual contact or by simply breathing the air near an infected person, but require close contact. The bacteria can live outside the body for only a few minutes; so, if the germs contaminate a desk or book, they soon die and won't infect a person who touches it later. As many as 2 in 10 people carry the bacteria in the back of the nose and throat at any given time, especiall y in winter. Why only a very small number of those who have the bacteria in their nose and th roat develop disease while others remain healthy is not understood. What are the symptoms? Meningitis is characterized by high fever, headache , and stiff neck. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, confusion, sleepiness, an d sensitivity to light. Sepsis causes high fever, low blood pressure, and severe malaise and s hock. Meningococcal sepsis is sometimes associated with a characteristic petechia l or purpuric rash. Petechiae are pinpoint spots that do not blanch with pressure, and purpura are patches of discoloration similar to bruises. Both are caused by bleeding into the skin. How can meningococcal disease be prevented? Besides vaccination according to established guidel ines, general meningococcal prevention measures include avoiding first and second-hand tob acco smoke, using cough etiquette, and minimizing shared saliva. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 6. Surveillance And Reporting -03/2017 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet 3 Who should be vaccinated? ACIP recommends routine vaccination with a quadriva lent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) for adolescents aged 11 or 12 years, with a booster dose at age 16 years. College freshmen living in dormitories are at incre ased risk for disease and should be vaccinated with MCV4 before college entry if they h ave not been vaccinated previously. ACIP also recommends that persons age 2 to 55 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease be vaccinated with MCV4; MPSV 4 is recommended for adults 56 years and older who are at increased risk. This inc ludes travelers to or residents of countries in which the disease is hyperendemic or epidemic, a nd individuals who have terminal complement component deficiencies or asplenia. Vac cination recommendations for children with asplenia, sickle cell, or complement deficienc y are complex. Refer to the footnotes of the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons a ged 0 through 18 years - United States, 2015. For guidelines on booster doses amon g persons with high-risk conditions, refer to MMWR 2013 / 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6202a1.h tm . For other catch-up recommendations for these persons, and complete inf ormation on use of meningococcal vaccines, including guidance related to vaccination of persons at increased risk of infection, see MMWR March 22, 2013 / 62(RR02);1-22, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr6202.pdf . Vaccination: A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) was licensed in 1981 to protect against serogroups A, C, Y and W-135, for persons ages 2 ye ars and older. In 2005, a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licensed for use in persons ages 11 to 55, which protects against the same four serogroups. M CV4 is the preferred product for individuals aged 2 through 55, and MPSV4 should be used for adults 56 and older. As of January 2015, two vaccines are licensed by the FDA that cover serogroup B for specified risk groups. Persons ages 2 through 55 with persistent complement component deficiency or asplenia should receive an initial series of 2 dose s of MCV4, 2 months apart, with a booster every 5 years. Persons with complement component de ficiencies or asplenia age 56 and older should receive one dose of MPSV4 and a booste r every 5 years. A bivalent vaccine that provides protection against meningococcal sero groups C and Y along with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Hib-MenCY-TT is licensed fo r use in children aged 6 weeks through 18 months with persistent complement component defi ciency. As of January 2015, two vaccines are licensed by th e FDA that cover serogroup B. MenB vaccine should be administered as either a 2-dose s eries of MenB-4C or a 3-dose series of MenB-FHbp. The same vaccine product should be used for all doses. They are recommended for certain persons aged 10 years who are at increased risk for meningococcal disease should receive MenB vaccine. These persons include: Persons with persistent complement component defici encies.\u00b6 Persons with anatomic or functional asplenia.** Microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of Neisseria meningitidis . Persons identified as at increased risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal disease outbreak. MenB vaccines are not licensed for children aged <1 0 years and are not currently recommended for children aged 2 months-9 years or o ther groups.

Also at risk are healthcare work ers who performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or unprotected intubation up to 7 day s before illness onset. The risk of secondary cases is highest within a few days after the index case occurs, but after 14 days, risk of secondary disease returns to baseline and p rophylaxis is of little value. Prophylaxis and Follow-Up of Contacts: Prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible after exposure to a meningococcal disease case, and must occur within 14 days. Ciprofloxacin 500 to 750 mg PO once may be given to adults >18 years of age to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis . Do not give to pregnant or lactating women Rifampin is the preferred antibiotic for children a nd non-pregnant adults: Non-pregnant adults: 600 mg PO q12h for 4 doses Infants and children > 1 months: 10mg/kg (maximum 600mg) PO q12h for 4 doses Infants < 1 month old: Rifampin 5mg/kg PO q12h for 4 doses Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 6. Surveillance And Reporting -03/2017 Neisseria Meningitidis Fact Sheet 5 Ceftriaxone should be given only if the client cann ot take Rifampin: Adults and children age 15 or older: 250 mg IM, on ce Children < 15 years old: 125mg IM, once Immunization with the appropriate meningococcal vac cine should be recommended according to guidelines above as a possible adjunct to chemoprophylaxis during an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable strain.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 1 Agent: Bordetella pertussis bacterium Brief Description: Pertussis is an endemic disease worldwide that is m ost common in children and can be especially severe in infants le ss than 6 months of age. Children usually get pertussis from a symptomatic household member ( e.g. older sibling, parent). Outbreaks occur periodically. Incidence and mortal ity rates declined markedly in the four decades following the introduction of the vaccine i n the 1940s. The disease shows cyclical peaks every 3-5 years with recent occurrences in 20 05 and 2010. National surveillance has shown an upward trend in disease incidence among 7 and 10 year olds, despite vaccination. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Transmitted person- to-person by droplets produce d from a cough or sneeze or by direct contact with secretion s from the respiratory tract. Pertussis is highly contagious, with 80% secondary attack rates among susceptible household contacts. Incubation Period: Typically 7-10 days (range 4-21 days) following e xposure. Signs and Symptoms: Pertussis typically begins with mild upper respir atory tract symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, and a mild cough (catarrhal stage). The cough becomes more severe over the next 1-2 weeks and dev elops into paroxysmal episodes (paroxysmal stage), often with a characteristic ins piratory whoop and commonly followed by vomiting (post-tussive vomiting). Fever is abse nt or minimal. Apnea and/or difficulty feeding frequently occurs in young infants, and may be the sole manifestation of early stage pertussis in this age group. Symptoms wane g radually over weeks to months (convalescent stage). Infants less than six months of age, adolescents, and adults often will not have the typical whoop. In mild cases adol escents and adults may have prolonged cough without paroxysms. The duration of classic pe rtussis is 6 to 10 weeks. Antimicrobial agents may alleviate the disease but only if given during the catarrhal stage. After the cough is established, antimicrobial agents are reco mmended primarily to limit the spread of B. pertussis organisms to others. Illness Progression : Stages: Catarrhal Paroxysmal Convalescent 1-2 weeks 1-6 weeks Weeks - Months Period of Communicability: Pertussis is highly communicable in the early cat arrhal stage before the paroxysmal cough stage. Thereafter, com municability decreases becoming negligible in about 3 weeks. Pertussis is most tra nsmissible during the catarrhal period (1- 2 weeks prior to paroxysmal cough onset) through th e first 3 weeks after cough onset (approximately 21 days). GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 2Temporal Pattern: Pertussis has no distinct seasonal pattern, but it may increase in the summer and fall. Susceptibility and Resistance: Susceptibility of nonimmunized individuals is uni versal. Cases can occur in previously immunized children, a dolescents and adults. Infection with pertussis confers prolonged immunity, but re-infect ion can occur. Protection of Contacts : Generally, post exposure antimicrobial prophylax is is recommended for all household contacts. Other cont acts are evaluated and managed on a case-by-case basis. Pertussis immunizations should be reviewed and updated, although vaccination may not prevent infection if given afte r exposure. Close contacts younger than 7 years of age who have not received 5 doses of Dip htheria, Tetanus toxoid, and acellular Pertussis vaccine (DTaP) or have not received a DT aP dose within 3 years should be given a dose as soon after exposure as possible. Ch ildren as young as 7 can be given a single dose of Tdap if they have missed one or more doses of DTaP. See below or Public Health Nursing Protocol for post exposure chemoprop hylaxis options . Isolation/Quarantine: Droplet precautions should be used for known cases. Cases should be removed from the presence of young childr en and infants, especially nonimmunized infants, until the case has received a t least 5 days of an appropriate antibiotic. Cases who do not receive antibiotics s hould be isolated for 3 weeks. Inadequately immunized close contacts less than 7 y ears of age should be excluded from school, day care, and public gatherings for 21 days after last exposure or until the cases and contacts have received at least 5 days of an ap propriate antibiotic. Clinical Case Definition GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 3A cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks (14 days) with one or more of the following: Paroxysms of coughing Inspiratory \"whoop\" Post-tussive vomiting Apnea (with or without cyanosis) (FOR INFANTS AGED <1 YEAR ONLY) Case Classification Probable: Meets the clinical case definition, is not laborat ory-confirmed, and is not epidemiologically-linked to a laboratory-confirmed case OR FOR INFANTS AGED < 1 YEAR ONLY: o Acute cough illness of any duration with at least one of the following signs or symptoms: /square4 Paroxysms of coughing, OR /square4 Apnea or without cyanosis) AND o Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for pertu ssis, OR FOR INFANTS AGED < 1 YEAR ONLY: o Acute cough illness of any duration with at least one of the following signs or symptoms: /square4 Paroxysms of coughing, OR /square4 Apnea or without cyanosis) AND o Contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of pertus sis Confirmed: o A person with an acute cough illness of any durati on who is culture-positive for B. pertussis; OR o A case that meets the clinical case definition and is confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) OR o A case that meets the clinical definition and is e pidemiologically-linked directly to a case confirmed by either culture or P CR. Case Classification Comments: *Note: An illness meeting the clinical case definit ion should be classified as \"probable\" rather than \"confirmed\" if it occurs in a patient who has contact with an infant aged <1 year who is Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for pertus sis and has 1 sign or symptom and cough duration< 14 days (classified as \"probable\" case). GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 4Laboratory testing: Pertussis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with prolonged cough with cyanosis, vomiting or apnea, r egardless of vaccination history. Nasopharyngeal secretions are the optimal specimens for isolating the pertussis bacterium and obtaining a lab confirmed diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal swabs for culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be collected as soon as possi ble after onset of symptoms and prior to antibiotic treatment. The time of collection will g reatly impact the ability to detect B. pertussis. There is a greater likelihood of positive cultures and/or PCR in the first two weeks of symptomatic infection than during later weeks of il lness. However, PCR may detect organisms for a prolonged period of time regardless of viabil ity. Confirmatory laboratory testing should be performed on all suspect or probable cases. Isolation of B. pertussis by culture Isolation of B. pertussis by bacterial culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing pertussis. A positive culture for B. pertussis confirms the diagnosis of pertussis. Culture of the organism is also necessar y for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing. Although bacterial culture is specific for diagnosi s, it is relatively insensitive. Fastidious growth requirements make B. pertussis difficult to isolate. Isolation of the organism using direct plating is most successful du ring the catarrhal stage (i.e., first 1-2 weeks of cough). Success in isolating the organ ism declines if the patient has received prior antibiotic therapy effective against B. pertussis , if specimen collection has been delayed beyond the first 2 weeks of illnes s, and if the patient has been vaccinated. All persons with suspected cases of pertussis shoul d have a nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab obtained from the posterior nasoph arynx for culture. For B. pertussis , nasopharyngeal aspirates will yield similar or hi gher rates of recovery than nasopharyngeal swabs; throat and anterior nasa l swabs yield unacceptably low rates of recovery. Therefore, specimens should be obtained from the posterior nasopharynx, not the throat. Specimens should be ob tained using polyester, rayon, nylon, or calcium alginate (not cotton) swabs and s hould be plated directly onto selective culture medium or placed in transport med ium. Regan-Lowe agar is generally used for culture; half-strength Regan-Low e should be used as the transport medium. Specimens should be transported o n cold packs and plated at the laboratory within 24 hours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is an important too l for timely diagnosis of pertussis and is increasingly available to clinicia ns. PCR is a molecular technique used to detect DNA sequences of the Bordetella pert ussis bacterium, and unlike culture, does not require viable (live) bacteria pr esent in the specimen. GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 5Despite these advantages, PCR can give results that are falsely-negative or falsely- positive. PCR results can be optimized by avoiding some of the more common pitfalls leading to inaccurate results. Although ea rly signs and symptoms of pertussis are often non-specific, only patients wit h signs and symptoms consistent with pertussis should be tested. Asymptomatic conta cts of confirmed cases should not be tested and testing of contacts should not be used for post-exposure prophylaxis decisions. Falsely-positive results may also occur as a result of specimen contamination, which can occur during spec imen collection and testing. The timing of PCR testing for pertussis can signifi cantly affect its ability to accurately diagnose the disease. PCR has optimal se nsitivity during the first 3 weeks of cough when bacterial DNA is still present in the nasopharynx. After the fourth week of cough, the amount of bacterial DNA r apidly diminishes, which increases the risk of obtaining falsely-negative re sults. Since its inclusion in the case definition in 1997, the proportion of cases confirmed by PCR has increased substantially, and many labora tories now use only PCR to confirm pertussis. However, as of March 2014, there are no standardized PCR assays for pertussis, and assay procedures, as well as sensitivity and specificity, can vary greatly between laboratories. Thus, interp retation criteria for diagnosis vary. Interpretation of PCR results, especially tho se with high cycle threshold (Ct) values should be done in conjunction with an evalua tion of signs and symptoms and available epidemiological information. While PCR is increasingly used as the sole diagnost ic test for pertussis, CDC recommends that PCR be used in conjunction with cul ture when feasible, rather than as an alternative test. Even when a laboratory has validated its PCR method, culturing for B. pertussis should continue; this is especially important to confirm the circulation of B. pertussis when an outbreak is sus pected. State laboratories should retain the capability to culture pertussis. Collection methods for PCR are similar to those for culture, and often the same sample can be used for both tests. However, calcium alginate swabs cannot be used to collect nasopharyngeal specimens for PCR. S wabs used solely for PCR (and not culture) testing may be placed in a steril e tube for transport to the laboratory. Use of liquid transport media is discou raged due to the risk of specimen contamination. Serologic Testing Commercial serologic tests for pertussis infection can be helpful for diagnosis, especially later in illness. However, there is no c ommercial kit approved by the FDA for diagnostic use. Cutoff points for diagnostic va lues of immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody to pertussis toxin (PT) have not been esta blished, and current IgA and IgM assays lack adequate sensitivity and specificity. I n the absence of recent immunization, an elevated serum IgG antibody to PT after 2 weeks of onset of cough is suggestive of recent B. pertussis infection. An increasing titer or a single GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 6IgG anti-PT value of approximately 100 IU/mL or gre ater (using standard reference sera as a comparator) can be used for diagnosis. As of December 2014, positive serology results from commercial laboratories are n ot confirmatory for the purpose of reporting. A single-point serologic assay has be en validated at the Massachusetts state public health laboratory for pe rsons aged 11 years or older and is used for clinical diagnosis and reporting in that state only. A serologic test performed at CDC or at the Massachusetts state labo ratory might be used to help investigate outbreaks. In states other than Massach usetts, cases meeting the clinical case definition that are serologically pos itive but not culture or PCR positive should be reported as probable cases. Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) Testing Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of nasoph aryngeal secretions is sometimes used to screen for pertussis; however, CD C no longer recommends DFA for diagnosing pertussis. Cases meeting the cli nical case definition that are DFA positive but not culture or PCR positive should be reported as probable cases. Diagnostic Testing: *Pertussis culture and PCR testing at the Georgia Pu blic Health Laboratory and/or CDC is available by special arrangement only. To receiv e pre-approval and make arrangements for either pertussis culture or PCR te sting, the District Health office or Georgia Department of Public Health must be contact ed at 404-657-2588 or 1-866-PUB- HLTH after business hours.

Transport requirements: The swabs should be plac ed in a sterile container and shipped overnight with ice packs. Vaccination: Beginning in 1996 acellular pertussis vaccines wer e recommended for all doses in the pertussis vaccine series, replacing the whole-c ell vaccines which previously had been used. All acellular vaccines are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTaP vaccine). Children should receive four doses of vaccine, with the firs t three doses administered at 4- to 8-week intervals, beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months of age. The fourth dose should be given 6-12 months after the third dose (17-20 months for Dapta cel). Children who receive four doses of DTaP before their fourth birthday should receive a booster dose of DTaP at 4 to 6 years of age. In children younger than seven years old, DTaP vacc ines efficacy ranges from 71% to 84%. Tdap vaccine is a formulation licensed for use in p ersons ages 10-64, and should be given as a one-time dose in lieu of a booster dose of Td. For more detailed vaccination information for either Tdap or DTaP, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and P ertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Investigation: Once notified of a suspect pertussis case: 1. Contact case/guardian AND health care provider I MMEDIATELY to obtain a detailed description of the clinical presentation. a. Use the Pertussis Case Report Form to assist in interviewing the case/guardian 2. Determine whether the case has clinically compat ible signs and symptoms 3. If the case-patient has clinically compatible si gns and symptoms, employ the control guidelines detailed below 4. Assist with the coordination of specimen collect ion (See Appendix B) if necessary a. If the case-patient has been coughing for 1-2 we eks, collect a specimen for culture and/or PCR testing at the Georgia Public He atlh Laboratory (GPHL). b. If the case-patient has been coughing for 3 week s collect a specimen for PCR (NOTE: State Epi approval must be obtained before a ny pertussis specimen is submitted to GPHL for testing) 5. Report/ensure reporting of case in SendSS 6. Update the SendSS record in a timely manner with new or additional information as it becomes available. Finalize SendSS record when case investigation is complete. NOTE: The final interview should be completed 14 days af ter the cough onset. If you are notified of a suspect pertussis case-patient wi th a recent cough onset (< 14 days) GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 8investigate the case IMMEDIATELY and follow-up 14 d ays after the cough onset date to assess whether the case-patient coughed for 14 days. This is required for case definition/reporting criteria. 7. In the event of death, obtain and send copies of hospital discharge summary, death certificate and autopsy report Control Guidelines 1. Investigate reports of suspect pertussis IMMEDIA TELY 2. If the clinical case definition is met (probable or confirmed), regard as true pertussis. 3. Ensure cases have received antimicrobial treatme nt to help limit spread of the disease to others and that they are excluded and is olated from group activity settings (e.g. schools, day-care centers, work plac e, camps, etc.) until they have received at least 5 days of an appropriate course o f antibiotics for pertussis a. In health care settings, use of droplet precaut ions is recommended. 4. Determine period of communicability (one week be fore to two weeks after cough onset) using the Period of Communicability Timeline 5. Identify exposed close contacts, including house hold contacts, child care contacts, etc. Note: Patients with pertussis are highly infec tious; attack rates among exposed, nonimmune household contacts are as high as 80%--90 %. 6. Identify high risk exposed close contacts. a. High risk contact definition (contacts at highes t risk of severe disease or transmitting disease to others at high risk) Infants <1 year of age Pregnant women Caregivers and household contacts of infants (e.g. , family members, friends, or babysitters who spend time car ing for an infant) All those attending or working in a childcare sett ing (i.e. same room) Healthcare workers who care for infants <1 year of age or pregnant/postpartum women Unimmunized/underimmunized children and Immunocompromised persons 7. Administer or coordinate the administration of a ntibiotics to close contacts within three weeks (21 days) of exposure, regardless of va ccination history GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health PERTUSSIS SPECIMEN COLLECTION & SUBMISSION 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 9a. Refer contacts for prophylaxis to their primary care physician, the health department, or follow DPH Nursing Protocol for obta ining prophylaxis from the contact's pharmacy. 8. Household and other close contacts should be tre ated prophylactically with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The recommended antimicrobial agents and dosing regimens for postexposure prophylaxis are th e same as those for treatment of pertussis a. Defining \"close contacts\" outside the household is especially challenging. Therefore, outside household environments, the risk for secondary transmission of pertussis should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and decisions to recommend prophylaxis should be based on infectiousness of the case, transmission setting, risk for transmissi on to others, and risk status of the contacts. b. Specific definitions of a contact for purposes o f pertussis control are problematic and will vary according to the situatio n. Transmission can be expected with the following situations: Direct face-to-face contact for a period (not defi ned) with a case- patient who is symptomatic (e.g., in the catarrhal or paroxysmal period of illness); Shared confined space in close proximity for a pro longed period of time, such as >1 hour, with a symptomatic case-pati ent; or Direct contact with respiratory, oral, or nasal se cretions from a symptomatic case-patient (e.g., an explosive cough or sneeze in the face, sharing food, sharing eating utensils during a meal, kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, or performing a full medical exam including examination of the nose and throat). 9. If period of prophylaxis has passed (three weeks , except in high risk cases), counsel contacts to call their health provider if they deve lop respiratory symptoms and/or cough so antimicrobial treatment/exclusion can be i mplemented immediately. 10. Vaccinination is not post-exposure prophylaxis, but encourage all household and close contacts to be up-to-date on their pertussis vaccinations. a. If possible, coordinate vaccination at the local health department. 11. Conduct surveillance for secondary cases and co ntacts. a. If necessary, a letter may be sent out to notify close contacts/guardians of possible exposure (Appendix E). * Note that the steps are not ordered by priority s ince several of these steps are conducted simultaneously.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Pertussis Specimen Collection & Submission 13 Pertussis Laboratory Testing Procedures and Interpr etation of Results Culture Cultures are held 7 days from the date of inoculati on and read daily. Nasopharyngeal swabs received i n transport medium tubes are inoculated immediately o nto Regan-Lowe plates and incubated. After the final day of incubation, if no colonies typical of B. pertussis or B parapertussis are present, the culture is reported as negative for these organisms. A positi ve culture report is based upon typical colony morphology, biochemicals and direct fluorescent ant ibody testing (DFA) Positive cultures or cultures overgrown with mold or normal flora are reported im mediately upon detection, and results are telephone d to the submitter. Both culture and PCR are recommended for diagnosis of B. pertussis whenever possible. A positive culture is considered confirmatory and is the most reliable. \" False negative\" culture results may fol low from any procedures that render the organisms nonvi able, such as improper handling of plates and transport medium after collection or prolonged anti biotic treatment. PCR The GPHL currently offers a multitarget PCR assay v alidated by the CDC, for qualitative detection of Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. holm esii DNA extracted from clinical specimens or cultu re isolates by real-time PCR. Most commercial laborato ries use a single target PCR for IS481, which is present in multiple copies in B. pertussis and in l esser quantities in B. holmesii and B. bronchisepti ca. Because this DNA sequence is present in multiple co pies, IS481 is especially susceptible to falsely- positive results. Use of the GPHL multiple target a ssay improves specificity of PCR assays for pertuss is. When requesting commercial PCR testing, clinicians are encouraged to inquire about which PCR target or targets are used by their laboratories. Interpre tation of commercial PCR results, should be done in conjunction with an evaluation of signs and symptom s and available epidemiological information, as the ir specificity can vary greatly.

Brief Description: Poliomyelitis is a highly contagious disease cause d by three serotypes of poliovirus. Infection with poliovirus results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations from inapparent infection to nonspecific febrile illness , aseptic meningitis, paralytic disease, and death. Two phases of acute poliomyelitis can be dis tinguished: a nonspecific febrile illness (minor illness) followed, in a small proportion of patients, by aseptic meningitis and/or paralytic disease (major illness). The ratio of cases of inap parent infection to paralytic disease among susceptible individuals ranges from 100:1 to 1000:1 or more. Reservoir: Humans Mode of Transmission: Person-to-person spread of poliovirus via the feca l-oral route is the most important route of transmission, although the oral-oral route is possible. Incubation Period: The incubation period for nonparalytic poliomyelit is is 3 to 6 days. For the onset of paralysis in paralytic poliomyelitis, the incubation period usually is 7 to 21 days. Period of Communicability: Poliovirus is highly infectious, with seroconversi on rates among susceptible household contacts of children nearly 1 00%, and greater than 90% among susceptible household contacts of adults. Persons i nfected with poliovirus are most infectious from 7 to 10 days before and after the onset of sym ptoms, but poliovirus may be present in the stool from 3 to 6 weeks. Temporal Pattern: Poliovirus infection typically peaks in the summer months in temperate climates. There is no seasonal pattern in tropical climates. Case definition: A. Paralytic Poliomyelitis Probable: Acute onset of flaccid paralysis of one o r more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs, without othe r apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss. Confirmed: Acute onset of a flaccid paralysis of on e or more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs, witho ut other apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss; AND in which the patient has a neurologic deficit 60 days after onset of in itial symptoms, or has died, or has unknown follow-up status Comment: All suspected cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are reviewed by a panel of expert consultants before final classification occurs. Con firmed cases are then further classified based on epidemiologic and laboratory criteria. GA Immunization Program Manual Division o f Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO ) B. Non-paralytic poliovirus infection Confirmed: Any person without symptoms of paralyti c poliomyelitis in whom a poliovirus isolate was identified in an appropriate clinical s pecimen, with confirmatory typing and sequencing performed by the CDC Poliovirus laborato ry, as needed. Laboratory Testing: Case confirmation is based on a clinical definition . However, a probable case can be supported by laboratory information. Diagnosis is made by is olation of the organism from throat, stool, rectum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood. The h ighest probability of isolation is achieved when two stool and throat specimens are obtained tw enty-four hours apart. These should be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) for primary isolation. The state laboratory will forward isolates to the Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and antibody blocking testing to determine intratypic variation. This will determine whether a paralytic polio case is derived from wild-type or vaccine related virus. Virus Isolation The likelihood of poliovirus isolation is highest f rom stool specimens, intermediate from pharyngeal swabs, and low from blood or spinal flui d. Isolation of virus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic but is rare ly accomplished. Because virus shedding can be intermittent and to increase the pr obability of poliovirus isolation, at least two stool specimens and two throat swabs shou ld be obtained 24 hours apart from patients with suspected poliomyelitis as early in t he course of the disease as possible (i.e., immediately after poliomyelitis is considere d as a possible differential diagnosis), and ideally within the first 14 days after onset of paralytic disease. Specimens should be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for pr imary isolation on appropriate cell lines. To increase the probability of poliovirus isolation , at least two stool specimens should be obtained 24 hours apart from patients wit h suspected poliomyelitis as early in the course of disease as possible (ideally within 14 days after onset). Isolation of wild poliovirus constitutes a public h ealth emergency and appropriate control efforts must be initiated immediately (in c onsultation among health-care providers, the state and local health departments, and CDC). Serologic Testing Serology may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis. An acute serum specimen should be obtained as early in the c ourse of disease as possible, and a convalescent specimen should be obtained at least t hree weeks later. A four-fold neutralizing antibody titer rise between the acute and convalescent specimens suggests poliovirus infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis GA Immunization Program Manual Division o f Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO ) The cerebrospinal fluid usually contains an increas ed number of leukocytes\u2014from 10 to 200 cells/mm3 (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein, from 40 to 50 mg/100 ml. These findings are nonspecific and may r esult from a variety of infectious and noninfectious conditions. Detection of poliovir us in CSF is very uncommon.

IPV is given intramuscul arly or subcutaneously, and OPV, a live attenuated virus, is given orally. Oral polio vacc ine (OPV) is no longer routinely recommended in the United States because of the continued risk for vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), the absence of indigenous disease, and the low risk for wild poliovirus importation into the United States. OPV is no longer available for routine vaccination in the U.S. The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP) recommends a four-dose schedule of IPV for routine immunization of infants and chil dren given at 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 GA Immunization Program Manual Division o f Public Health POLIOMYELITIS FACT SHEET (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO ) months, and 4-6 years of age. For more detailed vac cination information see Polio Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Most adults in the United States are at low risk fo r polio due to immunizations received in childhood. Certain adults are at high risk however , and should be vaccinated. These adults are: 1. Travelers to areas or countries where polio may be epidemic or endemic. 2. Members of communities with disease caused by wi ld-type polio. 3. Laboratory workers handling specimens that may c ontain wild-type polio. 4. Health-care personnel in close contact with pati ents who may be excreting wild-type polio. 5.

Surveillance and Reporting - 02/2018 Polio Questions & Answers 7 POLIOMYELITIS Q&A (Infantile paralysis, Polio) What is polio? Polio is caused by a virus that lives in the intest inal tract and sometimes in the throat. Polio was eliminated from the United States in 1979. However, polio still exists in some developing countries. What are the symptoms of polio? Infection with poliovirus can range from inapparent to a severe paralytic disease that may result in death. Symptoms include fever, malaise, headach e, nausea and vomiting, excruciating muscle pain and stiffness in the neck and back. What health problems does polio cause? Most people recover from polio without any problems . However, approximately 4 to 8 percent of those with polio develop health problems such as me ningitis and less than 1 percent develop permanent paralysis. How is polio diagnosed? Polio can only be diagnosed with laboratory testing . Taking samples from the stool or throat are common ways to test for polio. Who gets polio? Anyone who has not been vaccinated can get the dise ase. However, polio is more common in infants and young children and occurs under conditi ons of poor hygiene. Though, paralysis is more common and more severe when infection occurs i n older individuals. In exceedingly rare cases, oral polio vaccine can cause paralytic polio in a person who receives the vaccine (one in every 2.4 million doses). How is polio spread? The poliovirus is found in the stool and throat. It is spread through contact with the stool of an infected person (for instance, by changing diapers) . Poliovirus must be swallowed to cause infection. This can happen when hands that are contaminated wi th stool are put in the mouth. How soon after infection do symptoms appear? The incubation period is usually 6 to 20 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread th e poliovirus? Patients are most infectious from 7 to 10 days befo re and after the onset of symptoms. However, patients are potentially contagious as lon g as the virus is present in the throat and Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health POLIOMYELITIS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (INFANTILE PARALYSIS, POLIO ) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 02/2018 Polio Questions & Answers 8feces. The virus persists in the throat for approxi mately one week after onset of illness and is excreted in feces for 3 to 6 weeks. Does past infection with polio make a person immune ? There are three types of poliovirus. Lifelong immu nity usually depends on which type of virus one is infected with. Second attacks are rare and result from infection with a poliovirus of a different type than the first attack. What is the treatment for polio? There is presently no treatment for polio. Treatme nt involves supportive care. Is there a vaccine for polio? Yes. The inactivated polio vaccine, or IPV, is very effective. Children usually receive three doses of IPV vaccin e at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Booster doses are given again at 4 to 6 years of a ge. In the United States, polio vaccination is general ly unnecessary for person 18 years of age or older. In the case of travel to areas where polio disease exists, adults should receive a booster dose. In the rare case of an outbreak in a local area, p reviously vaccinated adults involved in the outbreak should receive a booster dose of polio vac cine. If they have never been vaccinated, a three-dose series of polio vaccine is recommended. How can polio be prevented? Maintaining high levels of polio immunization in th e community is the single most effective preventive measure. Two types of polio vaccine are available: trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). However, in t he United States IPV is the vaccine of choice and OPV is not readily available. Contact the Georg ia Immunization Program at 404-657-3158 for current vaccine recommendations. Where can I get additional information on polio? Contact the Georgia Department of Public Health, St ate Epidemiology Section by calling 404 657-2588. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella Fact Sheet 1 Agent: Rubella virus. Brief Description: Rubella is a viral illness caused by a togavirus of the genus Rubivirus and is characterized by a mild, maculopapular rash. The ru bella rash occurs in 50%-80% of rubella- infected persons and is sometimes misdiagnosed as m easles or scarlet fever. Children usually develop few or no constitutional symptoms, but adul ts may experience a 1-5-day prodrome of low-grade mild Postauricular, occipital and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is characteristi c and precedes the rash by 5-10 days. Arthralgia or arthritis may occur in up to 70% of a dult women with rubella. Rare complications include thrombocytopenic purpura and encephalitis. Rubella is transmitted through direct or droplet contact from nasopharyngeal secretions and has an average incubation period of 17 days (range: 12-23 days). Persons with rubella are most infectious when rash is erupting, but they can shed virus from 7 days before to 7 days af ter rash onset. When rubella infection occurs during pregnancy, esp ecially during the first trimester, serious consequences can result. These include miscarriages , fetal deaths/stillbirths, and a constellation of severe birth defects known as cong enital rubella syndrome (CRS). The most common congenital defects are cataracts, heart defe cts and hearing impairment. Reservoir: Humans. Mode of Transmission: Contact with nasopharyngeal secretions of infected persons. Infection is transmitted by droplet spread or direct contact with patients. Infants with congenital rubella syndrome shed large quantities of virus from body s ecretions for up to one year, and can therefore serve as a source of infection for suscep tible persons caring for them. Rubella may also be transmitted by sub-clinical cases (approxim ately 30% to 50% of all rubella infections). Incubation 14 days, (range 12-23 days) Period of Communicability: Rubella is moderately contagious. The disease is most contagious as the rash is erupting, but can be tran smitted about 1 week before to 5-7 days or more after onset of rash. Infected children should be excluded from school until 7 days after rash onset. Temporal Pattern : In temperate areas, incidence is usually highest in late winter and early spring. Case Classification: Suspected: Any generalized rash illness of acute onset that do es not meet the criteria for probable or confirmed rubella or any o ther illness. Probable: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an illn ess characterized by all of the following: o acute onset of generalized maculopapular rash; and o temperature 99.0 oF or 37.2 and o arthralgia, lack linkage to a laboratory-conf irmed case of rubella; and Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella virologic testi ng Confirmed : A case with or without symptoms who has laborator y evidence of rubella infection confirmed by one or more of the following : o isolation of rubella virus; or o detection of rubella-virus specific nucleic acid b y polymerase chain reaction; or o significant rise between acute-and convalescent-ph ase titers in serum rubella immunoglobulin G antibody level by any standard ser ologic assay; or o positive serologic test for rubella immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, * OR An illness characterized by all of the following: o acute onset of generalized maculopapular rash; and o temperature 99.0 oF or epidemiologic linkage to a laboratory-confirmed ca se of rubella. * Not explained by MMR vaccination during the previ ous 6-45 days. Not otherwise ruled out by more specific testing in a public health laboratory. Lab testing: Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, theref ore, cases must be laboratory confirmed. Virus detection and serologic testing can be used to conf irm acute or recent rubella infection. Virus detection (RT-PCR) Rubella virus can be detected from nasal, throat, u rine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens from persons with rubella. The best resul ts come from throat swabs. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens should be reserved fo r persons with suspected rubella encephalitis. Efforts should be made to obtain clin ical specimens for virus detection from all case-patients at the time of the initial invest igation. Virus may be detected from 1 week before to 2 weeks after rash onset. However, m aximum viral shedding occurs up to day 4 after rash onset. Serologic testing The serologic tests available for laboratory confir mation of rubella infections and immunity vary among laboratories. Enzyme immunoassa ys (EIA) are the most commonly used and widely available diagnostic test for rubella IgG and IgM antibodies and are sensitive and relatively easy to perform. E IA is the preferred testing method for IgM, using the capture technique, although indirect assays are also acceptable. Latex agglutination (LA) tests appear to be sensiti ve and specific for screening when performed by experienced laboratory personnel. Othe r tests in limited use to detect Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 Rubella Fact IgM (HI) and immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. Detection of IgM antibody Rubella-specific IgM can usually be detected 4-30 d ays after onset of illness, and often for longer. Sera should be collected as early as po ssible after onset of illness. However, IgM antibodies may not be detectable before day 5 a fter rash onset. In case of a rubella IgM-negative result in specimens taken before day 5 , serologic testing should be repeated on a specimen collected after day 5. Because rubella incidence is low, a high proportion of IgM-positive tests will likely be false positive. False-positive serum rubella IgM te sts may occur due to the presence of rheumatoid factors (indicating rheumatologic diseas e) or cross-reacting IgM, or infection with other viruses. Avidity testing (see below) and detection of wild-type rubella virus can be used to resolve uncertainties in the serologic e valuation of suspected cases. Particular care should be taken when rubella IgM is detected in a pregnant woman with no history of illness or contact with a rubella-lik e illness. Although this is not recommended, many pregnant women with no known expo sure to rubella are tested for rubella IgM as part of their prenatal care. If rube lla test results are IgM-positive for persons who have no or low risk of exposure to rube lla, additional laboratory evaluation should be conducted. Laboratory evaluation is simil ar to that described in the IgM- positive section below. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella Fact Sheet 4 Detection of IgG antibody (significant rise or avid ity) for diagnostic testing To detect a significant rise in rubella-specific Ig G concentration, the first serum should be obtained as soon as possible after onset of illn ess and the second serum sample should be collected about 7-21 days after the first specimen. In most rubella cases, rubella IgG is detectable by 8 days after rash onse t. Tests for IgG antibody should be conducted on both acute-and convalescent-phase spec imens at the same time with the same test. Assays for IgG avidity are useful to distinguish th e difference between recent and past rubella infections. Low avidity is associated with recent primary rubella infection, whereas high avidity is associated with past infect ion or reinfection. Avidity tests are not routine tests and should be performed in reference laboratories. Detection of IgG antibody to screen for rubella imm unity A single serologic IgG test may be used to determin e the rubella immune status of persons whose history of rubella disease or vaccina tion is unknown. The presence of serum IgG rubella-specific antibodies indicates imm unity to rubella. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6.

Vaccination: Children should receive rubella vaccine at 12-15 m onths of age, and 4-6 years of age. It is usually given combined with measles and mumps vaccine as MMR or MMRV. Adults Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health RUBELLA FACT SHEET (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella Fact Sheet 6born in 1957 or later should receive at least one d ose of MMR vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one MMR, or other acceptable evidence (laboratory results) of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella . Efforts should be made to identify and vaccinate susceptible adolescents and adults, parti cularly women of childbearing age who are not pregnant. Women who are pregnant or who plan t o become pregnant within one month should not receive the vaccine, due to the theoreti cal risk for causing birth defects in the developing fetus. Emphasize vaccinating susceptibl e males and females in colleges, employment and health care settings. For more detai led vaccination information, see Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Post-exposure Prophylaxis: Live attenuated vaccine given after exposure has not been demonstrated to prevent illness. However, non-preg nant people exposed to rubella may still theoretically benefit from the vaccine if given up to three days after exposure. Immunization of a person who is incubating natural rubella or who alr eady is immune is not associated with increased risk of adverse effects. The risk of con genital rubella when a pregnant woman is exposed is significant. Exposed pregnant women should not be given live virus vaccine. An intramuscular dose of 20 ml of immune globulin (IG) may decrease clinically apparent infection, but no studies show that such a dose protects the f etus. It should only be used in cases where therapeutic abortion is not an option. Treatment: None. Investigation: Measles and rubella must be ruled out whenever illn ess involving fever and rash are reported. The investigation must be started immediately when a potential case is identified. Essential components of the case investigation incl ude the following: a. Obtain a detailed history of illness progression and a rash description b. Obtain a detailed travel history c. Establish a diagnosis by obtaining laboratory sp ecimens for serology and viral isolation as early as possible (consult with GDPH regarding the case before collecting and submitting specimens) d. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization his tory. e. Identify the source of infection and transmissio n setting. f. Assess potential transmission and identify conta cts. g. For symptomatic contacts, obtain specimens for s erology, virus isolation and PCR if rubella is suspected. Initial response to the report of suspected rubella : 1. Call the State Epidemiology Section (404) 657-25 88 IMMEDIATELY . If after business hours, report suspect case to 1-866- PUB-H LTH. 2. Contact the parent(s) or guardian and reporting physician immediately to obtain a detailed clinical and exposure history of the patie nt. Ask parent(s) about any out-of-town travel or visi tors during the 7-21 days prior to rash onset. Identify any person(s) or group(s) exposed by the patient 4 days before to 4 days after rash onset.

Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella Questions & 9 RUBELLA Q&A What is rubella? Rubella, also called German measles, is a rash illn ess caused by a virus. What are the symptoms of rubella? Symptoms of rubella include a rash, low-grade fever , cough, and swollen glands behind the ears and in the neck. The rash generally appears fi rst on the face and moves from head to foot. The rash usually lasts for 3 days. Rubella symptoms can include joint pain \u2014 especially among adult females. Up to half of all persons infected w ith rubella do not have symptoms. What health problems does rubella cause? Most healthy children and adult males recover from rubella without any problems. However, many adults with rubella \u2014 especially women \u2014 get s ore or swollen joints. This joint pain usually lasts for less than one month. Having joint pain longer than that is rare. If a pregnant woman who is not immune to rubella is infected with rubella before the 21st week of her pregnancy, the baby may develop congenital r ubella syndrome, which can cause serious health problems. Often these include: stillbirth, m iscarriage, premature delivery, deafness, mental retardation, bone changes, and liver and spl een damage. Some of these problems are noticed at birth or within the first 2 years of lif e. Others, such as diabetes, may occur later in childhood. The good news is that congenital rubella syndrome is now rare in the United States due to widespread use of rubella vaccine. How is rubella diagnosed? Because rubella looks like many other rash illnesse s, it can only be diagnosed with laboratory testing. Taking samples of blood, urine, or fluid f rom the nose and throat are common ways to test for rubella. Who gets rubella? Anyone who has not been vaccinated or has not had r ubella can get the disease. Because there are people throughout the world and in the United S tates that are not vaccinated, it is possible that infected travelers can carry rubella to non-va ccinated people Is there a vaccine for rubella? Yes. The rubella vaccination is usually combined wi th measles and mumps (MMR). GA Immunization Program Manual Department of Pub lic Health RUBELLA QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (German Measles) 6. Surveillance and Reporting /uni2015 02/2018 Rubella Questions & Answers 10 Children should receive MMR shots at 12 to 15 mont hs of age. (They should have a second dose of the MMR vaccine at 4 to 6 years of a ge to be fully protected against rubella.) All adults who have not had rubella or a rubella s hot should receive an MMR vaccination. All non-pregnant women of childbearing age should receive rubella vaccine if they are not already immune. This will protect future childr en from the risk and severe consequences of congenital rubella syndrome. Pregnant women who do not have immunity should be vaccinated after their baby is born. How is rubella spread? The virus is found in fluids from the mouth and nos e of someone with rubella. The virus is spread when fluid containing the virus gets in your nose, mouth, or eyes. This can happen when a person with rubella coughs or sneezes near you, o r by touching the fluid and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth. The period between exposure to the virus and onset of illness is usually 16 to 18 days, but can range from 14 to 21 days. When and for how long is a person able to spread ru bella? A person with rubella can spread the virus to other s during the period from 7 days before until 7 days after the rash appears. What can be done to prevent the spread of rubella? Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread o f rubella. Widespread immunization against rubella is critical to controlling the spread of th e disease and preventing birth defects caused by congenital rubella syndrome. In addition everyone s hould: Avoid close contact with others who are ill Wash their hands often Stay at home if ill Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE FACT SHEET (Invasive Disease, Reported Syndrome and Susceptibi lity Information) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - pneumoniae causes many clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection (e.g., acute otitis media, pn eumonia, bacteremia, or meningitis). Pneumococci may be resistant to anti including penicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfametho notifiable with microbial inform ation asymptomatically coloni zes the nasopharynx of 5-40% of healthy people. Mode of Transmission : By droplet spread, direct oral contact, or throug h contact with articles freshly soiled with respiratory discharges. Person -to-person transmission of the organism is common, but illness among casual contacts and atten dants is infrequent. Infection can also occur from auto-inoculation among previously asympt omatic carriers. Disease results when the organism multiplies locally (e.g., otitis media), m ultiplies after aspiration (pneumonia) or invades a sterile site (e.g., central nervous system or blo odstream). Incubation Period: Variable. For pneumococcal pneumonia, approximate ly 1 to 3 days. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: For invasive disease: Isolation of S. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebro spinal fluid, or, less commonly, joint, pleural, or perica rdial fluid) Case Classification: Suspect: Any reported case lacking confirmation of isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site. Confirmed: Isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a normally sterile body site in a person of any age. Period of Communicability: The period of communicability for pneumococcal dis ease is unknown, but presumably transmission can occur as l ong as the organism appears in respiratory secretions. Vaccine: The polyvalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for all adults over age 65 and any individuals 2 years of age or older with chronic medical conditions that place them at high risk for pneumoc occal disease. PPSV is not effective in children under age 2. The 13-valent pneumococcal co njugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed for use in February 2010 and is recommended for infants and young children up to five years of age, all adults age 65 and older, and people betwee n ages 6 and 64 with certain underlying medical conditions. PPV23, PCV7, and PCV13 provide protection against commonly resistant pneumococcal strains. For more detailed vaccination information, see Pneumococcal Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. Treatment: Sensitivities of strains isolated from normally s terile sites should be determined because of the prevalence of drug-resistant pneumoc occi. Where diagnostic facilities are limited and delay in treatment could prove fatal, a ntibiotic treatment should be started presumptively based on clinical signs.

Surveillance and Reporting - Fact Sheet 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) is a bacterium that fre quently causes pneumonia (lung infection), otitis media (ear infec tion), bloodstream infection, and meningitis. Invasive S. pneumoniae infections affect body sites that normally contain no bacteria at all, such as blood, spinal fluid, joint, pleural, or pericard ial fluid. Who gets pneumococcal infections? Pneumococcal disease is most common at the extremes of age. Infections are also more common and severe in people with weakened immune sy stems such as persons undergoing chemotherapy or with HIV infection, or people with chronic diseases such as sickle cell disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, or congestive heart failure. Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives are also at higher risk. What are the symptoms of a pneumococcal infection? Symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia include abrupt o nset of fever, shaking chills, chest pain, productive cough, shortness of breath, and we akness. Signs of pneumococcal meningitis include headache, drowsiness, vomiting, irritabilit y, fever, stiff neck, and seizures. Ear infection can cause fever and ear pain or discharge. How soon do symptoms appear? Symptoms of infections caused by pneumococcus take a minimum of 1 to 3 days to develop after exposure. When and for how long is a person able to spread S. pneumoniae ? A person can spread the organism as long as the pne umococci are present in the discharges from the nose and mouth. Illness among casual conta cts of a person with pneumococcal disease is infrequent. How can pneumococcal disease be prevented? Two pneumococcal vaccines are available. PPSV23 pro tects against infections caused by common strains of S. pneumoniae . It is recommended for everyone age 65 and olde, a nd for people age 2 years and older with underlying health conditions making them more susceptible to S. pneumoniae infections. The other pneumococcal vaccine, PCV13, prevents disease in infants and young children but is also recommended in people age 65 and older and people between age 6-64 with certain health conditions. . ? Drug-resistant Streptococcus are the common bacterium S. pneumoniae (also called pneumococcus) that have become resista nt to a variety of antibiotics. Some strains are resistant to only one antibiotic, while other strains are resistant to many antibiotics, making infection with these strains mo re difficult to treat. How common is DRSP? Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE FACT SHEET (Invasive Disease, Reported Syndrome and Susceptibi lity Information) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 03/2017 Streptococcus Pneumoniae Fact Sheet 4Surveillance studies by the Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention have shown that in the U.S., DRSP strains have been increasing in frequenc y since 1987. In some communities, 30% of S. pneumoniae isolates are resistant to at least one drug, and st rains causing infections may be resistant to several antibiotics. DRSP strains i n Georgia are more common than in many other parts of the U.S. What caused these strains of bacteria to become res istant to antibiotics? Many experts believe that overuse of antibiotics co ntributes to the development of DRSP strains. Antibiotics are sometimes used to treat in fections caused by viruses (such as colds and bronchitis), which are not killed by antibiotics. O nce DRSP is in the community, use of antibiotics may \"select\" the resistant strains for survival. Where can I get additional information on pneumococ cal disease?

Surveillance and Reporting - 2/2018 1 Tetanus Fact Sheet Agent: The bacterium, Clostridium tetani . Brief Description: Tetanus is an acute, potentially fatal disease tha t is characterized by generalized increased rigidity and convulsive spasm s of skeletal muscles. Tetanus is caused by the spore-forming bacterium Clostridium tetani. C. tetani spores (the dormant form of the organism) are found in soil and in animal and human feces. The spores enter the body through breaks in the skin, and germinate under low-oxygen conditions. Puncture wounds and wounds with a significant amount of tissue injury are more likely to promote germination. The organisms produce a potent toxin tetanospasmin which is absor bed into the bloodstream. The toxin then reaches the nervous system, causing painful and oft en violent muscular contractions. The muscle stiffness usually first involves the jaw (lo ckjaw) and neck, and later becomes generalized. Tetanus is a noncommunicable disease\u2014i t is not transmitted from one person to another. Reservoir: Intestines of humans, as well as the intestines of horses and other animals, in which the organism is a normal inhabitant. Tetanus spores are ubiquitous in the environment and can contaminate wounds of all types. Soil or fomites c ontaminated with animal and human feces can also be reservoirs. Mode of Transmission : Tetanus spores are introduced into the body through : (1) puncture wounds; (2) lacerations, burns, trivial or unnotice d wounds in which fecally-contaminated soil containing C. tetani spores penetrates body tissues ; or (3) by injected contaminated street drugs. Incubation Period: The incubation period ranges from 3 to 21 days, us ually about 8 days. In general the further the injury site is from the cen tral nervous system, the longer is the incubation period. Shorter incubation periods are associated w ith a higher chance of death. In neonatal tetanus, symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days. Period of Communicability: Tetanus is not transmitted from person to person. It is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious but not contagious. Clinical Case Definition: In the absence of a more likely diagnosis, an acute illness with muscle spasms or hypertonia and diagnosis of tetanu s by a health care provider; or death, with tetanus listed on the death certificate as the caus e of death or a significant condition contributing to death. Case Classification: Probable: A clinically compatible case, as reported by a hea lthcare professional. There is no definition for confirmed tetanus. Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis: There is no diagnostic laboratory test for tetanus ; the diagnosis is entirely clinical. C. tetani is recove red from wounds in only about 30% of cases, and the organism is sometimes isolated from patients wh o do not have tetanus. Serologic results obtained before TIG is administered can support sus ceptibility if they demonstrate very low or undetectable anti-tetanus antibody levels. However, tetanus can occur in the presence of \"protective\" levels of antitoxin (>0.1 IU by standa rd ELISA); therefore, serology cannot exclude the diagnosis of tetanus. Diagnostic Testing: Not indicated. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depa rtment of Public Health TETANUS FACT SHEET (LockJaw) 6. Surveillance and Reporting - 2/2018 2 Tetanus Fact Sheet Vaccination: Primary tetanus immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all per sons at least 6 weeks old, but < 7 years of age, for whom the vaccine is not contraindicated. For those with allergies to pertussis vaccine, a diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine is availabl e (DT). The primary vaccination consists of a three-dose series, administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. The fourth dose (first booster) is recommended at 15-18 months of age to maintain adeq uate immunity during preschool years. The fifth dose (second booster) is recommended for children aged 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years o f schooling. Routine tetanus booster immunization, with tetanus toxoid usually combined with adult-diphtheria toxoid (Td), is recommended for all persons > 7 years of age every 10 years. Persons aged 10-64 years may get a one-time dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduce d diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) in lieu of one booster dose of Td. For more detail ed vaccination information, see Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine Guidelines in Chapte r 2 of this manual. Medical Management: All wounds should be cleaned. Necrotic tissue and foreign material should be removed. If tetanic spasms are occurring, supportive therapy and maintenance of an adequate airway are critical. Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is recommended for pe rsons with tetanus. TIG can only help remove unbound tetanus toxin. It cannot affect toxi n bound to nerve endings. A single intramuscular dose of 500 units is generally recomm ended for children and adults, with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) contains tetanus antitoxin and may be used if TIG i s not available. Because of the extreme potency of the toxin, tetanu s disease does not result in tetanus immunity. Active immunization with tetanus toxoid s hould begin or continue as soon as the person's condition has stabilized. Wound Management: Antibiotic prophylaxis against tetanus is neither p ractical nor useful in managing wounds; proper immunization plays the more important role. The need for active immunization, with or without passive immunization, depends on the condition of the wound and the patient's immunization history (see MMWR 2006; 55 [RR-17] for details). Rarely have cases of tetanus occurred in persons with a documented pr imary series of tetanus toxoid. Persons with wounds that are neither clean nor mino r, and who have had fewer than 3 prior doses of tetanus toxoid or have an unknown history of prior doses should receive TIG as well as Td or Tdap. This is because early doses of toxoid m ay not induce immunity, but only prime the immune system. The TIG provides temporary immunity by directly providing antitoxin. This ensures that protective levels of antitoxin are ach ieved even if an immune response has not yet occurred.

MM WR, April 1, 2011, Description Primary varicella infection, or chickenpox, is a vi ral illness characterized by a generalized maculopa pulovesicular rash typically consisting of lesions in varying stages o f development and resolution (crusting). Symptoms i nclude itchiness, low-grade fever, and general malaise. Disease sever ity and complications are increased among immunocom promised persons, infants, pregnant women, and adults. Break through varicella is a case of chickenpox that occu rs more than 42 days after an individual is vaccinated with varicel la vaccine; this disease is usually mild and may pr esent atypically. The virus that causes chickenpox can reactivate later i n life to cause herpes zoster, or shingles. Though chickenpox used to be fairly common in the US, with about 4 million ca ses per year, including 100-150 deaths a year, inci dence of chickenpox has decreased markedly since the introdu ction of the varicella vaccine in the mid-1990s. Course of Illness Chickenpox may begin with prodromal symptoms, inclu ding fever and malaise, 1-2 days before a rash deve lops. The rash typically consists of successive crops of lesions t hat appear over several days, with lesions at diffe rent stages of development. Healthy children commonly have 50-500 lesions in 2 - 4 successive crops. The rash usuall y resolves within 5 - 6 days, when all lesions have crusted over or d isappeared. This period may be longer in immunocomp romised people. Complications Secondary bacterial skin infections Pneumonia Central nervous system manifestations: o Encephalitis, cerebellitis/ataxia, meningitis Reye Syndrome * Hemorrhagic complications Vulnerable populations Pregnant women and their babies o Congenital varicella syndrome is more likely if mat ernal infection occurs during the 1st or early 2nd trimester of pregnancy o Infants are also at risk for severe infection and mortality if the mother develops varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery Immunocompromised individuals Adolescents and adults Children younger than 12 months of age Reservoir Humans Mode of Transmission Chickenpox is highly contagious, particularly among close contacts like household members or playmates . Chickenpox transmission is person-to-person, via the airborne route, following direct exposure with an active ras h. Infection can also occur following exposure to aerosolized virus from infectious lesions, and more rarely, exposure to re spiratory tract secretions of a person with an active varicella inf ection. Chickenpox can also spread through contact with articles that * Associated with aspirin use in children CHICKENPOX ( VARICELLA ) FACT SHEET have been soiled by fluid from lesions. Persons wit h shingles can spread chickenpox to people who are non-immune, through direct contact with an active shingles rash . Incubation period The amount of time that passes between VZV exposure and developing disease is 10 - 21 days (usually 14 - 16) . Period of Communicability A person with chickenpox can be contagious from up to 2 days before the rash appears until all the les ions have crusted over, or in the absence of crusting (common among b reakthrough cases), no new lesions appear after 24 hours. Exposure In general, exposure to varicella is defined as con tact with nasopharyngeal secretions or vesicular le sions, face-to-face interaction, or sharing indoor airspace with an inf ectious person. Clinical Case Definition Acute onset of diffuse, generalized maculopapuloves icular rash without other apparent cause. Breakthro ugh varicella cases are generally mild and may present atypically (maculopapular with few or no vesicles). Case Classification Probable: Meets clinical case definition, is not la boratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically li nked to another probable or confirmed case \u00a7 Confirmed: Is laboratory confirmed or a case that m eets the clinical case definition and is epidemiolo gically linked to another confirmed or a probable case Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis There are multiple means of diagnosing a varicella infection with laboratory testing ** . Direct Detection: Test for presence of the VZV antig en o Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) o Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) detection o Viral isolation through culturing VZV from a clinica l specimen Serologic Tests: Test for presence of VZV antibody o Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (considered evidence of curr ent infection if there is a four-fold or greater ri se in VZV IgG antibody level between paired acute and convale scent sera) o Immunoglobulin M (IgM) (considered evidence of curr ent infection if clinical symptoms of varicella are also present) Diagnostic Testing Routine laboratory testing to diagnose varicella is not required. Laboratory confirmation is recommend ed for fatal cases and in the case of an outbreak (for at least 2 to 3 cases). For cases of varicella among those who ar e documented as having received 2 doses of the varicella vaccine, l aboratory testing is encouraged in order to confirm varicella infection. The Georgia Department of Public Health conducts la boratory testing for varicella.

Evidence of immunity Any of the following criteria constitutes presumpti ve evidence of immunity: Documentation of age-appropriate vaccination Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confi rmation of disease Born in the United States before 1980 a. This does not suffice as evidence of immunity for h ealthcare providers, immunocompromised individuals, and pregnant women A healthcare provider diagnosis of varicella or ver ification of history of varicella disease History of herpes zoster based on healthcare provid er diagnosis Vaccination The best way to prevent chickenpox is to receive 2 doses of the varicella vaccine. The Advisory Commit tee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), recommends that all children without contraindications be vaccinated be tween 12 and 15 months of age and receive a 2nd dose between 4 and 6 years of age. Healthy people over the age of 13 who have no history of chickenpox and have never been vaccinate d against the disease should get 2 doses of the vac cine 4 to 8 weeks apart. Post-exposure Prophylaxis Varicella vaccine is effective in preventing infect ion or modifying the severity of illness if given w ithin 5 days (ideally within 3) of varicella exposure. For those with con traindications to vaccination, VariZIG, an immune gl obulin, may help prevent disease. Administration of VariZIG is recom mended as soon as possible following exposure to th e VZV and within 10 days. The patient groups recommended by the ACIP to receive VariZIG include immunocompromise d persons, pregnant women, and neonates whose mothers have var icella 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, and certain preterm infants. Treatment Chickenpox treatment is mainly supportive. Antivira l agents can reduce the duration and severity of il lness if given within 24 hours of rash onset. These drugs should b e considered for treatment of immunocompromised per sons and other persons at high risk for severe varicella. Case Investigation All suspect varicella cases should be investigated and reported to public health, recommendations are as follows: 1. Notify your local health department of a suspect va ricella case 2. Establish a diagnosis of varicella 3. Obtain an accurate and complete immunization histor y 4. Identify the source of infection 5. Assess potential transmission and identify contacts 6. Identify persons at high risk for developing severe disease (e.g., immunocompromised persons, pregnant women) 7. Complete the varicella case report form found at www.dph.ga.gov/varicella or in the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (SendSS) Outbreak Recommendations 1.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2015 Influenza Resources 1 RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL PREVENTING INFLUENZA Vaccination remains the primary method of preventin g influenza infection or lessening the severity of influenza. Because circulating influen za strains change from year to year, a new vaccine is manufactured each year. For complete pr otection individuals must receive a new influenza vaccine annually. CDC recommends that in dividuals receive the influenza vaccine as soon as it is available, ideally by October, esp ecially for persons at higher risk of developing complications from influenza, such as re sidents of long-term care facilities (LTCF) and children 5 years and younger. Persons w ho did not receive an influenza vaccine during the ideal time should still be immun ized throughout the influenza season to achieve some protection. Employees of LTCF are also strongly advised to be vaccinated to reduce the chance of their spreading influenza to residents. LTCF visitors should be encouraged to receive influenza vaccine. In fact, given that influenza vaccine is more effective at preventing disease amo ng young, healthy adults than among the elderly, vaccination of workers and visitors ma y be more effective in preventing disease among LTCF residents than vaccination of the reside nts themselves. Listed below are the three manufacturers of influen za vaccine with contact information for ordering. The ideal time to order influenza vaccin e for the upcoming flu season is in the spring, as most manufacturers' stocks are pre-booke Numerous infectious agents cause flu-like symptoms, making influenza diagnosis difficult on clinical grounds. A verified diagnosis of influenz a requires a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which may take up to 4 hours. Several rapid tests for influenza have been developed with variable sensiti vities and specificities. Some of these rapid tests can provide results as fast as 10 minut es and may be useful in a LTCF setting to attempt to quickly document the cause of an outbrea k of influenza-like illness. While negative rapid test results do not rule out influenza virus as the causative agent, a single positive result indicates that influenza is contrib uting to the outbreak a single positive test result in a LTCF setting strongly indicates an outb reak is due to influenza. If rapid tests are being used, PCR tests should still be done for confirmation and to identify the strai n and antigenic characteristics of the virus. Public hea lth officials can provide molecular specimen submission kits to an LTCF during an outbreak and a rrange for testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Call your local health departme nt immediately if an influenza outbreak is suspected in a LTCF. Public health does not sup ply rapid tests for influenza.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2015 Influenza Resources 6TREATING INFLUENZA Three antiviral drugs are currently approved for treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae), zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae), and Peramivir (Rapivab\u00ae). Al l three may be used for influenza A or B. Oseltamivir and zanamivir have also been approv ed for prophylaxis against influenza. Influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rima ntadine can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing result s conducted at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC and ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoproph ylaxis of influenza A in the United States until susceptibility to these antiviral medi cations has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related an tiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenz a A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. Zanamivir, an inhaled drug, may aggravate existing chronic respiratory illnesses. Table 2 describes medication dosage and duration for all ag e groups with normal renal function 2. Each medication should be administered within 48 ho urs of symptom onset. INFLUENZA PROPHYLAXIS Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related an tiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity against both influenz a A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infections. FDA has approved oseltamivir to treat influenza for persons 14 days and older and use as chemoprophylaxis in persons aged 1 year or older. However, CDC recommends using oseltamivir to treat influenza at any age and use f or chemoprophylaxis of influenza in persons 3 months or older. Zanamivir is approved fo r chemoprophylaxis among those 5 years and older. Once a cluster of influenza-like i llness has been identified in a long-term care facility, chemoprophylaxis of all residents sh ould begin immediately, regardless of whether they received vaccine. Chemoprophylaxis of staff should also be considered.

Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Committee on Infectious Diseases, 2014). 2 This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days and older and less than 1 year old, and provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in children ( Kimberlin, 2013 WP22849, FDA Clinical Pharmacology Review ). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for infants aged 9-11 months for the 2013-14 s eason, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol- defined targeted exposure for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study (Kimberlin, 2013). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in this age group. 3 Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health Influenza Resources 6.

Surveillance and Reporting - 9/2015 Influenza Resources 11 REIMBURSEMENT FOR INFLUENZA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCIN ATION Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are a Medicare benefit, so long-term care facilities can bill Medicare for these immunizations. Frequently, nursing homes in Georgia are not billing Medicare and are losing this revenue. One of the most effective strategies for increasing influenza and pneumococcal immunizations involves the health care provider. M edicare beneficiaries are more likely to get immunized when their physician specifically recommends vaccination. Medicare Part B began paying for influenza vaccine on May 1, 1993. Medicare Part B began paying for pneumococcal polys accharide vaccine (PPV) on July 1, 1981. Coverage of the vaccines and their administration i s available under Medicare Part B regardless of the setting in which they are adminis tered. If a beneficiary at high risk of pneumococcal disea se (i.e., aged 65 or older) is unsure about his or her PPV vaccination status, Medicare w ill cover re-vaccination. Roster bills can be submitted so that only one bill is needed per facility (although influenza and pneumococcal vaccines must be on separate roste r claim forms).

Surveillance and Reporting - 09/2015 LTCF Influenza Outbreak Control 1 Influenza vaccination remains the primary method of preventing illness and death associated with influenza. Among elderly persons r esiding in nursing homes, influenza vaccine can be 50-60% effective in preventing hospi talization or pneumonia and 80% effective in preventing death. While, the vaccine may be less effective in older people and may not prevent infection it may reduce the sev erity of illness. If an outbreak of influenza-like illness (defined as 2 or more reside nts with respiratory illness including: fever or feverishness with cough, chills, headache, myalgias, sore throat, or runny nose ) occurs in a long-term care facility, please immedia tely contact the local county health department or the Georgia Department of Public Heal th Epidemiology Section at 404- 657-2588 for assistance in outbreak investigation a nd control. Public health can help you confirm the diagnosis and prevent spread. A. Confirmation of Influenza and Determination of the Outbreak Strain Early in the outbreak, obtain nasopharyngeal swab specimens from up to 10 patients with symptoms suggestive of influenza for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Specimen collectio n kits can be obtained through the health department, which can also arran ge testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL). Approval from an epidemiologist at the local county health department or at Georgia Department of Public Health is required for influenza testing at GPHL. Because RT-PCR results may not be available for a f ew days, facilities may also consider using rapid flu tests. While a negat ive rapid test result does not rule out influenza, a single positive result indica tes that influenza is contributing to the outbreak. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for more information about rapid flu tests. Rapid flu tests are not available through public he alth. B. Vaccination of Patients and Personnel Even during an outbreak, administer current influen za vaccine to unvaccinated patients and staff, especially if the outbreak occurs early in the influenza season. The local county health department may have vaccine available during flu season. See RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information on how to order influenza vaccine p rior to flu season. For more detailed vaccination information, see Infl uenza Vaccine Guidelines in Chapter 2 of this manual. C. Treatment and Prophylaxis Even in the absence of laboratory confirmation, the Georgia Department of Public Health advises long-term care facilities to begin treatment and prophylaxis of residents and staff with antiviral m edications.

Five antivirals are licensed for prevention or trea tment of influenza, however only three antiviral drugs are used for influenza A or B. Oseltamivir and zanamivi have also been approved fo r prophylaxis against influenza. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are chemically related an tiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors that have activity agai nst both influenza A and B viruses. Both zanamivir and oseltamivir were approved in 1999 for treatment of uncomplicated influenza virus infectio ns.

However, CDC recommends using oseltamivir to treat influenza at any age and use for chemoprophylaxis of influenza in persons 3 months o r older. Zanamivir is approved for chemoprophylaxis among those 5 years a nd older. Amantadine and rimantadine are antiviral drugs that can be used to treat influenza A viruses but not influenza B viruses. H owever, influenza A virus resistance to amantadine and rimantadine can emerge rapidly during treatment. On the basis of antiviral testing result s conducted at CDC and in Canada indicating high levels of resistance, CDC an d ACIP recommend that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the United State s until susceptibility to these antiviral medications has been re-established among circulating influenza A viruses. Please see RESOURCES FOR INFLUENZA PREVENTION AND CONTROL for information regarding medication dosage and the rapy duration. D. Interruption of Person-to-Person Transmission Administer antivirals to individuals with suspected influenza within 48 hours of illness onset. Administer chemoprophylaxis to all non-ill resident s, regardless of their influenza vaccination status, within 72 hours of id entifying an influenza outbreak. Keep residents known or suspected to have influenza in a private room or in a room with other residents with documented influen za unless there are medical contraindications. If feasible, place persons with influenza-like illn ess together in an area with an independent air supply and exhaust system. Implement respiratory droplet precautions, includin g requiring all staff that have contact with ill residents to wear masks and g loves, and to wash hands frequently and thoroughly. Consider using hand san itizers in areas where hand washing is difficult. Restrict visitors who have a febrile respiratory il lness.

Administer the current influenza vaccine to previou sly unvaccinated resident and medical staff Preventing Influenza Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Fa cilities Morbidity and mortality from influenza can be great ly reduced if long-term care facilities follow these guidelines for influenza prevention: Develop an influenza control plan incorporating vac cination, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis activities. Ensure all staff are familiar with the plan's components. Plan an annual vaccination campaign targeting all r esidents, staff, volunteers, and visitors for flu vaccination. Ideally, vaccination should occur in October or early November, but the facility should also have methods in place to ensure that all staff and residents who enter the facility after the mass vaccination campaign are also vaccinated. Standing orders by the facility medica l director may make this process more convenient. Review residents' immunization histories and admini ster pneumococcal vaccine to those who are eligible. This should be done on a r egular basis, and especially during the annual flu vaccine campaign. If a pneum ococcal vaccination history is unknown, it is safe and preferable to give another dose. During flu season, post signs asking visitors with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, or muscle aches, to refrain fro m visiting. Train staff at the beginning of each flu season on the proper respiratory secretion precautions, hand-washing procedures, and surveilla nce activities. Have a mechanism to ensure all new employees who are hired during flu season receive the training as well. Establish and post a definition of flu-like illness . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines influenza-like illness as fever >100F and cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause other th an influenza. Be aware that influenza symptoms are sometimes different in elder ly persons or persons with chronic medical conditions and to also consider inf luenza when patients have fever or feverishness with cough, chills, headache, myalg ias, sore throat, or runny nose. Staff should be alert for residents who have fever with lethargy or delirium, or changes in their functional status. Monitor influenza activity in the community. The G eorgia Department of Public Health posts influenza information at https://dph.g eorgia.gov/flu-activity-georgia. You may also receive periodic influenza activities duri ng flu season by subscribing to the public health flu email list (sign up by sending an email to Audrey.Kunkes@dph.ga.gov with the word \"subscribe\" in the subject line). Knowledge of influenza activity in the community ca n assist in making a clinical diagnosis. Consider stocking rapid flu tests and antiviral med ications for immediate detection and response to outbreaks. If you do not stock rap id tests, have a plan in place for Georgia Immunization Office Manual Depar tment of Public Health Influenza Outbreak Control In A Long-Term Care Faci lity 6.

There should also be a method to quickly obtain physician orders for antiv iral medication. Post the county, district, or state health departme nt phone number for reporting a cluster of influenza-like illness. A cluster is de fined as 2 or more cases of illness among residents and/or staff within a 72-hour perio d. By law, any cluster of illness must be reported to Georgia public health authoriti es immediately .

Laboratory Confirmed case Positive culture of C. diphtheriae (or C. ulcerans) AND - Positive Elek Test OR - PCR for tox gene (Positive for subunit A and B) OR What other conditions may be considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory diphtheria? Respiratory diphtheria is an uncommon disease in the US. The symptoms of respiratory diphtheria are due to diphtheria to xin. Corynebacterium species which produce diphtheria toxin are C. diphtheriae gravis, intermedius, or belfanti), C. ulcerans, C. pseudotuberculosis. Symptoms of respiratory diphtheria may also be associated with non-toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae . Other biological disease agents whic h may also cause a membranous pharyngitis include: 1. Group A -hemolytic mononucleosis), adenovirus, Herpes simplex 8. Other agents - Toxoplasma Use of some anti-neoplastic agents ma y also result in formation of a pharyngeal membrane e.g methotrexate. Long term use of corti costeroids (e .g. prednesolone) can cause oral candidiasis.

Contact public health immediately when the diagnosis of measles is suspected. . A clinical diagnosis of measles is unreliable; suspect cases of measles must be laboratory confirmed. Confirmation of acute infection can be determined by the presence of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) , a four -fold rise immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer between acute and convalescent phase specimens , a positive PCR, and/or the isolation of measles virus from a throat or urine specimen. The Georgia Division of Public Health strongly recommends the collection of serum for measles IgM/IgG AND collection of a throat swab and urine specimen to confirm a measles case . To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) o r the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions Serologic Testing : Collect as soon as possible when measles infection is suspected, preferably at the onset of rash. Collect 7 -10 ml of blood in a red top or serum separator tube (SST) Acute must be centrifuged and the serum transferr ed into a transport tube for shipment. Keep specimens cold (4o C or 39o F) and ship overnight service. Do not freeze serum samples. Viral Testing: Collect a urine and throat swab at the same time as serology. Virus is most frequently recovered within the first 3 days following rash onset , but up to 7 days after rash onset is acceptable. If a few days have passed since resolution of the rash collect only a urine specimen. Throat Swabs Use a viral transport kit if possible (such as that used to isolate influenza or herpes simplex virus) Collect a throat swab by rubb ing the posterior oropharynx with a dry sterile cotton swab Place swab in a tube containing 2 -3 mls of viral transport medium or other sterile isotonic solution (phosphate buffered saline or cell culture medium). Keep samples cold (4o C or 39o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice pa cks or dry ice*. Avoid freeze -thaw cycles. Urine Specimens Collect 10 -15 ml of urine in a screw top sterile container Keep samples cold (4o C or 39o F) Ship the viral specimens using ice packs or dry ice*. Avoid freeze -thaw cycles. *If shipment contains both serum and viral specimens, ship together by overnight service on cold packs (do not freeze serum) Laboratory Submission Instructions 1. Notify your District Public Health Office or the Vaccine Preventable Disease Epidemiology Unit immediately . 2. Label the specimen containers (transport media, urine, and/or blood) with the patient's name, date of birth, and date of specimen collection ( UNAPPROVED OR UNLABELED SPECIMENS WILL NOT BE TESTED) 3.

A positive IgM test result indicates current/very recent infection or reinfection. As with any lab test, there can be false positive test results. o IgG: IgG alone is not diagnostic unless you obtain both an acute (can be done as soon af ter onset as the patient is seen, but ideally four to five days after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (from two to four weeks after onset) blood specimen for serologic tests to determine if a four -fold rise in IgG antibody titer has occurred (e.g., fro m 1:40 to 1:320). In vaccinated persons it may not be possible to detect a four -fold rise in measles IgG antibody titer in paired serum samples (acute and convalescent). In such persons, the existing IgG will begin to rise soon after exposure and infection . At the time of onset of symptoms and collection of the acute serum, the IgG may already be quite elevated, and obviate the 4fold rise observed in the convalescent serum specimen. PCR o Sequence analysis of a n RT-PCR product derived from a virus isolate or from clinical material confirms a presumptive positive PCR result and provide s epidemiologically important information Viral Culture o Isolation of measles virus from any clinical specimen constitutes laborato ry confirmation of measles Updated 1/2015 Acute Disease Epidemiology 2 Peachtree St., NW http://dph.georgia.gov/vaccine -preventable -diseases Minimize Measles Transmission in Healthcare Settings To minimize the risk of measles transmission in healthcare settings, healthcare personnel should: 1. Query patients with a febrile rash illness* about a history of international travel, contact with foreign visitors, transit through an international airport, or possible exposure to a measles patient in the 3 weeks prior to symptom onset. Suspect measles in patients with such a history . 2. Mas k suspect measles patients immediately . If a surgical mask cannot be tolerated, other practical means of source containment should be implemented (e.g., place a blanket loosely over the heads of infants and young children suspected to have measles when the y are in the waiting room or other common areas). 3. Do not allow suspect measles patients to remain in the waiting area or other common areas ; isolate them immediately in an airborne infection isolation room if one is available. If such a room is not availa ble, place patient in a private room with the door closed. For additional infection control information, please see the CDC \"Guidelines for Isolation Precautions\" at: www.cdc.go v/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html 4. If possible, allow only healthcare personnel with documentation of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity (measles IgG positive) to enter the patient's room. 5. Healthcare personnel who do not have documentation of 2 doses of live measles vaccine or lab -evidence of immunity must wear a N95 respirator (N95 respirator must be fit -checked each time it is donned). 6. If possible, do not allow susceptible visitors in the patient's room. 7. Do not use the e xamination room for at least two hours after the possibly infectious patient leaves. 8. If possible, schedule suspect measles patients at the end of the day . 9. Notify the Georgia Department of Public Health immediately of any suspect measles patients; arrange f or measles testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) by calling 404 -657-2588 or 1 -866-PUB -HLTH. 10. Notify any location where the patient is being referred for additional clinical evaluation or laboratory testing about the patient's suspect measle s status and do not refer suspect measles patients to other locations unless appropriate infection control measures can be implemented at those locations. Patient must wear a mask, if feasible, or loosely cover the heads of infants or young children with a blanket during transport to another clinical area. 11. Instruct suspect measles patients and exposed persons to inform all healthcare providers of the possibility of measles prior to entering a healthcare facility so that appropriate infection control precaut ions can be implemented. 12. Make note of the staff and other patients who were in the area during the time the suspect measles patient was in the facility and for two hours after they left. If measles is confirmed in the suspect case, exposed people will need to be assessed for measles immunity. 13. For more information on measles and measles testing, please see: http://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov /files/ADES_Measles_Specimen_Collection_Guidelines.pdf *Measles typically begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. Two to three days l ater, Koplic k spots (tiny red spots with bluish -white centers inside the mouth on the lining of the cheek), which are a characteris tic sign of measles, may appear. At this time the fever spikes, often as high as 104 -105oF. At the same time, a red blotchy maculopapular rash appears that may become confluent, usually appearing first on the face-along the hairline and behind the ears. Th is slightly itchy rash rapidly spreads downward to the chest and back and, finally, to the thighs and feet. In approximately one week, the rash fades in the same sequence that it appeared.

Nasopharyngeal secretions are the optimal specimens for isolating the pertussis bacterium and obtaining a lab confirmed diagnosis. Nasopharyngeal swabs for culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be collected as soon as possible after onset of symptoms and prior to antibiotic treatment. The time of collection will greatly impact the ability to detect B. pertussis . There is a greater likelihood of positive cultures and/or PCR in the first two weeks of symptomatic infection than during later weeks of illness. However, PCR may detect organisms for a prolonged period of time regardless of viability. Confirmatory laboratory testing should be performed on all suspect or probable cases. The Georgia Department of Public Health strongly recommends the collection of a nasopharyngeal swab to confirm a pertussis case. The preferred methods for laboratory diagnosis of pertussis are culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and it is recommended that BOTH tests be performed. *Pertussis culture and PCR testing at the Georgia Public Health Laboratory is available by special arrangement only. To receive pre -approval and make arrangements for either pertussis culture or PC R testing, the District Health office or Georgia Department of Public Health VPDEU must be contacted at 404-657-2588. A. Specimen Collection Instructions Nasopharyngeal Swab Collection A video detailing how to collect a nasopharyngeal swab can be found at: http://health.state.ga.us/epi/vpd/ in the Updates Section. Materials - Consult the District Epidemiologist or the Vaccine Preventable Disease Epidemiology Unit for the following: o Polyester (Dacron), rayon, or nylon -flocked swab (Cotton -tipped or Calcium alginate swabs are not acceptable) o Regan- Lowe transport media Store at 2- 8 degrees Celsius ( or 36- 46 degrees Fahrenheit ) in a refrigerator Remove from refrigerator and warm to room temperature Collection o Have patient sit with head against a wall or lie down, as patients have a tendency to pull away during this procedure o Insert swab into one nostril straight back ( not upwards ) and continue along the floor of the nasal passage for several centimeters until reaching the nasopharynx. The distance from the nose to the ear gives an estimate of the distance the swab should be inserted. Do not force sw ab, if obstruction is encountered before reaching the nasopharynx , remove swab and try the other side. o Rotate the swab gently for 5- 10 seconds to loosen the epithelial cells. Culture: Remove swab and immediately inoculate Regan- Lowe transport media by inserting the swab at least \u00bd inch below the surface of the media. Bend or clip the wire swab handle to fit the transport medium tube and reattach the cap securely. Georgia Department of Public Health Vaccine Preventable Disease Epidemiology Unit (VPDEU) Page 2 of 3 Vaccine Preventable Disease Epidemiology 2 Peachtree St, immediately place in a dry sterile container. Bend or clip the wire swab handle to fit the container. NOTE: A dry swab, not in Regan Lowe media, is acceptable for PCR testing. o Specimen should be transported at refrigerator temperature and received by the laboratory as soon as possible and within one day from time of collection .

Nasopharyngeal swabs received in transport medium tubes are inoculated immediately onto Regan- Lowe plates and incubated. After the final day of incubation, if no colonies typical of B. pertussis or B parapertussis are present, the culture is reported as negative for these organisms. A positive culture report is based upon typical colony morphology, biochemicals and direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA) Positive cultures or cultures overgrown with mold or normal flora are reported immediately upon detection, and results are telephoned to the submitter. Both culture and PCR are recommended for diagnosis of B. pertussis whenever possible. A positive culture is considered confirmatory and is the most reliable. \" False negative\" culture results may follow from any procedures that render the organisms nonviable, such as improper handling of plates and transport medium after collection or prolonged antibiotic treatment . PCR The GPHL c urrently offers a multitarget PCR assay validated by the CDC, for qualitative detection of Bordetella pertussis , B. parapertussis , and B. holmesii DNA extracted from clinical specimens or culture isolates by real - time PCR. Most commercial laboratories use a single target PCR for IS481, which is present in multiple copies in B. pertussis and in lesser quantities in B. holmesii and B. bronchiseptica. Because this DNA sequence is present in multiple copies, IS481 is especially susceptible to falsely -positive r esults. Use of the GPHL multiple target assay improves specificity of PCR assays for pertussis. When requesting commercial PCR testing, clinicians are encouraged to inquire about which PCR target or targets are used by their laboratories. Interpretation of commercial PCR results, should be done in conjunction with an evaluation of signs and symptoms and available epidemiological information, as their specificity can vary greatly. Why Whooping Cough is Serious: Whooping cough (also known as pertussis) is a contagious disease that can be passed easily from person to person. It is very serious for babies and can cause them to cough so much that they cannot breathe. Hundreds of babies are hospitalized each year for whooping cough, and some die from it. Whooping cough can cause adults or teens to have a persistent cough. The coughing can become severe enough to lead to vomiting or broken ribs. Adults and teens can be hospitalized for pneumonia and miss weeks of work or school. Even worse, they can spread whooping cough to babies. Ways to Protect Yourself and Your Family: Get Your Pertussis Booster (Tdap) Everybody in the family should be vaccinated against whooping cough to protect themselves and the baby at home. Adults should ask their doctor about the Tdap vaccine that includes a tetanus and diphtheria booster and also protects against whooping cough. Make Sure Your Grandchildren are Up-to-Date on Their Vaccinations Children need five shots against whooping cough before starting kindergarten. Children 7 years of age and older can get the new Tdap booster. Cover Your Cough and Wash Your Hands Whooping cough is spread by coughing and sneezing.

Please fax completed form to your District Health Department Georgia Department of Public Health Epidemiology Branch Varicella Specimen Collection and Shipping Instruct ions Laboratory confirmation of varicella zoster virus i s not normally required, because varicella diagnosi s is most commonly made by clinical assessment. However, the Georgia Department of Public Health recommends the collection of lesions to confirm a varicella case . To coordinate specimen collection and laboratory submission, call your District or County Health Department. Please do not send specimens directly to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (G PHL) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Specimen Collection Instructions: Viral Testing : To make a laboratory diagnosis of VZV infection u sing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, the presence of the virus DNA should be dem onstrated in tissues, vesicular fluid or crusts fro m lesions. We recommend the following methods for th e collection of specimens for PCR testing. As noted below, scabs generally contain sufficient viral DNA for amplification and as such are also useful specimens. Polyester Swab Method Use a sterile needle to unroof the top of the vesic le. Use a synthetic, sterile swab to vigorously swab the base of the le sion, applying enough pressure to collect epithelial cells without causing bleedin g, and collect vesicular fluid (collection of infected epithelial cells in the base of the lesion is important because they usually contain a significant amount of virus). Place swab into an empty tube, breakage-resistant s nap-cap or screw top tube. DO NOT PLACE TRANSPORT MEDIUM INTO THE TUBE; THE SP ECIMEN MUST BE KEPT DRY. Specimen can remain at room temperature. Glass Slide Method Rake the edge of the glass slide over the selected lesion, disrupting the lesion with sufficient vigor to ensure that skins cells are gathered onto the slide. Note: with young children, it may be less stressful if you ask them to help you with thi s. Use a synthetic , sterile swab to scrub the disrupted lesion and (u sing the same swab) collect the skin cells collected on the edge of the slide. Not e: if more than one lesion is sampled, a separate swab should be used for each one. Place the swab into an empty tube, breakage-resista nt snap-cap or screw top tube. Note: the swab for each sampled lesion must be placed in a separat e swab tube, but multiple tubes can be shipped in the same envelope. DO NOT PLACE TRANSPORT MEDIUM INTO THE TUBE; THE SP ECIMEN MUST BE KEPT DRY. Specimen can remain at room temperature. Crusts (Scabs) Remove a scab from the patient. Place specimen into empty tube, breakage-resistant snap cap or screw top tube. Specimen can remain at room temperature.

Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 2 A. Background In the United States, over 24,000 pregnant women te st positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) each year. In Georgia, the Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates between 500-1,000 births to hepatitis B s urface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women should be reported annually. Aside from antiv iral treatment, there is currently no cure for hepatitis B infection; however, there are methods to prevent perinatal transmission. Administering hepatitis B immune glob ulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine to an exposed infant within 24 hours of birth is 85 -95 percent effective in preventing both acute HBV infection and chronic infection. The purpose of the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Pr evention Program (PHBPP) is to ensure that infants born to hepatitis B surface ant igen (HBsAg)-positive women are given the opportunity to live their lives free of h epatitis B disease. Infants born to HBsAg-positive women are exposed to the virus throu gh contact with their mother's blood during delivery. Infants and children who be come infected with the hepatitis B virus have a 90 percent risk of becoming chronic ca rriers. These children are more likely to die prematurely from end-stage liver dise ase (hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis) as adults. Immunizing infants born to HB sAg-positive women with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the hepatitis B vaccine series can help prevent this tragic outcome. Identification of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in pr egnant women occurs through prenatal screening and reporting of HBsAg-positive results f rom the laboratory and/or physician to the state or local health department. To prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B, district perinatal hepatitis B case managers and st aff identify HBsAg-positive pregnant women during gestation and track their infants thro ugh completion of the post- vaccination serologic testing. Infants born to HBsA g-positive women should be administered HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, followed by hepatitis B vaccine at 1-2 months and 6 months of a ge. Testing and immunizing sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pregnant w omen also prevents transmission to susceptible individuals who are at high risk for the disease. Infected women should be informed by their medical care providers that an tiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B does exist and they should be encouraged to follo w up with a medical specialist after delivery. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m is funded through the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Di sease, Immunization Services Division, with technical support from CDC's Nationa l Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Since 1991, ever y state has received federal funding to support the Perinatal Hepatitis B Preven tion Program. Separate funding from the state has been allocated to each district to as sist with perinatal hepatitis B case management. These guidelines are to be used as a reference for the case management of HBsAg- positive pregnant women, their infants, and sexual/ household contacts. Emphasis is placed upon infant prophylaxis and post-vaccination serologic testing. The appendix contains several forms and tools that can be used d uring the case management process. Please adapt these materials to suit the needs of your health district's perinatal hepatitis B prevention program. Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3 B. Program Goals The goals of the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prev ention Program are to: Ensure that all pregnant women are screened for HB sAg as part of the initial prenatal screening panel Identify HBsAg-positive pregnant women and enroll them and their infants into the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m (PHBPP) Assure that local health departments perform case investigations on all HBsAg- positive pregnant women reported to their jurisdict ion Identify and refer household/sexual contacts of HB sAg-positive pregnant women for HBV testing and vaccination (HBsAg and an ti-HBs) Confirm that infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within twelve (12) hour s of birth Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women r eceive the second dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 1-2 months of age, and the t hird dose of hepatitis B vaccine at six (6) months of age Ensure that infants born to HBsAg-positive women ar e tested at nine (9) months to twelve (12) months of age for hepatitis B surfac e antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) after compl eting the hepatitis B vaccination series C. Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Program Eligibility R equirements Eligibility requirements for enrollment into Georgi a's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program include: Any pregnant women who tests HBsAg-positive (must reside in GA) Infants born to HBsAg-positive women (infant must be U.S. born & reside in GA) Sexual and household contacts of HBsAg-positive pr egnant women D. Universal Prenatal Screening for Hepatitis B The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (A CIP), The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), and The Americ an Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that all pregnant women be routinely tested for HBsAg at an early prenatal visit in each pregnancy. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program encourages all prenatal health p roviders to follow this recommendation. An additional test for HBsAg can be ordered later i n the pregnancy (approximately 34 weeks gestation) if the mother is at high risk for acquiring HBV infection (e.g., more than one sex partner during t he past six (6) months, recent history of STD, intravenous drug use, household con tact of a chronically HBV infected person). Pregnant women susceptible to hepatitis B virus (i. e., have never been infected) can and should be vaccinated a gainst the disease during pregnancy, especially if they are at high risk for infection ( see CDC \"Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women\" at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelin es.html ). Chapter 2 in this manual also addresses the hepatitis B vaccine sched ule and age appropriate dosage information. Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Tes ting and Vaccination,\" will provide a concise interpretation of the hepatitis B serolog y profile. Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 4 E. General Management of HBsAg-Positive Pregnant Women The following guidelines are recommended by the Geo rgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program and follow the recommendations o f the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the ACIP for manag ing an HBsAg-positive pregnant woman. 1. The client's physician should draw a prenatal se rologic panel at the time pregnancy is confirmed. While there is no law in Ge orgia mandating prenatal HBsAg testing, it is considered a standard of care for prenatal screening panels to include HBsAg serology. One of the following two scenarios may occur after the laboratory performs t he test: a. If the HBsAg test is NEGATIVE, the laboratory will report the results to the physician. The physician files the results i n the client's records and sends the information with the rest of her pren atal records to the hospital before delivery. b. If the HBsAg test is POSITIVE , the laboratory reports the results to the physician AND the Epidemiology Section at the Georgia Department of Health. The physician should inform the pregnant woman of her HBsAg-positive status, file the result s in the client's record, and forward an original copy of the patient 's HBsAg lab report with the rest of her prenatal records to the hospital prior to delivery. 2. The Epidemiology Section sends HBsAg-positive la boratory reports on all females between 10 and 50 years of age to the Georg ia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program for investigation. 3. The Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Pro gram reviews the laboratory reports for females 10 to 50 years of ag e that are HBsAg-positive. The program contacts the ordering physician to dete rmine the client's pregnancy status, estimated date of confinement (ED C) and delivery hospital for pregnant cases. 4. All pregnant HBsAg-positive women are entered in to the web-based tracking system (Perinatal SendSS), where it is available to the district perinatal hepatitis B case manager for case management. 5. All PREGNANT clients are contacted by the health district for co unseling about their infection and interviewed for sexual an d household contacts. Clients are reminded to alert medical personnel of their HBsAg status at the time of delivery. NOTE: All HBsAg-positive test results for pregnant women must be reported to either the local health department or the Georgi a Department of Public Health Epidemiology Section by the laboratory and health c are provider within seven (7) days of receiving positive results. Reporting is re quired by authority of the Official Code of Georgia Section 31-12-2, Official Code of G eorgia Section 31-22-7, Rules of the Department of Human Resources, chapter 290-5-3- 02. Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 5NOTE : Communicating the woman's HBsAg status to the deliv ery hospital's department of labor and delivery should be the resp onsibility of her healthcare provider . It is strongly recommended that the health distr ict make efforts to remind the healthcare provider and the h ospital of the woman's impending delivery at least four weeks before her EDC. An al ert letter should be sent to the hospital's labor & delivery unit and/or provider. S ee Appendix B-2 for a sample fax to use when notifying the hospital for this purpose. 6. The hepatitis B counseling interview should be p erformed in the client's native language. Each district has a Limited Englis h Proficient/Sensory Impaired (LEP/SI) Program Coordinator. This coordin ator can assist the district with the utilization of the language line. It is critical that she is aware of self-care and disease transmission in order to p rotect her own health and that of others. See the Example Interviewing/Counse ling Format for assistance (Appendix D-1 and Appendix D-2). 7. Any client who is chronically infected with hepa titis B should be encouraged to seek care with her physician so that her conditi on can be monitored routinely. Advise the client to discuss possible t reatment options with her physician that may improve her health outcome and o verall quality of life. F. General Management of Infants Born to HBsAg-Positiv e Women 1. Infants born to women who are HBsAg positive mus t receive HBIG and the appropriate dose of hepatitis B vaccine (see Sectio n 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelv e (12) hours of birth. NOTE : There is a seven (7) day window period to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not receive HBIG wit hin twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to locate the infant an d administer HBIG within seven (7) days, if the infant was released from the hospital before receiving this important prophylactic component. 2. The health district should contact either the cl ient or the delivery hospital close to the date of delivery to obtain: a. Infant's name, birth date, gender and birth weig ht, and b. Verification that the infant received HBIG and h epatitis B vaccine within twelve (12) hours of birth. c. Obtain the HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine administ ration dates and times After obtaining this information, the health distri ct should update the Perinatal SendSS case management tracking record, w here it will be available to the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prev ention Program. 3. The health district will notify the pediatric ca re provider and/or mother that the infant should receive the second dose of vaccin e, consult GRITS for verification that the vaccine was administered, and update Perinatal SendSS. Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 6REMINDER: Preterm infants with low birthweight (i.e. less tha n 2,000 grams or 4.4 pounds) have a decreased response to hepatitis B vaccine administered before 1 month of age. Infants born to HBsAg-posit ive women and who weigh less than 2,000 grams at birth should receive 4 dos es of vaccine using the following schedules: Single-antigen vaccine (e.g., Engerix-B or Recombivax-HB): dose #1 at birth, dose #2 at one month of age, dose #3 at 2 months of age and dose #4 at 6 months of age or Combination vaccine ( e.g., PEDIARIX): single- antigen vaccine dose #1 at birth, PEDIARIX vaccine dose #2 at 2 months of age, PEDIARIX dose #3 at 4 months of age and PEDIARIX do se #4 at 6 months of age). 4. The health district will notify the mother or le gal guardian to take the infant for the third dose of vaccine, verify that vaccine was given, and update Perinatal SendSS for further tracking. 5. District perinatal hepatitis B case managers wil l document updated infant information in Perinatal SendSS for each subsequent dose of vaccine and monitor for when any dose of hepatitis B vaccine is overdue. 6. The hepatitis B post-vaccination serologic testi ng (PVST) should be obtained when the child is 9-12 months old. If the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine is given late, the child must have received the third dose a minimum of 30 days before obtaining the PVST. When the test results (HBsAg and anti-HBs) are known, the health district will update Perinatal SendSS and document the case as complete. Note : The health district has the discretion to send th e parent/guardian and infant to a local public health clinic for the PVST (HBsAg an d anti-HBs), if testing is not otherwise affordable to the family. The local healt h department, health district or private physician can send the blood sample to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory where specimen processing will be perfor med at no charge to the infant's parent/guardian. District Immunization Pro gram budgets must cover the costs of testing according to Public Health Master Agreement Annex 066 (Immunization). 7. If the test is NEGATIVE for HBsAg and POSITIVE for anti-HBs , the infant is considered IMMUNE to hepatitis B and the perinatal case is closed. 8. If the test is NEGATIVE for BOTH HBsAg and anti-HBs, the infant is considered SUSCEPTIBLE to hepatitis B infection, and should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and retested 1-2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs remains <10 mI U/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additi onal doses of HepB vaccine, followed by testing 1-2 months later. Available data do not suggest a benefit from administering additional HepB vaccine doses to infants who have not attained anti-HBs >10 mIU/mL following receipt of two complete HepB vaccine series. The parents/guardian should be counseled regarding the infant's negative results and susceptible status. The perinatal hepatitis B case is closed fo r the infant after the Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 7second or third PVST is completed. 9. If the test is POSITIVE for HBsAg and NEGATIVE for anti-HBs , the infant is INFECTED and should be referred to the pediatrician for sub sequent follow-up and specialist referrals . This infection is a notifiable disease that should be reported as a hepatitis B infection throu gh SendSS and will be reported to the CDC by the Epidemiology Section. The perinatal hepatitis B case is then considered closed. G. Management of Infants Born to Women with Unknown HB sAg Status 1. Infants born to women whose HBsAg status is unknown at the time of delivery should receive hepatitis B vaccine at the appropriate dosage per manufacturer (see Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") within twelve (12) hours of delivery. The woman should be tested in the hospital at the time of delivery and an expedited HBsAg test should be run to determine her status. If the mothe r's test is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible, pre ferably before hospital discharge. REMINDER: There is a seven (7) day window period to administer HBIG if an infant born to an HBsAg-positive woman did not rece ive HBIG within twelve (12) hours of delivery. Every effort should be made to l ocate the infant and administer HBIG within seven (7) days, if the infant was relea sed from the hospital prior to administration. 2. The hospital laboratory and physician are requir ed by law (see Note under Section E, 1-b) to report a positive HBsAg test wit hin seven (7) days to the Georgia Department of Public Health, Epidemiology S ection. 3. Upon receipt of a maternal HBsAg-positive serolo gy report from the hospital, the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Progra m (GA PHBPP Coordinator or health district) will obtain the inf ant's vaccination history and enter the infant into the Perinatal SendSS tracking system to be followed as indicated in Section F, \"General Management of Infa nts Born to HBsAg- positive Women.\" If the mother is determined to be HBsAg-negative, the infant should receive the hepatitis B vaccine accor ding to the schedule recommended by the ACIP for infants born to HBsAg-n egative women, that is, first dose at birth, second dose at 1 to 2 mont hs and third dose at 6 to18 months of age. NOTE: When the mother is HBsAg-negative but is at high ri sk for hepatitis B infection, she should be vaccinated as soon as poss ible. Hepatitis B vaccine is not contraindicated during pregnancy. 4. Upon completion of the three-dose or four-dose v accination series, infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers need to undergo post -vaccination serologic testing (PVST), in order to document immunity or in fection status. If the infant does not have insurance to cover the PVST ex pense or the pediatric provider refuses to collect the PVST, the district case manager should assist with arrangements to refer the infant to a nearby p ublic health clinic for the Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 8blood test. (See Appendix K-2 for GPHL sample submi H. Management of Sexual/Household Contacts of HBsAg-Po sitive Pregnant Women 1. When health districts receive Perinatal Hepatiti s B Prevention Program referrals of HBsAg-positive pregnant women, appropriate distr ict personnel should make every effort to interview these women for household and sexual contacts. The contact interview should take place during the init ial counseling session with the woman. It is imperative to identify younger contact s of the HBsAg-positive client due to the high risk for chronic infection in child ren aged five (5) years and younger. (See Section III, \"Example Interviewing/Co unseling Format\", Appendix D-1, for further information.) 2. Household and sexual contacts of HBsAg-positive women are at increased risk of infection; therefore, it is important to test conta cts for HBsAg and anti-HBs (See Appendix H-1, \"Hepatitis B Facts: Testing and Vacc ination\"). Order these tests at the same visit when the contact receives the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine, but draw the blood for serology before administering va ccine . The test can be sent to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory using Form 3583: https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files /related_files/site_page/GPHL %20Lab%20Submission%20Form_Fillable.docx 3. Sexual and household contacts should be vaccinat ed during their first visit to a medical provider with the age-appropriate dose of h epatitis B vaccine. Vaccine must be given according to the ACIP recommended sch edule. See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\" of this manual for information on the hepatitis B vaccine dosage and s cheduling for infants, children and adults. 4. HBIG can be given to sexual contacts of pregnant women diagnosed with acute hepatitis B infection (e.g., HBV infection of less than six (6) months duration with or without symptoms of hepatitis and/or positive an ti-HBc IgM), when the last sexual exposure occurred within fourteen (14) days of administration. Administer HBIG and vaccine during the same visit, in two diff erent body sites. HBIG can also be given to those household contacts that have not had sexual exposure, but have had known blood exposure to an acute case of h epatitis B within the past seven (7) days. 5. To calculate HBIG dosage for persons one (1) yea r of age through adulthood, use 0.06 mL per kilogram of body weight or 0.06 mL per 2.2 pounds of body weight. For example, for an adult weighing 140 poun ds, the weight would be divided by 2.2 to obtain the equivalent in kilogram s, then multiplied by 0.06 to obtain the HBIG dosage. Example: 140 lbs. \u00f7 2.2 = 63.636 kg, rounded up to 64 kg 64 kg x 0.06 mL = 3.84 mL of HBI G 6. If it is determined that the contact is infected (HBsAg-positive) or has immunity (HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive) to infection , no further doses of vaccine are to be given. Report the infected case using Se ndSS. If the contact is susceptible to infection, that is, HBsAg-negative a nd anti-HBs-negative, then complete the vaccine series. (See Appendix H-4 for hepatitis B serology interpretations.) Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 9 7. Each susceptible contact should be followed and reminded to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series at the appropriate inter vals (See Section 2, \"Recommended Schedule and Guidelines, Hepatitis B\") . The district case manager is responsible for documenting tests and va ccinations in Perinatal SendSS for sexual and household contacts of a HBsAg -infected woman. 8. Contacts that are infected with hepatitis B shou ld be counseled about the disease and its transmission and reported in SendSS. The \"E xample Interviewing/Counseling Format\" is a useful guide f or this situation. (See Appendix D-1) I. Finding Clients That are Lost to Follow Up Ask if provider received request to transfer recor ds to another provider (there may be contact information available for the new pr ovider). Request CLEAR search (contact GA PHBPP Coordinator ). Call telephone information 411 to see if you can lo cate the lost contact. Use Internet search engines (e.g., Google), white p ages (whitepages.com), and United States Postal Service online (USPS.com) to search for contact information. Try old telephone numbers. Relatives/friends with i nformation on the patient might still be reached at those numbers. Look in directories that list occupants of each hou sehold in the city. Most sexually transmitted disease (STD) programs have su ch directories. Transpose digits in telephone numbers and addresses . Try \"Street\" instead of \"Avenue\" and vise versa. Ask neighbors, landlords, and apartment rental off ices. Ask mail carriers; they cannot give you addresses, by law, but might confirm whether or not the patient lives at the address. Ask the post office for the forwarding address. You may have to complete a justification form provided by the postal service a nd show your health department identification. The STD case manager may have local procedures. Search health department records. Ask other state and local agencies and programs (e. g., Medicaid, WIC programs, Department of Family and Child Services, parole and probation offices) for contact information. J. Required Reports and Case Updates for Perinatal Hep atitis B Prevention in Georgia Each month, the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Preve ntion Program will review case information about any cases that are due for activi ty during that month, such as vaccination, blood tests, deliveries, etc. The dis trict case manager is expected to update Perinatal SendSS at least weekly and alert t he Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program to any questionable or concernin g information about a case. Prompt documentation of case information in Perinat al SendSS allows for efficient maintenance of the tracking system and thus timely disease prevention. The updates will be used to complete state and federal annual r eports including the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Report requested annually by the CDC. If timely case Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 10 management is not being performed over a period of several months, a letter of concern may be sent to the District Clinical Coordi nator and District Health Director requesting assistance with problem solving future P erinatal Hepatitis B case management within that district. K. Glossary of Terms EDC Estimated date of confinement or the approximate da y that a woman's infant is expected to be born (aka: due date). Viral Hepatitis Inflammation of the liver as a result of viral infe ction. HBV Hepatitis B virus, the agent that causes hepatitis B virus infection . HBsAg HBsAg is the most commonly used test for diagnosing acute HBV infections or detecting chronic infections (carrier s). HBsAg can be detected as early as 1 or 2 weeks and as late as 11 or 12 weeks after exposure to HBV when sensitive assays are use d. The presence of HBsAg indicates that a person is infect ious, regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic. HBeAg Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is associated with active H BV replication, high concentrations of HBV in serum, and high infectivit y (increased risk of transmission); appears in early infection and pe rsists for variable length of time (from weeks to years). Anti-HBs Antibody to HBsAg is associated with long-term prot ection against reinfection and, in most persons, persists for many years after natural infection. Anti-HBs is also produced as an immune response to hepatitis B vaccine or is passively transferred when HBIG is administered. Anti-HBs is currently measured by ra dioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-HBc Anti-HBc (core antibody) develops in all HBV infect ions, appears shortly after HBsAg in acute disease, and indicates HBV infection at some undefined time in the past. Anti-HBc only occu rs after HBV infection and does not develop in persons whose imm unity to HBV is from vaccine. Anti-HBc generally persists for life and is not a serologic marker for acute infection. IgM Anti-HBc IgM anti-HBc appears in persons with acute disease about the time of illness onset and indicates recent infection wit h HBV. IgM anti- HBc is generally detectable for 4 to 6 months after onset of illness and is the best serologic marker of acute HBV infec tion. A negative test for IgM-anti-HBc together with a positive test for HBsAg in a single blood sample identifies a chronic HBV infect ion. Georgia Immunization Program Manual D epartment of Public Health Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines Georgia Immunization Program 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 11 HBsAg Chronic Carriage Through serologic testing, a person is confirmed as an HBsAg carrier (chronic infection) when: 1) HBsAg is detec ted on at least two tests, spaced a minimum of six (6) months apart; or 2) the results of a single serum specimen are HBsAg positive and IgM anti-HBc negative. Carriers may be asymptomatic and unaware that they are infected with HBV. Because they carry HBsAg in the ir blood, they are capable of infecting others. HBIG Hepatitis B immune globulin is a preparation obtain ed from the blood plasma from donor pools selected for a high antibod y content of anti- HBs. In some situations, HBIG is administered post -exposure with hepatitis B vaccine to provide additional protectio n against HBV infection. References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hepatitis B can be a serious disease. Not only does this virus affect your liver, but also it can be passed to your baby at the time of birth. To be protected from this disease, your baby will need to get several shots. The first two (2) shots are given within a few hours after birth. They are hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and dose 1 of hepatitis B vaccine. Your baby will later need dose 2 of hepatitis B vaccine at one or two months of age and dose 3 at six months of age. After completing these shots, your baby's doctor will do some blood tests to see if your baby is protected. The blood test should be done when the baby is between 9 and 12 months of age. In some cases, the baby may need more shots to prevent infection. It is possible that your sexual partner and other people living in your household could get infected. We recommend that they be tested and vaccinated for hepatitis B also, if they haven't been already. It is important that you discuss with your doctor whether you need further follow up for your infection. Your doctor may refer you to a gastroenterologist (GI doctor) who specializes in liver diseases. We encourage you to show this letter to your doctor and later to your baby's doctor.

The Jade Ribbon is folded like the Chinese character for people \" \" to symbolize the united voices of those /f_ighting hepatitis B and liver cancer worldwide. Protect yourself and your baby with the rst \"anti-cancer vaccine\" If you have not been infected, get vaccinated Hepatitis B can still be transmitted through unprotected sex and contaminated blood (sharing toothbrushes, razors, or needles for tattoos/piercings). The 3 shots given over 6 months are safe, even during pregnancy. The hepatitis B vaccine is so eective in preventing HBV and liver cancer that it is known as the /f_irst \"anti-cancer vaccine. \" Make sure your baby is vaccinated at birth Since 1991, U.S. national guidelines have recommended that all newborns be vaccinated against HBV. The 3 shots can protect your baby for life against hepatitis B, reducing the risk of liver cancer and liver damage in the future. Time Infant should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine The vaccine is safe, even for premature babies. ) +,HBV and Moms-to-Be Hepatitis B (HBV) is the most common serious viral infection of the liver, and can lead to premature death from liver cancer or liver failure. In the U.S., approximately 10-15 people die every day as a result of HBV infection. Hepatitis B can be transmitted from an infected mother to her child during the birthing process. Newborns who become infected with HBV have a 90% chance of developing chronic (lifelong) infection. Fortunately, HBV can be prevented with a very safe and effective vaccine. Ask your doctor for the results of your HBV test Most people with chronic HBV infection have no symptoms. As an expecting mother, you should have already been tested for HBV with the following blood test: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Tells if you have chronic hepatitis B (also known as being a hepatitis B carrier).7 7 7 7 7 ET ake extra precautions if you are a mom with HBV During pregnancy: Currently, antiviral HBV treatments are not recommended during pregnancy. If you are already on treatment, talk to your doctor. At time of birth: In addition to the /f_irst shot of the hepatitis B vaccine, make sure your newborn receives the hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) shot. Time Infant born to mother with HBV should receive At birth birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) 1-2 months 2nd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 6 months 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine 9-18 months HBsAg and anti-HBs* tests to con/f_irm that your child is protected * The hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) blood test checks for protection against HBV. Cesarean sections (C-sections) have not been found to prevent HBV transmission from mother to child. Hepatitis B vaccination along with the HBIG shot is the best way to protect your newborn against HBV infection. In the rst 6 months: It is critical for your child to complete the hepatitis B vaccine series on time. This will be more than 95% effective in protecting your newborn against HBV infection. Breastfeeding is safe for your baby. HBV is not transmitted through breast milk.Moms with HBV You're important too! Remember to get screened for liver disease You probably have no symptoms and feel healthy, but are still at increased risk for liver damage or liver cancer. However, regular screening and appropriate treatment can reduce this risk and help you lead a normal, healthy life. Ask your doctor for the following tests: Every Test Screens for 6 months ALT blood test liver damage AFP blood test liver cancer 1 year ultrasound liver cancer Don't rush into treatment Not every person with chronic HBV infection needs treatment. But if your ALT level is elevated, treatment with antiviral medication may be appropriate. Be sure to review all medications with your doctor. Even some over-the-counter or herbal medications can injure your liver. Get the hepatitis A vaccine Avoid drinking alcohol Protect your loved ones Make sure your family and partner are tested for HBV, and vaccinated if they are not already protected. Your local health department may contact you to ensure your baby is fully protected against HBV.%% +)E ,+ Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 1Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B I. Introduction, professional role, and purpose Purpose: To let the patient know what is going to take place is to his/her benefit, that he /she is going to be dealing with a competent person, and that there should be no fears about discussing otherwise personal information. A. Introduce yourself and anyone else present to the patient. B. Tell the patient that you have been trained and have experience in helping people who have hepatitis B to understand and manage their disease. C. Inform the patient that part of your job is to ensure that no one else find out about the patient's infection and that problems are minimized for everyone who may be involved. II. Patient Assessment Purpose: To establish rapport, get the patient accustomed to talking, reduce the possibility of patient concerns interfering with the rest of the process, gather information that can be used in later sections, and give the patient sufficient information to be able to understand and support disease intervention behaviors. Targeted medical information can preempt inappropriate strategies that the patient may be developing to take care of the problem. By getting the patient to talk during this section, issues may arise that can be used as motivations or as benchmarks against inconsistencies later on in the interview/counseling session. A. Patient Concerns 1. Ask the patient about problems or questions regarding the disease and how it has been handled thus far. 2. Address concerns even if they are involved in other elements of the format. B. Socio-sexual Information 1. Question patient conversationally about where he/she lives, telephone number, alternate locating information, who living with, employment, travel, recreation social groups. 2. Question the patient about current employment and/or past jobs where they may have had to handle blood or other body fluids. 3. Explain reasons for questions if patient shows signs of concern. C. Medical History and Disease Comprehension 1. Ask what patient knows about the disease. 2. Compliment correct responses, tactfully correct any misconceptions, and add any information that directly supports disease intervention behaviors. 3. Ask about past hepatitis/liver problems. 4. Impress upon the patient that the disease is serious, people usually don't know that they have it until it is too late, that routine tests may not discover the disease, and that it is often passed unintentionally.

Hepatitis - 2/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 2Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 III. Disease Intervention Behaviors A. Assure examination of household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts 1. Explain that the medical facts just discussed clearly show that the patient's household contacts, sexual contacts, and needle-sharing contacts are in need of an exam as soon as possible. 2. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the children in the home. 3. Explain that other adults in the household need to be notified that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done so that they can be tested for the infection and given vaccine as necessary. 4. Ask for the names and birthdays of all the adults in the house besides the husband/boyfriend. 5. Explain that the sex partners and needle-sharing partners (sex/NS partners) need to be notified privately that they have been exposed to someone with a serious disease. This has to be done in a way that doesn't embarrass them or the patient, but ensures that the examination takes place immediately by someone who knows enough about the circumstances to do the right things medically. 6. Tell the patient that you can work together to come up with the plan for notifying the sex/NS partners, and that you have to know about each of the sex/NS partners since a certain date in order to do that. 7. If the patient seems hesitant about talking about sex/NS partners, problem solve and explain the different plans and give different examples of how you would handle referrals. 8. Ask for the names of each of the sex/NS partners since the significant date you have established for the interview period. Do not be concerned if the patient doesn't supply the whole name, but emphasize that you want to discuss every partner during that period, regardless of how much they know about them. Continue to probe for partners even after the patient has indicated there are no more. Use some other identifier for sex/NS partners if the patient can't remember a name or nickname. 9. When further probing fails to produce other sex/NS partners, ask and record the last date of exposure beside each person's name. 10. Confront problems indicated by exposure gaps and conflicts with previously gathered information. 11. If you have not already done so, explain referral methods. 12. Gather locating information including full name, nicknames, address, telephone numbers, living-with status, employment, age, race, sex, marital status, physical descriptions, directions to home, description of home, etc. 13. Determine methods of sex/NS partner referral for each partner and agree to best approaches. 14. Coach patient on any contact referrals (referrals they prefer to make, themselves) and give guidelines and deadlines. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 2/2018 Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines 3Interviewing/Counseling Format Hepatitis B Appendix D-1 B. Reduce Risk Purpose: This section is important for all patients to hear, but is especially important for those who appear to have contracted the infection sexually. The information should be tailored to each patient. 1. The patient should be instructed that it is possible for her to spread the hepatitis B virus to others. She should be told of ways to prevent this spread: a. Household articles that could become contaminated with blood (such as toothbrushes, nail clippers and razors) should not be shared. b. Cuts or skin lesions should be covered to prevent the spread of infectious secretions or blood. c. When seeking medical or dental care, those responsible for care should be informed of HBsAg status. d. If sexual partner(s) are not immune to hepatitis B, the partner should be advised to take precautions, including \"safer sex\" and vaccination, if warranted. e. \"Safer sex\" should be practiced for the prevention of many sexually transmitted diseases, including hepatitis B, syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia infection, and HIV/AIDS. f. Blood, plasma, body organs, other tissue or sperm should not be donated. g. Enroll or stay in a drug treatment program if using illicit drugs. 2. Medical follow-up is needed for evaluation of chronic hepatitis B. Patients with progressive liver disease may need to be referred to a liver specialist for consideration of interferon therapy. 3. Other recommendations include: a. Limiting the number of sex partners. b. Limiting anonymous sex. c. Routine checkups for STDs and liver function. C. Respond to Disease Suspicion Purpose: In spite of current status, the patient should understand how to respond to signs that the infection has worsened. 1. Discuss clinical symptoms of hepatitis B. 2. Tell patient to return to provider immediately if symptoms appear. D. Complete Vaccine Series for All Exposed Purpose: The understanding of the multi-dose regimen is particularly important and these messages should be delivered in concert with individualized pamphlets. The case manager should be reinforcing messages expressed by the provider and verifying that the patient understands and intends to comply with the plan. 1. Emphasize the need for all exposed to complete the series, especially the baby and children of the household. Remind the patient that she is directly responsible for her baby's and other children's health. She should remind the nurses and her baby's doctor that she is a carrier of hepatitis B virus and her baby needs to complete the high- risk vaccine series. 2. Establish a specific schedule so that the patient is aware when the vaccine is due to be given to her baby. 3. Discuss contraindications and potential side effects.

The schedule is: HBIG & hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, hepatitis B vaccine at 1 month, 2 months and 6 months of age. The Pediarix \u00ae schedule is HBIG & single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, followed by Pediarix\u00ae doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. 3 Blood for the PVST should not be collected before 9 months of age AND must be drawn a minimum of 30 days after final hepatitis B vaccine dose, if infant is completing the hepatitis B series after the recommended intervals. Postvaccination Serologic Testing (PVST) Laboratory Interpretations For more information or to locate your local health department's perinatal hepatitis B case manager, visit the Georgia Department of Public Health's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program website: dph.georgia.gov/perinatal-hepatitis-bImmune to HepB Additional HepB doses neededInfected with HBV Report to Negative anti-HBs Negative NegativeHBsAg anti-HBs Positive NegativeWhat is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is an infectious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). HBV attacks the liver and can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and premature death. How is hepatitis B transmitted? HBV is transmitted through contact with infectious blood or body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from an infected mother to her newborn during delivery. When is an infant at high-risk for hepatitis B? Infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are considered high-risk. How can hepatitis B be prevented at birth? Administering hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) within 24 hours of birth is 85%-95% effective in preventing perinatal HBV infection. Is there a specific immunization schedule that needs to be followed for HBV-exposed infants? Yes. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and HepB (birth dose) should be administered within 12 hours of birth. HepB dose two should be administered at 1-2 months of age and the third dose should be administered at 6 months of age. After the birth dose, infants receiving Pediarix \u00ae should receive doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. What if my practice identifies a HBV-exposed newborn that did not receive HBIG before hospital discharge? Administering HBIG within 12 hours of birth is recommended; however, it can be administered up to 7 days after birth. The infant should be referred urgently to the Mother/Baby department of the delivery hospital for immediate administration of HBIG. If more than 7 days have passed, it is too late to administer HBIG. However, ensure that the HepB birth dose was given, and strictly adhere to the recommended intervals for subsequent doses. My patient was born to an HBV-infected mother and weighed less than 2,000 grams (4.4 lbs.) at birth. Why does this infant need 4 doses of HepB? The immune response to HepB is less reliable in newborns weighing less than 2,000 grams. HBV-exposed infants must receive HBIG and HepB within 12 hours of birth. The HepB birth dose should not be counted as part of the series and the infant should receive three additional doses beginning at 1 month of age, followed by a third dose 1-2 months after the second and a fourth dose at 6 months of age. Infants receiving Pediarix \u00ae should receive HBIG and the single-antigen birth dose followed by Pediarix\u00ae doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. What is postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) and why is it necessary? Postvaccination serologic testing (PVST) is recommended for infants and children born to hepatitis B-infected mothers. Serologic testing confirms whether the child has developed immunity or has been infected with HBV . The PVST should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) only. Testing should occur between 9 and 12 months of age. Why must providers wait until the infant is 9 months of age to collect the PVST? Labs collected before 9 months of age can provide inaccurate anti-HBs results by detecting the antibody from HBIG adminis- tered at birth and not actual response to the hepatitis B vaccine. Also, for infants who receive HBIG at birth but still develop HBV infection, there can be a prolonged incubation period. Waiting until 9 months of age can maximize detection of late HBV infection. Can collection of the PVST be delayed until the infant is older? After primary immunization with HepB, anti-HBs concentrations decline rapidly within the first year. This decline may result in a negative/non-reactive anti-HBs result, making it difficult to determine if this child has waned immunity or vaccine failure and leading to unnecessary revaccination. For this reason, providers are encouraged to test at 9-12 months of age (or 1-2 months after the final dose of the HepB series, if doses were delayed). What if my patient's HBsAg and anti-HBs results are negative after completing the HepB series? The child should be re-vaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and tested 1-2 months later. If the anti-HBs remains negative (<10 mIU/mL), the child should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine, followed by testing 1-2 months after the last dose. If immunity is still not present after two complete HepB series, counsel the child's parents or guardian on risk reduction strategies for vaccine non-responders. What if my patient is infected with HBV? Hepatitis B is a reportable condition in Georgia. Report the HBsAg-positive result to the Georgia Department of Public Health within 7 days of diagnosis. Refer the child to a pediatric specialist for further evaluation. The child's family and caretakers should be educated about avoiding blood exposure. My HBV-exposed patient has other siblings that I care for in my practice. Do they need follow-up? Yes. Household contacts including other siblings should be tested and vaccinated against HBV , if found to be susceptible. What if the infant was adopted or the mother's HBsAg-status is unknown? Verify the child's immunization history beginning at birth. Administer any missing HepB doses, followed by PVST at 9-12 months of age.Common Questions about Perinatal Hepatitis B All immunizations must be reported to the Georgia Department of Public Health via the Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services (GRITS) system within 30 days of vaccine administration. For more information, visit the Georgia Department of Public Health's Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program website at dph.georgia.gov/perinatal-hepatitis-b RE: \"Public Health\" Exceptions to HIPAA Dear Colleague: From time to time, we receive questions from physicians and other health care providers who are concerned that federal privacy regulations prevent them from reporting patient information to local h ealth departments or to the Department of Public Health. The \"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\" (HIPAA), enacted by Congress in 1996, protects the confidentiality of the patient's personal health information. However, HIPAA and its acco mpanying regulations strike a balance between a health care provider's duty of confidentiality and the need to protect the public's health. Federal HIPAA regulations stipulate that patient health information may be provided to state public health authoriti es, with or without the patient's consent, in many different circumstances. Those circumstances include the following: A health care provider \"may disclose protected health information for the public health activities and purposes described in this paragr aph to a public health authority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability, including, but not limited to, the reporting of disease, injury, vital events such as birth or death, and the conduct of public health surveillance, public health investigations and public health intervention,\" 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512(b)(1)(i); and A health care provider \"may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduc t, use or disclose protected health information, if the [provider] in good faith believes the use or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public, and is to a person or persons reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat, including the target of the threat,\" 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.512(j)(1)(i).

CDC states it is not necessary for the patient to disclose a risk factor to receive hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who are at risk for sexual exposure: Sexually active persons who are not in long-term, mutually monogamous relationships Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons Persons seeking evaluation or treatment for an STD Men who have sex with men Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood: Injection-drug users, current or past Household contacts of HBsAg-positive persons Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally challenged persons Healthcare and public safety workers with reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids Persons with end-stage renal disease and those receiving dialysis Others: Travelers to areas with moderate or high rates of HBV infection Persons with chronic (life-long) liver disease Persons with HIV infection Refugees, immigrants, and adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic should have hepatitis B testing. Adults should discuss their need or desire for hepatitis B vaccination with their healthcare providers. For certain people at risk, p ostvaccination testing is recommended. Consult ACIP recommendations for details (see references). www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2110.pdf Item #P2110 (6/10) Who should be vaccinated? Hepatitis B lab nomenclature HBsAg: Hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of infectivity. Its presence indicates either acute or chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBs: Antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen is a marker of immunity. Its presence indicates an immune response to HBV infection, an immune response to vaccination, or the presence of passively acquired antibody. (It is also known as HBsAb, but this abbreviation is best avoided since it is often confused with abbreviations such as HBsAg.) Anti-HBc (total): Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen is a nonspecific marker of acute, chronic, or resolved HBV infection. It is not a marker of vaccine- induced immunity. It may be used in prevaccination testing to determine previous exposure to HBV infection. (It is also known as HBcAb, but this abbre - viation is best avoided since it is often confused with other abbreviations.) IgM anti-HBc: IgM antibody subclass of anti-HBc. Positivity indicates recent infection with HBV (within the past 6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection. HBeAg: Hepatitis B \"e\" antigen is a marker of a high degree of HBV infectivity, and it correlates with a high level of HBV replication. It is primarily used to help determine the clinical management of patients with chronic HBV infection. Anti-HBe: Antibody to hepatitis B \"e\" antigen may be present in an infected or immune person. In persons with chronic HBV infection, its presence suggests a low viral titer and a low degree of infectivity. HBV-DNA: HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid is a marker of viral replication. It correlates well with infectivity. It is used to assess and monitor the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.Managing chronic HBV infection When you identify a patient who is chronically infected with HBV, make sure you consult a specialist knowledgeable in the treatment of liver disease so your patient's care is optimized. Chronically infected persons need medi - cal evaluation every 6-12 months to assess the status of their liver health and their need for antiviral therapy, as well as to screen for liver cancer. In addition, persons with chronic HBV infection should be educated about their disease and how to protect others. Household members and sex partners should be tested for HBV infection (HBsAg and antiHBs) and given the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at the same visit. (Vaccinating a person who has already been infected will do no harm). If testing indicates HBV susceptibility, complete the hepatitis B vaccination series. If testing indicates the presence of HBV infection, consultation and further care with a physician knowledgeable about chronic hepatitis B is needed. Serologic testing prior to vaccination may be undertaken based on your as - sessment of your patient's level of risk and your or your patient's need for definitive information (see information in the left column). If you decide to test, draw the blood first, and then give the first dose of vaccine at the same office visit. Vaccination can then be continued, if needed, based on the results of the tests. If you are not sure who needs hepatitis B testing, consult your state or local health department.About hepatitis B serologic testing Immunization Action Coalition 1573 St. Paul, MN 55104 (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccineinformation.org 1.

Sincerely, ____________________________________ ____________________________________ Clinician's signature Clinician's name (print or type)What the Physician Can Do to Help the Child with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection Sarah Jane Schwarzenberg, M.D. Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition University of Minnesota Although children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may follow many different clinical courses, these recommendations will help all of them maintain good health. 1. A yearly physical Every child with hepatitis B needs a yearly check-up with his/her primary physician to make sure the child is healthy and growing normally. 2. Laboratory studies to monitor liver health At the first clinical visit, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), INR, a complete blood count, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasound are usually obtained. Thereafter, liver enzymes should be checked yearly in the healthy child with HBV . 3. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma There are no definitive guidelines for screening children with HBV for hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP is a tumor marker and is increased in 85% of individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma, often before clinical evidence of cancer is present. It may be elevated at a time when the tumor can be resected completely. We recommend yearly AFP in the child with HBV , and twice yearly testing with hepatic ultrasound in the child with cirrhosis and HBV . It should be noted that even close monitoring of these tests does not guarantee early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 4. Hepatitis B testing every 3-5 years Few children convert from HBsAg to anti-HBs (HBsAb), especially if they acquired the disease in the perinatal period. It is important to occasionally check to see if the patient is still infected. 5. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist Any child with an AST >2 times the upper limit of normal, evidence of hepatic dysfunction, failure to thrive, an elevated AFP, a need for family counseling, or abnormalities on hepatic ultrasound should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for evaluation. 6. Treatment Although medications are available to treat hepatitis B, they are generally useful only in patients with on-going hepatic injury (active hepatitis). Consultation with a pediatric gastroenterologist will help identify those patients who would benefit from medical therapy. 7. Vaccination of household members All members of the child's household and caregivers who have close contact with the child should be vaccinated against hepatitis B, even if pregnant. 8. Hepatitis B education Each child with hepatitis B and his/her parents should receive age-appropriate hepatitis B education. This should include methods for prevention of transmission of the virus and assistance for the child in dealing with his/her positivity throughout the school years and as a teenager. Older children should receive counseling on the use of condoms to prevent viral transmission to their sexual partners. 9. Maintaining personal health Immunization against hepatitis A is recommended to prevent a second injury to the liver. Ethanol should be avoided. When prescribing other medications, care must be taken to avoid or monitor those with known hepatotox - icity.

Different serologic \"markers\" or combinations of markers are used to identify different phases of HBV infection and to determine whether a patient has acute or chronic HBV infection, is immune to HBV as a result of prior infection or vaccination, or is susceptible to infection.Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): A protein on the surface of hepatitis B virus; it can be detected in high levels in serum during acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The presence of HBsAg indicates that the person is infectious. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection. HBsAg is the antigen used to make hepatitis B vaccine. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs): The presence of anti-HBs is generally interpreted as indicating recovery and immunity from hepatitis B virus infection. Anti-HBs also develops in a person who has been successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. Total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc): Appears at the onset of symptoms in acute hepatitis B and persists for life. The presence of anti-HBc indicates previous or ongoing infection with hepatitis B virus in an unde ned time frame. IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc): Positivity indicates recent infection with hepatitis B virus ( <6 mos). Its presence indicates acute infection. Tests Results Interpretation HBsAg negative Susceptible anti-HBc negative anti-HBs negative HBsAg negative Immune due to natural infection anti-HBc positive anti-HBs positive HBsAg negative Immune due to hepatitis B vaccination anti-HBc negative anti-HBs positive HBsAg positive Acutely infected anti-HBc positive IgM anti-HBc positive anti-HBs negative HBsAg positive Chronically infected anti-HBc positive IgM anti-HBc anti-HBs negative HBsAg negative Interpretation unclear; four possibilities: anti-HBc positive 1.

Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem that affects people of all ages in the U.S. and around the world. In 2006, an estimated 46,000 people contracted hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the U.S. Hepatitis B is caused by a highly infectious virus that attacks the liver and can lead to severe illness, liver damage, and in some cases, death. The best way to be protected from hepa - titis B is to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, a vaccine used in the U.S. for more than two decades and proved safe and effective. Who is at risk for HBV infection? About 5% of people in the U.S. will get infected with HBV sometime during their lives if they are not vaccinated. You might be infected with HBV and not even know it. If you engage in certain activities, your risk might be much higher. You might be at risk if you have a job that exposes you to human blood share a household with someone who has chronic (lifelong) HBV infection inject drugs have sex with a person infected with HBV are sexually active but not in a long- term, mutually monogamous relation - ship are a man who has sex with men received a blood transfusion before 1975, when excellent blood testing became available are a person who was born, or who has a parent born, in Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East were adopted from Asia, Africa, the Amazon River Basin in South America, the Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, or the Middle East have hemophilia are a patient or worker in an institution for developmentally challenged people are an inmate of a correctional facility travel internationally to areas with mod- erate or high rates of HBV infection How is HBV spread? HBV is found in the blood of people infected with the virus and certain of their body fluids, such as serum, semen, and vaginal secretions. HBV is not found in sweat, tears, urine, or respiratory secre - tions. Contact with microscopic amounts of infected blood can cause infection. Hepatitis B virus can be spread by unprotected sex injection drug use an HBV-infected mother to her child during birth contact with blood or open sores of an HBV-infected person human bites from an HBV-infected person sharing a household with a person with chronic (lifelong) HBV infection sharing items such as razors, tooth - brushes, or washcloths pre-chewing food for babies or sharing chewing gum using unsterilized needles in ear- or body-piercing, tattooing, or acupuncture using the same immunization needle on more than one personHepatitis B virus IS NOT spread by casual contact, like holding hands eating food prepared by an infected person kissing or hugging sharing silverware, plates, or cups visiting an infected person's home sneezing or coughing breastfeeding What are the symptoms of hepatitis B? Most babies and young children who get HBV infection don't look or feel sick at all. About half of adults who get infected don't have any symptoms or signs of the disease. If people do have signs or symp - toms, they might experience any or all of the following: loss of appetite nausea, vomiting fever weakness, fatigue, inability to work for weeks or months abdominal pain yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) joint pain cola-colored urine clay-colored stools I'm not in a risk group. How did I get HBV infection? Many people don't know when or how they got the infection. When they get the results of a blood test indicating they've been infected with HBV , they are taken by surprise. Studies have demonstrated that about 15% of people who acquire hepatitis B are unable to identify a risk factor that explains why they have the disease. T echnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Aug. 2007.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )Do people usually recover from HBV infection? About 95% of adults recover after several months. They clear the infection from their bodies and become immune. This means they won't get infected with HBV again. They are no longer contagious and cannot pass HBV to others. Unfortunately, about 5% of adults and up to 90% of children under age 5 years are unable to clear the infection from their bodies and develop chronic HBV infection. How do I know if I have or have had HBV infection? The only way to know if you are current - ly infected with HBV , have recovered, are chronically infected, or could become in - fected, is by having blood tests. The three standard blood tests are the following: HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is currently infected with HBV and is able to pass the infec - tion on to others. Anti-HBs [sometimes written as HBs-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B sur - face antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"reactive,\" it means the person is immune to HBV infection, either from vaccination or from past infection. (This test is not done routinely by most blood banks on donated blood.) Anti-HBc [sometimes written as HBc-Ab] (antibody to hepatitis B core antigen): when this is \"positive\" or \"re - active,\" it might mean the person has had contact with HBV . This is a very compli - cated test to explain because the \"anti- HBc\" can possibly be a \"false-positive\" test result. Blood banks routinely run an \"anti-HBc\" on donated blood. The inter - pretation of this test result, if it is posi - tive, depends on the results of the other two blood tests previously described. A fourth blood test that is sometimes done is IgM anti-HBc (IgM class anti - body to hepatitis B core antigen). When this is positive or \"reactive,\" it means that the person has had HBV infection in the past six months, indicating acute (recent - ly acquired) HBV infection. Interpretation of the hepatitis B blood test results *Postvaccination blood testing, when it is recommended, should be done 1-2 months after the final vaccine dose. 1. May be recovering from acute HBV infection. 2. May be distantly immune, and the test is not sensitive enough to detect a very low level of antiHBs in serum. 3. May be susceptible with a \"false posi tive\" antiHBc. 4. May be chronically infected and have an undetectable level of HBsAg present in the serum.susceptible immune due to vaccination immune due to natural infection newly infected chronically infected four interpretations negative negative negative positive with >10mIU/mL* negative positive positive positive positive positive negative positive positive negative negative negative positive negativeTests Results Interpretation Vaccination Needed Yes, for all people who want protection no no no no (may need treatment) possibly What does it mean if my blood bank said I tested positive for hepatitis B and can no longer donate blood? If the blood bank told you your test was \"positive,\" it is important to find out which test was positive. If the \"HBsAg\" was positive, this means that you are either chronically infected with HBV or were recently infected. If only the \"anti-HBc\" was positive, it is most likely that you either had a \"false-positive\" test or are immune to HBV infection (had HBV infection sometime in the past). It is important that you understand the full meaning of your test results. If you are not sure how to interpret these test results, call your blood bank for an explanation or have the blood bank send the test results to your healthcare provider. You may need to provide written permission for the blood bank to release these results to your healthcare pro - vider. Your healthcare provider may want to repeat the blood tests or perform additional tests such as an \"anti-HBs.\" Bring this information sheet along with you on your visit to your healthcare provider. The blood bank does not usually test for anti-HBs or IgM anti-HBc. And remember, you cannot get HBV from donating blood because the equipment used during blood donation is sterile. CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION What does it mean to be chronically infected with HBV? People who do not recover from HBV infection are chronically infected, usually for life. There are over one million chron - ically infected people in the U.S. today. A chronically infected person is someone who has had HBV in her/his blood for more than 6 months. While approxi - mately 5% of adults who acquire HBV infection become chronically infected, children younger than age 5 years have a greater risk (up to 90%). The younger the child is at the time of infection, the greater the risk that the child will develop chronic infection. Many babies born to chronically infected mothers will also become chronically infected with HBV unless the babies are given two shots in the hospital immediately after birth\u2014the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine and a dose of hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG])\u2014and at least two doses of hepa - titis B vaccine during the 6 months after Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018(continued on next page )birth to protect them from the infection. The final dose should not be given before 24 weeks of age. A chronically infected person might have no signs or symptoms of HBV infection but usually remains infected for years or for a lifetime and is capable of passing HBV on to others. Some - times chronically infected people will spontaneously clear the infection from their bodies, but most will not. Although most chronically infected people have no serious problems with hepatitis B and lead normal, healthy lives, some develop liver problems later. Chronically infected people are at significantly higher risk than the general population for liver fail - ure or liver cancer. How can I take care of myself if I am chronically infected with HBV? A person with HBV infection should see a physician knowledgeable about the management of liver disease every 6-12 months. The physician will do blood tests to check the health of the liver, as well as test for evidence of liver cancer. It is best for chronically infected people to avoid alcohol because alcohol can injure the liver. Additionally, your physician should know about all the medicines you are tak - ing, even over-the-counter drugs, because some medicines can hurt the liver. If the result of any liver test is abnormal, it's important that you consult a liver specialist. If your liver disease has progressed... If your physician tells you your liver dis - ease has progressed, read the following for some extra precautions you should take. Avoid alcohol and medicine that has not been prescribed by your doctor\u2014even over-the-counter medicines. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A virus infection can further damage your liver. Get a yearly influenza (flu) vaccination. Patients with severe liver disease (cir - rhosis) should also receive pneumococ - cal vaccine. Don't eat raw oysters. They may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause serious blood infections in people with liver disease. Approximately 50% of people with this blood infection die from it. What can I do to protect others from HBV infection? People with HBV infection might feel healthy but are still capable of passing the infection on to other people. To protect others from getting HBV infection, it is important to protect them from contact with your infected blood and other infec - tious body fluids, including semen and vaginal secretions. Sweat, tears, urine, and respiratory secretions do not contain HBV . Transmission of HBV by saliva has only been documented through biting. Important DOs and DON'Ts for people with chronic HBV infection DO: Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Discard used items such as bandaids and menstrual pads carefully so no one is accidentally exposed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or infectious body fluids. Clean up blood spills. Then reclean the area with a bleach solution (one part household chlorine bleach to 10 parts water). Tell your sex partner(s) you have hepatitis B so they can be tested and vaccinated (if not already infected). Sex partners should be tested for anti- HBs 1-2 months after the three doses are completed to be sure the vaccine worked. Use condoms (rubbers) during sex un - less your sex partner has had hepatitis B or has been vaccinated and has had the anti-HBs blood test demonstrating immunity. (Condoms may also protect you from other sexually transmitted diseases.) Tell household members to see their healthcare providers for testing and vaccination for hepatitis B. Tell your healthcare providers that you are chronically infected with HBV . See your healthcare provider every 6-12 months to check the health of your liver with blood tests and liver scanning. If you are pregnant, tell your healthcare provider that you have HBV infection. It is critical that your baby is started on the hepatitis B shots (both vaccine and HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. DON'T: Don't share chewing gum, toothbrush - es, razors, washcloths, needles for ear or body piercing, or anything that might have come in contact with your blood or infectious body fluids Don't pre-chew food for babies. Don't share syringes and needles. Don't donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Don't take any medicines not pre - scribed by your doctor, even over-the- counter medicines. What are the long-term effects of HBV infection? Each year, approximately 3,000-5,000 people in the U.S. die of HBV-related chronic liver disease. HBV infection is the most common cause of liver cancer worldwide and ranks second only to tobacco as the world's leading cause of cancer. Is there a cure for hepatitis B? As of this writing, there are several drugs used for the treatment of people with chronic hepatitis B. These drugs usually don't get rid of the virus completely, but may reduce your risk for serious liver disease such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Check with your doctor to find out if treatment with medication is the right choice for you. Researchers continue to find additional treatments and look for cures for hepatitis B.Questions Frequently Asked About Hepatitis B Page \u0018Why is hepatitis B so serious in pregnant women? Pregnant women who are infected with HBV can transmit the disease to their babies. If babies aren't protected with vaccinations, many of them develop life - long HBV infections, and up to 25% of those who become infected will develop liver failure or liver cancer later in life. All pregnant women should be tested early in every pregnancy to determine if they are infected with HBV . If the blood test is positive, the baby should be vaccinated within 12 hours of birth with two shots, one of HBIG and the other the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. The in - fant will need at least two more doses of hepatitis B vaccine by age 6 months. The final dose should not be given before age 24 weeks. How can hepatitis B be prevented? Hepatitis B vaccine can provide pro - tection in 90%-95% of healthy young adults. The vaccine can safely be given to infants, children, and adults, including pregnant women. Usually, three doses of vaccine are given over a 6-month period. Hepatitis B vaccine is very safe, and side effects are rare. Since 1982, more than 100 million children, teens, and adults in the U.S. have been vaccinated. Hepa - titis B vaccine is our first vaccine that prevents cancer\u2014liver cancer. At what age are hepatitis B vaccines given routinely? The hepatitis B vaccine series can begin at any age. For newborns, it's recom - mended that the first dose be given in the hospital at birth. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended routinely for all children age 0-18 years living in the U.S. Older children and teens should be vaccinated at the earliest opportunity. Any adult who is at risk for HBV infection or who simply wants to be protected from HBV infection should start the vaccine series right away.Where can I get hepatitis B vaccine? Check with your healthcare provider's office first. Children's health insurance usually covers the cost of this vaccine since it is routinely recommended for all children in the U.S. If your child is unin - sured, ask your local health department for assistance. The federal Vaccines For Children (VFC) program helps families by providing free vaccines to healthcare providers who serve eligible children. VFC is administered at the national level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which contracts with vaccine manufacturers to buy vaccines at reduced rates. For adults, contact your healthcare provider to find out if the vaccine is available and how much it costs. If you are uninsured or don't have a healthcare provider, call your local health department for advice. How many doses of vaccine are needed? Three doses are needed usually for the best protection against HBV infection, but protection is sometimes provided from receiving as little as one dose. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given on a schedule of 0, 1, and 6 months, but there is flexibility in the timing of these injections. As with all other vaccines, if you fall behind on the schedule, you just continue from where you left off. Hepatitis B vaccine will not help or cure a person who is already infected with HBV . What should I do if I'm in a risk group and am not infected with HBV? If you are in a risk group for hepatitis B, be sure to get vaccinated! All people in risk groups (risk groups are listed in the second question on this question-and- answer series) should protect themselves from HBV infection. You don't have to \"admit\" that you have a risk factor to be vaccinated. You simply need to ask to be vaccinated. Every day you delay getting vaccinated increases your chances of being in contact with this highly conta - gious liver disease. The problems caused by hepatitis B\u2014liver cancer and liver failure\u2014are too great to take a chance. See your healthcare provider or visit your health department. How does hepatitis B differ from hepatitis A and C? Hepatitis A, B, and C are all different viruses that attack and injure the liver, and all can cause similar symptoms. Usually, people get hepatitis A virus (HA V) infection from household or sexual contact with a person who has the infection. Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and is spread through HCV-infected blood. Both HCV- and HBV- infections are spread by blood through some of the same activi - ties (e.g., injection drug use). Both HBV- and HCV- infections can cause lifelong liver problems. HA V infection does not. Vaccines to prevent HA V infection are also available. Hepatitis A vaccine won't protect you from HBV or HCV infection, nor will hepatitis B vaccine protect you from HA V or HCV infec - tion. There is no vaccine yet for hepatitis C. If you've been infected with HA V or HCV in the past, it is still possible to get infected with HBV . Where can I receive more information about hepatitis B?

If you have chronic hepatitis B virus infec - tion (HBV), you are not alone. Today, approximately one million people in the United States are chronically infected with HBV. The majority of infected people feel healthy for their entire lives and do not demonstrate any evidence of ongoing liver damage. Other people progress to levels of more severe disease. Some people ultimately develop liver scarring (cirrhosis), liver failure, or liver cancer. It is important that you take care of yourself. And because it is possible to spread HBV to others, you have to know how to protect your family, friends, and others from this disease. How you can take care of yourself People who have chronic HBV infection need regular monitoring of their liver condition to determine whether their disease is progressing, whether treatment is needed, or whether a liver cancer is developing. Make sure you do the following: See your doctor for evaluation of your liver's condition once or twice a year. Certain blood tests need to be performed periodically to monitor your liver's health. Discuss with your doctor if you are a candidate for antiviral medication. These medicines are given to certain people with chronic liver disease. Discuss with your doctor about getting periodic ultrasounds, alpha-fetoprotein blood tests, or other studies to make sure there is no evidence of a developing liver cancer. Physicians may recommend different schedules for ultrasounds and blood tests depending on the patient's age, sex, ethnicity, age at which the infection was initially acquired, family history, HBeAg status, and liver enzymes. Usually, ultrasounds and blood tests are recommended every six to 12 months. Review with your physician all medica - tions you take. Even some \"over-the- counter\" medications can injure your liver. If you are pregnant, tell your physician that you have chronic HBV infection. It is essential that your baby be given an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and started on the hepatitis B vaccine series within 12 hours of birth. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol can damage your liver.If your doctor tells you your liver disease has progressed... If your liver disease progresses, here are some extra precautions you should take: Get your yearly influenza vaccine. Patients with severe liver disease should also receive pneumococcal poly - saccharide vaccine. Get vaccinated against hepatitis A. Hepatitis A can further damage your liver. Don't eat raw oysters. Raw oysters may carry the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus which can cause a serious blood infection in individuals with liver disease. Approxi - mately 40% of these cases are fatal. How to protect others from HBV infection People can get HBV infection from you by coming in contact with your blood, serum, semen, or vaginal fluids. HBV has also been transmitted by human bites. Although HBV has been detected in low concentrations in other body fluids, including tears, sweat, urine, feces, and breast milk, these fluids have not been associated with any docu - mented transmission. Fortunately, HBV is not transmitted by sneezing or coughing, or from casual contact such as holding hands. Here are some important guidelines for you to follow so that others are protected: Tell your sex partner(s) that you are infected with HBV. Your sex partner(s) must see a physician for hepatitis B blood testing and should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at this same visit. If, according to the blood tests, your partner has never had hepatitis B, he or she should complete the vaccination se - ries. One to two months after the series of three shots is completed, your partner needs to return to the doctor for blood testing to make sure the vaccine protected him or her. Use condoms until your part - ner is proven to be protected from HBV. Make sure all your household members see their physicians for hepatitis B testing and vaccination. Tell your healthcare providers that you are infected with HBV. Cover all cuts and open sores with a bandage. Throw away used personal items such as tissues or menstrual pads in a bag that does not leak so others will not be ex - posed to your blood. Wash your hands well after touching your blood or body fluids. More resources...

Do not share toothbrushes, razors, needles for ear piercing, nail files, clippers, nail scissors, washcloths, or anything that may have come in contact with your blood or body fluids. Do not share food that has been in your mouth (e.g., chewing gum) and do not pre-chew food for babies. Do not share syringes, needles, or drugs. Do not donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, or sperm. Know that if someone is exposed to your blood\u2014be it a family member, a friend, or even a stranger\u2014 preventive treatment is available for that person. If the exposed person receives HBIG and starts the hepatitis B vaccine series right away, that person has an excellent chance of being protected from HBV!

The first dose of HepA vaccine should be given between 12 months and 23 months of age. The second dose should be given 6 to 18 months later. HepA vaccination may be given to any child 12 months and older to protect against HepA. Children and adolescents who did not receive the HepA vaccine and are at high-risk, should be vaccinated against HepA. If your child has any medical conditions that put him at risk for infection or is traveling outside the United States, talk to your child's doctor about additional vaccines that he may need.NOTE: If your child misses a shot, you don't need to start over, just go back to your child's doctor for the next shot. Talk with your child's doctor if you have questions about vaccines.Is your family growing? To protect your new baby and yourself against whooping cough, get a Tdap vaccine.

See www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de Visite www.immunize.org/vis U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Hepatitis B Vaccine What You Need to Know 1 Why get vaccinated? Hepatitis B is a serious disease that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus. Hepatitis B can cause mild illness lasting a few weeks, or it can lead to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis B virus infection can be either acute or chronic.Acute hepatitis B virus infection is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis B virus. This can lead to: fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or vomiting jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a long-term illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Most people who go on to develop chronic hepatitis B do not have symptoms, but it is still very serious and can lead to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death Chronically-infected people can spread hepatitis B virus to others, even if they do not feel or look sick themselves. Up to 1.4 million people in the United States may have chronic hepatitis B infection. About 90% of infants who get hepatitis B become chronically infected and about 1 out of 4 of them dies. Hepatitis B is spread when blood, semen, or other body fluid infected with the Hepatitis B virus enters the body of a person who is not infected. People can become infected with the virus through: Birth (a baby whose mother is infected can be infected at or after birth) Sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person Contact with the blood or open sores of an infected person Sex with an infected partner Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment Exposure to blood from needlesticks or other sharp instruments Each year about 2,000 people in the United States die from hepatitis B-related liver disease.Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B and its consequences, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. 2 Hepatitis B vaccine Hepatitis B vaccine is made from parts of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause hepatitis B infection. The vaccine is usually given as 3 or 4 shots over a 6-month period. Infants should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and will usually complete the series at 6 months of age.All children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age who have not yet gotten the vaccine should also be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated adults who are at risk for hepatitis B virus infection, including: People whose sex partners have hepatitis B Sexually active persons who are not in a long-term monogamous relationship Persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease Men who have sexual contact with other men People who share needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment People who have household contact with someone infected with the hepatitis B virus Health care and public safety workers at risk for exposure to blood or body fluids Residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons Persons in correctional facilities Victims of sexual assault or abuse Travelers to regions with increased rates of hepatitis B People with chronic liver disease, kidney disease, HIV infection, or diabetes Anyone who wants to be protected from hepatitis B There are no known risks to getting hepatitis B vaccine at the same time as other vaccines. 3 Some people should not get this vaccine Tell the person who is giving the vaccine: If the person getting the vaccine has any severe, life- threatening allergies. If you ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, or have a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, you may be advised not to get vaccinated. Ask your health care provider if you want information about vaccine components. If the person getting the vaccine is not feeling well. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, you should probably wait until you recover. Your doctor can advise you. 4 Risks of a vaccine reaction With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible. Most people who get hepatitis B vaccine do not have any problems with it. Minor problems following hepatitis B vaccine include: soreness where the shot was given temperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days. Your doctor can tell you more about these reactions.Other problems that could happen after this vaccine: People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears. Some people get shoulder pain that can be more severe and longer-lasting than the more routine soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely. Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. As with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ 5 What if there is a serious problem? What should I look for? Look for anything that concerns you, such as signs of a severe allergic reaction, very high fever, or unusual behavior. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. These would start a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. What should I do? If you think it is a severe allergic reaction or other emergency that can't wait, call 9-1-1 or get to the nearest hospital. Otherwise, call your clinic. Afterward, the reaction should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (V AERS). Your doctor should file this report, or you can do it yourself through the V AERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not give medical advice. 6 The National V accine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Persons who believe they may have been injured by a vaccine can learn about the program and about filing a claim by calling 1-800-338-2382 or visiting the VICP website at www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation. There is a time limit to file a claim for compensation. 7 How can I learn more? Ask your healthcare provider. He or she can give you the vaccine package insert or suggest other sources of information. Call your local or state health department.

Various serologic procedures are performed for a variety of bacterial, parasitic, and viral agents except for HIV. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is performed in the Virology Unit. Hepati tis serology is only performed for county health departments and Georgia Department of Public Health agencies. Tests not performed in the Public Health Laboratory can be forwarded to CDC, if the submitter requests the testing. SPECIMEN COLLECTION/LAB ELING/REQUISITION FORM Collection Using Universal Precautions, and standard venipuncture technique, collect approximately six milliliters of whole blood (for serum) in a red top tube (no additive), labeled with patient's identifier (name, first and last, or number), data, and name of the submitter. Use a marker that will not fade, smear, or run during transportation. Use proper size needle (large enough to prevent hemolysis of the red blood cells) for the vein location and age of the patient. Allow blo od specimen to clot, at least 30 minutes undisturbed, at room temperature, and transport, or place in the refrigerator for transporting. Collect blood specimens in, or transfer them to, non -breakable, leak resistant tubes. Specimens should be transported as soon as possible, do not hold over 7 days. Specimens over 14 days old are unacceptable. Many of the procedures we perform are not approved for use with plasma. Therefore, please submit only serum or whole blood without anticoagulants, not plasma. Collect cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) according to proper hospital procedure. CSF contaminated with blood or grossly contaminated with bacteria is unacceptable. Labeling All specimens must be labeled with patient identification (name or number), in acceptabl e testing condition, and accompanied by a completed requisition form. If the form is not specific for one test or a set of tests, the specific testing requested must be hand - written in the proper area, e.g., \"viral serology\" is not acceptable, the specific agent, e.g., \"CMV\", must be clearly requested. Failure to provide proper patient information may result in testing delays. Requisition Form : Use Form #3583 for all tests performed by the Microbial Immunology Unit. There is a single requisition form for all tests performed in the Georgia Public Health Laboratory. Hepatitis B 38 testing is performed for the (Department of Public Health facilities and county health departments only). Completely fill out the form and include the following information: 1. Unique patient identifier (name or number). 2. TEST(S) REQUESTED (Please check only the corresponding box for test(s) requested). 3. Date specimen collected. 4. Submitter's name, address and code number, where applicable. 5. For hepatitis the reason for testing, e.g., routine, or prenatal. 6. Any information the submitter needs for patient identification, e.g., chart number, address. 7. The date of onset of illness, if applicable. 8. Race, sex, and age, where applicable, e.g., hepat itis testing. SHIPMENT OF SPECIMENS Use outfit #0500, available from Laboratory Services and Supply, 404 -327-7920, and follow the specific instructions below. For HCV Viral Load testing please use outfit 502. Routine specimens may be mailed at room temperatures overnight or delivered cold to the laboratory by courier. HCV Viral Load should be sent frozen by overnight courier. Shipp ing Instructions for USPS and Couriers: Place the tubes of blood in protective, leak resistant, doubled -walled containers, e.g., aluminum and cardboard box, for transport. Wrap the requisition form around the inner (aluminum) can, secure with a rubber ban d and place in the outer container. If a screw -cap outer container is used, the screw -cap must be secured with tape or the Postal Service will return it for taping. Up to 50 milliliters of blood may be transported in one package (U.S. postal regulations) . Therefore, an individual tube of blood may be placed in the metal can, with the requisition form secured to the outside by a rubber band, and several aluminum cans placed in one cardboard box for transporting. Shipping Instructions for Courier Services Only: Tubes of blood may be placed in leak proof biohazard bags. Wrap brown absorbent material around the tube, then secure with a rubber band. Place the requisition form in the sleeve located on the outside of the bag. REPORTING AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Table 1 summarizes the interpretation of results for all serological tests performed in the Microbial Immunology Unit. The turnaround time after receipt of the specimen depends on the testing methodology and the frequency of testing. The frequency of testing depe nds on the demand for a specific test. Several tests are performed daily, while others are performed weekly. The turn -around time for specimens referred to CDC depends on CDC's schedule, which varies from laboratory to laboratory. 39 UNACCEPTABLE SPECIMEN S 1. Spinal fluid obviously contaminated with bacteria or blood; 2. All specimens: Not approved for testing by the indicated method, e.g., plasma for RPR.

When first infected, a person can develop an \"acute\" infection, which can range in severity from a very mild illness with few or no symptoms to a serious condition requiring hospitalization. Acute hepatitis B refers to the first 6 months after someone is infected with the hepatitis B virus. Some people are able to fight the infection and clear the virus. For others, the infection remains and leads to a \"chronic,\" or lifelong, illness. Chronic hepatitis B refers to the illness that occurs when the hepatitis B virus remains in a person's body. Over time, the infection can cause serious health problems. Hepatitis B is usually spread when blood, semen, or other body fluids from a person infected with the hepatitis B virus enter the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact with an infected person or sharing needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment. Hepatitis B can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby at birth. Hepatitis B is not spread through breastfeeding, sharing eating utensils, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, or sneezing. Unlike some types of hepatitis, hepatitis B is not spread by contaminated food or water. ETIOLOGY Hepatitis B virus (HBV) SUBJECTIVE 1. May have a history of exposure at birth to a HBV-infected mother 2. May have a history of close (household/sexual) contact with a HBV-infected person 3. May have experienced or is experiencing symptoms listed below. Not everyone has symptoms with acute Hepatitis B, especially young children. Symptoms usually appear within 2 to 3 months (Range: 45-180 days) of exposure. Symptoms can last from a few weeks to several months and include: a. Fever b. Fatigue c. Loss of appetite d. Nausea e. Vomiting f. Abdominal pain g. Grey-colored stools Perinatal Hepatitis B h. Dark urine i. Joint and/or muscle pain j. Jaundice OBJECTIVE History of exposure to an HBV-infected mother at birth or through close household contact. ASSESSMENT Exposure to hepatitis B viral infection PLAN MANAGEMENT OF EXPOSED INFANTS For infants that were exposed to HBV at birth: Ensure that Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine were given to the child prior to hospital discharge if the child is less than 7 days old. Verify child's hepatitis B immunization record in GRITS. Administer any needed doses using the current year's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) schedule. Conduct post-vaccination serologic testing (HBsAg & anti-HBs) at 9 months of age. The child must be at least 9 months and have not received a hepatitis B vaccine in the previous 30 days. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES For infants and children born to a HBV-infected mother, order hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) serology. Infants must be at least 9 months of age and have not received hepatitis B immunization less than 30 days prior to lab testing. NOTE: Draw blood before administering the dose of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) to avoid a temporary HBsAg-positive result (transient antigenemia). Specimen Collection Refer to the most current version of the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) Manual at http://dph.georgia.gov/lab . Hepatitis B testing is performed by the Microbial Immunology Unit. GPHL can be contacted at 404-327-7970. Obtain the specimen via venipuncture using the appropriate gauge needle (e.g. 23-25 gauge butterfly needle) Hepatitis B testing requires approximately six milliliters (one tube) of whole blood in a serum separator tube (SST). Red top tubes may be used but are not preferred and may not be available through GPHL. Centrifugation of specimen should be performed prior to 13.24 Perinatal Hepatitis B shipment. Invert specimen in serum separator tube (SST) 5 times to ensure distribution of the clot activator within sample, and allow it to clot for 30 minutes in vertical position before centrifugation. Red-top tubes (non-SST) should be allowed to clot for 60 minutes in vertical position before centrifugation. Laboratory Requisition Form Refer to the most current version of the Georgia Public Health Laboratory (GPHL) Manual to obtain the current laboratory requisition form. This information is available online at http://dph.georgia.gov/lab (see Infectious Disease Serology section). NOTE: Hepatitis testing is located under Immunology. Select Hep B (Routine Screen) under the hepatitis testing section. The panel consists of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). Test Result Interpretation Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a protein on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. It can be detected in the blood during acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The body normally produces antibodies to HBsAg as part of the normal immune response to infection, unless chronic infection occurs. Positive/Reactive test result means: The person has an acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection and can pass the virus to others. Negative/Non-Reactive test result means: The person does not have the hepatitis B virus in his or her blood. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is an antibody that is produced by the body in response to the hepatitis B surface antigen. Positive/Reactive test result means: The person is protected or immune from the hepatitis B virus for one of two reasons: he or she was successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B. OR he or she recovered from an acute infection (and cannot get 13.25 Perinatal Hepatitis B hepatitis B again) Negative/Non-Reactive test result means: A person does not have immunity against hepatitis B virus. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is an antibody that does not provide any protection or immunity against HBV. Positive/Reactive test result means: The person may have current or past infection with the hepatitis B virus. A positive result does NOT mean the person is protected from HBV. Negative/Non-Reactive test result means: The person does not have current or past infection with the hepatitis B virus. NOTE: The anti-HBc result should be disregarded for children less than 24 months of age who were exposed to HBV at birth. The mother's maternal antibody can be detected in the child's blood up to 24 months after birth. THERAPEUTIC POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP) 1. Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive women should receive hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. 2. Infants that are discharged from the delivery hospital prior to hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) administration should be referred to the delivery hospital for immediate HBIG administration. HBIG can be administered up to 7 days after birth. 3. HBIG may be administered simultaneously with hepatitis B vaccine but in a different injection site. 4. HBIG is administered by intramuscular injection. For infants, HBIG should be administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral thigh using a 22--25-gauge needle that is 5/8\"--1\" in length. For older children and adolescents, an appropriate muscle mass (e.g. deltoid 13.26 Perinatal Hepatitis B muscle or anterolateral thigh) should be chosen in which to deliver the larger volumes of HBIG required for these age groups by using a needle length appropriate for the person's age and size. 5. Vaccination with certain live-virus vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) should be deferred for at least 3 months after administration of HBIG because HBIG can inhibit the response to these vaccines. PHARMACOLOGIC Drug Name: Hepatitis B B\u00ae, B\u00ae, Nabi-HB\u00ae Formulation months) 0.5 mL Intramuscularly in vastus lateralis (anterolateral mL/kg Intramuscularly One Name(s): Engerix-B\u00ae, Pediarix\u00ae, Recombivax HB\u00ae Formulation Dose Route Frequency Duration Pediatric/adolescent 0.5 mL Intramuscularly One time N/A IMMUNIZATION 1. Infants and children of hepatitis B-infected mothers should follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons 0 Through 6 Years for the current year. NOTE: Infants born to HBsAg-positive women and who weigh less than 2,000 grams at birth should receive postexposure prophylaxis with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth and receive 4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The birth dose should not be counted in the 3-dose schedule. The next dose in the series should be administered when the infant is chronologic age 1 month. The third dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the second, and the fourth dose should be given at 6 months of age. Infants receiving Pediarix\u00ae should receive single-antigen vaccine dose #1 at birth and Pediarix\u00ae vaccine dose #2 at 2 months of age, Pediarix\u00ae dose #3 at 4 months of age and Pediarix\u00ae dose #4 at 6 months of age. Perinatal Hepatitis B NOTE: Infants whose mothers are HBsAg-positive should receive the last (third or fourth) dose by 6 months of age 2. The anterolateral thigh muscle is the recommended site of administration for the hepatitis B vaccine for neonates (aged <1 month) and infants (aged 1-12 months). For toddlers (aged 1--2 years) and older children, either the anterolateral thigh or the deltoid muscle may be used if the muscle mass is adequate. The deltoid muscle is the preferred site of administration for adolescents. 3. Infants and children who do not develop adequate antibody (HBsAg-Negative/Non-Reactive and anti-HBs-Negative/Non- Reactive) to the first series of hepatitis B vaccine should receive additional hepatitis B vaccine. Administer a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine and test for HBsAg and anti-HBs 30-60 days later. If the anti-HBs remains negative (<10 mIU/mL), the child should receive two additional hepatitis B doses, followed by testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs 30-60 days after the final dose of the hepatitis B series. NOTE: Persons who fail to respond after two appropriately administered three-dose series should be counseled regarding precautions to prevent HBV infection. No additional vaccine needed. PATIENT EDUCATION/COUNSELING 1. Ensure that the client's parent or legal guardian knows the ways HBV can be transmitted. 2. Teach the client's parent or legal guardian ways to reduce disease transmission. 3. Explain the importance of completing the hepatitis B series using the recommended time intervals. 4. Explain the importance of completing post-vaccination serologic testing. Post-vaccination testing is recommended at age 9 through 12 months (after hepatitis B series completion). 5. Explain the client's status of immunity based on the laboratory findings. Perinatal Hepatitis B CONSULTATION/REFERRAL 1. Administer additional hepatitis B vaccine doses and post-vaccination serologic testing for hepatitis B vaccine non-responders. Testing should be conducted at least 30 days after last dose of vaccine to avoid a transient antigenemia result. 2. Refer clients that test positive for hepatitis B virus to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist (liver specialist) for further evaluation. 3. Notify your district's Perinatal Hepatitis B Program Case Manager of the laboratory results for any clients tested. 4. Contact the Georgia Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program for consultation or additional information at 404-651-5196. REFERENCES 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hepatitis - 3/2018 State Hepatitis Program 1 State Hepatitis Program Background: The State Hepatitis Program provides hepatitis B vaccine when indicated to eligible children and adults through the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, and the STD/HIV Program and Family Planning Program . Hepatitis A vaccine is provided to eligible children through the Vaccines for Children Program, high -risk adults, and to both children and adults in outbreak situations. Groups recommended for routine vaccination: Hepatitis B Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all persons aged zero through 18 years, and adults at highest risk for th e hepatitis B virus. These high -risk groups are as follows: Injecting drug users (IDU) Sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) Sexually active heterosexual men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted dis eases, and for persons who have a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. NOTE: Persons seen for evaluation of sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination . Household contacts and sexual partners of persons infected with HBV Household members of HBsAg -positive adoptees Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled Inmates of juvenile detention centers or long -term correctional facilities Persons with occupationa l risk of infection through exposure to blood Hemodialysis patients Persons with chronic liver disease, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection International travelers to areas with high or intermediate rates of HBV infection Persons with diabetes me llitus (Type 1 or Type 2) Persons with HIV infection Hepatitis A Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children 12 through 23 months of age.* Also, older children and adolescents who are susceptible should be immunized, when seen by their providers. All persons aged 12 months and older who are at increased risk for infection or severe outcomes from the disease should receive hepatitis A vaccine . These groups include the following: Travelers * to countries where hepatitis A is endemic Men who have sex with men (MSM) Users of illegal injection and non -injection drugs Persons with clotting -factor disorders Persons with chronic liver disease Close contacts of newly arriving international adoptee s from countr ies of high Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 State Hepatitis Program 2 State Hepatitis Program or intermediate endemicity Persons with occupational risk ( e.g., working with nonhuman primates) *Special Category : Administer a single dose to infants 6 -11 months of age traveling to countries outside the United States for which protection against hepatitis A is recommended . Infan ts should then receive the full 2 -dose hepatitis A vaccine series at >12 months of age as recommended. Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state -supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Provision of vaccine for routine vaccination by the State Hepatitis Program: The State Immunization Program provides hepatitis B vaccine to household and sexual contacts of acute and chronic hepatitis B cases (which includes perinatal cases), persons seeking evaluation for an STD at a pu blic STD/HIV or Family Planning Clinic , and VFC and PeachCare eligible children ages birth through Prevaccination serology for hepatitis B: Prevaccination serology is not indicated before routine vaccination of infants, children and adults. Prevaccination serology should be performed on persons who are at highest risk for infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Those clients at highest risk are defined as: Injecti on drug users (IDU) Sexually active men who have sex with men (MSM) Sexually active heterosexual men and women with more than one sex partner within a 6-month period Certain persons receiving cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy All persons born in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and other regions with HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher Children of immigrants from endemic countries Household, sex, and needle -sharing contacts of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg )-positive persons Persons being evaluated in STD/ HIV and Family Planning clinics should firs t be assessed for risk factors and have serologic testing performed , if indicated. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the same visit as serologic testing. Draw the blood before administering vaccine . After the results of the serologic tests are received and the client is found to be susceptible, the second and third doses should be administered according to the client's age as specified in the ACIP recommended schedule. Always check GRITS for patient's history of hepatitis B vaccination, especially for persons born on or after 1/1/1992. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department Of Public Health 7.

Antibody production in response to HAV infe ction results in lifelong immunity to hepatitis A infection. Vaccination of persons who are already immune because of prior infection does not increase the risk for adverse events. In populations that have expected high rates of prior HAV infection, prevac cination testing may be considered to reduce costs by not vaccinating persons who have prior immunity. Testing of children is not indicated because of their expected low prevalence of infection. For adults, the decision to test should be based upon the f ollowing information: a) the expected prevalence of immunity; b) the cost of vaccination compared with the cost of serologic testing (including the cost of an additional visit); and c) the likelihood that testing will not interfere with initiating vaccination. Persons for whom prevaccination testing will likely be most cost -effective include: Adults who were either born in or lived for extensive periods in geographic areas that have a high endemicity of HAV infection; Older adolescents and adults in certain pop ulations (i.e., American Indian /Alaska Native, and Hispanic); Adults in certain groups that have a high prevalence of infection (e.g., injecting drug users) ; Adults 40 years of age and older Post -vaccination serology for Hepatitis B Testing for immunity to hepatitis B following vaccination is not routinely recommended but should be considered for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status. This would include: Infants born to HBsAg -positive women Infants whose mother's HBsAg status remains unknown indefinitely (e.g., confidential surrender of infant shortly after birth, such as adoption) Dialysis patients, persons with weakened immune systems , and health care workers who have direct contact with blood or body fluids When indicated, post -vaccination testing for children and adults should be done 1 to 2 months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definitive information on response to the vaccine. Infants born to HBsAg -positive women should be tested for HBsAg and anti -HBs at 9 months of age or 30 to 60 days after the final dose of hepatitis B vaccine , if the infant/child is older than 9 months of age . Post -vaccination serology for Hepatitis A Post-vaccination serology is not indicated in persons receiving hep atitis A vaccine due to the high rate of response among children and adults. No test sensitive enough to detect low anti -HAV concentrations after vaccination is approved for routine diagnostic use in the United States.

Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 1 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Background The goal of hepatitis B immunization is to prevent transmission of hepatitis B virus ( HBV) infection, which in turn prevents chronic liver disease , cirrhosis and liver cancer , as well as hepatitis D coinfection . While routine vaccination of infants in the United States will eventually produce a population highly immune to hepatitis B, further efforts must be extended to prevent transmission among groups at hi ghest risk for infection (see list below). Healthy People 2020 goals state that \"viral hepatitis can be prevented, yet health care systems often do not make the best use of their available resources to support prevention efforts.\" To reach the Healthy People 2020 target for adults (1.5 cases per 100,000), hepatitis B vaccination programs must continue to focus on susceptible persons at the highest risk of infection. In 2010, there were 1.6 cases per 100,000 population reported in Georgia, with individual county rates ranging from 0.7 to 16.1 cases per 100,000. By 2014, the overall incidence rate in Georgia had declined to 1.0 case per 100,000; however, risk factor data collected since then show the majority of newly acquired cases of hepatitis B are associ ated with high -risk sexual activity or injection -drug use , and the case rate remained at 1.0 per 100,000 in 2016 . It is important to provide prevention and healthy lifestyles information. This includes advancing effective and evidence -based viral hepatitis prevention priorities and interventions. Vaccinating susceptible persons attending public Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD), HIV, and Family Planning clinics in Georgia will reduce the transmission of HBV to sexually active adolescents and adults. Measur es should be taken at the district and county levels to avoid missed opportunities to vaccinate high -risk patients, especially those referred by Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Managers and other Public Health staff. Particular attention should be paid to vacci nating adults born before January 1992 , who were not required to have hepatitis B vaccine for school attendance . High -risk Groups for whom Hepatitis B Vaccination is Recommended 1. Injecti on drug users (IDU). Persons with history of current or recent injecti on drug use who are susceptible to HBV should be vaccinated. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population, prevaccination screening should be considered. 2. Men who have sex with men (MSM). Susceptible MSM should be vaccinated. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population, prevaccination screening should be considered. Men known to have HIV infection should be tested for anti -HBs response after completion of the vaccine series. Check GRITS for patients born on or after 1/1/1992. 3. Sexually active heterosexual men and women. Vaccination is recommended for men and women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, for prostitutes, and for persons who have a history of sexual activ ity with more than one partner in the previous 6 months. Most patients seen in clinics for sexually transmitted diseases should be considered candidates for vaccination. Check GRITS for patients born on or after 1/1/1992. 4. Household contacts and sex ual partners of HB sAg-positive persons . All household and sexual contacts of persons identified as HBsAg positive should be vaccinated. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the age -appropriate dose to those determined to be susceptible or judged likely t o be susceptible to infection. 5. Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled. Susceptible Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 2 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health clients in institutions for the developmentally disabled, as well as staff who work closely with clients, should be vaccinated. Susceptible cli ents and staff who live or work in smaller residential settings with known HBV carriers should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. Clients discharged from residential institutions into community programs should be screened for HBsAg so that appropriate meas ures can be taken to prevent HBV transmission. These measures should include both environmental controls and appropriate use of vaccine. 6. Staff of nonresidential day -care programs for the developmentally disabled (e.g., schools, sheltered workshops) atten ded by known HBV chronic carriers have a risk of infection comparable with that of health -care workers and therefore should be vaccinated. The risk of infection for other clients appears to be lower than the risk for staff. Vaccination of clients in day ca re programs may be considered. Vaccination of classroom contacts is strongly encouraged if a classmate who is an HBV carrier behaves aggressively or has special medical problems (e.g., exudative dermatitis, open skin lesions) that increase the risk of expo sure to his or her blood or serous secretions. 7. Inmates of long -term correctional facilities . Prison officials should consider undertaking screening and vaccination programs directed at inmates with histories of high-risk behaviors , such as IDU and multi ple sex partners . 8. Persons with occupational risk. Any healthcare or public -safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks performed. Workers who perform tasks involving contact with blood or blood -contaminated body fluid should be vaccinated. For persons in health -care fields, vaccination should be completed during training in schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions, before trainees have their first contact with blood. 9. Hem odialysis patients. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis patients. Vaccinating patients early in the course of their renal disease is encouraged because patients with uremia who are vaccinated before they require dialysis ar e more likely to respond to the vaccine. Although their seroconversion rates and anti -HBs titers are lower than those of healthy persons, patients who respond to vaccination will be protected from infection, and the need for frequent serologic testing will be reduced. 10. Persons with chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible persons with chronic liver disease, including, but not limited to, those with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and liver enzyme (ALT and AST) level greater than twice the upper limit of normal. 11. International travelers. Vaccination should be considered for pers ons who plan to spend more than 6 months in areas with high rates of HBV infection and who will have close contact with the local population. Short -term travelers who are likely to have contact with blood (e.g., in a medical setting) or sexual contact with residents of areas with high or intermediate levels of endemic disease should be vaccinated. Vaccination should begin at least 6 months before travel to allow for completion of the full vaccine series, although a partial series will offer some protection. The alternate four -dose schedule should provide protection, if the first three doses can be delivered before departure. 12. Persons with HIV. Susceptible HIV -positive persons should be vaccinated against HBV Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 3 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health to avoid coinfection and increased risk of cirrho sis and end -stage liver disease. 13. Adults with diabetes mellitus . All previously unvaccinated adults age d 19 through 59 years with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) should be vaccinated as soon as possible after a diagnosis of diabetes is made. Unvaccinated adults aged >60 years with diabetes may be vaccinated at the discretion of the treating clinician, after assessing their risk and the likelihood of an adequate immune response to vac cination. 14. Families of adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic. Adopted or fostered orphans or unaccompanied minors from countries where HBV infection is endemic at high or intermediate level s should be screened for HBsAg. If the children ar e HBsAg positive, other family members should be vaccinated. Eligibility for Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD/HIV and Family Planning Clinics in Georgia The following persons ARE ELIGIBLE to receive state -supplied hepatitis B vaccine if screened in any P ublic Health clinic and are Medicare covered, Medicaid covered, underinsured, or uninsured: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Injection drug users (IDU) 3. Individuals with multiple sex partners (more than 1 partner in the past six months) 4. Homeless Adults 5. Persons seeking STD/HIV screening services including HIV testing and counseling 6. Persons recently diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) 7. Persons seeking Family Planning clinic services 8. Sexual partners and household contacts of persons with a cute or chronic HBV infection 9. Hemodialysis and transplant patients 10. Persons who began the series using state -supplied vaccine and still need to complete the series, regardless of insurance status 11. Diabetics (Type 1 or Type 2) 12. Refugees > 19 years of ag e 13. Any unvaccinated adult who wants to be protected against hepatitis B virus Note: See Chapter 2 of this Manual for list of persons eligible for state -supplied vaccine in Public Health clinics. Persons NOT ELIGIBLE to receive state -supplied hepatitis B vaccine for routine immunizations include: 1. Public safety workers 2. Health care workers 3. International travelers 4. Inmates 5. Staff of institutions for developmentally disabled 6. Insured clients with immunization coverage Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 4 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B with Vaccine and HBIG Recommendations on postexposure prophylaxis are based on available efficacy data and on the likelihood of future HBV exposure of the person requiring treatment. In all exposures, a regimen combining HBIG with hepatitis B vaccine wil l provide both short - and long -term protection and is the treatment of choice. Please refer to Chapter 2, \"Eligibility Criteria for Vaccines Supplied by the Georgia Immunization Program for Adult Populations (age 19 years)\" in this manual for the eligibi lity requirements for persons to receive state -supplied HBIG. Immunization Consent Requirements Vaccination against viral hepatitis for persons under the age of 18 years without parental/guardian consent can occur in conjunction with STD/HIV examinations due to already existing laws and legal precedent relating to STD/HIV examination and treatment of minors (O.C.G.A. 31 -17-7). In these instances, a minor is considered to be receiving hepatitis B vaccine as prophylaxis for STD, and therefore is covered under the aforementioned section of the Official Code of Georgia. Conversely, persons less than 18 years of age cannot be vaccinated without parental/guardian consent in any other vaccination setting, including school vaccination programs, outbreak control settings where mass vaccinations are being given, and other clinic settings where STD/HIV evaluati ons and treatments are not conducted. Serology Testing Prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility Prevaccination serology is cost effective and should be considered in persons who are at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Due to higher serop revalence , the following high -risk groups should receive prevaccination testing: 1. Men having sex with men (MSM) 2. Injecting drug users (IDU) 3. Sexual , household or needle -sharing contacts of persons infected with HBV 4. Persons born in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and other high -prevalence regions Prevaccination testing should not interfere with administering vaccine during the visit for which immunization against hepatitis B is requested . To test high -risk patients for history of disease and the need for vaccine, order HBsAg and anti -HBs tests. Draw the blood before administering vaccine. The first dose of vaccine should be given at the same visit as the blood test. If the client is f ound susceptible to HBV (via negative serology), then doses 2 and 3 should be administered at the appropriate intervals. It is not cost -effective for groups with a low expected prevalence of HBV serologic markers to receive prevaccination testing. Therefo re, prevaccination serology is not indicated before routine vaccination of infants, children , or adolescents . The Georgia Public Health Laboratory hepatitis serology consists of HBsAg, total anti -HBc, HBeAg , and anti -HBs. Specific guidelines for ordering hepatitis B serologic testing can be found in the Georgia Public Health Laboratory Service Manua l in the \" Microbiology Services - Immunology -Infectious Disease Serology \" section. https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files/related_files/site_page/LSM2013_June.docx %207.3.13.pdf For additional information regarding the interpretation of hepatitis B serology , please see Appendix H4 of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Program Guidelines. Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 5 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health Postvaccination Testing Hepatitis B vaccine, when given at the correct anatomic site , produces protective antibody ( anti- HBs) in greater than 90% of healthy persons. Testing for immunity after vaccination is not recommended routinely but is advised for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status (such as dialysis patients, other immunocomp romised patients, and health care workers with direct contact to blood and body fluids). Testing for immunity is also advised for persons for whom a suboptimal response may be anticipated, such as those who had received vaccine in the buttock, persons aged 50 years or older , and persons known to have HIV infection. Postvaccination testing should also be considered for persons at occupational risk who may have needle -stick exposures necessitating postexposure prophylaxis. When indicated, postvaccination test ing should be done between 1 and 3 months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definitive information on response to the vaccine. Note: The postvaccination serology recommendation for infants born to HBsAg -positive women is to test at 9 to 12 months of age; however, if the last dose is delayed and the child is 9 months of age or older, testing should be completed within 30 to 60 days after final dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Persons who do not respond to the first series of hepatitis B vaccine should complete a second three -dose series. Revaccination of persons who do not respond to the primary series produces adequate antibody in 15% -25% after one additional dose and in 30% -50% after three additional doses , when the primary vaccination has been given in the deltoid. For persons who did not respond to a primary vaccine series given in the buttock, data suggest that revaccination in the arm induces adequate antibody in greater than 75%. Sexual Partners of Persons with Acute HBV Infection Sexual partners of HBsAg -positive persons are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, and post-exposure administration of HBIG has been shown to be 75% effective in preventing such infections. Data about the efficacy of HBIG beyond the 14 -day cutoff are limited and the period after sexual exposure during which HBIG is effective is unknown; however, it is unlikely that this period would exceed 14 days. Testing of sexual partners for susceptibility is recommended at the same visit as the first dose of vaccine. Be sure to draw blood for the serology before administering the vaccine. If a sexual partner is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Household Contacts of Persons with Acute or Chronic HBV Infection Since infants have close contact with primary caregivers and they have a higher risk of developing ch ronic HBV infection after acute HBV infection, prophylaxis of an unvaccinated infant less than 12 months of age with HBIG (0.5 mL) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated , if the mother or primary caregiver has acute HBV infection. Prophylaxis with HBIG for other household contacts of persons with acute or chronic HBV infection is not indicated unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes , razors or glucometers within the past 7 days . Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for household contacts and the first dose should be administered at the same visit as the prevaccination serology. Be sure to draw blood for the ser ology before administering the vaccine. If the household contact is found susceptible after serology, then administer doses 2 and 3 at the appropriate dosage and time intervals. Such exposures should be treated similarly to sexual exposures. If the index patient develops chronic HBV infection , all household contacts Georgia Immunization Office Manual Department of Public Health 7. Hepatitis - 3/2018 - Guidelines for Public Health Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics 6 Hepatitis B Vaccination in STD, HIV and Family Planning Clinics Guidelines for Public Health should be given hepatitis B vaccine. NOTE : Administering even one dose of hepatitis B vaccine allows seroconversion for 40% to 50% of persons receiving vaccine. Always encourage clients to c omplete the series, but do not withhold vaccine if uncertain that the client will return for the subsequent doses. General Hepatitis B Vaccination Requirements Please see Chapter 2, \"Vaccines to Prevent Hepatitis B\", for specific vaccine administration guidelines. Reporting Requirements All Georgia physicians, laboratories, and other health care providers are required by the authority of the Official Code of Georgia (Sections 31 -12-2 and 31 -22-7, Rules of the Department of Public Health ) to report perso ns with acute hepatitis B disease or persons who are HBsAg positive within 7 days to their County Health Department or District Health Office. Hepatitis B cases may also be reported to the Epidemiology Section. The preferred method of reporting is throug h the State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System ( SendSS ), available at https://sendss.state.ga.us/ . In addition, positive serologic tests and acute cases received by the County Health Department or Health District are to be reported via SendSS . Hepatitis B Counseling Interview Each person infected with HBV should be counseled regarding the infection and interviewed for household and sexual contacts. For more specific information, please refer to \"Example Interviewing/Counseling Format (for) Hepatitis B,\" found in the Appendix section of the Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Guidelines in this chapter.

RECALL OF PATIENTS Recall of Immunization Patients Policy Statement Immunization Documentation, \"Moved or Gone Elsewher e\" (MOGE) Categories Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health 8. Recall Of Patients - 7/2015 Recall of Immunization Patients Policy Statement 1 One of the national objectives recommended in the H ealth and Human Services document, Healthy People 2020 , calls for the completion of primary immunizations for 90% of newborn children by the time they reach two years of age. This goal is endorsed by the Georgia Immunization Program and is one of the reasons that efforts to recall children for needed immunizations is so important. In late 1985 and early 1986, the Immunization Progr am reviewed the immunization status for 2,858 children whose records were found in health d epartments in five (5) districts. Only 32% of those children had completed primary immunizations before age two (2) years. That level increased to 55% statewide by the end of 1989 and t o 93.82% by the end of 1999. Although the adequate rates for children receiving immunizations in public health clinics has steadily risen, the number of children receiving their immunizations in public health clinics has decreased. In 1998- 99, approximately 50% of immunizations were given b y private providers, and in 2007, they gave more than 80% of the childhood immunizations. Ther efore, the adequate rates for two year old children attending public health clinics is not ind icative of the status for the majority of Georgia's two year old children. In order to attain and main tain 100% immunization levels for all two year olds in a community, each health unit should addres s five (5) issues: 1. Due to the increase in the administration of imm unizations by private providers, it is important that public health ensure high levels of immunizations are maintained in each community regardless of who is providing immunizati on delivery services. Every effort should be made to educate and collaborate with othe r health providers in the community to assist them in their immunization service delive ry. 2. Health districts are responsible for conducting an annual population based study to determine the immunization level of all two year ol d children born in Georgia. The State Immunization and Epidemiology Programs will provide annual training and instruction for conducting the population-based study. 3. All children brought to health department facili ties for any reason should be screened for immunization history and served as necessary. Child ren attending specifically for immunizations should be screened for other health c are needs and served as necessary. 4. Districts should utilize Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Software Applicat ion (CoCASA) which is provided free of charge by CDC/National Im munization Program to measure the progress of its patients toward complet ion of primary immunizations and to identify problems. The Georgia Immunization Progra m will conduct at least one annual CASA audit for each health district and will provid e training in the use of this software application. As part of this application, categorie s for documenting that a child has moved or gone elsewhere for services (MOGE) were develope d by the Immunization Coordinator's Advisory Committee. To provide consis tency in measurement procedures, districts should utilize the categories for MOGE do cumentation. (See next page) 5. Each health department unit must devise and impl ement a system(s), which encourages compliance with the recommended schedules and allow s for active recall of delinquent patients.

Informed Request Policy - 7/2015 Immunization Documentation, \"Moved or Gone Elsewher e\" (MOGE) Categories 1 Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) Criteria Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) Criteria An annual assessment is conducted to determine the immunization coverage levels of children 19-35 months of age in public health depar tments. This assessment is also conducted in private provider sites bi-annually. T he Comprehensive Clinical Assessment Software Application (CoCASA) is used to assist in conducting this assessment. Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) is a process that is used in CoCASA to filter out patients that are no longer associated with the facility being assess ed. By removing these patients, immunization practices may be assessed more accurat ely. Clients should not be placed into a MOGE category o nly to improve immunization coverage rates. It is important that every effort is made to accurately identify the status of inactive children. Moved or Gone Elsewhere (MOGE) status is assigned when one of the following has occurred: a Patient has moved out of the immediate area a Patient has gone to another practice a Patient has moved with no forwarding address a Patient has died a Patient has a medical exemption issued by a phys ician a Patient has a signed and notarized religious exe mption With the exception of patients that have died, or w ho have a medical or religious exemption, all patients assigned the status of MOGE must have documentation to show that at least 3 attempts were made to contact the patient. Once the status of the patient is identified, no further attempts are required. Acceptable document ation includes: 1. The family, a neighbor, the WIC Program, Post Of fice, DFACS, etc. has notified the clinic, either in writing or by phone, that the cli ent has moved out of the area. 2. School, day care, Headstart, employer, etc., sta te that the family has moved out of the area. 3. Client reports that immunizations are being rece ived from a private physician or other health care provider. Patient is identified in GRIT S and is receiving immunizations from another provider. 4. The provider receives a request for client's rec ords to be transferred out of state. 5. The provider receives a returned post card or le tter, which has been stamped or documented as \"Moved, left no forwarding address.\" 6. A home visit was made and there is confirmation that the client no longer resides at that location. Confirmation means that someone els e is now residing at that address, or the manager of the development confirms they hav e moved. A person refusing to answer the door on a visit does not confirm the cli ent no longer lives at that address. 7.

This policy is designed to ensure: 1. Vaccine purchased with Vaccines for Children (VFC), federal and state funds are admin istered only to VFC- eligible and state-eligible recipients; 2. Vaccine loss and waste are minimized and measured; 3. The Georgia Immunization and VFC Programs are protected against fraud and abuse; 4. State, VFC and other federally purchased vaccines are ordered a ppropriately based on a provider's VFC-eligible and state-eligible populations. The increase in the number of ACIP recommended vaccines and a r ise in their associated cost s have prompted a renewed emphasis on program accountability at all levels. As part of th e enrollment and annual recertification processes for VFC and state vaccine programs, provi ders agree to comply with VFC and Georgia Immunization Program (GIP) requirements for ordering, storage, hand ling and accountability of vaccine t o avoid vaccine loss as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A). Providers als o agree to operate in a manne r intended to avoid vaccine fraud and abuse as outlined in the Georgia Vaccine Fraud and Abuse policy (Appendix B). Georgia will help ensure vaccine accountability in provider off ices by: 1. Using provider profiles to monitor provider orders; 2. Monitoring provider vaccine inve ntory levels to ensure adequate supplies of public and privately purchased vaccine for the population size served in provider offices; 3. Monitoring vaccine wastage and lo ss that occur in provider offi ces; 4. Monitoring provider activities to prevent and/or identify fraud and abuse against the VFC and state vaccine programs. 5. Providing clear guidance to providers regarding the return of e xpired and wasted public vaccine for excise tax credit. Using Provider Profiles to Monitor Provider Orders VFC Providers are required to submit supporting documents for t he enrollment estimates produced during VFC enrollment, re-enrollment, or annual re-certification with the VFC Program. Documentation is required to verify that submitted estimates are ba sed on previous years': 1. Doses administered, benchmarking , Medicaid and/or other billing data; or 2. IIS (GRITS) data. The VFC Logistics Associate will review a random provider sampl e on a monthly basis for accountability review purposes. Doses administered data will be reviewed over a 6 mon th span and data will be com pared to the providers submitted profile estimates. Aggregate vaccine data exceeding a nnual profile estimates identif ied during this will result in corrective action development and implementation as necessary, including vaccine replacement for unaccounted for doses. Page 2 of 3 Revised 4/15/2015 1. GIP staff contact providers that exceed profile amounts to dete rmine if distribution of additional vaccine is justified, or if adjustments to the profile are needed. 2. Future vaccine orders are adjust ed appropriately to ensure prov iders receive sufficient supply to serve their VFC or State-eligible population w ithout creating an increased risk for vaccine loss, fraud, and/or abuse. Monitoring of Provider Inventory Levels (Public vs. Private Sup ply) In order to receive vaccine from Georgia's VFC program, VFC-enr olled providers must comply with reporting requirements for vaccine usage in cluding: doses administered b y eligibility category, wastage, and inventory. Georgia uses the following methods as ways to monitor provider inventor y levels for both public a nd private vaccine supply: 1. VFC Program Representatives have been trained to routinely revi ew monthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, over reporting and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 2. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provide r(s) and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will res pond accordingly. Monitoring Vaccine Wastage and Loss The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Program Vaccine Loss Policy (Appendix A) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC Program for identifying, monitoring an d management of incidents that result in loss of public vaccine. The action taken by the Georgia VFC Program will depen d on the category of the vaccine loss. For this policy, lost vaccines fall under three categories: 1. Negligence, 2. Non-preventable loss, and 3. Noncompliance. VFC staff use the CDC Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirement Protocol (algorithm) to address all vaccine loss policy violations. Continued violation of any section of this p olicy will result in termination from the VFC Program. Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Abuse in Provider Offices The Georgia Department of Public Health - Immunization Program Fraud and Abuse Policy (Appendix B) details the action taken by the Georgia VFC P rogram to provide programmatic direction for the prevention of fraud and abuse in the utilization of state-supplied a nd/or VFC-funded vaccine. The Fr aud and Abuse Policy is rev iewed annually and updated, as necessary. Training on fraud and abuse takes place as part o f new employee orientation. Additionally, program staff (VFC staff and Immunization Prog ram Consultants [IPCs]) receive s annual educational updates, led by the Deputy Director. Georgia uses the following methods as ways to detect and/or pre vent fraud and abuse of public vaccine supply: 1. Upon enrollment and on a monthly basis thereafter, provider inf ormation is cross-checked against the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities on the Department of Health and H uman Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General website. If located in th e Exclusion database, provider s are not allowed to participate in VFC. 2. VFC Program staff has been trained to routinely review monthly comprehensive reports for excessive use, underreporting, and anything that may look out of the ordinary. 3. Georgia Immunization Representatives are required to review wit h the provider a vaccine accountability statement representative of at least six (6) months, which can help identify areas of pot ential fraud and/or abuse. 4. Vaccine over- and under-reporting will be reviewed with provide r, and unexplained amounts above the 5% allowance will be reported to the Deputy Director, who will res pond accordingly. 5. Any individual, group, or practice who wants to report a suspec ted case of fraud and/or abuse, a dedicated Fraud and Abuse Hotline has been imple mented and is monitored by the Deputy Director. The Fraud and Abuse hotline number is (404) 657-5950. Reports must include (as applicable): 1. Provider name and address; 2. Source of the allegation; 3. Source's name, address, and telephone number (if available) 4. A description of the reason for the report (suspected misconduc t/violation) 5. Specific VFC requirements violated; Page 3 of 3 Revised 4/15/2015 6. Value of vaccine involved (if available); 7. If the report was initiated in r esponse to a complaint, a copy and/or summary of the complaint and the complainant's name, address and telephone number; 8. Success of educational intervention; and 9. A summary of the result of any pr eliminary investigation conduc ted by GIO staff regarding allegations or suspicions of fraud or abuse. Once a report is received, the Non-compliance with VFC Provider Requirements Protocol will be used to determine the appropriate follow up action. At the GIP, the Deputy Director is the person with primary resp onsibility for responding to suspected fraud and/or abuse. The Deputy Director will have aut hority to make decisions, refe rrals, and notifications when a ppropriate. In the event that the Deputy Director is not available, the VFC Coordinator will assume responsibility. In the event that neither of these individuals is available, the Program Director will assume resp onsibility. The Deputy Director (or designa ted respondent) will review all information submitted and initia te an internal investigation on all cases reported without sufficient evidence of fraud and abuse within five (5) busin ess days of the report. All suspected cases of VFC fraud and abuse will be forwarded electr onically to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicaid Integrity Group (MIG) Field Office and CDC within ten (10) business days following disposition. MIG will conduct pre liminary investigations and, as warranted, transmit the re ferral to the appropriate oversight entity and will monito r the handling of the referral by entity. Process for Returning Expired and/or Wasted Public Vaccine All vaccine received from the GIP must always be accounted for. This includes doses administered and inventory as well as wasted and expired vaccine. Pr oviders are required to report doses wasted or expired on t heir Monthly Comprehensive Report which begins the processing of their return request and our excise tax credit process. Vaccine returns are approved by the Vaccine Logistics Associate. The Vaccine Logistics Assoc iate submits requests via VTrckS to McKesson for UPS return labels. Once returns are finalized in VTrckS, McKesson w ill ship UPS return label(s) dir ectly to the provider site. Providers are asked to box returns properly to ensure safe tran sit of the vials. Providers subm it return request monthly to ensure vaccines are returned with in 6 months following the date of expiration per VFC program requirements. The Vaccine Logistics Associate processes and screens each return t o ensure returned vaccines have been properly accounted for and determines if replaceme nt of the loss vaccine(s) are re quired according to Georgia's Vaccine Loss Policy. The Vaccine Logistics Associate ente rs all returns and wastage into VTrckS and e-mails a copy of the VTrckS Return Invoice to the provider. Providers are to place a copy of the return in voice(s) in the box with the appropriate vaccine return(s).Providers are reminded to mark expired or wasted vacc ine(s) \"DO NOT USE\" and store it securely and outside of the refrigerator to avoid acci dental administration of non-v iable vaccine. Vaccine return boxes should include: 1. Full vials or manufactured pre-filled syringes (no needle attac hed) of unused vaccine 2. Appropriate padding to protect vials from breaking 3. VTrckS Return Invoice (copy e- mailed from the VFC office) Vaccine return boxes should not include: 1. Needles or syringes with needles (vaccine that has been drawn i nto a syringe should be wasted on-site, not returned.) 2. Broken or partially used vials (including partially used multi- dose vials) 3. Paperwork or other re ports intended for VFC 4.

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 9. Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2018 Distribution Of Vaccines 1 1. The State Immunization Program will utilize comp rehensive reports, submitted by individual clinics each month to evaluate current vaccine inventory an d historical usage. Shipments of vaccines, sufficient to bring vaccine inventories to the leve l of a three-month supply, will be made if vaccine is available. 2. Comprehensive reports are to be submitted monthly v ia GRITS. 3. All vaccine shipments will be sent directly to C linic/County offices. 4. Short dated vaccines MUST be reported a minimum of 90 days before the date of expiration to the State Immunization Program, via phone (404) 657 -5013 or e-mail: DPH-gavfc@dph.ga.gov . The GRITS pre-populated report form will not genera te this information for you . 5. State supplied vaccines lost due to expiration o r spoilage must be returned to McKesson. Vaccines wasted and/or expired will appear in the w astage section of the monthly comprehensive report and returns will be processed once your repo rt has been reviewed for approving your vaccine order. Wastage that occurs as part of an i ncident require a Vaccine Incident Report that can be obtained by contacting the Vaccine Logistics Associate at 404-657-5013. 6. When vaccine shortages occur nationally, it may be necessary to move vaccine within the district. It also may be necessary to move vaccine from one d istrict to another. It is the responsibility of the Immunization Program to evaluate total state ne eds and authorize movement of vaccine when necessary. Requests for vaccine transfers must be reported to the state office via email at : DPH-gavfc@dph.ga.gov. As of January 1, 2018, each facility that stores va ccine must use continuous recording digital data lo ggers (temperature monitoring devices) that are calibrate d and certified in both the refrigerator section an d in the freezer section of the unit used for vaccine storag e. In addition to the primary thermometers, a sec ondary backup thermometer should be kept on hand as well. As of the January 1, 2018 deadline, all backup thermometers used to replace primary units during r ecalibration or malfunction must be continuous recording digital data loggers. VFC will no longer allow the use of standard calibrated thermometers for use in units storing state supplied vaccines as wel l as coolers being used to transport vaccines upon approval by the program. Temperature readings must be checked and record sto rage unit minimum and maximum temperatures at the start of each workday (see sample temperature l og). If temperatures fall outside the acceptable range, the cause must be determined and corrected immediately. Failure to have digital data loggers and to record temperatures will jeopardize your status to receive vaccine and may result in counties/distr icts having to purchase replacement vaccine. At the end of the month, temperature logs should be checked by a reviewer who will sign off on the logs. Logs sho uld be kept on file for a minimum of 3 years. Each facility that stores vaccine must have adequat e storage to assure vaccine integrity. Dormitory ty pe refrigerators are not acceptable. Routinely placin g vaccine in portable coolers during the clinic day is also unacceptable. Refrigerators must have externally s eparate sealed doors for the refrigerator and freez er compartments. As of January 1, 2016, VFC requires t hat frozen vaccines be stored in a pharmaceutical grade, or stand-alone unit. More information on rec ommended frozen vaccine storage can be found in the CDC's Storage and Handling Toolkit by clicking on t he following link https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storage/tool kit/storage-handling-toolkit.pdf An emergency plan must be developed by each facilit y for handling vaccine storage in the event of a DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department Of Public Health 9.

I will screen patients and document eligibility sta tus at each immunization encounter for VFC eligibil ity (i.e., federally or state vaccine-eligible) and administer VFC-purchased vaccine by such category only to chi ldren who are 18 years of age or younger who meet one or more of the following categories: A. Federally Vaccine-eligible Children (VFC eligible) 1. Are an American Indian or Alaska Native; 2. Are enrolled in Medicaid; 3. Have no health insurance; 4. Are underinsured: A child who has health insurance, but the coverage does not include vaccines; a chil d whose insurance covers only selected vaccines (VFC- eligible for non-covered vaccines only). Underinsured children are eligible to receive VFC v accine only through a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), or Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or unde r an approved deputization agreement. B. State Vaccine-eligible Children 1. In addition, to the extent that my state designates additional categories of children as \"state vaccineeligible\", I will screen for such eligibilit y as listed in the addendum to this agreement and w ill administer state-funded doses (including 317 funded doses) to such children. Children aged 0 through 18 years that do not meet o ne or more of the eligibility federal vaccine categ ories (VFC eligible), are not eligible to receive VFC-purchased vaccine. 4 3. For the vaccines identified and agreed upon in the provider profile, I will comply with immunization s chedules, dosages, and contraindications that are established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice s (ACIP) and included in the VFC program unless: a) In the provider's medical judgment, and in accordan ce with accepted medical practice, the provider deems such compliance to be medically inappropriate for the child; b) The particular requirements contradict state law, i ncluding laws pertaining to religious and other exemptions. 4. I will maintain all records related to the VFC prog ram for a minimum of three years and upon request m ake these records available for review. VFC records include, but are not limited to, VFC screening and eligibili ty documentation, billing records, medical records tha t verify receipt of vaccine, vaccine ordering recor ds, and vaccine purchase and accountability records. 5. I will immunize eligible children with publicly sup plied vaccine at no charge to the patient for the v accine. 6. VFC Vaccine Eligible Children I will not charge a vaccine administration fee to n on-Medicaid federal vaccine eligible children that exceeds the administration fee cap of $21.93 per vaccine dose. For Medicaid children, I will acc ept the reimbursement for immunization administration set by the state Medica id agency or the contracted Medicaid health plans. Non-VFC Vaccine Eligible Children I will not charge a vaccine administration fee to n on-Medicaid state vaccine eligible children that ex ceeds the administration fee cap of $21.93 per vaccine dose 7. I will not deny administration of a publicly purcha sed vaccine to an established patient because the c hild's parent/guardian/individual of record is unable to p ay the administration fee. 8. I will distribute the current Vaccine Information S tatements (VIS) each time a vaccine is administered and maintain records in accordance with the National Ch ildhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which includes reporting clinically significant adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). 9. I will comply with the requirements for vaccine man agement including: a) Ordering vaccine and maintaining appropriate vaccin e inventories; b) Not storing vaccine in dormitory-style units at any time; c) Storing vaccine under proper storage conditions at all times. Refrigerator and freezer vaccine storage units and temperature monitoring equipment and practices must meet Georgia Department of Public Health, Division of Health Protection, Immunization Office storage and handling requirements; d) Returning all spoiled/expired public vaccines to CD C's centralized vaccine distributor within six mont hs of spoilage/expiration 10. I agree to operate within the VFC program in a mann er intended to avoid fraud and abuse. Consistent wi th \"fraud\" and \"abuse\" as defined in the Medicaid regu lations at 42 CFR \u00a7 455.2, and for the of the VFC Program: Fraud: is an intentional deception or misrepresentation m ade by a person with the knowledge that the decepti on could result in some unauthorized benefit to himsel f or some other person. It includes any act that c onstitutes fraud under applicable federal or state law. Abuse: provider practices that are inconsistent with soun d fiscal, business, or medical practices and result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, (and/or i ncluding actions that result in an unnecessary cost to the immunization program, a health insurance company, o r a patient); or in reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary or that fail to meet profession ally recognized standards for health care. It also includes recipient practices that result in unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program. 5 11. I will participate in VFC program compliance site v isits including unannounced visits, and other educa tional opportunities associated with VFC program requireme nts. 12. For providers with a signed deputization Memorandum of Understanding between a FQHC or RHC and the Georgia Department of Public Health, Division of He alth Protection, Immunization Office to serve under insured VFC-eligible children, I agree to: a) Include \"underinsured\" as a VFC eligibility categor y during the screening for VFC eligibility every visit; b) Vaccinate \"walk-in\" VFC-eligible underinsured ren; and c) Report required usage data Note: \"Walk-in\" in this context refers to any underinsure d child who presents requesting a vaccine; not just established patients. \"Walkin\" does not mean that a provider must serve underinsur ed patients without an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for all patients to make an appointment to receive immunizations then t he policy would apply to underinsured patients as w ell. 13. For pharmacies, urgent care, or school located vacc ine clinics, I agree to: a) Vaccinate all \"walk-in\" VFC-eligible children and b) Will not refuse to vaccinate VFC-eligible children based on a parent's inability to pay the administra tion fee. Note: \"Walk-in\" refers to any VFC eligible child who pres ents requesting a vaccine; not just established pat ients. \"Walk-in\" does not mean that a provider must serve VFC patients without an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for a ll patients to make an appointment to receive immunizations then the policy would apply t o VFC patients as well. 14. I agree to replace vaccine purchased with state and federal funds (VFC, 317) that are deemed non-viabl e due to provider negligence on a dose-for-dose basis. 15. Pursuant to O.C.G.A.\u00a731-12-3, the vaccination data for every dose of vaccine administered by the clini c will be entered into the Georgia Registry of Immunization T ransactions and Services (GRITS) within thirty (30) business days of the service being rendered. 16. I understand this facility or the Georgia Departmen t of Public Health, Division of Health Protection, Immunization Office may terminate this agreement at any time. If I choose to terminate this agreement, I will properly return any unused federal vaccine as direc ted by the Georgia Department of Public Health, Div ision of Health Protection, Immunization Office. By signing this form, I certify on behalf of myself and all immunization providers in this facility, I have read and agree to the Vaccines for Children enrollment requi rements listed above and understand I am accountabl e (and each listed provider is individually accountable) f or compliance with these requirements.

Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2018 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 02/11/2018 1 Georgia Immunization Office Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions To protect vaccine and to minimize the potential mo netary loss from inclement weather conditions such as tornadoes; hurricanes; and tropi cal, ice, snow, rain, lightening, or wind storms, etc., emergency procedures at the provider level should be implemented immediately. A part of this implementation should include communic ation to all providers who receive publicly purchased vaccines, or at least to those in the geo graphic areas of highest risk. When the state/local officials or a provider has re asonable cause to believe that weather conditions have the potential to disrupt power and/ or flood any office where vaccine is stored, emergency procedures should be implemented IN ADVAN CE OF THE EVENT. In advance of the emergency, all providers should e nsure the following: A. Identification of an alternative storage facilit y (hospital, packing plant, state depot, etc.), with back-up power (generator), where the vaccine c an be properly stored and monitored for the duration of the storm (provider needs to en sure that the receiving site is able to store multiple sites, if they have signed agreement s with multiple sites). A written agreement (updated annually) is strongly advised; B. The availability of staff to pack and move the v accine; C. The use of appropriate packing containers, certi fied digital data logger, and conditioned frozen water bottles; and D. The transport of the vaccine to the secure stora ge facility. It is appropriate for providers to suspend vaccinat ions before weather conditions deteriorate. Sufficient time must be allowed for packing and tra nsporting vaccine BEFORE the storm can adversely affect local conditions. There are other precautions and appropriate measure s one can take to protect vaccine inventories using the emergency procedures describe d below. The following includes some HELPFUL HINTS AND REFERENCE INFORMATION. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES A. List emergency phone numbers, companies, and poi nts of contact for: 1. Electrical power company: 2. Refrigeration repair company: 3. Temperature alarm monitoring company: 4. Perimeter alarm repair company: 5. Perimeter alarm monitoring company: 6.

Novartis: Purchased by GSK B. Providers may contact the Georgia Immunization P rogram (GIP) for assistance in identifying hospitals, health departments or other facilities that could serve as emergency vaccine storage facilities and communicate this inf ormation. This might also be done at the district or county level and/or with assistance from the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The GIP will prioritize assistance a nd communication to target providers in areas at highest risk, e.g., low lying coastal o r floodplain areas. C. Entering vaccine storage spaces: Describe, when necessary, how to enter the building and vaccine storage spaces in an emergency if close d or after hours. Include a floor diagram and the locations of: 1. Doors 2. Flash lights 3. Spare batteries 4. Light switches 5. Keys 6. Locks 7. Alarms 8. Circuit breakers 9. Packing materials D.

Vaccine Distribution and Storage - 02/2018 Handling Of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions Revised 02/11/2018 3Georgia Immunization Program Handling of Vaccine During Inclement Weather Conditions E. Identify what vaccines to pack first in an emerg ency and while the power is still working: 1. Pack the refrigerated vaccines first with an ade quate supply of cold packs and certified digital data loggers. 2. Remove and pack the varicella vaccines, using co ld packs and certified digital data logger, immediately prior to transport F. Pack and transport all vaccine or if that is not possible, determine the types and amount to save; e.g., save only the most expensive vaccine s to minimize dollar loss or save some portion of all vaccines to ensure a short-term , complete supply for resuming the vaccination schedule. Priority should be given to t hose vaccines which would be the most expensive to replace (pneumococcal conjugate, varic ella, DTaP/HepB/IPV, Hep B/Hib, MMR). G. packing procedures for transport to backup storage facilities: 1. Open refrigerated units only when necessary and only after you have made all preparations for packing and moving the vaccine to alternative storage sites. 2. Use properly insulated containers. 3. Do not place vaccines that cannot be frozen dire ctly against cold packs. (Note: MMR can be stored frozen or refrigerated.) 4. Follow vaccine handling guidelines. The followi ng are important tips to remember: --Varicella vaccine is fragile and should be used w ithin 72 hours of placing on wet ice or in a refrigerated environment. --MMR vaccine can be refrigerated or frozen, but sh ould be kept out of direct light. --All other vaccines should be maintained at refrig erator temperature. H. Move vaccine to backup storage according to pre- arranged plans. Pre-arranged plans should take into consideration the following: 1. How to load the transportation vehicle 2. Routes to take 3. Time enroute 4. Temperature monitoring with a continuous recordi ng data logger (maintenance of temperature log with temperatures checked twice dai ly) while vaccine is in backup storage I. On returning inventory to the clinic/practice/ph armacy, vaccines should be checked carefully and placed in the appropriate refrigerato r or freezer compartments. If the provider is not able to assure viability, GIP shoul d be contacted before using any vaccines that may not be effective for protecting c hildren and/or adults against disease.

Children are only eligible for vaccines that are not covered by insurance. In addition, to receive VFC vaccine, underinsured children must be vaccinated through a Federally Qualified Health Cent er (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or under an approved deputized provid er. The deputized provider must have a written agreement with an FQHC/RHC and the state/local/territorial immunization program in order to vaccinate these underinsured children. 2Other underinsured are children that are underinsured b ut are not eligible to receive federal vaccine through the VFC program because the provider or facility is not a FQHC/RHC or a deputized pr ovider. However, these children may be served if vaccin es are provided by the state program to cover these non-VFC eligible children. 3CHIP - Children enrolled in the state Children's Health Insu rance Program (CHIP).

Georgia Immunization Program Manual Department of Public Health FOREIGN TRAVEL INFORMATION 12. Travel Information - 01/2018 Foreign Travel Information 1In general, U.S. citizens who are up-to-date with regard to the ACIP recommendations do not need any additional immunizations. When advising individuals regarding foreign travel, recommend they check their immunization record to see if they are due to receive any of the vaccines routinely recommended by the ACIP. The CDC may recommend other vaccines and prophylaxis depending on traveler destination and kind of traveler (e.g. pregnant women, immunocompromised, etc.). Therefore, it is important that if you administer vaccines for travel purposes, you have a system for keeping current information regarding travel requirements for specific countries. These recommendations should be referred to for specific vaccine dosage and administration information and guidelines. How to Obtain Travel Vaccines The Georgia Department of Public Health does not purchase and distribute any vaccines or preventive medications that might be recommended for travel. Healthcare Providers must obtain these from the drug manufacturer. For direct travel from the United States only a few countries require certificates. No vaccinations are required for return to the United States. Travel Resource Information Travelers and immunization travel clinics may refer to the following resources when seeking information about recommendations and requirements: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Internet Address: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ CDC Health Information for International Travel (commonly called the Yellow Book) is published every two years as a reference for those who advise international travelers about health risks.

QUALITY ASSURANCE Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement for Immunization Practice for Public Health Nurses and Immunization staff QA/QI Immunization Attachment H 1 Revised September 2016 GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH Guidelines for Student Nurses Administering Immunizations for Clinical Experience in Public Health Settings The Department of Public Health supports the concept of providing student nurses meaningful and appropriate learning opportunities related to vaccine -preventable diseases and immunizations as part of their clinical experience. Administering immunizations to people in the community is a fundamental role for public health. Assessing the immunization n eeds of communities and individuals is an integral part of public health services. Public health assesses immunization status as a rou tine part of serving each individual receiving clinical service. Public health also monitors the immunization status of communitie s and the state and collaborates with private and public partners and community agencies to improve immunization levels. Because improving the immunization status of a community is such an important public health issue, the Department supports ef forts to assure that student nurses receive planned opportunities to learn about this public health role, which may include clinical experience in the actual administration of immunizations, reviewing the data sources for monitoring immunization levels for communit ies and planning with community partners to improve immunization levels. The student learning experience related to immunizations should be planned to include the following: 1. The written agreement between the nursing school and the public health agency sh ould clearly specify the responsibilities of public health and those of the nursing school, including a) Orientation to immunizations and vaccine preventable diseases prior to student beginning clinical experience (suggested training may be found at http://dp h.georgia.gov/health -care -professionals ) b) Who is responsible for clinical supervision of the students; c) Who is responsible for overall provision of patient care; and d) Compliance with public health guidelines/policies/procedures and documentation requirements related to immunizations. 2. The written agreement should specify that each student is covered by liability insurance carried by the school.

IMMUNIZATIONS INTRODUCTION The Georgia Immunization Program, within the Georgia Department of Public Health produces an Immunization Program Manual based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations that outline the recommended Policies and Procedures f or administering vaccines by Registered Nurses and for providing immunization services. An advisory committee consisting of District Immunization Coordinators and Pediatricians, a State Pharmacist and the Immunization Program management team, review and u pdate the manual on an ongoing basis. All public health locations that provide vaccine services will utilize the current edition of the Georgia Department of Public Health Immunization Program (GIP) Manual as outlined in the Standard Nurse Protocol for Ch ildhood and Adult Immunizations located at https://dph.georgia.gov/nurse -protocols . Each district is responsible for having written policies and procedures for the administration of travel vaccines th at have been reviewed and signed annually by the health director or their designee if applicable. PURPOSE The purpose of this QA/QI tool is to document the training/education expectations and the parameters of clinical practice for immunization service s. Use of this tool will help promote consistency in practice across programs on a statewide basis and provide an opportunity to identify excellence in practice, as well as opportunities for improvement. The components of this tool may be used to conduct QA reviews of training programs and administration of vaccines by registered nurses. These reviews may be done by Public Health staff from either the local or state level. The credentialing, training and education expectations as well as the parameters o f clinical practice for Licensed Practical Nurses in immunization services are in Chapter 13 of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. This tool may be used when evaluating immunization services provided by Licensed Practical Nurses.

STANDARD OPERATING GUIDELINES FOR MASS VACCINATION CLINICS Mass Vaccination Guide Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Pub lic Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 12/2017 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 1 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Conducting stan Guidel ines Introduction Any mass vaccinating effort in response to a bioterrorism or naturally occurring event will require pre -event planning and coordination of vaccines, personnel, facilities, communication, and other support activities. The purpose of this anne x to the Immunization Program Manual is to provide standard operating standards and generic templates for the vaccinating processes that meet State and federal laws related to mass vaccination clinics. The standards will include the following information to assist districts and local clinics in planning and including mass vaccination activities in their written emergency operations plan: Guidelines for the administration of routinely supplied vaccines Determination of need for mass vaccination clinic(s) Mass clinic goals Vaccine supply Storing and handling vaccines Authority to vaccinate Suggested roles and responsibilities Informed consent Documentation of vaccination Adverse events following vaccination Recommended references The templates included in the appendices are not meant to be all -inclusive and should be adapted according to the type of event and the number of persons that need to be served. In providing these standards , the assumption applies that districts have made arrangements for and ha ve addressed the following issues in their written emergency operations plans: The securing of appropriate administration site facilities and medical supplies The provisions for staffing The addressing of liability, training and education issues The establ ishment of communication, security, transportation, and storage and handling procedures The establishment of guidelines for the requesting, obtaining, administration, and documentation of vaccines routinely provided to the districts and local health depar tments Standards for the Administration of Routinely Supplied Vaccines The standards for administration of vaccines routinely provided by the State Immunization Program outlined in the \"Recommended Schedule and Standards \" section of the Georgia Immunizati on Program Manual should be followed and a written copy of this manual must be readily accessible to clinics. In addition, this manual may be accessed through the Georgia Immunization Program web site: https://dph.georgia.gov/immunization -publications These standards are based upon ACIP Recommendations located on the following web site: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pr ofessionals/vaccination/vax_clinic.htm Clinics must be able to access the ACIP recommendations either as written copies located on site or through the above mentioned web site. In an emergency situation, a current hard copy must be accessible. Determination of Need for Mass Vaccination Clinic(s) Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Pub lic Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 12/2017 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 2 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Conducting stan Guidel ines Prior to the implementation of a mass vaccination clinic(s), determination of persons/populations who are considered to be \"at risk\" and need to receive vaccinations should be done by state and local hea lth officials based on epidemiologic surveillance, reporting information and current CDC and ACIP recommendations. Recommendations outlined in the current Georgia Immunization Program Manual and the following documents and/or web sites should be referen ced regarding exposure to vaccine preventable diseases: Georgia Notifiable Disease Manual (Not available as a complete manual. Disease -specific fact sheets are available online at: http://d ph.georgia.gov/vaccine -preventable -diseases : (Click on view fact sheet {i.e. Notifiable Disease: xxxxxx}) CDC Surveillance and Reporting http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv web site : www.bt.cdc.gov /bioterrism The need to establish a mass clinic(s) will be dependent upon the number of persons who need to be vaccinated and the accessibility of appropriate vaccination sites. Mass Clinic Goals The goal of a ma ss vaccination clinic should be to vaccinate with the appropriate vaccine(s) and provide accompanying education to persons who have been determined to be \"at risk\" by epidemiological surveillance, public health reporting and CDC/ ACIP recommendations. Oth er arrangements should be made to vaccinate or dispense medications to persons who are unable to attend the mass dispensing /vaccination sites. District and local plans should include estimates for how many persons can be vaccinated within designated tim e periods, utilizing a designated number of sites and stations at each site according to the current CDC recommendations. District and local plans should also address the dispensing of medication at a mass clinic site, since there is a possibility that a dministration of vaccine(s) and dispensing of medications may need to occur simultaneously. In this incidence, nursing protocols that are included in the current Nurse Protocol Manual and the Protocol Manual for Chemical and Biological Agents should be ref erenced. See Appendix A to this document for samples of Vaccine Administration /Dispensing Flow charts. Vaccine Supply The provision and distribution of vaccines routinely supplied to public health clinics from the State and federally funded Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program is outlined in the \"Vaccine for Children and Adult Vaccine Program Policy and Procedure \" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. District and local clinics should assess current vaccine supplies, estimate the amount of vaccine(s) needed for response, and request any additional vaccine needed according to standards outlined by the State Immunization Program and CDC. Vaccine usage and supply inventories should be documented according to the standards outlined in \"Vaccine f or Children and Adult Vaccine Program Policy and Procedure\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. In the event that an emergency situation may warrant the administration of vaccine(s) that are not routinely provided by the State or VFC prog ram, the State Immunization Program, working in collaboration with Pharmacy, Epidemiology and Emergency Preparedness will follow CDC's guidelines for obtaining and administering vaccines. If an investigational new drug (IND) is recommended by CDC, guidance for requesting obtaining and administering this drug(s) will be obtained from the CDC and FDA and communicated to the districts. Storing and Handling of Vaccine(s) The storage and handling of vaccines that are routinely provided by the State and VFC is outlined in the \"Vaccine For Children & Adult Vaccine Program Policies and Procedures \" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual and should be adhered to. The guidelines include instructions and templates for documenting storage temperatures and tr ansporting vaccines if indicated. Guidelines detailed in the \"McKesson Vaccine Return Instructions\" for reporting short -dated vaccine, rotation of stock, and returning unused vaccine should be followed.

Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 12/2017 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 3 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Conducting stan Guidel ines Authority to Vaccinate Georgia law empowers cert ain licensed health professionals to administer vaccines. There are no provisions in the Code or in the state's rules and regulations that explicitly give individuals who are not licensed health care professionals the same authority. However, the Georgia Emergency Management Act of 1981 may be interpreted to provide non -licensed health care professionals the authority to vaccinate by deeming such individuals emergency management workers and volunteers that are engaged in emergency management activities. It also appears that this issue can be resolved through the rul es and regulations process. DPH can develop a rule that specifically authorizes volunteers, who are not licensed health care professionals, to administer the smallpox vaccine. Various health professionals are currently considered to have the authority to administer vaccines under the Georgia Code due to their job duties, job descriptions, protocols, or delegation from a physician. Some of these professionals can only administer medications/d rugs while under the supervision of another. Following is a list of health professionals followed by the statute that provides them with the authority to administer medications/ drugs, i.e. vaccinate: Physicians . (30)(A) and (8) and O.C.G.A. \u00a743 -34-26.1 (b). Advanced Practice Nurses - Certified Nurse Midwife, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Nurse Practitioner and Clinical Nurse Specialist . O.C.G.A. \u00a743 -26-3 (1), (6) \u00a731 -11-55. The Code does not give the following professionals explicit authority to administer drugs. Acupuncturists . O.C.G.A. \u00a743 -34-62 (1) and (4) (acupuncture does not include administering drugs). Veterinarians. O.C.G.A. \u00a743 -50-3 (5) (can only administer drugs to animals). Chiropractors . O.C.G.A. \u00a743 \u00a7\u00a743 -11-1 (5) and 43 -11-17 (can prescribe drugs, but can only perform procedures in the oral cavity). Suggested Roles and Responsibilities District and loca l health departments written plans should include: Plans for recruitment, liability, training and use of personnel, including volunteers Detailed description of process of triage, registering and administering vaccine to appropriate individuals. Process should include venue specific roles and responsibilities for command and support personnel as outlined in CDC's Incident Command guidelines (See Appendix A) Lay out of clinic plan and flow chart List of supplies needed Plans to vaccinate first responders in a separate setting prior to implementation of a mass vaccination clinic, when indicated (i.e. smallpox) Plans for utilizing teams of personnel to administer and/or dispense medication to persons that would be unable to attend a mass clinic Plans for i dentifying persons who require personalized attention in the mass clinic setting due to physical, mental, or communication issues See Appendices B1, B2, B3, and B4 to this document for sample templates of Dispensing/ Vaccination Site Command charts and Ap pendices C1, C2 and C3 for sample templates of Clinic, District and State Vaccination Report forms. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Pub lic Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 12/2017 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 4 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Conducting stan Guidel ines Informed Consent Prior to administering vaccines, informed consent should be secured. Consent for treatment is documentation that the person has been pro vided information about the purposes, risks, benefits, and alternatives for care. In Georgia, the legal definition of a person authorized to make a request for immunization is cited as the Georgia Medical Consent Law located in the Official Code of Georgi a, Annotated, Title 31, Chapter 9, 12/2001. A copy of this law and an explanation of the informed consent process and the mandated use of current Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) prior to vaccinating are located in the \"Informed Request Policy\" sectio n of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. The policies outlined in this section should be referenced and utilized by districts in conducting vaccination clinics. Documentation of Vaccination Required documentation of vaccine administration is outline d in the \"Informed Request Policy\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. Documentation of each vaccine administered and the receipt by vaccine recipients (or their parent or legal representative) of the current appropriate VIS is required in the vaccine recipient's medical record. Georgia law requires that vaccines administered to individuals of all ages must be documented in the Georgia Registry of Immunization Tran sactions and Services (GRITS). This legal requirement is referenced in the \"Requirements of Law\" section of the Immunization Program Manual. GRITS may be utilized as an individual's medical record of immunization. In addition, immunizations may be recorded on form number 25-IMM-002 E, \"Georgia Vaccine Administration Record\", w hich is located in the \"Informed Request Policy\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. When vaccines are administered in a mass vaccination clinic situation, each clinic is responsible for tracking, documenting, and reporting the number of d oses of each vaccine administered during designated time periods. The Vaccine Site Coordinator is ultimately responsible for submitting summary reports of the number of doses administered to the District Command Site at the designated times. See Appendix C 1, \"Clinic Site Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. In addition, each clinic site is responsible for tracking, documenting and keeping a record of the number of personnel working in the mass vaccination clinic. The District Comman d Site is responsible for collecting, tabulating, and reporting to the Georgia Immunization Program, the total number of vaccines doses administered in all of the sites located within their district for the time periods that have been established in collab oration with the State Immunization Program and the E mergency Operation Center (EOC) . See Appendix C 2, \"District Command Site Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. The District Command Sites should submit the total number of doses admi nistered, requests for additional vaccine, and any other pertinent information as part of their \"Situation Report\" which is located on the web based EOC. See Appendix C 3, \"Georgia Immunization Vaccination Report\" for a suggested tabulating template. Screening for contraindications to vaccines shall be completed prior to administration of a vaccine. Sample forms (one for children and teens and another for adults) that can be utilized to screen for contraindications to the vaccines routinely recommended by ACIP and to document the screening process are located in the \"Recommended Schedule and Standards \" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. In the event of an emergency situation where an investigational new drug (IND) might be recommended by CDC, an IND consent form for off -labeled use must be utilized. In this instance, guidance and forms obtained from the CDC and FDA will be utilized and distributed to the districts. Adverse Events Following Vaccination Each district should utilize the guidelines outlined in the Nursing Protocols for Registered Nurses, Chapter 12 , Emergency Guidelines, Policies, Procedures and Protocol located on the Georgia Public Health Nursing website at https:// dph.georgia.gov/nurse -protocols or develop and utilize emergency protocols and procedures consistent with those outlined in the State Nurse Protocols. Georgia Immunization Program Manual Division Of Pub lic Health 14. Mass Vaccination Clinic Standards - 12/2017 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics 5 Standard Operating Guidelines for Conducting Mass Vaccination Clinics Conducting stan Guidel ines Any adverse reaction or event occurring after the administration of a routinely recommended vaccine s hould be documented and reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) according to the guidelines established in the \"Adverse Events Following Vaccination\" section of the Georgia Immunization Program Manual. VAERS is a national vaccine saf ety surveillance program. Reporting an event to VAERS does NOT file a claim for compensation. VAERS form can be downloaded at http://vaers.hhs.gov/index The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act created the Vacc ine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to compensate individuals whose injuries may have been caused by vaccines recommended by the CDC for routine use. VICP provides liability protection to both vaccine companies and health care providers. If there is an adverse reaction requiring medical treatment, that treatment should be paid for by the individual or their insurance company, not the administrator or the vaccine company. If the reaction is one covered by the VICP, an individual can file a claim with VIC P. A civil claim can only be filed against the vaccine company and/or the vaccine administrator after first filing a claim under the VICP and then rejecting the decision of the Court. Information on VICP can be obtained from the VICP website http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html . Recommended References Current versions of reference materials should be readily accessible for individuals administering the vaccines routinely reco mmended by the ACIP.
