Acupuncture is an effective form of medical treatment that has evolved into a complete holistic health care system. Acupressure is an ancient Chinese healing method that involves applying pressure to certain meridian points on the body to relieve pain. Cupping therapy is an ancient method of treatment that has been used in the treatment of a broad range of conditions. The herbal tradition of China is valued scientifically, as well as being a fascinating and popular tradition. When used in conjunction with Western fertility treatments, acupuncture increases conception rates by 26%. Oriental medicine places high value on diet and nutrition. However, rather than the popular \"you are what you eat\" dogma, Oriental medical theory asserts that balanced dietary practices are just one piece of a healthy lifestyle. Microneedling is a very simple, safe, effective, and minimally invasive therapeutic technique. Our professional therapists offer nano needling, an esthetic treatment targeted to reduce fine lines, improve skin texture, and remove acne scarring.
