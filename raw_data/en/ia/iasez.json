He' s try\u00ad ing to make sure no parents ever have to go through the trauma of watching their son die. Skowronek's son Michael, who was a Drexel freshman majoring in information systemsthis year, died on Nov. 12 of meningococcal meningitis, about 24 hours after he first felt ill. That' s the nature of meningi\u00ad tis. It can kill someone very swiftly. It' s caused by a common bacteria, one that about 20 per\u00ad cent of the population carries in a harmless state. Only one percent of peoplewho carry the bacteria ever develop the meningitis disease. But to those who do develop it, the results can be devastating. The disease begins with flu-like symptoms like fever, vomiting and severe headaches. Neck stiff\u00ad ness, lethargy and a rash can set in quickly. A coma often follows. About 200 people a year die inAmerica from the disease, while* another 2,000 recover \u2014 many with amputated limbs and per\u00ad manent mental damage. \"Statistically, it kills more peo\u00ad ple than tornadoes and hurri\u00ad canes,\" Skowronek said. \"It' s like having an Oklahoma City [bombing] every single year.\" The bacteria that causes Court drops banned in Main Building Starting June 16, student organizations will no longer be allowed to hang court drops in the Main Building's Great Court. Patricia O'Brien EDITOR-IN-CHIEF Effective Monday, June 16, the court drops that students have used for over 30 years to adver\u00ad tise events will no longer be per\u00ad mitted in the Main Building's Great Court. A recent admonishment by an official from the PhiladelphiaFire Department and the March 9 fire that gutted the University of Pennsylvania' s historic Asbury Methodist Church were the main reasons for banning the court drops, according to Senior Vice President for Student Life and Administrative Services Tony Caneris. \"We're trying to eliminate apotentially dangerous situation,\" Drexel' s Director of Public Safety Richard Cottom said. The paper court drops, which are painted by students, hang 20 feet in length over the third-floor rail\u00ad ings. Since the Great Court is an open space \u2014 with no walls around the court to separate each floor of the building \u2014 fireNoah Addis The Triangle would spread more easily from floor to floor than in a typical multi-story building. Commenting on the devastat\u00ad ing fire at the Asbury Methodist Church, Caneris said, \"It' s some\u00ad thing that I worry about because that is exactly what [would] hap\u00ad pen to [the Main] Building. ...

The Triangle loses about 20 percent of its staff each year, more or less. This year, however, it' s more. Much more. Eight senior staff members are graduating, including five out of the six editors on the staff. Chief among them, no pun intended, are editor-in-chief Patty O'Brien and managing editor Jon Poet. Also graduating are sports editor Larry Rosenzweig, enter\u00adtainment editor Brad Wible, photo editor Noah Addis, busi\u00ad ness manager Jay Kimball, columnist and former entertain\u00ad ment editor Nick DiFranco, and staff writer and photographer Sean Murphy. To say that this was an influ\u00ad ential group of staffers would be an understatement. Not only did they rise to positions of influ\u00ad ence, but most of them did so early in their academic careers.

Chairman of the BPD com\u00ad mittee, mechanical engineering and mecjianics professor Jona\u00ad than Awerbuch, said while salaries for assistant professors at Drexel are \"competitive,\" those for the associate and full profes\u00ad sors \"are falling behind.\" BPD com\u00ad mittee to \"help the president on strategic planning and to work with him to establish the plan by which the [faculty] compensa- See Faculty salary on page 2 Computer support outsourced Jonathan Poet MANAGING EDITOR On July 1, the Equipment Support Group will close its doors a final time. The group, which is part of the Office of Computing Services, has been responsible for selling and ser\u00ad vicing Apple Macintosh comput\u00ad ers for more than 10 years. ESG' s two functions, sales and service, have been outsourced to separate groups. Fewer Apple sales led to the dissolution of the group, according to Senior Vice President for Finance Frank Bachich. In the fall of 199b, the Uni\u00ad versity began supporting Win\u00ad dows 95-based computers for students who did not want to buy Apple computers. The Uni\u00ad versity's Chief Information Officer John Bielec said that nearly 25 percent of incoming freshmen took advantage of the offer and didn' t buy a Macintosh See E5G outsourcing on page 4 U niversity/N ational T he Triangle June 6,1997 Faculty Senate addresses salary Issue Faculty salary from page 1 tion will be similar to that of competing institutions.\" The BPD committee is tabu\u00ad lating a survey it sent out May 23 to full-time faculty members. The survey seeks faculty opinion on their satisfaction regarding Drexel's support of teaching and learning environm ents and University life. The professors were asked to rate their level of satisfaction on issues such as facilities, salaries, benefits and campus security. More than 100 full-time facul\u00ad ty members have responded to date, Awerbuch said. He will pre\u00ad sent the survey results at the June 10 Faculty Senate meeting. The results of the survey will help the BPD committee form a position on the compensation issue. Electrical and computer engi\u00ad neering professor Kambiz Pourrezaei, who is Faculty Senate chair, said, \"We want to work with the President. We [intend] to cooperate.\" He and other Faculty Senate officers will meet with Papadakis on June 10 before the Faculty Senate meeting to address the issue. Papadakis wrote in the strate\u00ad gic planning docum ent, \"The heart of every great university is its faculty. To continue to attract and retain an outstanding facul\u00ad ty, our objective over the next five years is to provide state-of- the-art teaching and research resources and com petitive salaries and fringe benefits.\" In the planning docum ent, Papadakis com pared Drexel's faculty average salaries to \"Peer Universities\" and members of the Big Ten Conference. The 12 peer universities cho\u00ad sen were Carnegie Mellon U niversity, Case W estern Reserve U niversity, Georgia Institute of Technology, Lehigh University, N ortheastern University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute ofTechnology, Stevens Institute of Technology, U niversity of C incinnati and W orcester Polytechnic Institute. Carnegie Mellon, Georgia Tech and Rensselaer have the overall quality Drexel wants to achieve, Papadakis wrote. At the May 27 University Assembly meeting, Papadakis gave a presentation on faculty compensation and benefits. He presented data of average tenure track faculty salaries of Drexel and the peer universities for the 1995-96 academic year. The data suggested that Drexel faculty members come in at the middle of the pack with $59,700 annual salary. Carnegie Mellon tops the list with $73,500 while Polytechnic University comes in last at $51,700. Papadakis also compared the faculty salaries paid by Drexel and the schools in the Big Ten Conference. According to the chart, Drexel is also near the average. Papadakis said sonie faculty members have told him that their salaries are not competitive. The numbers indicated on the charts suggested that the Drexel faculty members are paid competitively, Papadakis said. He said the recent increase in enrollment has generated more revenue for the University, but it has also created more spending. Papadakis said giving faculty members a salary raise would be difficult. \"We need you-to be.happy. We need you to WQrJk.har^,\" Papadakis said to end his University Assembly presenta-f tion. * In the past 10 yearSj Awerbuch said Drexel has compared itself with other doctoral granting institutions in the region such as Carnegie M ellon University, Temple University, Pennsylvania State U niversity and Lehigh University. The statistics from those schools are provided by the A m erican Association ofUniversity Professors. Each school provides three pay levels for its assistant profes\u00ad sors, associate professor and full professors. Awerbuch said using the average salaries for all three faculty levels are misleading. Awerbuch m aintains that Drexel has an unusual makeup of its faculty body; only 14 of 285 full-time Drexel faculty members are assistant professors. The average salary for all full-time faculty members, as used by Papadakis, leans toward the salaries of associate and full pro\u00ad fessors. The figures for Drexel faculty salaries do not include a sbc per\u00ad cent raise in January that brought the average full-time faculty salary to $62,800. . The May 25 Strategic Planning Assumptions docum ent is the final version from Papadakis. The document will set founda\u00adtions for the Strategic Plan for the University. Pehding approval by the Board of Trustees, the document provides direction to lead the University to where it wants to be in year 2002. The document sets specific goals for the University to become \"high quality, very selective, [and] financially sound.\" Papadakis is wrote in the doc\u00ad ument that he revised the draft based on feedback from the University community for earlier versions. Awerbuch told The Triangle that the Faculty Senate BPD committee is drafting resolution to address faculty concerns in the document. Among the concerns, the current draft calls for \"strengthening Drexel's compet\u00ad itive position for attracting and retaining an excellent faculty ... faculty compensation should be adjusted vis-a-vis peer institu- tion(s).\" Faculty salary comparisons The 1995-96 faculty salaries for regional doctoral granting institutions (in thousands): Full A sspftete faculty salary for members of th e Association of independent Technology Universities (in thousands): .

Mostafa Hefny said the classi- 'fication, based solely on his country of origin, has kept him from seeking jobs, grants, schol\u00ad arships and loans as a member of a minority group. He said that even though he's from Egypt, his ancestry is from the ancient black kingdom of Nubia, now part of m odern Egypt and Sudan. Hefny said his hair is kinkier, his complexion darker and his features m ore African than blacks such as D etroit Mayor Dennis Archer and retired Gen. Colin Powell. \"I was born and raised in Africa and they were not,\" said Hefny, a 46-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen. \"And yet they are classified as black and I am clas\u00ad sified as white.\" The lawsuit, filed in March in federal court in Detroit, targets directive No. 15 of the U.S. Office of Management and Bud\u00ad get, a document drafted in 1977 that sets racial categories for all federal record keeping, including the U.S. Census. The directive defines blacks as having origins with the black racial groups of Africa. But it defines whites as having, origins with original peoples of Europe, the Middle East \u2014 and North Africa, including Egypt. No court date has been set for the lawsuit. Hefny said he doesn't plan to serve it on the QMS until later this summer. An OMB spokesman referred questions to the Justice Depart\u00ad ment, which did not return a phone noessage. Hefny, an unemployed bilin\u00ad gual educator, said millions of Uacks born in England.

In the year-long project, the seniors designed a visitor's cen\u00ad ter, footbridge and a partially submerged observatory for the John Pennekam p Coral Reef State Park in Florida. The group addressed the potential effects of hurricanes and the design's possible damage to the environment. It has been designed to save money in the complicated construction pro\u00ad cess. \"As a faculty member the m om ent their award was announced was one of the most exciting since I've been atDrexel,\" Mitchell said. \"There's nothing so satisfying, however, as seeing a group you like and respect develop their talents and be rewarded for an extraordinary amount of hard work.\" The $1,000 second prize went to the mechanical engineering project \"Remote Source Fiber Optic Illumination: Design of an Illum inator\" by Sipra Prasad, Robert Cruz, Dennis Costandino and Raymond Heising. The design is intended to be used with a flexible light pipe for use in the remote source lighting industry. The group was advised by mechanical engineering andmechanics associate professor Alan Lau and research assistant professor Wei Sun. Two materi\u00ad als engineering majors, Cather\u00ad ine Miller and Wynn Sanders, and two mechanical engineering majors, Eric Rohrbaugh and Jennifer Finnimore, teamed up to make \"The Dragon Flyer, A Design for M ini-Flight.\" The project took the $500 third place prize. The authors suggested that the design is \"the smallest'navi\u00ad gable radio-controlled helicopter ever designed and constructed.\" Prize money was provided by 1966 Drexel graduate William Mitchell, who is president and Spring Dance Noah Addis The Triangle The department of performing arts opened the Drexel Dance Ensemble's 1997 Spring Concert on June 5.

Drexel News USGA closes year without quorum The Undergraduate Student Government Association did not reach quorum on June 2 for the last regularly scheduled meeting of its 1996-97 officers. Three leg\u00ad islative officers were present. Six were needed for USGA to con\u00ad duct an official meeting. President-elect Ed Gillison intended to discuss the finalizing of write-in candidates to fill the remaining open officer positions. According to USGA Elections Chair Banu Ibisi, many of the 20 open positions ended up in ties among write-in candidates. Gillison announced that the issue will be moved to USGA's first m eeting of the sum m er term, when he officially takes office. During spring term, the USGA achieved quorum only once, on April 28, for its weekly meeting.

' U niversity T he Triangle June 6,1997 Court drop tradition removed from Main Building Court drops from page J Any kind of smoke that would go up like that would be almost impossible to stop,\" The Main Building at 32nd and Chestnut Streets has been the heart of D rexel's cam pus since the University was first dedicated as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry in December of 1891, The building is 106 years old, just two years younger than the Asbury Methodist Church two blocks to the west on Chestnut Street,Caneris told The Triangle that a Philadelphia Fire Department official pointed out to him that the court drops were a potential hazard when the official was on campus about three months ago. The official was touring the Main Building, where the 171st cadet class of the Philadelphia Fire Academy will hold its graduation this summer. A ccording to Cottom , the University was not officially cited for the court drops, but the Philadelphia Fire Department \"had the same kinds of concerns we did.\"Caneris sent a memo dated April 22 to several University adm inistrators explaining the new court drop policy. Student organizations were not officially notified of the new policy. Undergraduate student gov\u00ad ernm ent President-elect Ed Gillison said, \"(USGA officers] have to create a voice, a link between us and the administra\u00ad tors so things like this could be announced by us to the stu \u00ad dents.\" \"It is an important tradition [and] should be kept u p ,\" Gillison said. \"Almost every stu\u00addent organization has used a banner at one point or another.\" Gillison saijd he wants to explore the possibility of con\u00ad structing the court drops out of nonflammable materials. \"We're an engineering school,\" said Gillison, who is an electrical and com puter engineering p re \u00ad junior. \"We are taught to find solu\u00ad tions. We should looking into alternatives,\" said Gillison, who will hold his first m eeting as USGA president at the start of the summer term on June 23. Senior Associate Vice Pres\u00adident and Dean of Students Dianna Dale said she would like to pursue other locations on cam pus for the court drops, where they would not pose such a fire risk. Before finalizing the decision to ban the court drops from the Great Court, Caneris consulted with U niversity President C onstantine Papadakis. \"We talked about the tradition, and it is a tradition, ... but our biggest w orry was should som ething inadvertently happen, then a lot of people are going to hold us [accountable].\" E SG to be disbanded, replaced by outside vendors ESG outsourcing from page / from the University, The University used the deep discounts it garnered from Apple to fund the Equipment Support Group, \"If you lose 25 percent of your market, you have a business operation that really isn't viable over the long run,\" Bielec said. Equipm ent Support Group Manager Dan Miele said that in past years nearly 100 percent of students bought Apples from ESG. Bachich said, \"We got a good price from Apple, but it is not as good as it used to be, ,., Our prices were becoming less and less attractive. Generally, the cat\u00ad alogs could provide Apple or W indows units for about the same price.\" ESG was also at a disadvan\u00ad tage price-wise, because it had to charge sales tax on all purchases. Mail order catalogs can only charge sales tax to in-state orders, Bachich said the slipping Apple sales were a trend, not a\"one-time reduction.\" Sales To replace ESG, the Univer\u00ad sity has set up an agreement with Apple Cam pus Direct and MicroWarehouse, a catalog ven\u00ad dor. U nder the agreem ents, Drexel students, faculty and staff will receive discounts on hard\u00ad ware and software purchased at the vendors. Apple Campus Direct will handle all Macintosh orders and MicroWarehouse will handle all Windows platform orders. The discounts for the Windows 95 machines are for Compaq-brand computers only. Students who will be freshmen in the fall of 1997 have already been sent a letter with recom\u00ad mendations on which computer systems to purchase. The University has set up a toll-free num ber (1-800-981-9197) to direct com puter orders to the correct vendor, \"Rather than go to ESG to pick up your machine, now you call an 800 number, give yourinformation, order your machine and have it delivered to you at home,\" Bielec said. \"From a stu\u00ad dent perspective, it should be rel\u00ad atively the same interface whether they're buying Apple or Compaq.\" Miele said that among schools that require students have access to a computer, Drexel is proba\u00ad bly the first to have an arrange\u00ad ment without outside vendors. Students will still have the option of buying their computers elsewhere. \"You can buy a machine from anywhere you want to, but it [should] meet certain qualifica\u00ad tions,\" Bielec said. \"The differ\u00ad ence know what the Drexel recommenda\u00ad tions are.\" ' For software, the University is recommending that incoming freshmen purchase Microsoft Office, which is available for both platforms at a discounted price from the vendors. Service ESG's maintenance businesswill be handed over to The Computer Fixer, a Philadelphia- based service. The C om puter Fixer will set up an on-campus office in the basem ent of the Korman Center to handle main\u00ad tenance. \"It'll be similar to ESG, except that it' ll be a company that does this as [its] business, .,, Hopefully service will be better,\" Bielec said. Bielec said The C om puter Fixer was chosen because it has technicians who can handle both Apple and Compaq machines. The company also handles the University of Pennsylvania's computer maintenance. \"I think you'll find that most sjchools that try to provide in- house maihfeMhce have hot had a' lo f o f s aceis'siff 0 lo n f- run,\" Bielec said. \"Equipment is constantly changing. ... You end up having training problems.\" The C om puter Fixer will accept manufacturer warranties on the equipm ent it services. Though students have never been required to purchaseextended w arranties, OCS is more strongly urging all buyers to pay for an extended warranty plan. The future ESG has been slowing down its operations over the past six months. Employees who left ESG were not replaced and its staff is now lim ited to two Drexel employees and several tem po\u00ad rary em ployees. The Drexel employees, including Miele, have been offered positions within other areas of OCS, Bachich said that Drexel has not yet decided what to do with ESG's space at 32nd and Race Streets, The building contains mostly warehouse storage space, Bachich-said that complex reno- .vatian-of the bttHdtng would be needed to make it usable as office or classroom space, \"Not only did we try to figure out how to do business more efficiently, make it more customer-oriented for the students, but also the reality that business processes have to change with time,\" Bielec said. Parents of Skowronek push for meningitis awareness Meningitis awareness from page 1 disease, because many there are so many students living near each other. With only those facts in mind, Skowronek started writing letters and gathering information about the disease. \"It took a couple months. It didn't happen right away. We had to get over the shock of course,\" he said in an interview at his Collingswood, New Jersey home. What Skowronek discovered was that vaccines exist for some forms of meningitis. The vac\u00ad cines' effects typically last for three to five years. He also found out that the military vaccinates most of its personnel to prevent outbreaks of the disease, because troops are often housed together in large numbers. Skowronek then asked the question he thought was obvi\u00ad ous; Why not just vaccinate all college students? The Centers Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Skowronek, who works for New Jersey's Department of Human Services, that its studies have determined that vaccinating all college students is not a cost- effective strategy to fighting the disease. The CDC says a one\u00adtime vaccine that covers all forms of meningitis is about five years away. That vaccine might be cost effective enough for the CDC to vaccinate the general public. \"What they're trying to do is come up with a Cadillac of vac\u00ad cines that' treats all types of meningitis for a long period of time,\" Skowronek said. He said, however, that the coverage pro\u00ad vided by today's vaccines would probably at least cover the years. people spend in college \u2014 the time they are most susceptible to the bacteria. The CDC reports indicate that doing so would be an inefficient way of controlling the rare dis\u00ad ease. Skowronek said that the CDC estimates that the vaccine costs about $30 to administer to each patient. \"What [the CDC is] say\u00ad ing is that giving all these doses to m illions of teenagers and young adults that will only have an effect on about 3,000 people is, in essence, .,, not worth the effort,\" Skowronek said, \"If it's your child, [you] certainly have a different attitude.\" Skowronek then contacted legislators. He hoped to convince them to sponsor legislation requiring students to get vacci\u00ad nated before attending college.\"One thing I found out is that with a New Jersey address, if you write somebody in another state, they don't answer you,\" Skow\u00ad ronek said. He explained that he's made limited progress, especially with the New Jersey state legislature. His request to the New Jersey body was forwarded to the state's Office of Legislative Services. \"They analyze it and see if there is room for some kind of legisla\u00ad tion,\" Skowronek said. He said the group might decide whether getting the vaccine should be required for high school gradua\u00ad tion or to get into a college in the state. \"That's really the way we're pushing \u2014 toward use of the vaccine,\" Skowronek said, Skowronek said that in addi\u00ad tion to those efforts, he and his wife Linda are trying to increase awareness of the disease by post\u00ad ing informational signs at area colleges. The couple also has two other teenage sons. The memorial scholarship Skowronek and his wife, in coordination with the Princeton Area Community Foundation, awarded the first annual Michael Skowronek Memorial Scholar\u00ad ship to Collingswood HighSchool senior Christine Kline. Carl Skowronek said the $2,000 scholarship will serve as a reminder of Michael's passions. Skowronek said, \"We're look\u00ad ing for someone, like Michael, who was active in student gov\u00ad ernment and had school spirit and who would stay after school to do extra activities. One of his passions was com puters, but that's ... a secondary thing. If the person likes com puters th at's good too.\" Kline plans to attend Camden \"County Comniunity College. The family has also given money to Drexel. The University is currently accepting donations to raise money for renovation of the Main Building Auditorium. The Skowroneks donated money to have Michael's name inscribed on a plaque that will be placed on one of the new chairs in the audi\u00ad torium. Education In the eyes of the public, the dangerous nature meningitis is often not understood, Linda Skowronek has been a nurse for more than 20 years and she's never seen a case, \"That's what we're saying,\" Carl Skowronek said. \"They should have some kind of orien\u00adtation, probably in high school and in college, especially if you're going to live in the dorms. Just to know the symptoms and educate people, ... A lot of times when they get a college student in [the hospital], they're already in a coma. They' ve been in bed in the dormitory for a day or two and their room m ate thought they had the flu.\" \"I don't even think the general public knows that vaccines are available,\" Skow ronek said. \"They don't even know you can call your physician and get it.\" The Skowroneks keep in con\u00ad tact with several families in the area who have lost children to meningitis. The family was also referred to the N ational M eningitis Foundation in Columbia, Maryland. When he called the NMF, Skowronek found out that the person who started the foundation \"v/as a parent who had lost a daughter six years ago and had started a similar operation to ours.\" Skowronek says he isn't ready to stop the fight to educate or cease writing politicians, \"The woman in Maryland is burned out already and I understand that, I sort of feel burned out after six months, but I'll keep going,\" he said.

N ational T he Triangle June 6,1997 Icy miniplanet found in solar system's ferthest reaches MattCrenson ASSOCIATED PRESS NEW YORK \u2014 Astronomers have found an icy m iniplanet that orbits the sun well beyond Pluto, providing evidence that the solar system extends much farther than was once thought. The little planet is about 300 miles across, which gives it a sur\u00ad face area comparable to Texas. It is the brightest solar system object to be found beyond Neptune since the discovery of Pluto's moon Charon in 1978. At its most distant, it wanders three times farther from the sun than Pluto, tracing a looping, oblong path into an astronomi\u00ad cal terra incognita. \"It's the first object in a sort of no man' s land, an area we never thought we could get a glimpse of with our current technology,\" said Jane Luu, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.And it's probably not alone. Theoretical calculations suggest that there are millions of small, icy solar system objects well beyond the outermost planets. Astronomers consider their new discovery an extension of the Kuiper belt, a collection of small, icy bodies that circle the sun beyond the orbit of Neptune. About 40 Kuiper belt objects have been discovered since 1992. Before then, the only known K uiper belt objects were the planet Pluto, discovered in 1930, and Charon. Luu discovered the new object, known as 1996TL66, with colleagues from Harvard, the U niversity of Hawaii and the University of Arizona, as well as an amateur astronomer based in Cloudcroft, N.M. They describe the find in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. \"I wouldn't call this a major planet,\" said Brian Marsden, aHarvard astronomer and con- tributer to the Nature paper. \"But then I tend not to call Pluto a major planet.\" In fact, 1996TL66 is consid\u00ad ered too minor to be named for a Roman god, like the other plan\u00ad ets. Astronomers surmise that it is composed of the same material as other outer solar system objects \u2014 water, carbon dioxide, methane and other materials \u2014 all frozen solid. The astronom ers found 1996TL66 with a University of Hawaii telescope as the object passed among the outer planets last October. They and others followed it for several months with tele\u00ad scopes in Hawaii, Arizona and New Mexico. The object's motion over the last few months shows that it fol\u00ad lows a lopsided orbit unlike that of any other Kuiper belt object. It swings through the neighbor\u00adhood of the outermost planets every 800 years, then loops far out into space before making its next pass. Astronomers have never seen such a thing. \"It just rem inds us that we really don't know what the outer solar system holds,\" Luu said. Some researchers had an inkling that the object would be out there, however. Hal Levison, a scientist at the Southw est Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., has been telling his col\u00ad leagues for the past year that objects such as 1996TL66 ought to exist. The research behind that pre\u00ad diction, conducted with Martin Duncan of Queen's University in Canada, is scheduled for publica\u00ad tion in a future issue of the jour\u00ad nal Science. \"Though we knew that we had an interesting scientific result, it just never occurred to me that anybody would find o n e,\"Levison said. \"It's very satisfying when someone confirms your theciries.\" In his Science paper, Levison describes how U ranus and Neptune probably generated the Kuiper Belt during the formation of the solar system more than 4 billion years ago. According to that theory, Neptune kicked a small percentage of the Kuiper belt objects into oblong orbits such as the one followed by 1996TL66. Luu apd her colleagues found the object at the very beginning of a systematic search for objects at the edge of the solar system. Because it was so easy to find, the researchers calculate that there are hundreds, and perhaps more than 1,000, objects sim ilar to 1996TL66. \"Unless we are im probably lucky, it is merely the first detect\u00ad ed of a larger population of simi\u00ad lar b odies,\" the astronom ers wrote. *^Everyone*s talking about MiaY* 1 ^ \\ A g r o d o u s P h ilo d e lp h iQ lo n d m o r k ... 1 1 J C r itic a lly o c d o im e d M e d ite fra n e a n c m m m onD w int m ip m illfW flD W IC K tlO IE lI c u is in e ...A n e x te n s iv e s e le c tio n o f w in e s b y th e g lo s s .

Hoping to push the industry to act on its own, the Senate Commerce Com m ittee chair-- man, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., intends to move ahead with a new bill that would force stronger TV program ratings. The bill, by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., would forbid the Federal Communications Commission to renew TV stations' licenses unless they provide detailed information about a program 's sexual and violent content. The bill does not recom m end any one particular ratings system. Last month, McCain's com \u00ad mittee voted 19-1 to send to the Senate a bill that would either require stronger ratings or ban violent shows when children are likely to be watching. Now McCain is planning for the committee to vote on Coats' bill June 18 \u2014 two days before the FCC holds its first hearing on the effectiveness of the TV indus\u00ad try's rating system, which took effect Jan. 1. - McCain was meeting with net\u00ad work and cable representatives W ednesday to underscore his seriousness about industry action. No agreement between the TV industry and critics, how\u00ad ever, was expected at that meet\u00ad ing. Critics, including lawmakers, child-advocacy groups, the N ational Parent T eacher A ssociation and the m edical community, say the existing six\u00ad tier, age-based ratings system d oesn't provide parents with enough information to protect their children from excessive vio\u00adlence, sex and language. They want more-detailed rat\u00ad ings that would give specific information about the amount and intensity of such content in each program. To address those concerns and short-circuit legislation. Fox, ABC and some cable networks are leading an effort to persuade other members of the TV indus\u00ad try to support adding \"V,\" \"S\" and \"L\" to existing ratings to note violence, sex and language that could be considered offen\u00ad sive. NBC is opposed and CBS is uncommitted. Existing ratings use designa\u00ad tions from \"TV-G,\" programs suitable for all ages, to \"TV- MA,\" for mature audiences only. M ost shows have been rated \"TV-PG,\" parental supervision suggested. Two ratings categories are devoted to children's programs: \"TV-Y,\" denoting program s suitable for all children, and \"TV-Y7,\" designating those suit\u00ad able for children 7 and older. Each of the six ratings cate\u00ad gories provides a general description about sexual, violent and language content that may be contained in a program . Critics want the industry to make these content descriptions more detailed. Critics now want \"V,\" \"S\" and \"L\" designations for programs rated \"TV-Y7.\" They have been pushing for the designations to be added to \"TV-PG,\" \"T V -14,\" programs unsuitable for children under 14, and \"TV-MA.\" \"Right now 'Y7' includes everything from 'Saved by the Bell,\" to 'Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\"' said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education. Com e to C elebrate Your Success ' 'at'-Sears strikes deal with F T C Kevin Galvin ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON \u2014 The Fed\u00ad eral Trade Commission struck a deal W ednesday with Sears, Roebuck & Co., ensuring that the com pany will refund at least $100 million to customers who were pressured to pay off Sears credit card debts even though they were protected by bank\u00ad ruptcy laws. \"Since 1985, Sears has under\u00ad mined some very important con\u00ad sumer protections embedded in the Am erican bankruptcy process,\" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau. \"Sears induced consumers to pay debts they did not legally owe.\" News of the FTC's decision to accept the proposed consent decree for public comment came one day before the nation's sec\u00adond-largest retailer was expected to outline a deal with 39 state attorneys general to settle similar charges filed in federal bankrupt\u00ad cy court in Boston. A Sears spokeswoman said the company would have no com\u00ad ment until after Thursday's court filing. Sears said in a court brief Tuesday it has reached no settle\u00ad m ent with the Justice Department. ' Wednesday's consent decree preserved the FTC' s right to take Sears to court in the event its refunds under the class-action settlem ent to be subm itted Thursday total less than $100 million. The FTC's Bernstein said the consent decree was designed to ensure that Sears returned \"all of the financial gain it realized through these illegal collection efforts.\"Sears said Tuesday the class- action suit is likely to affect cus\u00ad tomers in all 50 states. The FTC said W ednesday's settlem ent \"requires Sears to completely redress debtors, with interest, for payments wrongfully obtained.\" The retailer's actions affected more than 200,000 customers, the FTC said. Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, has been trying for months to put the flap behind it after admitting its executives \"exercised flawed legal judgment\" in handling the debt collections. Sears holds a secured interest in purchases made with its card, giving the company the right to reclaim purchased items when the buyer defaults on the credit card debt or tries to wipe it out by filing for bankruptcy.

She has been editor-in-chief for the past year. No other editor has served longer in the top two positions on the staff. Jon becam e editor of the comics section his sophomore year, and took over as editorial and opinion editor soon after. He held that position for the next two years, before moving up to the position of managing editor last year. Larry and Nick also became section editors during their sophomore years, in the sports and en tertain m en t sections, respectively. Larry served as sports editor for three years, interspersed by periods as layout editor and production manager. Noah has served as photo edi\u00ad tor for three years, and Brad has been editing the entertainment section for two. All told, mem\u00ad bers of the class of 1997 have held a majority of the editorial positions at the paper for three years. \"In some ways it feels like a statistical aberration,\" Jon said, \"that in a school of thousands there are a limited num ber of people who can make a differ\u00ad ence at this paper, and that so large a percentage of those peo\u00ad ple are m em bers o f this one class.\" \"I was lucky to come at a time when there were so many people who were interested in working ^for th e papex,~an^d w ho cared about it so much,\" Noah said. \"I think it's a shame that we're all graduating at the same time.\" I struggle to come up with the words to adequately convey the accomplishments of this class. Luckily for me, I don't have to. You, the reader, are holding it in your hands. \"There's no doubt in my mind ... we're putting out the best Triangles I've ever seen,\" Jon said. \"When I got here,\" Patty said, \"the paper was made by ... fol\u00ad lowing a form ula \u2014 they thought what they were doing was right because they^were doing what the people before told t^^m. to leafn on o u ^ Q ^ Wh\u00ab^D&rnalisiliJs, and fb ii6 w ts d ^ % \" What Slight liot^be apparini however, is the dedication need\u00ad ed to produce these issues every week of every term. \"I used to think people were crazy for spending so much time at The T riangle,\" Jon said. \"When I first joined, I used to tell my friends that I' d never become one of what I called the 'Triangle geeks,' who spent 40 or 50 hours a week sitting in the office work\u00ad ing on the newspaper. But that's probably what the younger staff members say about me today.\" Unlike newspapers at colleges with regular semester cycles and long summer breaks, The Triangle publishes year-round. \"Putting out the paper during co-op is terrible,\" Patty said. \"You have to work for 40 hours a week doing trivial jobs at trivial places. Then you come home, go to the Triangle office, and make a newspaper. There' s no time left for sleep. By the end of the week, I' d be dizzy.\" Yet despite the hardships ofworking the equivalent of 80- hour weeks while on co-op, the year-round nature of the Drexel calendar has its advantages. \"M ost of our editors stay while on co-op, so there isn't an awkward transition when co-op starts,\" Patty said. \"Knowledge isn't lost. Papers at other schools, like The Daily Pennsylvanian, don't have that advantage. Their papers take a dive every sum- mer. \"If we all went home for the. summer and came back ihaJie fall and tried to put out a paper as good as the previous ^rtngfit. just wouldn't be possible^' Jon said. \"We'd lose a lot of momen\u00ad tum.\" The lone returning editor on the staff, news editor Anh Dang, will replace Patty as editor-in- chief, starting with the first issue of summer term. Dang, who will be a senior in the upcoming year, was elected unanimously by the staff. The editor-in-chief is the only elected position at The Triangle; all other, positions are appointed by the editior-in-chief. The first item on his agenda is , to begin filling the vacant posi\u00ad tions. \"I' ve already found people to fill some of the positions,\" Anh said. The current editors expressed confidence in Anh'sabilities, but none were envious of his position. \"Since I've been here,\" Patty said, \"Anh has had the longest- running and most consistent involvement in news. He'll be able to use that to his advantage, both in helping new writers, and in keeping the news section at thehigh level it is now.\" - v * \"If Anh can put out a news section near the quality that we do now, and can continue to cover the events we do now, the^ i paper might slip a little, but-it will still have its place at this uni\u00ad versity,\" Jon said. j f \"I think it's going to be lough for Anh,\" Noah said. \"I feel sorry for him because h e's tHe one [experienced] person who's left.\" \"Anh knows a bit about every section, and th a t's the key,\" Larry said. \"The editor-in-chief must know how every section goes \u2014 how else can you rule over the entire paper? \"Our success speaks well of the previous editors, who made sure we were w ell-prepared. W e're .all good editors. I hope Anh can keep it going.' * ' -Like some previbCis Triamgle graduates, however, Patty and Jon don't plan on leaving Anh high and dry. Both plan on help\u00ad ing him to some degree during the next term.\"Everything I' ve learned at the Triangle I've learned from Patty,\" Anh said. \"She's been a big help. She's had a big influ\u00ad ence on my life. And Jon, too. For the last two terms he's almost been the news editor, while I've learned the other aspects of the paper, like production and advertising.\" The last time this many edi\u00ad tors graduated at one time was in 1991. Theigraduating editor-in- chief was Gary Rosenzweig, Larry's brother. Then-sopho- more Andrew Ross became edi\u00ad tor-in-chief that summer, taking over a paper with only one other returning editor. \"Anh has a lot more experience than I d id ,\" Andrew said. \"After five issi/es, I was burned out. \"But you'd be surprised who'll come forward.,People who you never thought in a million years could do it, will step up to be good [section] editors,\" Andrew said. \"Stress can bring out the best in people. Sometimes.'' . Thursday is production night at The Triangle. The paper goes to press early on Friday m orn\u00ad ings, which means while the rest of the world is home watching the Friends and Seinfeld, Triangle editors are working. And longafter the rest of the campus has gone to bed, they're still working. Although that \"work\" encom\u00ad passes more than writing, editing and layout. \"The atmosphere in the office is what I'll rem em ber m ost,\" Larry said. \"How crazy we were, taking a BB gun and shooting up the hallway, stuff like that.\" For the record, this w riter hais absolutely no recollection of this alleged \"BB gun\" \"H aving a T hursday nighjt where I won't have anything to do, I'm going to be lost,\" Jon said. \"I'm probably going to sit in my apartment for hours just looking at the wall. Just as weird will be Friday morning, waking up with a full night's rest. \"It's a combination of the atti\u00ad tude, the atmosphere, and the product. Those three things together really define what I love about The Triangle.\" Never are those things in greater abundance than on \"Triangle Thursdays.\" \"For four years, my life has revolved around Triangle Thursdays,\" Patty said. \"Know\u00ad ing that every Thursday night, we were going to publish a news\u00ad paper. \"I don't think there will ever be a Thursday when I don't think about The Triangle.\" 387-1213 387-1260 P i z z a o f t h e m o n t h : P ' ''4'' % P iz z a J u n e S p e c i a l sS m a li W a s $ ^ Now $3ifiO ' O n e|$1 Off!

Darlington, you might remendier, was the victim of the infanutus \"Hot Dog's Hot D og\" incident, in which a series of ctmipromising photogi'aphs featuring Darlington and his pet dachshund Hans were publishe<l in m y Triangle column. Later, the photos were revealed to be a cruel hoax, but the danmge to Darlington's once-stellar reputation w as already done. A t the Orange Brick Awards, Darlington w as generally ignored, and afterward he received a cruel beating at the hands of a few over-zealous boys frtm i the Inter-Fraternity Association.

Well, as I'm finding out more and more, the beginning is nothing compared with tackling the end. For five years, I've w ritten about a lot of things in the pages of this newspaper. News, sports, music and movies \u2014 I' ve covered them all. And well, too, for the most part. But it was tough to get going. Like most of the staffers at The Triangle, the toughest part of being aslept too little, and skipped class because it might have rained that day. And in hindsight, I wouldn't have had it any other way. W hat I've accomplished at Drexel I wouldn't trade for anything. You can't possibly tell me that four years spent at some suburban, candy-assed day care center that somehow passes for a university could even compare with my Drexel experience. No chance. I've seen more, done more, felt more \u2014 lived more \u2014 on this tiny tract of urban landscape than I ever would have out on the Main Line. I have no doubt about that. Drexel has prepared me well for the future I'm im A \u00ab9r\u00bbp- - .r, . t .. .................... But this isn't some sort of recruiting pitch. Hie and ethics than I ever would have as a lab tech on Triangle is not for everybody. Lately, it's not been co-op. I got myself involved. I booked concerts for CAB and served over two years on the editorial board right here at The Triangle. There's real-world stuff happening on campus all the time, and you don't have to look far. I had a blast here, and I hate to go. But I know it's time. I could spend hours remembering the stuff I did \u2014 the basketball road trips, the concerts and n, I tell .myself, but I sliY j ajva^' M|id^}^t tijips tp th^,^rt jf^use^Xn. tapes ^ndfor me, through no fault of its own. Over the past year I've decreased my involvement in most of my activities. Not just coincidentally, Vve also picked up more hours at my job and have spent more time with my girlfriend, my friends and my family. I've been career hunting, apartment hunting, and occa\u00ad sionally you can find me hunting golf balls out of the rough. I'm iri'transition fronf| wiiat' ' But I'd rather think about what iies ahead, the world ' I came to this school as a teenager from N e^ Jersey five years ago, for two simplie reasons: co-op and financial aid. I chose Drexel over Rutgers School of Engineering and Georgia Tech because this school had the right classes at'the least burden to my family. It's not like I hate this place, but whenbeyond 32nd and , Chestnut Streets, the world of work and responsfcility that I only barely have a handle on. That's where the action is. That's whe^e the promise lies. i .. I leave here a Drexel Dragon. When vvejvyi^j I'll;, jump and shout. When we lose. I'll, bked bl|4?f and^ gold. I owe a lot to this school, this paper, t^iese people, and you readers.

I also came across something buried deep in my belongings that predated the Drexel era by some seven years or more. Upon seeing it I was reminded that despite how much has chsmged in my life, some things always remain the same, I held in my hands a collection of Garbage Pail Kids, that grotesque collection of mutated offspring that only pre- pubescent boys could find humor in. Or so you would hope. But as I paged through the two-inch stack of cards I couldn't help but smile. The still-familiar names and images of bulging eyes, oozing puss and an overabun\u00ad dance of limbs amuses me just as much as it did oh so many years ago. Mom would probably sigh in disgust. Try as I might, I just can't see growing up as anything but giving in. I look around at the same friends who chucked stale DUFS bagels at each other five years agoand they're different. It's a subtle change to be sure, but it's different all the same. The same people I walked into classes, with 20 minutes late for a midterm now have plans; plans that extend over the course of a year or more. How could this happen? W hat's so great about being a grown-up anyway? Take a look around you. Look at what your parents do. Watch people work all day. I know people who go to sleep at nine o'clock each night because they have to get up so god-awful early in the morning. All I can think is: I'm supposed to look forward to this? It's not that I'm lazy or hate work, but it's never going to be that impor\u00ad tant to me. I will never let my life cen\u00ad ter around work. I'll work hard, but when it's time to go, it's assholes and elbows out the door. I need balance and it's not to be found in an office at 7:30 at night.As if these looming work-weeks weren't enough to crush my lingering youth, some of my friends have begun to utter a word that backhands my inner-child^p hard my head spins. My friends are talking about marriage. Nothing can shock me right to the core more than friends thinking about getting hitched. They're smart enough to know better \u2014 at least they ought to be. My friends are great people and I wish them best of luck. But when it all goes to hell I'll hate being the jackass who says 'I told you so.' It's certainly possible that I'm overreacting to all of this. Maybe I'm just holding on to an ideal whose time passed on long ago. But I have to do what I feel is fight. Happiness for me right now doesn't lie inside a cubicle or a marriage. I do not need them to be content. And if it's the wrong thing to do then I'll accept the consequences with pride. But until that time you can leave me \u2014 Drew Blood, Bruised Lee and the rest of them \u2014 the hell out of this grown-up business.

Chris Puzak: D i s t o r t i n g t h e M e d i u m Reliving every single minute of Spring Jam Spring Jam was dead on arrival this year. The cry goes out: \"W ho will dissect the corpse of this monstrosi\u00ad ty?\" Fear not Drexel students, I, Chris Puzak, have answered the call. I skipped the Cheech and Chong movie, because I had more interesting things to do, like laundry. I also hate Cheech and Chong, so that was a big part .of it. So,; my Spring jiam Weekend Was dfftci i SlbW start,' but I managed to get my room cleaned up a little bit, so I was feeling pretty good. I wasn't quite \"back in the day\" yet, but I was definitely back at some point in the early morning of the day after. Friday arrived. Even in my office at my co-op job, I could feel the intense burning desire for the Drexel block party that was sweeping across canipus. I turned the air conditioher up higher, ian < i I didn't feel it anymore, so maybe it was just hot in the room. Still, I wias excite^ Apparently three dozen other people were excited too, because that's about how many people who showed up. The block party didn't exactly offer much to do, so I'm not sure why people even stayed. CAB could have imported hookers and heroin fpr the block party, and they still wouldn't have livened things up much. For those of you who missed out, the \"block party\" consisted of some carnival games, a spin art booth, and two inflatable things that looked like the physical chal\u00ad lenge stuff from Double Dare. I went on the giant inflatable sliding board, but just like the rest of the block party, it was bor\u00ad ing. The high point of the evening for me was being able to talk to my friends from Calhoun Five, the floor I lived on last year.I don't know about you, but I get nostalgic when I think back to freshman year. The vomit encrusted floors and elevators. The people playing rap music at 3:00 in the m orning. People smoking pot like it's going out of style. People transferring into majors with almost no work \u2014 so college won't impinge too much on their alco\u00ad holism. M those hiappy memories bring a - ' tear \" to my eye. Anyway, when I need to know how things are going on the floor these days (people are carving things into doors and stealing sinks) or how much it costs to be the soap handler for the girl-girl shower show at the Fantasy Showbar (16 bucks), I can count on the good people of C alhoun Five to keep me inform ed. Thanks guys. Anyway, the night wore on, and once they played \"We're Not Gonna Take Jt,\" it kind of went downhill, especially when they played \"Beat It.\" I spent the last hour of the evening sitting on a bench with about four people from Calhoun Five drinking bottled water and complaining about the student activity fee. Fool that I am, I still went to the festivi\u00ad ties on Saturday. W hat can I say, I'm a masochist. M ore people showed up, but it still d id n 't make up for the fact that there wasn't much to do besides sit around. Well, CAB did have a couple of different rides this time around, but how many peo\u00ad ple really want to spin around in a giant gyroscope? I went on it, and I can tell you, you're not missing mudi. Live music was presented before the headliners showed up, and it seemed to be of two varieties. It was either bad imita\u00ad tions of Nirvana or bands that soundedlike Rage Against The Machine, shouting about injustice and hatred while using the same riff in every song. Maybe I would have enjoyed the music a little bit more if I didn't have a horrible stomach ache from eating the food. I don't know if Marriott was involved in the food preparation, but if they weren't. ijL^eni.s that theii- incompetence has rubbed off bn others. There are certain things you have to do to a hamburger before serving it, like cooking it first, and these people didn't even manage to pull that off. Of course, Drexel students are used to dealing with inedible food, since they reg\u00ad ularly eat at the Dragons Den, so that didn't stop lots of people from eating. Apparently, someone decided that we couldn't exactly go back in the day if the garbage cans were emptied, so they decid\u00ad ed to just let tl;ie garbage pile'up. Drexd students, never ones to be thwarted by unfortunate circumstances, came up with the ingenious plan of just throw ing garbage on the ground. Evening arrived, and some drunk frat guy (Oh, excuse me. There I go being politically incorrect and using unfair stereotypes again. I mean drunk frat American.) started blowing a hand-held horn every few minutes. His parents prob\u00ad ably hate him and he was just crying out for attention. Anyway, G. I^ve show ^ up about this time. They kept insisting they were playing different songs, but as far as I could teU they were just playing one really long song and saying \"OK, we got another song for you\" every once in while. G. Love's finile consisted of a really long har\u00ad monica solo, apparently to make up for the fact that he had left his washbasin andFisher Price \"My First Piano\" at home. As G-Love left the stage, a hush fell over the crowd. Fresh off a nationwide tour of state fairs and grade schools, Run-DMC would soon be making their appearance. Sure enough, Run-DMC hit the stage with their first song \"Lots of mumbling with a big thumping noise^\" Then, one of them had to go to the bathroom, so the show was delayed for a little bit. But soon enough, Jam Master Jay was on the stage doing a song from his solo album \"Doesn't anyone like Adidas anymore?\" entitled \"One, one, two, testing, one, one, testing.\" Just as it appeared Oiere was about to be a riot, Run-DMC appeared again, pumped and ready to rock the old school. They told everyone to say \"Ho!\" Everyone did. They told everyone to say \"Yeah!\" Everyone did. Apparently, this was a new experience for everybody, because a lot of people seemed really excited. I must admit, I was less impressed with Run-DM C than other people. One of them, either Run or DMC, seemed to be confused in trying to determine whether we were all \"in the house\" or \"at the place to be,\" because he used both phrases inter\u00ad changeably to refer to Drexel. I hope my midlife crisis is that easy. I stayed for a couple of songs, but I soon left. I was tired of trying to recapture the magic of a decade I never really cared for much to begin with. Besides, when Run-DM C waved their hands in the air, it was like they just didn't care. So I didn't either. Chris P iu k is a sophomore rnajoring in inform a\u00ad tion systems.

Craftily, I avoided the vendors and exploited the free oases of liquid refreshment. Not that they were of much aid. A bank of six water fountains provided five devices which drooled warmly and one which ejaculated hot bathwater. The bathroom sinks flowed endlessly with warm rivers of diluted chlorine. A few unlucky people attem pted to fill their cups, recently emptied of three dollars w orth of water, at one of the fountains. T heir friend, the guard, informed them that this was not allowed. Free refills have no place in the midst of exploitative capitalists' beverage dreamland. One attendee mentioned to the lead singer of that dog that her camera had been confiscated. Of course. I would expect noth\u00ad ing less. All in the name of con\u00ad tractual obligations, copyright law and the love of pushing around kids. Free refills have no place In the midst of exploitative capitalists' beverage dreamland. Upon leaving the show, the guards were preventing some people from taking the confiscat\u00ad ed food and blankets, claiming the loot was in fact property of the guards. Of the two bodies responsible for this event, Y-lOO and the E- Center, I imagine the E-Center was responsible for the restric\u00ad tions. Still, given that Y-lOO was the sole reason the 20,000-plus fans shelled out bucks for the show, I wish the radio folks would have taken a stand in the name of their fans. They-must have had clout, as does anyone who can sell out an outdoor theater. W ith this clout they could have fought the limitation on blankets and water. Blankets and water. The stuff of Red Cross relief efforts and television child birth when there's no time to make it to the hospital. How basic and cheap can something be, those blankets and w ater, yet they still garnered rejection from those who must leech money above and beyond the amount of a sold-out event.

Hey, I love dinosaurs!' Cold-blooded rampage from page 20 read the book, the movie is noth\u00ad ing like the book. In The Lost World, Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) has become the laughing stock of his peers for making up stories about the exis\u00ad tence of dinosaurs. The story begins With Malcolm going ta H am m ond's (Richard A tten\u00ad borough) house, where he is told that there is another island with dinosaurs j Hammc fo'rsplW fieri Y oy're L\u00ae o ra ry /F e rffia n e n t Em Cali TODAYS T em porary^ ex ment the I in the wild Dr. Ian island of dea his currer^|^[^yp^h< H ardingi re there, infeftt bh dinosaur observation without interference.

There is the m om ent when the t-rex mom and pop make a meal out of one guy by tearing him in half. Most people probably didn't like The Lost World as much as Jurassic Park because the movie starts out boringly. There was no real curiosity buildup. We hear a lot about Malcolm's perlsonal life.

Buckley TRUCKER As my career as an undergrad\u00ad uate comes to a close, 1 can't help looking back to see what the last five years have really meant to me. I'm not looking to relive the good ol' days of people throwing sour milk at a truck full of Teamsters. All I really need is some sense of closure. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find it, so I made some of my own. Five years ago, I was obsessed. I was pining away for the new Lard album. I had heard rumors about it, but nothing was con\u00ad crete. I heard it was due to come out in the spring, but then Jeff Ward died, and my hopes were shattered. However, in 1993, on the way to Ocean City, N.J. with my best pal Omar I heard the word of God. A new Lard album was to be out that summer. It came out two weeks ago. Closure. Five years ago, I was recover\u00ad ing from high school. I spent years performing in musicals, and in every one the director would cut the songs that I had to sing. 1 was on stage with people who were \"serious\" about the theater and sought to make a career of it. Apparently, that wasn't me. As fate would have it, I found my way into a theatrical project of my own. 1 often think of having one chance to say to those peo\u00ad ple, \"W ho's getting paid for singing now?\" Of course, 1 never actually made a dime from my band, but that was only because all our money went to pizza. Closure.Five years ago, 1 was on a mis\u00ad sion. After twelve years of Catholic education, I finally had the opportunity to grow my hair just like Bret \"The H itm an\" Hart's \u2014 long and greasy. While the idea had lost a little luster from the time I was thirteen, I was determined. It took all the patience I could muster, and all the time I could spare, but I did it. Of course, I then had to go and shave my head, thus turning out looking just like The Hitman's biggest enemy, Stone Cold Steve Austin. I guess it's just funny how things change. Regardless, closure. Five years ago, The Incredible Hulk was smart. All of the con\u00ad flicting personalities in his head were acting as one. He was whole. I felt kinda the same way myself. Now, however, the jade giant is an empty vessel, a shad\u00ad ow of what he once was, a living engine of destruction. I feel kinda the same way myself. Closure. Anyway, I know this helped me find what I was looking for a lot more than that piece of paper I'm getting next week. If you're having the same trouble yourself, just think about where you were when you started, and where you are now. But don't think about where you're going. That'll ruin everything.F ascism , C am d en s ty le 'Goosestep was the dance of choice at the modern rock version ofPoiand'38. Brad Wible LOST AND FOUND As a general rule, I don't com\u00ad plain about free things. It is with much guilt, then, that I admit I've got complaints galore about som ething for which I volunteered and which cost me not a cent. On Sunday, June 2, local radio station Y-lOO held its Summer Fez-tival at the Sony Blockbuster Entertainm ent Center on the \"bad\" side of the Delaware River in Camden, New Jersey. I attended simply because I had nothing better to do, it was a great day to be outside and, most importantly, I had access to two free tickets. So, with a \"why-the- hell-not?\" and a bag full of Blowpops, I found myself in a parking lot near the Ben Franklin Bridge, an apathetic pilgrimnearing the temporary Mecca of \"modern\" rock. Then the Nazi muscle flexed. As expected, the guards at the gate checked for drugs and alco\u00ad hol. Drugs, as we all know, are bad, and alcohol has no place inside the hallowed gates unless it is sold at inflated prices. Leave your notions of frugality at the gate, please. On such a hot, sunny day, I thought surely they'd allow us to bring in a little bit of nature's own coolant, deliciously tasteless water. Der Fuhrer von Camden (right) greets Adolf H itler (left), lead singer of Toad the Wet Sprocket.Wrong. Admittedly, the poor vendors of three-dollar water need as much support as anyone. Still, it just seems a little, for lack of a better word, greedy, to put over 20,000 people in the position of having to pay three dollars a bot\u00ad tle not for a tasty luxury item, but for necessary hydration. Charge all you want for an ice cream cone, I just won't eat it. But suck\u00ad ing cash for water leaves me the choice of emptying the pockets, or losing consciousness on a sun-baked hill. Having rooted out all traces of consumables, the guards then directed their attention to any other item intended to provide com fort to the lowly concert goer. What better way to ruin the entire notion of an outdoor festi\u00ad val than to disallow blankets. Beside each gate their grew large piles of confiscated blan\u00ad kets, thrown there with great joy by the men and women of the yellow -shirted ' confiscation brigade. Why allow blankets, I imagine some brainiac reasoned, when we can cram more people on the grass without them. Besides, who needs blankets when there are little green chairs to be rented for a modest fee? See Mein Camfden on page 1 9 Leapin' lizards ravage San Diego Boy, can that Spielberg make money! Ashish Talati SOFT SE R V E Universal's The Lost World, the sequel to 1993's box-office smash Jurassic Park, opened with a stunning $90.1 million week\u00ad end. The movie is expected to gross over $275 million domesti\u00ad cally. With this kind of success one would expect that the people who saw the movie liked it. But it seems everyone who saw it came out dissatisfied. According to many, the movie has no plot, only special effects. I completely disagree. The Lost World is a superb movie with a good plot. It's just that dinosaurs are no longer nov\u00ad elty. Everybody has seen them in Jurassic Park and as such, they now expect som ething more than dinosaurs. The movie doeshave some weak points, but overall it is a good movie. Screenwriter David Koepp did not do much to stir things up, but only so much can be done since he has to get the animalsand the people together some\u00ad how. The Lost World has spectac\u00ad ular special effects and sound. The action is excellent. Spielberg once again has done a superb directing job. The movie is defi\u00ad nitely worth seeing, at least once. For those of you who have See Cold-blooded rampage on page 1 9 Action scenes from The Lost l^or/d demonstrate cutting edge special effects.
