But with just a little bit of effort, you can feel as clever as Martha Stewart herself when all your cleaning and body care products smell great and are earth-friendly, too. Essential oils are practical and inexpensive but feel frivolous!

You can feel good about using essential oils. When properly used, they are safe for everyone, especially young kids and their developing immune systems. We hope you enjoy our beginner's guide! Ways to Use Essential Oils Essential oils are distilled from plants, shrubs, flowers, trees, roots and seeds. They come from every corner of the Earth. Chemists have identified over 70,000 different chemical compounds in essential oils, each having a therapeutic use. Here are just a few ways they can be used in your home: - Cooking: Add to drinks, meals, and desserts (Note: ONLY use essential oils meant for consumption. Attend our May event for specific tips on using essential oils for cooking.) - Personal body care: Mix with salts, soaps, or bath bombs, homemade toothpaste - Cleaning: Use for hand soaps, sanitizers, carpet deodorizers - Laundry: Add to laundry soaps or use with wool dryer balls - Insect repellant: Effective for pests like mosquitoes, ants, spiders, cockroaches - Medicinal care: Use on bug bites, skin rashes, toothaches and as a sleep aid - Aromatherapy: Select your favorites to circulate throughout the house with a diffuser or just for your personal enjoyment with a simple cotton ball. Essential oils can be energizing, calming, cleansing, relaxing . . . there's one to suit your mood!

How to Select Quality Essential Oils It's worth noting that the FDA only requires an oil to contain 10% essential oils to be labeled \"100% pure.\" Therefore, finding a reputable company is important. The best essential oils are sourced carefully and sustainably from around the world and are tested for purity and quality. Companies that take pride in their products will usually provide gas chromatography (GC) or mass spectroscopy (MS) test results. You can request copies of this testing to verify the quality of their oils, including a breakdown of their chemical properties, the geographic breakdown, harvest time of the year, even if their herbs were blooming at the time. Most quality companies will present you with the following information about their oils: - Common name (i.e. Thyme) - Scientific name (i.e. Thymus Vulgaris) - How is it extracted (i.e. steam distillation) - Some lower-quality companies may use chemicals to extract oils...which defeats our intention to find healthy alternatives to the chemicals found in conventional products! - Part of the plant used (i.e. flowering tops) - Depending on your intended therapeutic purpose for the oil, it may be important to be this specific. - Country of origin (i.e. France) - Lot number (generally corresponding with GC or MS test) - Quantity (amount in bottle) - Company contact information Probably the simplest and most important quality marker for the average consumer to recognize is the phrase, \"Therapeutic Grade!\" You want to buy therapeutic grade essential oils to ensure they contain the constituents (chemical compounds) that provide the therapeutic properties you seek. For example, a lower-quality lavender oil may help you sleep but may not effectively address skin conditions. Low-quality oils may not have the same therapeutic effects due to the difference in chemical constituents found only in pure, therapeutic grade oils.

How to store your essential oils: Store your essential oils in glass, amber-colored bottles that close tightly. Put them in a cool, dark location (refrigeration is ideal). Keep out of reach of children! Essential oils safety tips: Most essential oils need to be diluted for use on the skin. Some can be \"phototoxic\" which means they can cause a reaction if the skin is exposed to sunlight. Check labels, but generally oils that are known to cause photosensitivity are: angelica root, bergamot, cumin, melissa, and most citrus essential oils (grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange). Carrier oils: Essential oils are diluted with what we call \"carrier\" oils. Just like essential oils, opt for high-quality carrier oils that are unrefined and have been naturally extracted and cold-pressed. Common carrier oils are: almond or sweet almond, apricot kernel, cocoa butter, coconut, jojoba, kukui nut, olive and shea butter. Some of these oils have healing properties of their own! Skin-patch test: If you have any allergies or sensitive skin, perform a skin-patch test prior to using essential oils. - Apply 1-2 drops of essential oil to the forearm. - Observe for 1-2 hours. - Usually reactions occur within 5-10 minutes. - Avoid use of the oil if any redness, swelling, or blistering occurs. General essential oils safety: If a dangerous quantity of EO has been ingested, contact Poison Control immediately! (800-222-1222) Be prepared to provide the brand and type of oil. Poison Control is aware of different essential oil brands and can give better advice when you can provide the specific brand name. If you are unable to contact Poison Control, drink olive oil and induce vomiting. The olive oil will slow down the absorption and dilute the essential oil. Do not drink water as this can increase absorption. Never use water to flush an oil off the skin, as this may increase discomfort. If an essential oil gets in your eye, flush with a carrier oil to alleviate discomfort. If discomfort does not subside within five minutes, seek medical attention. General health warnings: If you are pregnant, lactating, suffering from epilepsy or high blood pressure, have cancer, liver damage or other medical conditions, use essential oils under the supervision of a medical doctor or qualified aromatherapist. If taking prescription medications, check for interactions between your medicine and the essential oils you want to use.

The 8 Best Essential Oils to Have on Hand It doesn't take long to gather your own essential oil collection for personal and [home use](https://mycipc.com/cleaning-with-essential-oils/). Here are some of the most popular oils and a few of their common uses. Lavender Essential Oil Benefits: Known for its ability to promote tissue regeneration, lavender is often used for burns.

It has long been highly regarded for digestion. It has also been studied for its supportive effect on the liver and respiratory systems, ability to improve concentration and mental sharpness, and its direct effects on the brain's satiety center, which triggers a sensation of fullness after meals. When using topically for children, remember to dilute your essential oil in at least a 50/50 mixture.
