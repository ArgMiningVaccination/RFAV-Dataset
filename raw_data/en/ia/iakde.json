Plasmid DNA vaccines and recombinant fowlpoxvirus (rFPV) vaccines are promising HIV-1 vaccine candidates, although either vaccine alone may be insufcient to protect againstHIV-1.AconsecutiveimmunisationstrategyinvolvingprimingwithDNAandboostingwithrFPVvaccinesencodingmultiplecommonHIV-1antigens was further evaluated in 30 macaques. The DNA vaccine vector included CpG immunostimulatory molecules, and rFPV vaccineswerecomparedwithrFPVvaccinesco-expressingthepro-TcellcytokinesIFN /H9253orIL-12.VaccinesexpressedmultipleHIV-1genes,mutated to remove active sites of the HIV proteins. The vaccines were well tolerated, and a signicant enhancement of DNA-vaccine primed HIV-1specicTlymphocyteresponseswasobservedfollowingrFPVboosting.Co-expressionofIFN /H9253orIL-12bytherFPVvaccinesdidnotfurther enhance immune responses. Non-sterilising protection from a non-pathogenic HIV-1 challenge was observed.

This approach has beenconrmedbyseveralresearchgroupsinprimates for recently in humans [11]. HIV-1-speciccellularimmunityalonecanonlylimitin- fection by blunting the acute and chronic infection, ratherthan prevent it altogether. This is a concern for HIV-1 vac-cines since (a) the virus integrates into the host genome andcan remain viably latent, and (b) high rates of viral muta-tionselectforvaccine-escapemutants.Long-termprotectionfromlentiviraldiseasemaybedifculttoachievewithpurelyTcell-basedvaccines [12,13].However,studiesduringacute lentiviral infection have suggested that the magnitude, phe-notype and breadth of the vaccine-induced T cell responsemay correlate with the control of the initial viremia [3,14]. Enhancingcellularimmunitybyimprovingvaccinesmayfur-ther limit the degree of late escape from immune control. DNA vaccines, on their own, have limited immuno- genicity in human clinical trials [15]. DNA vaccines may be improved by including multiple primate-specic CpGoligonucleotides [16]. CpG motifs enhance T cell immunity by binding to Toll-like receptor 9 [17]. Co-delivery of cytokines that promote T cell immunity together with DNAvaccines can improve their immunogenicity [3]. The co- expression of cytokines from viral vectors such as vacciniaand FPV can also dramatically modulate viral immunity[18,19]. The benets of encoding CpG motifs within the DNA vaccine, or co-expressing cytokines such as interferongamma(IFN /H9253)orinterleukin(IL)-12,tofurtherenhancethe immunogenicity of prime/boost vaccines is not known, andis the subject of this study. The mutation of active enzymesor binding sites within the HIV genes, while maintainingthe immunogenicity to multiple HIV antigens from a singlevector, also presents a challenge to vaccine design. We as-sessed an immunisation strategy that employed priming theimmune system with CpG optimised DNA encoding HIV-1antigens and boosting with rFPV encoding shared HIV-1antigens with or without co-expression of IFN /H9253or IL-12. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Vaccines The DNA and rFPV vaccines and in vitro protein ex- pressionisdescribedelsewhere(Purcelletal.,manuscriptinpreparation; [37]). Briefly, the DNA vaccine (pHIS-HIV-B) contained approximately 65% B subtype pNL(AD8)provirus,withsequencesexpressingmodiedGag,modiedRT, Tat, Vpu, truncated Nef (the rst 31 aa)andtruncatedEnv(therst275aaonly).HIV-1geneswhose function posed a theoretical risk were either deleted (Inte-grase, LTRs, Vif, Vpr) or mutated (RT, Zn 2+ngers of toameliorateRNApackaging).ThemodiedHIV-1genomewas inserted into the plasmid DNA vaccine vector pHIS-64 (Dr. Heather Davis, Coley Pharmaceuticals), containingkanamycin-selection, a CMV promoter, and primate-optimised CpG im-munostimulatory sequences. Vaccine expressing mutated Gag/Pol, the gag/polfrom the pHIS-HIV-B DNA vac- cine described above. Pol antigens in the vaccines (RT,protease) are expressed via a frameshift mutation. Primerswere designed to add the FPV early/late promoter and anearly transcription terminator to the genes the PCR.Thepromoter- gag/polPCRproductwasclonedintoplasmid pKG10 for insertion into /H9253orIL-12genes(knowntobebiologicallyactivein [20-23]) were inserted rFPV under the the FPV P.E/L promoter immediately downstream IL-12 were removed by PCR mutagenesis.Recombinants were selected on the basis of co-expressionof theE. coligpt gene and plaque puried on the basis of co-expression of the E. colibeta-galactosidase gene. 2.2.

Vaccine regimensusing groups of four to six macaques are shown in Table 1. 2.3. Power and statistical considerations The study was primarily powered to detect two-fold dif- ferencesinIFN /H9253ELISPOTresponsesbetweenregimens.We have observed a standard deviation in assays of16%betweensimilarlyimmunisedmacaques,predictingthata six versus (two-sidedsignicancetestof5%)todetect1.26-folddifferencesin HIV-specic IFN /H9253ELISPOT responses, and a four ver- sus four comparison was powered to detect a 1.32-fold dif-ference. Statistical comparisons of secondary endpoints ofimmune responses and viral levels between vaccine groupsutilised a t-test of pair-wise comparisons without compen- sation for the multiple analyses performed. Comparison ofviral concentrations across groups utilised a time-weightedarea-under-the-curve analysis.190 C.J.

HIV-1 antibody responses Antibodies to HIV-1 were tested by a competitive en- zyme immunoassay (EIA, Wellcozyme HIV Recombinant,UK) and by western blot using 200 /H9262g standardised HIV-1 viral lysate [26]. 2.6. HIV-1 challenge of the macaques Stocks of HIV-1 LAI, passaged through neonatal M. nemestrina , were kindly provided by Drs. M. Agy and M. Bosch (U. Washington, Seattle, WA) [27-29]. The HIV-1 isolate K98227/W35 was selected from an infected neona-tal macaque, with high HIV-1 plasma RNA 35 weeks post- infection. As it was impractical to expand this stock sep-arately in autologous PBMC from each of the 30 macaquesstudies,thechallengestockwasderivedfrominfectingphyto-haemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated human PBMC with HIV-1 LAIisolate with to PHA-stimulated, CD8-depleted PBMC from a fur-ther three donors and maintained for 7 days.

Reactogenicity of the DNAand rFPV vaccines in macaques Six groups of four to six pigtailed macaques received ei- ther two DNA priming vaccinations followed two rFPVboostervaccinations,threerFPVvaccinationsalone,orcon-trol vaccinations with placebo DNA and/or FPV ( Table 1). All macaques remained healthy following the vaccinationsand gained weight normally. No large swelling or erythemawas observed at the injection sites. Serial analyses of bloodcellcounts,plasmaelectrolytes,urea,totalprotein,albumin,bilirubin, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase did not revealany adverse effects of vaccination (data not shown). Simi-larly,detailedpre-clinicaltoxicologyexperimentsperformedon 36 cynomolgus macaques did not reveal any adverse ef-fects of the vaccines (data not shown). 3.2.

However, in the groups receiving rFPV vaccines alone, only lowlevelsofHIV-specicIFN /H9253producingTcells,thatwerenot signicantly observed ( Fig. 1b). There was no further enhancement of the HIV-specic IFN/H9253response by ELISPOT in the groups administered the DNA/rFPV-IFN /H9253 group (Fig. 1b and c). At week 15, post-vaccination, the P-value for the difference between the DNA/rFPV regimen and the DNA/rFPV-IFN /H9253regimen was P= 0.008 (Fig. 1b). On day of challenge, the P-value between these two groups wasP= 0.04 to whole inactivated HIV-1, and P= 0.03 to HIV-1 Gag peptides ( Fig. 1c). Similarly, responses from the DNA/rFPV group were signicantly greater than those forthe DNA/rFPV-IL-12 following all vaccinations ( Fig. 1b;P = 0.01), but were not signicantly enhanced on the day ofchallenge ( Fig. 1c;P= 0.10 using whole inactivated HIV-1, andP= 0.16 HIV-1 Gag peptides). HIV-speciclymphoproliferativeresponses,whichgener- allydetectCD4+T-helperresponses,wereassessedtowholeinactivated HIV-1 antigen and HIV-1 P55 Gag protein. Oneweek following two DNA vaccinations alone (week 4), nosignicant T cell proliferative activity was detected to ei- ther whole inactivated HIV-1 or P55 Gag protein ( Fig. 2). In macaques receiving rFPV vaccines alone, no signicantproliferative response was detected above control macaques(P> 0.05). Macaques in the three groups receiving DNA prime and rFPV boost vaccinations generated enhanced Tcell proliferative activity to 2a) Gag protein ( Fig. 2b). second rFPV boost vaccination did not detectably enhance HIV-specicT cell proliferative activity compared to the response af-ter a single rFPV boost (week seven versus week 11, P> 0.05). There was no enhancement of the T cell prolifera-tiveresponseintheDNAvaccineprimedmacaquesboostedwith the rFPV-IFN /H9253or rFPV-IL-12 vaccines compared to responses from in Fur-thermore,thelymphoproliferativeresponsesfollowingboost-ing with the rFPV-IFN /H9253vaccine liferativeactivityoftheDNA/rFPVandtheDNA/rFPV-IFN /H9253 arms was 0.04 to whole inactivated HIV-1 and 0.01 to P55Gag. Following the second rFPV boost (week 11), the P- valueswere0.04towholeinactivatedHIV-1and0.01toP55Gag. There was no signicant difference in the lymphopro-liferative responses detected between the DNA/rFPV-IL-12armandtheDNA/rFPVarm,excepttoP55Gagatweekseven(P= 0.03). Two rFPV boosts were administered in this study to as- certain whether further rFPV boosts were required to en-hance T cell immunity. However, there was no signicantincreaseinHIV-speciclymphoproliferativeactivity1weekfollowingthesecondrFPVboost(week11)comparedtooneweek following the rst rFPV boost across any of the threeprime/boost regimens either to the P55 Gag protein antigenor to whole inactivated HIV-1 antigen ( P> 0.05). 3.3. HIV-1 antibodies Although the vaccine regimens were primarily designed to induce HIV-specic T cells, HIV-1 antibodies were alsoassessed, both by a commercial EIA to quantify responses,and by western blot to assess responses to various HIV-1proteins ( Fig. 3). HIV-1 antibody responses by EIA were only detected in the three groups of macaques immunisedwiththeprime/boostregimensandweresimilaracrossthesegroups. The responses were weak, with a mean sample/cut-offratiointhe18prime/boostvaccinatedmacaquesof 1.0 in the competitive EIA; this represents a borderline positiveresultinthissensitiveassay( Fig.3a).Bywesternblot,weak HIV-1P24Gag-specicresponsesweredetectablefollowingthe DNA vaccination prime in only 6 of the 18 macaquesreceivingtheDNAprime(exampleshownin Fig.3b,week6).

A quantitative analysis of cellular HIV-1 DNA in PBMC was used to further analyse protective efcacy. A non-signicant trend of reduced HIV-1 in macaques in theDNA/rFPV prime/boost group in comparison to the controlgroup (P= 0.17) and the DNA/rFPV-IFN /H9253group (P= 0.13) was observed ( Fig. 4f). The continued presence of HIV-1 DNA 8 weeks following challenge, even in macaques withcontrolled HIV-1 plasma RNA, was notable and consistentwith seeding of cellular reservoirs following challenge.C.J.

Anamnestic antibody responses to HIV-1 challenge showed more rapid rises in antibody titers in macaques re-ceiving the three prime/boost regimens compared at three weeks post-challenge, consistent with vaccine-inducedprimingoftheimmuneresponse( Fig.3c).Alower, late antibody response at 11 weeks post-challenge was ob-served in the DNA/rFPV group in comparison to controls(P= 0.02), consistent with the control of viremia observed. Western blots also demonstrated the rapid development ofreactivity against multiple viral proteins by 3 weeks post-challenge in macaques receiving the prime/boost regimens(Fig. 3b, 3 and 11 weeks post-challenge). 3.5.

Discussion This study evaluated DNA prime/rFPVboostregimensintendedforclinicalevaluation.ThevaccinationswerewelltoleratedandhighlevelsofHIV-specicTcellresponseswereinducedintheDNAandrFPVprime/boostarms.Ifsimilarsafetyandimmunogenicityisob-servedinhumans,thisregimencouldevaluatewhetherprior induction of HIV-specic T cell responses can ameliorateHIV-1 infection or disease in humans. DNA priming together with attenuated pox-virus boost- ing for HIV vaccination has been described previously byour group [4,19,32] and others [6-8,33-35] . Several aspects differentiatedthisstudyfrompreviousDNAprime/poxvirusbooststudies.First,aseriesofmutationswereintroducedintotheHIV-1proteinsexpressedbytheDNAandrFPVvaccinesto address potential safety concerns. Second, an abbreviatedvaccinationschedulewasstudiedandfoundeffective.Third,we demonstrated no further enhanced T cell immunogenic-ity following a second rFPV boost suggesting the regimenmightbeabletobeabbreviatedstillfurther.Fourth,rFPVwasusedastheboostingvectorwhichisunlikelytohavesigni-cant cross-reactive immunity against vaccinia viruses. Fifth,primate-optimised CpG motifs were included in the DNApriming vaccination, potentially improving priming abilityoftheDNAvaccination,althoughfurtheranalysiswithmoredenitivecomparativeprimatestudiesisrequired.Lastly,in-corporatingmultipleHIV-1genes( gag,pol,tat,rev,vpu,env, nef) in the DNA vaccine may have facilitated a broad-based immune response. This study conrms previous ndings of non-sterilising immunity associated with the cellular immunity inducedby the DNA prime/poxvirus boost approach. The non-pathogenic nature of the challenge stock does not allow arigorousanalysisofprotectiveimmunity.However,thestudydiddemonstratelowerandmoretransientplasmaHIV-1RNAconcentrations following challenge, and a brisk but abortedriseinanamnesticantibodiesfollowingchallenge.Thedetec-tionofpersistinglevelsofcell-associatedHIV-1DNA,eveninthisnon-pathogenicmodel,isofconcerngiventhepropen-sity of HIV-1 to mutate and escape immune responses. Thedegree of protection from pathogenic SHIV challenge (withmuch higher levels of viremia) by DNA and rFPV vaccinesis currently being assessed. The lack of enhancement of T cell immune responses by thecytokinesintherFPVboostwassurprising nd-ing in both ELISPOT and lymphoproliferation assays wascorroborated using multiple, separate HIV-1 antigens. Possible explanations for the reduced HIV-specic T cell immunogenicityintheDNA/rFPV-IFN /H9253andDNA/rFPV-IL- 12 regimens were explored by analysing anti-FPV humoralimmunity.GreaterFPVantibodyresponsesintheDNA/rFPVgroup were observed in comparison to the DNA/rFPV-IL-12 regimen. Co-expression of IL-12 may have enhanced theelimination of the FPV vector by FPV-specic T cells, re-sulting in decreased FPV and HIV antigen expression andconsequently poorer immunogenicity. Although the rFPVvector is non-replicating, durable persistence and expres-sion of the inserted antigen may be required for optimalimmunity.196 C.J. Dale et al. / Vaccine 23 (2004) 188-197 FPV-specic T cell immunity may also have been modu- lated by the cytokine co-expression in the rFPV boost. attempts to examine FPV-specic T cell immunitybyELISPOTusingwholeliveFPVasanantigenwereham-peredbylargebackgroundTcellresponsestocontaminatingchicken embryo dermal cells used to grow immunodominant T cell responses inoutbred most likely also re-sultedinthelackofenhancementofTcellimmunitytoHIVfollowing a second rFPV boost. Planned studies to further evaluate these promising vac- cineswilladdressseveraloutstandingissues.First,wewillas-sessasimilarlyexpandedantigencontentintherFPVboost-ing vaccine. This strategy should further broaden immuneresponses [12,13].Second,wewillassessprotectionagainst apathogenicSHIVchallengeinmacaques.Onlypathogenicmodels with high levels of viremia will provide further pre-clinical information on the limitations of this HIV vaccineapproach and assist in evolving strategies to improve them.Third, we will consider assessing co-delivery of a pro-Tcell cytokine gene in the DNA priming vaccination. Severalgroups have shown this to be a promising approach [3,36]. Including the cytokine gene together with the DNA primingvaccine may have advantages over co-expressing it with therFPV boost, since the immunomodulatory effect of the cy-tokinecanonlybedirectedagainsttheinsertedHIVgenesintheDNAvaccineasnoothergenesareexpressedbyplasmidvector.Fourth,wewillassessadministrationoftheDNAvac-cine alone for immunogenicity and efcacy. The DNA vac-cine clearly primed an immune response and the efcacy ofthis approach alone against a SHIV challenge is of interest.Fifth, we will evaluate further renements of schedule (e.g.,asingleDNAprime)anddose.Sixth,wewillassessmucosaladministration of the vaccines for the induction of mucosalimmunity, which may be of additional benet in protectionagainst mucosally transmitted HIV. Seventh, we will studyvaccines expressing antigens from HIV-1 subtype A/E suit-able for eventual use in Asia. Last, we will progress thesevaccines to clinical trials.
