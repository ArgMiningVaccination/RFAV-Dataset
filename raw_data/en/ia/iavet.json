Examples of complementary therapies include acupuncture, meditation, therapeutic massage and yoga. yNo complementary health treatment has been proven to cure cancer, but complementary treatments may help cancer patients manage their cancer symptoms or treatment side effects and enhance well-being. These treatments may help cancer patients suffering from anxiety, fatigue, nausea, pain or stress. yComplementary therapies, especially natural health products such as herbs and supplements, may have their own side effects and can interfere with standard cancer treatments. It is important to discuss complementary therapies with your healthcare providers. This will allow each of your doctors to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that incorporates complementary therapies that are safe and effective. yUnproven products or practices should never be used to replace or delay standard medical treatment for cancer.Introduction Cancer patients may suffer from physical and emotional distress due to their disease or its treatment. Patients are turning to integrative medicine (IM) to reduce stress, prevent or minimize side effects and symptoms, and support health and healing. IM combines standard medicine (such as surgery, chemotherapy, cancer drugs and radiation treatments) with safe and effective complementary therapies. Standard treatments are based on scientific research and are accepted by medical experts as proper treatment for a disease. Less research has been done for most complementary therapies. Complementary therapies include an array of healing philosophies, approaches and therapies that embrace a more holistic approach to care\u2014treating the mind, body and spirit. Examples of complementary therapies are: yTherapeutic massage yAcupuncture yMeditation yYoga yMusic therapy By integrating complementary therapies into conventional treatment plans, healthcare providers are better able to address the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of their patients. Researchers are currently exploring the potential benefits of Integrative Medicine (IM). The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Cancer Institute Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) support research that holds complementary therapies to the same rigorous scientific standards used to evaluate medical treatments. Researchers work to determine which complementary treatments are promising, which treatments are effective, and which treatments are safe. 2 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies Some complementary therapies studied have been determined to be both safe and beneficial for cancer patients. For example, certain complementary therapies help patients manage cancer treatment-related side effects such as nausea, fatigue and pain. However, for other complementary therapies, little or no scientific evidence about safety or effectiveness is available. For this reason, it is important for patients to learn as much as they can about any therapies they may be considering, and to consult with their healthcare provider before trying any of them. A growing number of hospitals, cancer centers and individual healthcare providers offer complementary therapies as part of a patient's treatment plan. Several major cancer centers have established IM services to make complementary therapies, such as music therapy, therapeutic massage, acupuncture, meditation, and yoga easily accessible to patients and families. At such centers, cancer patients can receive their complementary therapy and their cancer treatment in the same setting. Understanding the Benefits and Risks of Complementary Therapies A growing number of people are turning to complementary therapies to help manage symptoms, reduce side effects, and restore and promote a sense of control and well-being. Roughly two out of three cancer patients have tried at least one complementary therapy as part of their cancer care. Existing scientific evidence has found that certain complementary therapies may alleviate cancer-related symptoms and treatment side effects such as nausea and fatigue. For example, acupuncture has been evaluated in numerous studies and is now recognized as a safe method for managing chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting. Many complementary therapies are gentle, relaxing, and minimally invasive, providing ways for patients to develop an appreciation of themselves and an awareness of their own inner strength. Some techniques are \"passive,\" requiring limited participation (such as massage and aromatherapy), while others are \"active\" (such as yoga and tai chi). Still, there are comparatively few studies about the safety and effectiveness of many complementary therapies. To date, there is no definitive clinical evidence that any complementary therapies can slow cancer progression. Unproven products or practices should not be used to replace or postpone standard medical treatment. Delaying conventional cancer treatment can be dangerous and decrease the likelihood of a remission or a cure. Any treatments that are presented as alternatives to standard cancer therapies should be considered only within the context of clinical trials (See Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers on page 6). Despite some patients' views that complementary therapies are natural and safe, medical research indicates that not all these therapies are harmless. Cancer patients should consult with their healthcare providers before trying any complementary therapy for any purpose, whether it is cancer-related or not. Complementary Therapies for Side Effects An integrative healthcare team evaluates the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of each patient and then recommends and incorporates specific therapies and lifestyle changes as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Team members consider the scientific evidence, identify risks and benefits, and take into account individual preferences when they advise patients about various complementary therapies. Complementary therapies do not work for everyone. While some patients find relief from complementary therapies, some have found them to be ineffective or have reported problems with one or another. Benefits may vary from individual to individual. The following is a partial list of complementary therapies: Acupuncture\u2014Acupuncture has been used in China for thousands of years as part of traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncturists insert very thin needles through the skin at strategic places known as acupuncture points. Sometimes external heat and/or pressure is used, along with the needles. Substantial evidence shows that acupuncture can help relieve treatment-related nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Other emerging evidence shows that acupuncture may relieve symptoms such as cancer pain, hot flashes, anxiety, sleep problems, dry mouth, digestive problems and neuropathy (nerve pain). Acupuncture can be considered if symptoms are severe and conventional therapies are ineffective. It is important for acupuncturists to follow strict clean needle procedures by using a new set of disposable needles for each patient. Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to an acupuncturist who has experience working with cancer patients. 3 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies Aromatherapy\u2014Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants. Essential oils may be diluted and then massaged into the body. Some evidence suggests that aromatherapy massage can help reduce stress, anxiety and fatigue in cancer patients. Essential oils may also be mixed with water into a diffuser and inhaled. Aromatherapy may work by sending chemical messages to the area of the brain that affects mood and emotions. Keep in mind that one side effect of cancer treatment can be sensitivity to certain smells. Aromatherapy may even trigger nausea or vomiting for some patients. Additionally, skin changes such as rashes may be a side effect of cancer treatment, and lotions or massage oils, especially those with strong scents, may irritate sensitive skin. Art Therapy\u2014Art therapy involves creating art to help improve a person's health and well-being. It may include drawing, painting, working with clay, or engaging in other art forms. The participant does not have to be a skilled artist to benefit from art therapy. The process of creating and exploring feelings and emotions, not the finished product, is the key to art therapy. Art therapy led by a mental health professional may help reduce anxiety for cancer patients. Exercise\u2014A growing body of evidence suggests that physical exercise (walking, swimming, strength training) improves a cancer patient's fatigue and increases energy levels. Patients who exercise are less tired, less depressed and sleep better than patients who do not exercise. Exercise works by maintaining or building a person's stamina and strength. Before starting an exercise program, patients should consult with their healthcare team. Patients may be referred to a physical therapist, who will do a physical assessment and provide an exercise plan. An exercise plan should be individualized based on the patient's age, type of cancer, mobility and physical fitness level. Hypnosis\u2014Hypnosis is a trance-like state (like daydreaming) in which the body is relaxed but the mind is active. A specially trained therapist can direct the patient's attention to specific thoughts, feelings, images, sensations or behaviors. While under hypnosis, a person may feel calm, relaxed and more open to positive suggestions that may help reduce physical symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea and vomiting. Massage Therapy\u2014Research suggests that massage therapy may help relieve symptoms such as pain and anxiety in cancer patients. Massage therapy involves a professional practitioner applying pressure to muscle and connective tissue. In most states, people who practice massage may obtain a license to practice, which should ensure quality and requires continuing education for practitioners. Massage can help reduce tension and pain, improve circulation and encourage relaxation. Patients should consult with their healthcare providers before starting massage therapy to learn if there are any special precautions needed. For example, a massage therapist should not use deep or intense pressure especially near enlarged lymph nodes or on skin that is sensitive following radiation therapy. Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a professional massage therapist who has experience working with cancer patients. Medical Marijuana\u2014Marijuana has been used in herbal remedies for centuries. The biologically active components in marijuana are called \"cannabinoids.\" The two most-studied components are the chemicals delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Under federal law, marijuana cannot legally be prescribed, possessed or sold. However, under most state laws, the use of marijuana to treat some medical conditions is legal. To get medical marijuana, you will need a recommendation or certification from a licensed provider, verifying that you have a qualifying condition. Each state has its own list of qualifying conditions. You may then need to enroll in your state's medical marijuana program, which may include obtaining a medical marijuana ID card. Once enrolled, you will be able to buy medical marijuana at an approved dispensary. (Some state laws also allow the legal use of recreational marijuana by adults ages 21 and older; no states allow it for children and teens.) In cancer care, medical marijuana is sometimes used to manage side effects, such as nausea, appetite loss, pain or anxiety, if other medications or treatments are unsuccessful. More research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of marijuana and its cannabinoids. Do not use marijuana or products made with cannabinoids without first talking to your healthcare team. Marijuana or related products (for example, CBD oils) could interfere with other medications. Do not obtain any kind of marijuana anywhere that is not a licensed dispensary. Marijuana products that are not obtained from licensed dispensaries carry additional risks as they may contain unknown ingredients, including infectious agents or more potent (sometimes illegal) drugs. Talk honestly with members of the healthcare team about your use of marijuana or related products. Meditation\u2014Meditation is a mind-body self-practice that offers training in awareness and focused attention to get 4 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies a better sense of perspective. Meditation helps induce calmness and physical relaxation, improves psychological balance, and enhances overall health and well-being. The most extensively studied form of meditation in cancer patients is a multicomponent approach called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which includes meditation, yoga and group dynamics. MBSR may help cancer patients relieve anxiety, stress, fatigue and sleep disturbances. Music Therapy\u2014Music therapy uses music to help improve a person's health and well-being. It may include listening to relaxing music, singing, playing or learning a musical instrument, composing music and/or moving to music. In recent years, the use of music therapy has become more common for cancer patients. Music therapy may reduce stress, pain, anxiety and nausea. Relaxation Techniques\u2014Relaxation techniques promote health by relaxing the body and quieting the mind. These therapies are used to relieve stress and muscle tension, lower blood pressure and reduce pain. Relaxation techniques include guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive thoughts), biofeedback (learning to control specific body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and muscle tension with the help of a special machine), self-hypnosis and deep breathing exercises. For patients with cancer, regular relaxation training has decreased stress levels, increased immune system functioning, decreased pain, decreased the side effects of cancer treatment and improved mood. Tai Chi\u2014Tai chi is a system of sequences of very slow controlled movements that originated in China. It combines physical movement, breathing exercises and meditation to improve health and quality of life. In some patients, tai chi is effective in relieving pain, reducing fatigue and stress, and improving sleep quality. The practice may also help increase aerobic capacity, muscular strength, balance and flexibility in patients. Yoga\u2014Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India, which uses both the mind and the body. The various types of yoga usually combine physical postures, breath control and meditation or relaxation. Yoga may help improve anxiety, depression and stress in cancer patients. It should be noted, however, that only a small number of yoga studies in cancer patients have been completed. Therefore, more research is necessary. Since yoga involves physical activity, it is important for patients to discuss yoga with their healthcare providers to find out whether yoga may be safe for them because for newcomers, it's easy to over-do.If you are suffering from: Consider trying: (listed alphabetically) Anxiety, depression, stress Acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, exercise, hypnosis, massage therapy, meditation, music therapy, yoga Chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomitingAcupuncture, aromatherapy, hypnosis Fatigue Aromatherapy, exercise, meditation, tai chi, yoga Pain Acupuncture, hypnosis, massage therapy, music therapy, relaxation techniques Sleep problems Acupuncture, meditation, relaxation techniques, yoga Dietary Supplements, Vitamins, Herbs and Natural Products While approval is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drugs to be prescribed for a particular condition or illness, therapies such as vitamins or herbal supplements are not considered drugs, but \"foods.\" Unlike drugs, they do not have to be tested by the FDA before they are available to consumers, so their effectiveness and safety is often unknown. Patients undergoing cancer treatment should not take any dietary supplements, vitamins, or herbs unless a doctor approves them. Many oncologists advise their patients to avoid these products during chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The following are examples of how vitamins and herbal supplements can adversely affect patients: yFew herbal products have been tested for quality or side effects. Product quality is highly variable with differing concentrations of active ingredients. In addition, some herbal supplements may be contaminated with microorganisms, pesticides or heavy metals that can harm patients, particularly seriously ill patients. There are also concerns that certain herbal supplements can cause allergic reactions, gastrointestinal problems, liver damage or nerve damage. ySome herbal supplements can either increase or lessen the effects of other medications, or they may interfere with the metabolism of prescription drugs, 5 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies making them less effective. For example, the herb St. John's Wort, which is sometimes used to treat depression, can make some cancer treatments such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec\u00ae) less effective. Conversely, some herbs can increase the potency of a drug, causing more side effects. Some herbs can affect blood thinners such as warfarin and make the blood too thin or too thick, increasing a patient's risk of bleeding or blood clots. yVitamins in high doses can also have similarly unwanted side effects. They can cause adverse effects and are prone to interact with other drugs and dietary supplements. For instance, some studies have shown that high doses of vitamin C may reduce the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs in patients who have leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Some chemotherapy treatments use free radicals to destroy cancer cells. Vitamin C may neutralize these free radicals and reduce the effectiveness of various chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin, methotrexate and cisplatin. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have warned the public to be aware of fraudulent cancer treatments. The internet is full of \"miracle cures,\" \"scientific breakthroughs,\" and \"secret ingredients\" to treat or prevent cancer. Some of these fraudulent treatments may be dangerous and can cause physical harm. Other ineffective treatments may cause indirect harm by delaying or interfering with proven, effective treatments. Any patient considering using an anticancer product seen in advertisements or online, or even endorsed by well-meaning family and friends, should talk with their healthcare provider first. Complementary Therapies and Childhood Cancer Integrative medicine and complementary therapies may also be used in pediatric (childhood) cancer care. According to studies, complementary therapies may help children with a cancer diagnosis in some of the following ways: yMassage therapy may help decrease pain and anxiety. yArt therapy and music therapy may improve mental health and communication skills and help manage pain and fatigue. yAcupuncture may help with managing nausea and pain.Not all complementary therapies are safe for children undergoing cancer treatment. Even therapies that have been studied in adults for safety and effectiveness may not have been studied in children. Dietary supplements, vitamins, herbs and natural products are typically not recommended for children during cancer treatment because of the risk of interference with the prescribed doctor's treatment. Talk to the healthcare team before giving your child any supplements or natural products. If age-appropriate, include your child in discussions about complementary therapies with the healthcare team. There may be specific complementary therapies that your child finds more appealing. For example, is your child more interested in music or art therapy, or would they prefer to try yoga or massage? Talk to your child's healthcare team about what complementary therapies (both activities and supplements) may help improve your child's well- being and ask for referrals to licensed and/or certified specialists who have experience working with children. Will My Insurance Pay for Complementary Therapies? Some health insurance companies have started covering certain complementary therapies such as acupuncture. Check with your insurance provider to find out about your health plan coverage. Talking to Your Healthcare Provider Make sure to speak openly with your healthcare providers about any complementary therapies that you are currently using or considering. According to some studies, many patients do not share the complementary therapies they use with their doctors, due to fear that their doctor will disapprove. However, it is very important to discuss all therapies openly with your doctor because: yMany complementary therapies have not yet been extensively studied. For this reason, it is not widely known which are potentially helpful or harmful. ySome therapies - herbal remedies and dietary supplements in particular - can interact with radiation therapy or chemotherapy. yIf you have been doing research on specific complementary therapies, your healthcare providers can help you to better understand the scientific studies. Together, you can determine which therapies will be the most effective and safest for you. 6 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies yThanks to new integrative medicine programs, your cancer treatment center may even offer the complementary therapies you are interested in trying. By receiving the therapy at your treatment center, you will ensure that it's performed by a professional who has experience working with cancer patients. Questions to Ask Your Healthcare Team Use the following questions as a guide to discuss complementary therapies with your healthcare team: yAre there complementary therapies that you would recommend? yWhat research is available about this therapy's safety and effectiveness? yWhat are the benefits and risks of this therapy? yHow will I know if the therapy is working or not? yWill this therapy interfere with standard cancer treatments? yAre there potential side effects of this therapy? What should I look for? yDo you offer this therapy as part of your practice? If not, can you refer me to a licensed practitioner in the area? yAre there specific therapies that you would advise against? yDo you know if this therapy is part of a clinical trial? How can I learn more about clinical trial eligibility and enrollment? Locating an IM Specialist or a Complementary Health Practitioner If you are looking for a complementary health practitioner for treatment, it is important to conduct a careful and thorough search. Here are some suggestions to help in your search for a practitioner: yYour oncologist or cancer center may be able to refer you to a complementary health practitioner. Local hospitals or medical schools, professional organizations, state regulatory agencies or licensing boards, or even your health insurance provider may also be able to give you a referral. yAsk family and friends if they can recommend a practitioner for the type of therapy that you are seeking. yLearn as much as you can about any prospective practitioner including education, training, licensing and certifications. Be sure to find out whether the practitioner you are considering is licensed or certified and if they have worked with cancer patients. Before scheduling any appointments, ask how many years they have been in practice, where they received their training, as well as the estimated cost of treatment. The goal is to find practitioners who will work with your oncologist and other healthcare providers so that together, they can devise a treatment plan that meets your needs. Clinical Trials for Blood Cancers Every new drug or treatment regimen goes through a series of studies called \"clinical trials\" before it becomes part of standard therapy. A clinical trial for new cancer drugs and treatments is a carefully controlled research study that aims to improve the care and treatment of cancer patients. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all new drugs and other treatments to be tested in clinical trials before they are made available to the public. At any given time, there are thousands of cancer clinical trials available, because doctors and researchers are always seeking new and better treatments for patients. Many cancer clinical trials are searching for a cure. This means devising safer, more effective treatments that destroy cancer cells and keeps them from coming back. Other clinical trials look for new ways to improve existing treatments and to improve the quality of life for patients. There are trials for patients at every stage of treatment as well as for those whose disease is in remission. Researchers design cancer clinical trials to study new ways to: yTreat cancer using o A new drug o An approved therapy for a different diagnosis o A new drug combination o A new way of delivering a drug (pill, intravenously [IV], etc.) yManage cancer symptoms and alleviate the side effects of treatment yFind and diagnose cancer yPrevent cancer from returning yManage long-term side effects 7 Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies Conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation therapy have undergone years of rigorous study. Clinical trials to study various complementary therapies are also under way in many locations across the country to assess their safety, benefits, dosing and relative effectiveness. Participation in a carefully conducted clinical trial may be the best available option to receive a complementary therapy. Patient participation in past clinical trials has resulted in the therapies we have today. Patients interested in participating in a clinical trial are encouraged to talk with their hematologist-oncologists about whether a clinical trial would be appropriate for them. When you and your hematologist-oncologist discuss a clinical trial as a potential complementary therapy option, it may be helpful to: yHave a list of questions to ask concerning the risks versus the benefits of such a trial (visit www.LLS.org/ WhatToAsk for lists of suggested questions). yAsk a family member, friend, or another advocate accompany you to your doctor visit\u2014both for support and to take notes.
