Ordinario, MAIntroduction 1 Dear Colleagues, I am thrilled to share with you the 2019 Boston Medical Center Nursing Annual Report. Every single day in every corner of BMC our nurses bring to life our mission and core values: Built on Respect, Powered by Empathy; Move Mountains; and Many Faces Create Our Greatness. In this report we highlight but just a few of the amazing accomplishments of our teams. This year, we have real momentum in unit-based reliability with many quality , safety and patient experience initiatives. I am very proud of the unit based work, as well as our broader commitment to staf safety , EPIC improvements for safety and eiciency , and recruitment, onboarding, and retention which create the foundation for exceptional care. Across the hospital we have seen nurses going back to school and becoming certii ed. I believe that by the end of next year, we will meet the Institute of Medicine goal of 80% BSN nurses by 2020! Across all departments, clinical nurses are involved in meaningful change with their unit based council work, and their participation in hospital-wide committees and councils. Thanks to each of you for your commitment to excellence in patient care, and for your support of each other. With my sincerest appreciation, NANCY W. GADEN, DNP , RN, NEA-BC Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Oficer Boston Medical Center2 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentMission Statement EXCEPTIONAL CARE WITHOUT EXCEPTION Nationally , professional nurses play an important role in our healthcare transformation. At Boston Medical Center (BMC), nurses are leading the improvement of health and health care and strengthening the discipline of nursing through new knowledge, innovations, and improvements. Each day , front-line nurses and nurse leaders in every corner of our system are advancing professional practice, clinical inquiry and the delivery of evidence-based care to the patients, families, and the communities we serve regionally , nationally , and around the world. In partnership with patients and their families, BMC nurses and other caregivers provide a high level, consistent standard of care, delivering compassionate care with the best possible outcomes. Using the patient- centered care model, over 1,600 nurses in our system are driven to deliver 'Exceptional Care Without Exception' on a daily basis. Boston Medical Center Department of Nursing is Committed to Professional Practice Nursing Commitment to Professional Practice The Boston Medical Center (BMC) professional practice model serves as the underlying framework for all we do, unifying BMC nurses around a common belief system. It relects the care nurses provide to our patients, aligns with the BMC mission, and emphasizes BMC's core values and overarching goals. Even in the face of challenges, BMC nurses provide excellent care with kindness and hope in their hearts. They consider and incorporate those meaningful values into each patient's plan of care, ensuring that patients and families feel respected and well-served. They honor the uniqueness and diversity of all, creating goals and nursing interventions that incorporate the cultural values important to their patients and families. BMC nurses are committed to our care delivery model, patient centered care and shared governance, as both are core components of our professional practice model. Patient Centered Care BMC nurses embrace our care delivery model which is Patient Centered Care\u2014\"care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions\" (Institute of Medicine, 2015). Patient centered care is the practice of caring for patients and their families in ways that are meaningful and valuable to the individual patient. It includes listening to, informing and involving patients in their care. As advocates, BMC nurses provide compassionate care with dignity , respect and sensitivity to patients' cultural values and autonomy .Shared Governance BMC nursing leadership endorses and celebrates shared governance. Shared governance is collaboration among all nurses, whether in scheduling staf, educating new staf, or implementing evidence-based practice. It involves teamwork, problem-solving, and accountability , with the goals of improved staf satisfaction, productivity , and patient outcomes. It is working together to make decisions that afect nursing practice and patient care. We are committed to interprofessional collaboration with patients as the focus of all we do. BMC believes that institutions that utilize shared governance at the organizational, departmental, and unit levels experience decreased turnover rates, increased nursing satisfaction and better patient outcomes. BMC Nursing Philosophy: Nurse Theorist Dr. Madeleine Leininger The Cultural Care: Diversity and Universality Theory was developed by Dr. Leininger to guide in the provision of culturally congruent nursing care provided to diverse populations. BMC Professional Nurses embrace their duty to provide supportive care that is tailored to speciic individual and groups and consider what is culturally valued and believed by those populations. BMC nurses consider and incorporate those meaningful values into the patients' plan of care so patients and families feel respected. Nurses at BMC create goals and nursing care interventions that incorporate special cultural values important to their patients and families. Our diverse patient population has better outcomes because of the adoption and enumeration of this theoretical framework.73% WHITE 16% AFRICAN AMERICAN 5% ASIAN 4% HISPANIC OR LATINO 1% TWO OR MORE RACES <1% AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKAN NATIVE <1% NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER BMC NURSING BY THE NUMBERS REGISTERED NURSES 1783 407CNAS & LPNS ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES231YEARS OF SERVICE ETHNICITY FEMALE 90%RNS WITH BSN, MSN, OR PHD 77% 13%RNS WITH SPECIALTY CERTIFICATIONS < Respect, Powered by Empathy 5 BMC nurses partner with patients and families to inluence change in our hospital. Our Professional Practice Model incorporates our philosophy of nursing, theoretical frameworks, and tenets of our professional nursing practice. Our nursing philosophy is based upon patient centered care with an emphasis on creating caring, therape utic and synergistic relationships with our patients and their families. Establishing relationships is the foundation of our care delivery . Nurses create partnerships wit h patients and families to establish goals and plans for delivery of patient cente red care. To ensure care coordination, our nurses practice collaboratively with the interprofessional team to develop the plan of care. To help create these plans of care, nurses incorporate specialty guidelines and evidence-based practice to assure optim al patient outcomes. These care plans are individualized with the patient and family and reviewed at interprofessional rounds. Patient centered care results in our pat ients and their families \"feeling cared for\" and produces exceptional clinical outcomes, patient experience, and professional accountability for practice.Quality of CareRESPECT6 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentClinical Outcomes Interventions Contributes to CAUTI Reduction According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), catheter- associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are associated with negative patient outcomes such as discomfort, prolonged hospitalization, associated health care cost increases, and mortality . AHRQ reports that up to 25% of hospitalized patients have an indwelling catheter during their hospital stay and the practice of catheter utilization is often not clinically indicated. Quality nursing care starts with improving the delivery of patient care. Professional nurses take pride in doing the right thing, but quality care is more than will; it is a mindset of inquiry and the capacity to use appropriate tools to improve systems in which we work. To that end, we are committed to chasing zero and the eradication of healthcare-associated infections. During the past six years, there have been many interventions put into place at BMC to reduce the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). In 2015, a task force, comprised of nurse managers, staf nurses, nursing leaders, nurse educators and infection preventionists, was formed. This group met monthly to assess current practice and products and provide recommendations for change. The irst change was the implementation of a new foley catheter kit. The kit contained a smaller catheter, an improved betadine prep kit and detailed insertion instructions.A key factor in decreasing CAUTI in 2019 were these noteworthy best practice changes: A bladder protocol for urinary retention Indications for insertion and continuation of indwelling urinary catheters Perineal care protocol for patients with urinary catheters Urinalysis, with relex to culture protocol on patients with an indwelling urinary catheter Use of the PureWick female incontinence device Daily rounding on all patients with indwelling foley catheters Sending email communications to the foley team to determine if foley removal is possible All of these interventions have contributed to a signiicant reduction in CAUTI and utilization of foley catheters. A big thank you to all our patient care providers in helping reduce patient infections. Incidence of CAUTI 2014-2019 Foley Utilization per 1000 Respect, Powered by Empathy 7Journey to Reduce CLABSIs In 2018, the raw number of Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSIs) in the medical Intensive Care Units (MICUs) was nine. This number was much higher than the n ational average. With hospital-acquired infections (HAI) such as central line-associated blood stream infections, ideally you want your number to reach \"zero\". Zero is an extremely high bar and takes vigilance, cohe sive teamwork and a culture of safety . For these reasons, the interdisciplinary team set out to address the prob lem of CLABSI on their units utilizing improved communication, safer products and enhanced veriication processes. The irst improvement intervention utilized was a standardized approach aimed to s trengthen the current auditing and rounding processes. The team initiated daily nurse manager auditing of all central lines in the MICUs. This process involved a conversation with each nurse and medical team mem ber taking care of a patient with a central line. The team members were asked speciic questions. T hese questions were primarily aimed at determining if the central line can be removed that day . The questions addressed speciic criteria that warranted a central line. If a central line did not meet the criteria, t he line was removed. If criteria to keep the line was veriied, the team would proceed to audit the full bundle of care being done for central line care and maintenance every shift (i.e., shift assessment s, central line dressing changes per protocol, daily chlorhexidine baths, IV tubing changes, scrubbing the hub etc.) Additionally , c harge nurses were empowered as champions. On each shift, charge nurses would round on central lines and verify that central line dressings were dry , intact and labeled. They would speak with eac h nurse about the plan for the line. This conversation reinforced the nurse-manager conversation. During the improvement cycles, several evidence-based product changes we re also made to further reduce CLABSIs. The team recognized that several of the previous CLABSIs had involved dia lysis lines and occlusion of lines due to blood clotting. To improve this issue the dialysis catheters we re replaced with a new product ofering a larger bore. The chlorhexidine bath process was changed, and th e team opted to use disposable wipes with chlorhexidine. Single and dual lumen midlines as options were promote d as an option for a line that could stay in longer than standard peripheral IVs but did not incur the s ame infection risk. These diligent eforts by the team in FY 2019 yielded signiicant results. The addition of improved communication practices, auditing processes and evidence-based products resulted in th e number of CLABSIs in the MICUs going from nine in FY 2018 to only one CLABSI in FY 2019! 8 Boston Medical Center Nursing Department MARCHNumber of Patients with Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries in 2019 3% Preventing Pressure Injuries at BMC Hospital Acquired Pressure Injury (HAPI) prevention is a hospital-wide safety initiativ e that takes a team efort. The skin and wound care program at BMC provides patient s and staf an environment of safe care. This care is guided by a comprehensive and competency-based pressure injury prevention program using evidenced-based practic e. Every year, BMC participates and completes quarterly pressure injury prevalen ce surveys. In 2019, the skin care team evaluated a total of 1,325 patients for pressure injuries. These prevalence surveys are conducted by \"skin care\" champions from ever y unit of the hospital. The skin care team provides a head-to-toe skin assessment on each patient and reviews their chart for inclusion of best practice pressure injury prev entive measures such as the Braden score, proper bed support surface, re-positioning, incontinence management and nutritional support. Once they've completed the assessment, they incorporate an interdisciplin ary approach and communicate their indings to their peers, nurse managers and clinical educa tors, building efective teamwork, improving communication and ultimately , improving patient outcomes. The skin care team continues to act as a resource for skin and w ound care assessment on their units. Several members of the skin committee have identiied what being a member of t he team means to them: \"I like seeing the improvement in patients' skin health.\" - Jil l, MICU A \" As staf, the importance of being on the skin committee is bringi ng information to our units, helping our colleagues get excited about skin and how to document skin issue s they ind when caring for patients.\" - Laura, M6E \"I like the skin care committee because I feel wound care and pr essure injury prevention is 100% nurse driven. We are captains of the ship, we do the assessment s, planning, interventions and hands-on monitoring and healing.\" - Lisa, M6W \"The skin team is the irst line of defense to help the patient, families and doctors.\" - Lisa, M7E \"Participating in the skin committee has improved my bedside practice in preventing pressure injuries using evidence-based practice. As a committee member, I have met ma ny RNs from diferent units who work together to promote healthy skin and prevent HAPI.\" - Bridget, SI CU The skin team provides support and commitment in engaging all staf and is critical to our program's success. * Data from the pressure injury prevalence surveys are submitted to the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) and Massachusetts Hospital Association (MHA).JUNE 2% AND PEDI UNITS WHO HAD NO HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PRESSURE INJURIES FOR THE YEAR! Built on Respect, Powered by Empathy 9 Improving Treatment of Postpartum Severe Obstetric Hypertension with Nurse Released Nifedipine IR In the US, hypertensive disorders have a signiicant association with maternal morbidity and mortality (Hitti, 2018). Severe hypertension (SBP greater than or = 160mmHg and/or DBP greater than or = 110mmHg sustained for 15 minutes) in an obstetric patient constitut es an obstetric hypertension emergency and should be managed within 1 hour (ACOG, 2019). In 2017, a maternity multidisciplinary team at BMC created a severe range Hyper tension (HTN) OB algorithm to optimize timely treatment of HTN. Subsequent analysis of the algorithm determined that we were not reaching our goal of having all severe range HTN crisis treated within one hour. The mainstay tr eatment was IV labetolol and this created delays for three reasons: 1) Many of our patients did not h ave IVs 2) The antihypertensive medications were not ordered consistently 3) BMC requir es that IV labetolol include EKG monitoring and this created a need to have the resource nurse pr esent for all IV labetolol administrations. The mother/baby unit did not have telemetry nor are the mother/baby nurses tele-certiied. There was often a delay in treatment w hile waiting for the resource nurse. Based on the current evidence for treatment eicacy for severe range H TN management, the multidisciplinary team created a nurse released order set for nifedipine IR with a new algorithm to relect the change including the nurse and provider responsibilities for using th e order set. The team added this nurse released order set into every patient's admission and l ater added this to all patients who were readmitted. The original goal for 1/31/19 was that at least 80% of our patients with severe range HT N would be treated with antihypertensive within 1 hour of irst severe range BP . Since 2019, we exceeded that goal with 88% of all patients receiving antihypertensiv e within 1 hour of irst severe BP range and 100% of patients who needed antihypertensive rec eived them. We greatly reduced our need to access the resource RN with the use of nifedipine and hav e increased our timely approach to treatment within 1 hour of the severe range BP . Our anecdotal review earlier in the year found that close to 100% of patients now ge t the needed nurse released nifedipine within an hour of the severe range blood pressure. photo by Ed Collier10 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentMother-Baby Early Bloomers Program Late preterm infants (born at 34- 36.6 weeks gestation) are at increased risk of hypothermia, hypoglycemia, respiratory complications, feeding diiculties, neurodevelopmental delays, hyperbilirubinemia, infection, extended length of stay and higher infant mortality . They comprise 70% of all preterm births in the United States. Late preterm infants need a focused nurse assessment that closely monitors for stress associated with hypothermia, infection, weight loss and require interventions to prevent complications that lead to mother infant separation and breastfeeding failure. Late pre-term infants have lower rates of breastfeeding compared to term infants (over 37 weeks' gestation), and the disparity is even greater for African American infants. Boston Medical Center (BMC) is a Baby Friendly designated hospital and supports breastfeeding best practices. Clinical nurses recognized these interventions were not suicient to help late pre-term infants successfully breastfeed. Due to feeding challenges which result in dehydration and hyperbilirubinemia, the readmission rates for this patient population were 33.3% in September 2018.After clinical nurses from the mother baby unit reviewed the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) evidence-based guidelines on late pre-term infant breastfeeding, the clinical nurses along with support from a professional development specialist, and nurse managers, implemented AWHONN's evidence-based enhanced breastfeeding support interventions targeting late pre-term infants and their mothers. Their goal was to decrease the rate of late pre-term infant readmissions within the irst year of life related to breastfeeding issues on the Mother-Baby unit. The program was named \"Early Bloomers\" and the protocol designed by the staf consisted of: Increased vital sign monitoring to assess for and prevent hypothermia Increase infant feedings to every 2-3 hours Automatic consult with a lactation consultant placed at the time of delivery Automatic eligibility for donor breast milk \"Early Bloomers\" kit provided to the mother to assist with breastfeeding and hand expression to increase milk production \"Early Bloomers\" kit provided to the mother to assist with early initiation of breastfeeding and hand expression to increase milk production A special demarcation \"Early Bloomer\" on the nurse/patient assignment which indicates the increased care demands of this patient population In April 2019, the Early Bloomer Nursing Pathway was fully implemented, providing guidance for the assessment and care related to breastfeeding of late pre-term infants on the Mother Baby Postpartum Unit. As a result of their work, the readmission rate of late preterm infants related to breastfeeding issues within the irst year of life went from 33% to 0%. This clinical nurse-led evidence-based change guided nursing practice and made a positive impact on late per-term infant outcomes. top left photo by Ed CollierBuilt on Respect, Powered by Empathy 11Newborn and Pediatric Bereavement Conference When families bring new life into the world or are able to watch their children gr ow into adulthood, it is a time of happiness, hope and joy . As medical professionals at BMC, we understand and recognize there are times when tragic events occur that m ay not allow families to follow their intended path. Bereavement care is one of the realities of being a nurse. Research indicate s that dealing with death and dying is a leading factor in nurse turnover and job dissatisfaction related t o a lack of bereavement skills and preparedness. In March 2019, BMC held its 1st Newborn and Pediatric Bereavement Conference. Thirt y- eight nurses in maternal child health, surgical services, and pediatric units w ere invited to attend an eight-hour bereavement training which granted nursing contact hours. Skill stations were reviewed including cuddle cot, memory making rituals and simulations emphasizin g the nurse to family empathic communication. Guest speakers included Decedent Afairs, New England Donor Services, photographers, Chaplaincy Services and a bereaved pare nt speaker panel. The conference concluded with strategies for self-care provided by an in tegrative nurse, an employee social worker and lots of love from BMC's therapy dogs. The conference had a great turnout and was well received by nurses who verba lized the conference helped staf develop skills and increase conidence in caring for patie nts and families who have experienced a loss at BMC. 12 Boston Medical Center Nursing Department Each month, the team works on a message of the month which is distributed through handouts and posted on the HOPE team link on the nursing webpage. An ongoing project for the HOPE team was to collaborate with unit-based council colleagues and leadership to articulate a set of unit-based staf commitments. T o achieve this, members used several strategies including creating posters and lyers to solicit staf suggestions around speciic themes: How we count on each other How we promote teamwork How we support each other The impact of this initiative will be measured through data obtained in the NDNQI survey . Members have also collaborated with their colleagues at the unit level to create programs to recognize kindness and positive behaviors. One example of this is the \"Daily Daisy\" in the CCU in which staf acknowledge positive actions of their peers.At the conclusion of each meeting, members are asked to provide post-it feedback. This feedback guides the direction and agenda for future meetings. The response of the registered nurses who participate on the committee has been overwhelmingly positive. One of the perioperative representatives, Christine Gagliano, BSN, RN expressed it best: \"The HOPE committee is dedicated to encouraging a healthy practice environment. It's a supportive group that reinforces collaboration and teamwork, plus provides skills at handling confrontations. As a nurse and HOPE committee member, I can encourage and advocate for a healthy practice environment, that is essential to efective patient care and best patient outcomes.\" Healthy Organization and Practice Environment (HOPE) Committee The HOPE committee, comprised of staf nurses, was established in early 2019 and its purpose was to advance a practice environment which promotes civility and respect among all team members. The committee was co-chaired by professional development staf Maureen Plunkett, RN, MS and Eduarda Fonseca, RN, MS. Sponsors for and Carol Conley , RN, DNP . The committee set out to introduce best practice ideas to promote positivity by generating ideas that will foster a healthy practice work environment, identify strategies and tactics to address incivility and bullying and create a community of support for nursing staf. The monthly meetings provided a highly interactive setting in which nurses representing units across all specialties could share challenges and successes in dealing with diicult behaviors and share strategies for encouraging positive behaviors. Topics covered in learning sessions included understanding implicit bias; how to diferentiate bullying from incivility and the process for dealing with each; and understanding generational diferences.

The initiative focused on improving the quality and eiciency of MD-RN communication and patient safety . It is well known in hospital settings that poor communication across teams can lead to serious medical errors. This team had reviewed adverse events experienced on the unit that ultimately led to the prioritization of this project by stakeholders. The team utilized the multidisciplinary evidence-based model for bedside rounding already employed in the ICU settings at Boston Medical Center.The primary process goal of this quality improvement project was to include the nurses in the physician rounding at the patient's bedside. Physician colleagues were asked to stop by the nurse's station prior to rounding and announce the start of bedside rounds to the nurses. Nurses would pause what they were doing if possible and join the team for rounds. This method used for testing of a new worklow was \"Plan, Do, Study , Act\". This allowed for rapid changes of the new process to continuously improve the methods used. At the beginning of the project, signs were posted around the unit to remind the teams of the new process. The unit coordinator was asked to audit the process daily and served as \"gatekeeper\", reminding teams as they entered the unit space. There were barriers to this change in physician worklow . Physician \"buy-in\" took time to build. The value of nurse participation and the beneits this provided to patient safety were the main driving forces, while resistance to change and fears that the new process would add additional time to rounds were the main barriers identiied by the teams. A few weeks into the project the unit council members realized that the signs weren't enough incentive to drive this big change. They began a new Plan, Do, Study , Act cycle and utilized a standardized rounding board. The rounding board listed all the teams that cared for the patients on the pilot unit. When the teams remembered to follow the new process at the nurses' station, they received a magnet, when they did not stop, they received an \"x\" for the day . T eams who stopped ive days in a row would be given a reward. This created some competition amongst teams and seemed to work better than the signs. While this project is still an active work in progress, it has fostered improved teamwork, interdisciplinary collaboration, patient safety and communication. As a result, the 5W unit council continues to work on this project and has recently initiated testing of a 30-day initiative focusing on solely the General Internal Medicine (GIM) teams who have a high impact on many patients cared for on the unit. 14 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentLong Stay Rounds in the MICU In 2019, the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) observed a concerning trend in their length of stay (LOS) inpatient admissions data. It was noted in some cases patients may be staying longer due to missed opportunities for advance care planning (ACP) discussions with patients, their families and the care team. This included missed conversations on the option for end-of-life care with our General Inpatient Hospice (GIP) program. Hospice care improves the costs of care and length of hospital level stay at the end-of-life and ofers relief for many of the symptoms at end-of-life such as pain and respiratory distress. Boston Medical Center (BMC) contracts with Seasons Hospice to provide hospice care to our patients when they qualify at end-of-life. The team came together to address the problem of increased LOS and possible decreased quality at end-of-life for their patients. Nurse managers, case managers and social workers in the MICU all had noticed how many of the patients had extended stays of at least three weeks long. The team wondered how to address some of the barriers that were preventing timely discharge from the MICU. They looked to the literature to identify evidence-based strategies that may work in this type of clinical setting to improve the discharge process from the MICU. The team engaged physicians in discussion about the trends. They proposed a quality improvement initiative coined \"MICU Long Stay Monday Rounds\". This new process would include testing dedicated rounds every Monday in the afternoon. The team invited all three Attending Physicians from the MICU teams, palliative care, a nurse representative from Seasons Hospice, a MICU nurse manager, case manager and social worker to the rounds. Buy-in to attend rounds started slow at irst but the new process convinced team members of its potential impact and attendance improved. Since the initiation of MICU Long Stay Monday Rounds, referrals to GIP hospice have steadily increased while length of stay in these patients decreased. This dedicated weekly rounding also helps to ensure that there are earlier ACP discussions and family meetings to improve communication. The MICU team was able to identify barriers to ACP discussions earlier and if indicated, engage teams such as patient advocacy or ethics. Ethic consults and involvement from Patient Advocacy is often beneicial to the family or team with a particularly complex case. Through this work the team additionally identiied the need to reach out to Shattuck Hospital. Many MICU patients are also discharged there. There have been barriers to transfers and the team hopes to better understand their processes, capacity , criteria and worklows for accepting and admitting patients. This testing will target another group of longer stay patients seen in the MICU. The whole team acknowledges that each time a patient goes out even a little bit earlier, a bed is created for a patient waiting in the ED. Every time a patient goes on GIP hospice, the family receives 13 months of bereavement support, music therapy and additional supports while they are in the hospital and their inpatient hospital LOS is decreased. This important work on discharges from the MICU provides beneits that extend beyond the original desired outcomes of increased ACP discussions and decreased LOS.

In the Endocrinology , Diabetes, Nutrition, and Weight Management department, we have a multidisciplinary team of Certiied Diabetes Educators (CDEs) comprised of Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Registered Dietitians and Pharmacists. These CDEs have collaborated with our diabetes providers and Olivia Weinstein, Culinary Nutrition Manager in BMC's Demo Kitchen, to combine diabetes education with a cooking class focusing on nutritious meals for people who live with diabetes. Diabetes self-management education has been shown to reduce A1Cs by a mean of 0.74%. Despite this, only 5% of the Medicare-eligible population access their education beneit. Medicare patients with diabetes accessing their beneit for the irst time, are allowed nine hours of education the irst year . Our combined class allows patients to prepare and cook these meals with recipes that they can take home. In addition, patients can discuss management of glucose highs and lows, medications, nutrition as well as issues that they might be having that are sometimes unique but most often universal. In the past, diabetes education classes were ofered during clinic hours in the clinic setting. Patients had diiculty arriving at these meetings due to work, etc. This class was designed to meet the request of our patients by ofering the classes in the evening the last Thursday of the month from 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. in the Y awkey Demo Kitchen. Since the program started ive months ago, patients have been receptive to the education program and the team has plans to increase the frequency of the group to further patient engagement around diabetes education.\"When I irst got diagnosed two years ago, I literally was lost. I was nervous and afraid. I was trying to igure out what to do. When my doctor told me that I had to prick myself three times a day, I was doing more than that to igure out where I'm at. This program has taught me to recognize the symptoms and be more active. I continue to come to the classes because I get to meet diferent people that have the same condition as me so that way I don't feel alone dealing with this. I could learn from other people, solving some of their problems but also it helps me to apply it to what I'm doing at home. I think the class is great. They should be doing this more often. It's been very helpful to me.\" \u2014Jose, Diabetes patient top left photo by Yael Bermudez16 Boston Medical Center Nursing Department When Mr . T irst met Megan, his CCM nurse, he felt he was at rock bottom. He had recently experienced a near-fatal opioid overdose. His access to treatment was complicated by homelessness and multiple serious medical problems, including heart failure and diabetes. He was admitted to the hospital on ive occasions followed by long rehabilitation stays. His life experiences had put strain on relationships with his friends and family , and it was diicult to ind support in the community . Despite all these challenges, Mr. T had a clear vision for his needs and his future and agreed to enroll in CCM. After a comprehensive intake with his multidisciplinary team, which includes a Community Health Worker and a Pharmacist, it became clear that Mr. T's biggest goal was achieving permanent housing. Using a strengths-based approach, the CCM team began the journey with Mr. T . He connected with a Housing Specialist and undertook the long process of preparing a viable public housing application. He was able to achieve some early wins, such as obtaining transportation to medical appointments, applying for supplemental security income (SSI) and building understanding of his medical conditions and medication regimen. Over his months in CCM, Mr. T formed an authentic caring relationship with his team. The strength of this relationship with his team sustained their bond through numerous setbacks, including relapses and hospitalizations. Through the ups and downs of the journey , Mr. T never lost sight of his goals. Today , Mr. T lives in his own studio apartment in Boston. He has achieved recovery from his substance use disorder and is focused on giving back to his community by leading recovery groups at BMC. Mr. T's medical conditions remain serious, but he has the tools and supports to manage them and rarely requires hospitalization. He has reconciled with his family and enjoys spending time with his sister and his children. Recently , his CCM nurse has started a conversation about graduation from the program, so the next patient may have the opportunity to begin the CCM journey . Complex Care Management: A Patient Story In March 2018, Boston Medical Center Health System (BMCHS) became part of a Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and began a transformational journey to redesign care delivery and improve health outcomes for some of the state's most vulnerable patients. BMCHS is now two years into the ACO work and has achieved some remarkable outcomes, on both the system and individual level, thanks in large part to the work of an innovative and committed group of nurses. Complex Care registered nurses are the leaders of the multidisciplinary Complex Care Management (CCM) team. Their work is focused on the highest-risk, highest-cost ACO patients, many of whom are living with addiction, mental illness, and homelessness. Complex Care nurses strive to meet patients where they are at and empower patients to achieve their goals, using a nursing framework that is trauma-informed, holistic, and patient- led. In partnership with patients, CCM nurses look beyond the traditional medical model to take on many barriers to wellness. To date, CCM nurses across the state have partnered with hundreds of patients. One of these patients, Mr. T , graciously agreed to share his CCM story .Built on Respect, Powered by Empathy 17 When asked about what CCM has meant to him, Mr. T said, \"it took everybody collectively to get this journey done. Megan and Sonya started off helping because I had so many health problems. I couldn't remember my appointments. They would call a couple of days before my appointment and remind me. They came in and assisted with my medication, if I didn't know how to take it, they would send someone out to come visit me. If it wasn't for this program, I wouldn't know really where I'd be. That's the honest truth. I needed that support. It took a hospital and my family to get me on track because I couldn't do it alone. I've been clean and sober for three years now.\" \"I recommend this program for people because this is what other people will probably need in their life if they have care management. Especially ones who are still out there, sick and suffering, from a drug or disease addiction. They need teams like care management because that would make their process a little bit easier. I'm a prime example. I'm standing strong now. I can stand on my own. I ain't got to hide behind a door. I can come in and out freely in my own apartment. I could go to that bathroom any time I want to, take my medication, my water pill whenever I want to. That's all because of care management and everything, my whole team, my family being supportive. It's beautiful.\"MOVE MOUNTAINSMove Mountains 19 room. Reasons for seeking evaluation in the emergency room included the lack of knowledge of the role of their PCP oice in the management of sick visits and potential emergencies as well as being uninformed of the hours of operation of their PCP oice. Patients also revealed the lack of available appointments and inconvenient appointment times as reasons for seeking care from an emergency department. Delays in the ability to speak with a clinician in order to determine the severity of their symptoms were identiied and considered barriers to obtaining the reassurance patients often needed. This delay resulted in inappropriate use of the emergency room. The LAED team determined that a multi-prong strategy and approach was necessary to reduce the overall LAED visits, and eforts began focusing on Education, Outreach, Access, and Nurse Telephone Triage. Primary care nurses manage an average of more than 2000 calls per month. Not all calls are identiied as triage when routed to the nurse pool, but they all have the potential for triage, which is identiied as symptom-based and time sensitive. \"Telephone triage is an interactive process between a nurse and client that occurs over the telephone and involves identifying the nature and urgency of the client health care needs and determining appropriate disposition\" according to Carol Rutenberg, MSc, RN-BC, C-TNP , a nationally recognized expert on telephone triage and a consultant in this project. Telephone triage relies on nurses' skills at listening, motivational interviewing, critical thinking, pattern recognition, and the use of the nursing process. Nursing protocols are tools used to support this process. Nurse telephone triage was determined to be a vital component of the goal to reduce unnecessary LAED visits. Ambulatory Nurse Leaders, Tami Chase and Sherry Brink, conducted an assessment of the current telephone triage practices through data and manual chart review. This revealed opportunities in operations, technology , and nurse triage practices such as assessments, interventions, use of evidence-based care advice and/or documentation of the call. Compelled by improving our patient's experience, staf nurses across the ambulatory primary care sites committed to setting best practice benchmarks by enhancing the access of nurses over the telephone for callers verbalizing concerns or illness. The patient feedback information helped to deine the duration of time a patient should await a call back from their PCP oice. The Primary Care Staf Nurses deine \"timely access to speak with a nurse\" to be within one hour for a Pediatric focused call and two hours for an Adult focused call also giving the call centers the ability to escalate real time triage as needed. Operational changes were put in place to facilitate return calls in the deined timeframe. All \"symptom-based calls\" were rerouted from the call center to the Nurses in Primary Care. T o facilitate eicient and timely responses, messages sent in the Epic system were streamlined to one pool designated for symptom-based calls and the nurses were given direct access to easily schedule appointments for same day sick visits. These operational changes provided the foundation for the nurses to work more eiciently and set them up for the ability to successfully meet their new benchmarks. In search of a framework to support nurse triage, Lois Howry , Ambulatory Informatics Manager, assisted with identifying an Epic resource, Marnie Woyat. Marnie had previous experience with incorporating Thompson and Baxter's Nurse Protocols into the EHR. A presentation of the project was developed and shared with all concerned parties. In late Fall of 2019, BMC approved a project to purchase the electronic version of the Nurse Telephone protocols and Boston Medical Center's Ambulatory Nurses in the Primary Care locations of Pediatrics, Family Medicine and General Internal Medicine are leading eforts to decrease unnecessary and costly emergency room visits. The organization committed to a multi-prong approach to reduce unnecessary visits by 5% in 2020. The Primary Care Nurses are helping to achieve this goal by providing patients with timely access to clinical advice through improved telephone triage systems. Using evidenced-based telephone protocols, nurses are supporting our patients by triaging all symptom- based calls in order to determine the most appropriate level of care in a timely manner. As part of the Boston Accountable Care Organization (BACO), Boston Medical Center is focusing eforts on the quality- of-care delivery while reducing health care costs. An interdisciplinary team was formed to conduct a comprehensive review of the data and current services ofered to patients of BMC. After evaluating the Emergency Room usage claims data for 2018-2019, a subset of emergency room visit diagnoses was identiied as being diagnoses manageable in Primary Care and Urgent Care locations. These visits were further deined and named as, \"Low Acuity\" (LAED) diagnoses. Further evaluation showed ten diagnoses, such as upper respiratory infection, sore throat, headaches, conjunctivitis, rash, musculoskeletal, low back pain, gastroenteritis, and urinary tract infections that made up 83% of all LAED visits. In late 2018, the Primary Care Nurses conducted routine emergency room visit follow up calls and obtained additional visit information from our patients in order to understand the patient's perspective and identify any unmet needs. Information obtained from our patients revealed common trends. Most patients did not call their Primary Care Provider (PCP) prior to seeking services in the emergency BMC Primary Care Nurses Aim to Reduce Low Acuity Emergency Room Visits photos by Ed Collier & Yael Bermudez20 Boston Medical Center Nursing Departmentintegrate them into the Epic system further supporting the evidenced-based practice of Nurse Telephone triage. When the project is completed, electronic protocols will be used as checklists to support the nurses' critical thinking and determine the most appropriate level of care for patients. The triage protocols will improve the standards of care that includes documentation in real time, prevention of reworking and decrease the chance of overlooking important information, essential documentation, assessment, diagnosis, collaborative planning, intervention, evaluation, and clear documentation of pertinent negatives. These protocols will facilitate the use of evidenced-based practice for home care recommendations, optimal documentation and use of dispositions to capture data and measure outcomes. To date, much of this information has not been retrievable. Nurse Telephone triage dashboards will be built for the tracking of data in the system, practice and individual nurse level. The dashboard will provide the nurses with the ability to select and prioritize calls and tasks as well as the ability to quantify work for future staing models. The protocols will support nurses by providing a framework for Nurse Telephone Triage thus supporting our patients' needs. Preliminary data indicates that our eforts made an impact in reducing LAED visits using interventions focused on Outreach, Access and Nurse Telephone Triage. Total ED visit data is dependent upon claims data and lags at least three months behind. Based on triage call data collected in the irst quarter of the following year on calls made Monday through Thursday between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine has a median call back time of 52 minutes, Family Medicine 3 hours and 32 minutes, and General Internal Medicine 5 hours and 26 minutes. Factors inluencing achievement of the timely access measure may include call volume, acuity mix of calls, and staing capacity . Primary Care Staf Nurses at Boston Medical Center are making improvements in Nurse Telephone triage to help reduce the use of the emergency room for low acuity diagnoses manageable in Primary Care clinics and urgent care locations. The Ambulatory staf nurses have set benchmarks to deliver timely nurse triage for all symptom-based calls and assist patients in determining the most appropriate level of care based on their symptoms. With the adoption of industry standard protocols and the implementation of integrating these computer-based protocols, nurses will have an evidenced- based framework to eiciently triage and document appropriately . Data will be available to help measure this nursing practice. Nurse Telephone triage is one intervention of a bundled approach to reducing unnecessary emergency room visits thereby reducing the total cost of care. Nurses across ambulatory primary care demonstrate leadership, collaboration, teamwork and the commitment to improving patient experiences and outcomes in alignment with the overall mission of Boston Medical Center. photo by Yael BermudezMove Mountains 21Boston Medical Center's Emergency Department is ranked the 8th busiest emergency room in the United States with 139,577 annual visits in 2019, according to Becker's Hospital Review. Operating and caring for patients in such a busy environment, while undergoing continual construction phases, requires having the right team, a spirit of innovation, collaborative skills to create eiciencies with our peers in practically all areas of the hospital, and most importantly , the concern to provide the highest level of quality care without exception. Here are a few highlights: Throughput and Eficiencies While annual visits have increased at BMC, so has the number and length of stay of patients with an inpatient admission status\u2014 patients who stay in the ED for extended periods of time (greater than 2 hours). When patients stay in the ED for long periods of time, it creates concern on the impact of the quality of care being treated within the care areas, as well as for those waiting to be brought back to an available space for evaluation and treatment. Thus, the ED team continually works to assure that patients are seen by a provider in a timely manner as possible. \"Reducing the time patients remain in the Emergency Department can improve access to treatment and increase quality of care\" (Pierce & Gormley , JEN, November 2016, (42)6). Emergency Department: Quality Care, Throughput and Eficiencies Consequently , the ED team has been able to successfully manage the high volume of patients who arrive to the BMC ED through several diferent strategies. The team utilizes concepts in creating and utilizing vertical treatment spaces, results pending areas\u2014 maximizing every space within the ED. Vertical treatment spaces require the identiication of patients who can be assessed and treated in alternative spaces that do not require a stretcher or bed. This may be patients who are in hallways or waiting rooms who may have been assessed and had their care started and inished while sitting in a chair. Results pending areas are areas within the ED such as the Adult ED and Fast Track. This strategy is employed by the team on patients who may initially need a more private area for assessment and initial treatment, but then complete their care and wait in an area in a chair, freeing up a bed for the next patient. Patients in results pending areas may be waiting for lab results to return or may be waiting to have an X-ray completed and reviewed. These patients have typically been identiied as those who will be discharged to home. These tactics all aim at having the ability to have treatment space for our sickest patients who require a stretcher or bed.Quality of Care In the past ive years, the BMC HazMat T eam has grown from a single digit team of willing participants to the largest HazMat response team within the Boston city hospitals. Presently comprised of 64 members from all disciplines\u2014RNs, MDs, Unit Coordinators, Public Safety Oicers, T echs, all have completed an 8-hour of site annual training. It was decided over a year ago that working with our own equipment within our own space is the best way to build muscle memory and empower our team. With the generous collaboration of BMC's Emergency Management Leadership, this is exactly what has happened. This collaboration has provided extensive education and training for our team which will soon include monthly education and training. Also, the collaboration has formed a group of super users that will oversee and lead the team. Almost all our Hazmat team members are part of the BMC ED Staf. Our Super Users have participated in a weeklong national training with other HazMat teams from across the country and are crossed train to work with, and on our Special Pathogens Unit. A paging system with active members has been established and we now have a team that is conident and competent to handle a hazardous incident\u2014a long way from willing participants to conident team members!22 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentA New Organizational Model for Patient Flow The Of-Shift Nursing Management (OSNM) team is a dynamic group of nurse leaders who are responsible for nursing operations in the of-shift and as well as the shared responsibility of driving patient placement. 2019 presented many exciting opportunities for the Of-Shift Nurse Manager team to adopt new practices and align themselves with the needs of the organization post campus consolidation. Not only did the team grow in size with the introduction of new team members over the last year, but the evolving needs of the organization ultimately widened the scope of the role. There was a concentrated efort and commitment to each other to cross train team members to both the traditional nursing supervisor aspects of the role as well as in the bed control aspects. This created a more lexible and dynamic team that was able to provide extended evening bed control coverage to drive patient placement through the Emergency department and the Integrated Procedural Platform while facilitating transfers of patients requiring tertiary level of care from the community . This allowed other members of the team to focus their time and energy on supporting the bedside nurses and patients through rounding on the units, assessing clinical and staing needs, and partnering with charge nurses to employ problem solving strategies. The team spent much of the year redesigning their core worklows and implementing new technologies to drive their work. Together they implemented standard work including daily multidisciplinary bed huddles, a standardized hand of process, and standardized rounding. The team also adopted the use of Epic's Transfer Center Module to allow for electronic documentation and tracking of direct admissions and transfers from outside facilities, a process that up until last year remained on paper. They became accustomed to analyzing real-time supply and demand data and other operational metrics using newly installed electronic capacity management dashboards. Together, with the newly formed Central Flow Unit and the admitting team, the of- shift nurse managers executed standardized algorithms to drive patient placement for more than 25,000 inpatient admissions in 2019. This work also laid the foundation for the evolving care team regionalization initiatives. Partnering with physician and nursing leadership, the OSNM team drives patient placement of surgical patients to the extended stay PACU program as well as observation patients to the D- pod program. These programs have increased BMC's capacity and ability to admit patients by 16 additional beds. The new team model has enhanced collaboration and teamwork, streamlined the work to reduce ineiciencies and duplications, and merged the clinical and operational needs of the organization so that each patient is receiving the right care, at the right time, in the right bed. The standardization of their work coupled with the updates to the electronic health record has empowered the OSNM to make better informed decisions and more accurate throughput and capacity projections. Move Mountains 23Saving a Co-Worker's Life There have been several highly acute patient care scenarios where inte rdisciplinary staf support \"moved mountains\" with rapid transfer or conversion of cases from strict ly surgical or procedural to a combined procedure to give patients the best chance of having a positive outcome. Nurses in both areas have commented that they are supported by knowing that \" help is never far\" and they can simply look to the right or left for skilled help whenev er necessary . Little did we know that the irst real test would be a race to save the life of one of our own. Not long after the inauguration of the new IPP , a staf member's life was saved due to th e quick thinking and cooperation of her IPP teammates. It was around 7:15 on a Thursday morning in January . Andrea knew she wasn't feeling well but thought she could get through her scheduled 8-hour shift in the operating room . After huddle, she went into the locker room and started to feel weak, diaphoretic and h ad some vague chest pain. One of the night surgical techs saw her and approached t he nurse manager at the desk. A group of staf went to the locker room and knew she needed t o get to the emergency room quickly . Her colleagues pushed her by wheelchair to the emergency room and the ED nur se manager and trauma team greeted them. By this time, Andrea couldn't feel he r left side and her left leg was mottled. She was now in the trauma bay surrounded by physicia ns and nurses and there was a lot of urgency . Her colleagues knew she was in great hands so they went back to the OR to st art the day . They received a call within minutes from surgery asking to get the hybrid room re ady for a repair of an aortic dissection and possible fasciotomy of left leg. It was their colleag ue who was ighting for her life! Andrea was in the OR at 9:05 with the cardiac and vascular team. The general sur gery team scrubbed in later to assist as well. She remained in surgery until 6:49 pm. It was a tough day for all the staf. Knowing the severity of Andrea's condition, the team remained calm under tremendous pressure. Andrea was transferred directly to the SICU wh ere she remained for several weeks. She received dialysis and she said that the nurs es and staf were kind and caring during a very challenging time. She felt supported. The journey was far from over, she had several more IR procedures and returned to the operating room. The IPP teams received her with a smile. She was progressin g well and was ready for Spaulding rehab to gain her strength and learn how to walk again. Unfortunately , she was transferred back to BMC for a r/o DVT after having pain an d vomiting. She was again cared for the step-down unit where she received exce ptional care and was discharged back to Spaulding. Andrea remained there until mid-February and was discharged home. The team is happy to report that Andrea is working full-time in the operating room. Colleagues spoke often about that day\u2014the day when many units at BMC worked together to save the life of one of their own. Integrated Procedural Platform When the decision was made to merge the two hospital campus surgical suites as well as combine the integrated procedural areas such as interventional radiology , neuro interventional radiology , and cardiac cath lab into one Integrated Procedural Platform (IPP), it was not known how mutually beneicial it would turn out to be for patients and IPP team members. Patients receiving care in this new Integrated Procedural Platform begin and end their experience by being cared for by the skilled and dedicated nurses of the pre- operative holding room and post anesthesia care unit. These nurses have worked hard to make each patient feel well taken care of before their procedures, which now take place on the same loor and in the same IPP space. Nurses in each area can reach out to each other for aid, education, or peer support whenever needed. The development over the last few years of High-Performance Teams has seen a wonderful opportunity for all staf- nurses, surgical technicians, anesthesia staf, and surgeons to form collaborative and productive teams and produce changes related to patient safety , operating room eiciency , and knowledge sharing between specialties. The cardiac and vascular teams have spent considerable time working in our new hybrid room perfecting how to treat patients requiring both surgical and endovascular interventions. Medical diagnoses which once required massive operations can now be addressed through the use of specialized radiographic technology and small vascular puncture sites. The nurses working in these areas have built a solid relationship with their counterparts working in interventional radiology to care for these patients successfully . The close exposure of these units has also given nurses insight into the work of their peers in other specialty areas and a new understanding for the capabilities of BMC in caring for our patients. Nursing Professional Development Fellows In 2019, in response to the feedback of some of our most experienced nurses, Boston Medical Center created an innovative nursing professional development (NPD) fellowship program to assist new graduate nurses transitioning into practice. Th is program paved the way for four grant-funded fellowships\u2014two in critical care and two in medical-surgical services, working with new graduates for six months on nig hts (where most new grads were working.) Nursing Professional Development Fellows are the bridge between new nurses and the complexities of healthcare systems. They promote organizational standards, c ultivate critical thinking skills, provide education and conduct in-services and audits when procedures and changes are rolled out at the hospital, review policies and provide sta f with various support. \"During rounds, it's not unusual for a fellow to be seen assisting a nurse with a central line, ofering support with Epic documentation during a rapid response or guiding a new nurse with a blood transfusion. Finding policies on the HUB can pose various challenges, therefore, we teach nurses how to access and save pol icies, even to troubleshoot Epic,\" said Celia Hill, Nursing Professional Development Fellow. Why was this program developed? With the impending nursing shortage, more new graduate nurses have been transitioning into practice, especially in specialized areas as critical care. T he Institute of Medicine in its landmark paper The Future of Nursing emphasized that patients' needs and care environments have become more complex. Nurses need to attain competencies to deliver high quality care. The literature also states that n ew graduate nurses are thrust into roles that they maybe inadequately prepared for. A skill that typically needs to be developed in new graduates is that of critical thinking. Well known educator Christine Tanner\u2014coined the phrase \"think like a nurse\", but h ow do we foster more critical thinking/ judgement in new graduates and continue this journey of critical thinking. Senior nursing staf expressed a strong desire for the continuation of the program. NPD fellows, Jo Foley , Corey Leaver, Joanne Rosato, Krisztina Nichols, Celia Hill, a nd Maureen McCarthy expressed that \"one of the best things about this job is working with such great staf.\" The role of the NPD Fellow and other creative supportive roles will continue to be essential to the hospital. They ensure consistency and progress on night sh ifts\u2014 addressing new nurses' transition into practice, providing education support and promoting critical thinking that ultimately impacts patient outcomes. Together with staf, they promote BMC's mission and create a healthy environment for new n urses and staf to thrive and develop into excellent caregivers. NURSING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACTAfter six months, the NPDs have made a signiicant impact on new graduates and nursing staff. They surveyed staff and found fellows to be: \"VERY ACCESSIBLE, AVAILABLE AND APPROACHABLE\" \"A VALUABLE ADDITION TO THE NURSING WORKFORCE\" \"EVERY DAY, YOU COME HERE, AND I LEARN SOMETHING NEW.\" THEY ASK, \"DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING NEW FOR ME TODAY?\" OR \"I'VE BEEN WAITING TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION...\"Move Mountains 25Critical Care Resource Nurses Implements Early Warning System (EWS) Tool The Critical Care Resource Nurses (CCRN) is an established clinical team at BMC. They are comprised of nurses with strong critical care ICU backgrounds and work closely with staf nurses and physician teams throughout the hospital. Critical Care Resource Nurses prevent failure to rescue, and support patients requiring ICU level of care outside the critical care area. In 2019, the CCRN team collaborating with the Quality Improvement group developed an Early W arning System (EWS) predictive tool. EWS uses speciic parameters documen ted by the team to monitor changes in a patient's condition and trigger if certain cr iteria are met. Failure to act and evaluate these changes can lead to diminished patient out comes, and these triggers allowed the CCRN to respond quickly to these changes. Using this tool, an EWS response team, consisting of a certiied nursing assistant, the patient's primary nurse, CCRN, and physician, will assess, review and develop a comprehensive plan to support the patient. Once the plan of care is developed, the CC RN uses a note template developed by their team in response to the EWS score of 6 or high er, triggering the best practice alert (BPA) so that team members are ale rted to changes in the patient condition. The note also documents the treatment plan. Implementation of EWS has improved recognition and response to non-ICU patients who are deteriorating. Due to the teamwork, the CCRN team and the physician teams w ere able to decrease morality by almost 50% in one year \u2014a signiicant achievement in impro ving patient outcomes.Improving Patient Safety by Implementation of Human Milk Bar Code Scanning Human milk is an important option for babies who are unable to breastfeed. It is associated with improved outcomes for some infants. Human milk is routinely administered by clinical nurses in mother baby units at Boston Medical Center. This includes the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), maternity and pediatrics units. Documentation of administration was a manual worklow with two nurses reading the medical record number and name on the human milk label. This posed an increased risk for human error during administration and the potential for infants to receive the wrong human milk which could impact the child's potential exposure to maternal bacteria and viruses as well as maternal medications. In September and October of 2018, there was one administration error and several near misses. As a result, a nurse committee was formed to review literature of human milk administration standards and best practices. National safety and industry standards recommend utilization of a barcode scanning process when human milk is collected, stored and administered in a patient care setting. Staf nurses identiied several key points during human milk administration and presented to nursing senior leadership for approval. A multidisciplinary group of nurses and IT analysts met weekly to identify the current worklow and transition into a new electronic worklow . From January to May of 2019, the work group met weekly to review all aspects of the proposed worklow and make decisions about the process. Testing was done to validate the proposed scanning process and training was conducted via eLearning. Initial support was provided by IT and nursing superusers for each unit for one week and thereafter, was transitioned to the nursing superusers who were resources to their colleagues. After implementation of this worklow change, nurse human milk scanning compliance has consistently been over 98 %. Anecdotally , nurse feedback has been positive, and staf feel the transition to scanning patients and human milk has improved patient safety . Control Intervention Group Group Time to resuscitative effort 1.69 hrs 1.22 hrs Difference in mean = 28 min ; p<0.0001 Time to ICU Transfer 9.82 hrs 7.99 hrs Difference in mean = 110 min ; p=0.0034 Length of stay; mean 14.1 days 11.59 days Difference in mean = -2.53 days ; p=0.0015 Mortality 14.5% 8.61% OR 0.73 (0.57 0.94); p < 0.000126 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentNursing Supports for Prenatal Patients with Substance Use Disorder Each year, BMC's RESPECT (Recovery , Empowerment, Social Services, Prenatal Care, Education, Community and Treatment) Program cares for over 120 women who are struggling with addiction in pregnancy . This unique interdisciplinary team works closely to tailor to the individual needs of each patient in a shared decision- making model. Clinical nurses create a caring culture of non-judgment and compassion that informs every aspect of nursing practice. Patients struggling with addiction are often met with stigma, however the RESPECT team has worked vigorously to break down barriers to earn the trust of their patients and the reputation of a safe space for all women no matter where they are in their journey to recovery . The RESPECT program core values are a steadfast parallel to that of Boston Medical Center by practicing empathy , innovation, advocacy and compassion for our most vulnerable patients every day . Nursing care from the prenatal period through post-delivery is framed around a philosophy which respects, supports and empowers mothers while considering the safety of their babies. Upon irst contact with pregnant patients experiencing a substance use disorder (SUD), nurses provide information about the program, and collaborate with these patients throughout pregnancy to support recovery eforts and promote both the expectant mother and growing baby's emotional and physical well- being in a non-judgmental manner. BMC nurses take the journey with the patient; establishing care contracts as an agreement by the patient to hold themselves accountable, empowers a therapeutic relationship while supporting and collaborating with the patient to provide a safe environment from antepartum to post-delivery . The nurses work with the mother and partner or family to provide a very unique type of care which places the mother as healer. The nurses focus support on keeping the infant with the mother and/or partner as much as possible to provide the much needed non-pharmaceutical treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms. The nurses teach the mother how to calm and soothe her baby , how to feed her baby and most importantly , the nurses practice with an authentic presence of caring. This year, nursing supports were implemented to bridge the often complex care management of patients transitioning from inpatient to outpatient services. This unique entity ofers immediate support to women during the period of highest risk of relapse yet often where they ind the most motivation to begin and continue recovery . Our nurses frequently meet with delivering moms during their hospital stay to proactively ensure they have stable housing, proper medication regimen, appointments and support services such as social work and psychiatry already aligned for the very next day , post-discharge. This process allows for patients to foster a trusting relationship with the care team even before their irst outpatient visit and diminishes many of the anticipated risks of relapse. The team is able to ofer a myriad of treatment options including Subutex, Vivitrol and outside methadone clinic coordination depending on the needs of the patient. Nursing works closely with moms who are involved with DCF to support their recovery by creating a unique summary for the patient which represents a detailed account of their relapse prevention eforts, making DCF involvement less scary and better understood. Routinely , patients attend clinic visits up until approximately 6 weeks postpartum, however the RESPECT team is well equipped to support patients for six months and beyond. Keri-Lyn Schob, the newest nursing member of the team recalls a recent event informing a patient of a positive urine screen, \"I explained to the patient that this is not punitive and that I needed to know that she was safe, and that I am here to support her. This is the core of nursing, the reason that we do what we do.\" Keri's oice can often be found cluttered with thank you cards, many exclaiming moving sentiments such as \"Thank you for believing in me.\" Move Mountains 27Frontline Staff Moving Mountains through the Nursing Informatics Council The Nursing Informatics Council (NIC) and its forty plus clinical nurses are Moving Mountains by collaborating with other disciplines to improve information technology (IT) tools and nursing informatics worklows. This committee has representatives from all clinical areas including inpatient, critical care, emergency department, perioperative and procedural areas. There is also an ambulatory subcommittee that focuses on the unique worklows of the outpatient clinics. The council meets monthly to review current and proposed IT nursing processes, to identify areas for improvement and to ofer solutions to solve issues reported by their colleagues. The staf council is supported by nursing informatics specialists, trainers and analysts providing guidance and helping to drive decisions. In the afternoon, there are specialty breakout sessions where the inpatient, perioperative/procedural, emergency room, perinatal and ambulatory areas gather separately and focus on their speciic needs. During these sessions, council members provide feedback and approve content for the monthly Epic newsletters. They assist in the on-going process to create and revise tip sheets. Members are then charged to utilize these tools to communicate system changes, worklow improvements and best practices to their peers. The Nursing Informatics Council encourages nurse leaders from all areas to attend a meeting to review worklows that need improvement. Quality improvement tools are used to guide changes and support activation plans. Physicians, ancillary leaders, and quality and compliance specialists have all attended NIC to obtain clinical nurses' feedback on their proposed system or worklow changes when there is an impact to nursing practice. This type of collaboration is critical to implementing on- line tools that have the voice of the clinical nurse as a key driver for change. Here are several examples of the work that the council helped drive in 2019: A safer way to administer blood Improved documentation tool focused in reducing CAUTI rates Revisions to the After Visit Summary (AVS) Retooling the inluenza screening process Implementation of bar-coding scanning for milk products and surgical implements Activating the Avatar to drive LDA improvements Execution of therapy plans for reoccurring medication delivered in the ambulatory clinics NIC ofers a forum for front line staf to make a diference and act as a change agent. Their involvement positively inluences the overall acceptance of new features and tools. They are super users. They participate in pilots where they evaluate new features, approve changes, participate in end user acceptance testing and contribute to creating training materials. During implementations, members provide At-the-Elbow (ATE) support to others to assist with adoption of new Epic tools. Council members also lead classroom training for new hires. Having a colleague train a new nurse on how to use Epic in their practice with real life examples is a tremendous beneit. Members share that they enjoy \"having a voice in practice\", \"representing their peers\" and \"being the key communicator of needs and changes\". They work hard to be experts in the online systems, \"break down silos\", and appreciate that they \"have the voice of the clinical nurse in all the decisions\". When surveyed to ask why they value being a member of NIC here is what they shared: \"I like being asked my opinion and feel I can give feedback on proposed items to ensure changes relect current practices. My feedback matters.\" \"Participating in the council has improved my overall knowledge of Epic so I can be an expert user for my co-workers.\" \"I enjoy sharing what I have learned in NIC with my peers.\" \"I get the 'why' behind what changes are happening.\" Members of the Nursing Informatics Council presented details about the council, its charge and its accomplishments at national and local conferences in both poster and formal presentations. Members have also contributed to quality projects that were highlighted in poster presentations at Epic's annual user group, the Institute of Healthcare Improvement annual conference and during BMC's Quality Week. In its ifth year , NIC continues to drive system and worklow improvements by engaging clinical nurses to impact overall eiciency and adoption. Staf reported that \"I feel empowered by being a member of NIC and the collective energy at the monthly meeting relects everyone's drive to improve Epic and improve patient care.\" NIC members are a priceless resource for their peers when it comes to all things IT .New Advanced Practice Provider Council at Boston Medical Center! It's an exciting time at Boston Medical Center for Advanced Practice Providers (APPs). The newly created APP Council will help promote, develop and support APPs including Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) and Physician Assistants (PA) wh o work at BMC. This Council was modeled after advanced practice councils across the nation at major academic medical centers. The Council will function as a centralized resour ce for systems of care, scope of practice and programs related to APP practice. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses such as Nurse Practitioners, Certiied Re gistered Nurse Anesthetists, Certiied Nurse Midwives, Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specia lists as well as Physician Assistants are represented on the APP Council. The Council's dynamic and diverse members allow a full perspective of APP prac tice across all departments, divisions and services at Boston Medical Center. The APP Council will advise Boston Medical Center and Boston University Medical Group senior leaders on matters pertaining to systems of care, scope of practice, an d campus-wide resources and programs. The APP Council will report to Boston Medical Center's Chief Oicer , William Creevy , MD , MS. The Council will also have ex-oicio members who will provide a broad view of patient care, education and research perspectives across the medical campus. Th ese members are BMC Associate Education Jef Schneider , MD; Boston University P A Program Director designee Angela Refell P A-C and Boston Unive rsity School of Medicine Associate Dean of Faculty Afairs, Hee-Y oung Park, MD . APP Council members meet monthly to discuss and deliberate action items.

There are currently over 35 members from inpatient and outpatient clinical nurs ing that have met monthly since April 2019 utilizing a shared governance model that empo wers clinical nurses to share, learn, and lead. The nurses on the SUD Council have brought forward challenges that are faced in the clinical environment, ranging from disruptive patient behaviors, lack of specialty knowle dge, moral and ethical dilemmas, and the confrontation of stigma. They have worked with BMC's Legal Department to develop the inpatient absenc e agreement, a document that is reviewed with newly admitted patients to encourag e harm reduction and participation in their care during hospitalization. Nurses want to establish a trusting relationship with patients while simultaneously encouraging safety a nd autonomy , and the inpatient absence agreement was created by the council with feedback fr om colleagues in mind. They have also created an online SUD educational resource on the Nursing websit e. Council members have taken on the role as clinical leaders during their shifts to assess the needs of their patients, colleagues, and BMC community . Each month the voice of the nurse is shared and heard and used to inform the direction of the work to ensure progress in what reall y matters. Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders (NICHE) Council Update The implementation of the NICHE program has been well received and supported at BMC. In 2017, the organization supported the development of a NICHE leadership team, which consists of physicians, nurse leadership and inpatient staf nurses. That group has met or exceeded most of the goals set one year ago, with continued work in those goals. The NICHE staf nurses have embraced the opportunity to advance their practice. Many nurses, including the charge nurse and the nurse manager on 6 West have become Geriatric Resources Nurses (GRN) over the few years. Throughout the organization, there have been several more staf nurses who have advanced their practice by becoming GRNs. In support of the continued commitment to NICHE, a conference was hosted by the NICHE committee. The conference titled \"State of the Science in Geriatric Nursing\" was a day-long professional development conference held on September 12, 2019. Sessions throughout the day focused on the four M's of evidence-based geriatric care (mobility , mentation, medications, and what matters). Guest speakers Pat Noga VP of the Massachusetts Hospital Association and Arlene Stoller from the NICHE organization provided cutting edge information on the new dementia guidelines for nursing care and the importance of having the discussion with patients to determine what matters most to them. BMC is so proud of the work done by all of our NICHE experts. 30 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentIntegrative Nursing Council, Focus and Deliveries \"Integrative nursing is a framework for providing whole person/whole system care that is relationship-based and person- centered and focuses on improving the health and wellbeing of caregivers as well as those they serve.\" -Mary Jo Kreitzer, Ph.D., R.N., F .A.A.N. Integrative nursing deals with the mind, body , and spirit. Some of the integrative therapies are: meditation, music, guided imagery , yoga, aromatherapy , deep breathing exercises, resiliency , pet therapy , care channel, caring touches and prayers. All these play a major role in calming and comforting patients and staf. It's all about a healing and caring relationship. At BMC, we have an Integrative Nursing council, comprised of nursing staf from diferent departments. They meet the irst Thursday of each month. The goal is to provide education and to empower patients as well as staf with the use of evidence- based practices. Initially , the Council developed a quarterly newsletter about what we do at BMC. Over time, they have progressed to having their own integrative website which was launched in January 2020. Now staf can view short video clips on deep breathing exercises, watch instructional yoga videos, as well as read articles about self-care and recipes. Also, Reiki requests are now available on the HUB and ongoing Reiki classes up to Level 3 are now available to all staf. Last year, integrative nursing notes, aromatherapy , and reiki policies were established. Today , BMC is approved for essential oils like ginger, peppermint, lavender, mandarin, black pepper, frankincense, Bergamot and clary sage. These essential oils were carefully selected to guarantee patient and environmental safety . Aromatherapy has recorded a huge success in the PACU. They hope to extend services to the mother baby units and other departments as soon as possible. Last year's conference at Lombardo's in Randolph, MA was something to write home about because of the topic of the event: \"Empower, Innovate, and Cultivate\u2014 Change Starts with Y ou\", and with Rebecca Love as the keynote speaker. The topic of the conference was so captivating with deep professional implications that it attracted many attendees beyond BMC staf. This year, the 10th Annual Integrative Nursing conference is scheduled to take place on May 8th, 2020 with an exciting topic\u2014\"Expressions of Joy\" with Nataly Kogen as the keynote speaker.The council serves as a professional development opportunity platform for nurses at BMC. Their interests grow every day because this platform is innovative, exposing us to deeper knowledge of our professional concerns. The Council hopes to have more outside nurses and clinicians, vendors and staf to be able to reach a greater number of participants for this program. In conclusion, the noble goal of this council could best be understood in the words of Florence Nightingale, often referred to as the founder of modern nursing, when she stated that \"The role of the nurse was to put the patient in the best possible condition so that nature could act and healing occur.\" Many Faces Create our Greatness 31 CREATE OURMANY FACES GREATNESS32 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentThere are many diferent programs at BMC, that the care managers are involved with to assist with their discharge planning. One of the programs the care managers have been involved in is the decanter program. This program was created to help transition patients from the hospital to an appropriate post-acute care setting. The care managers assess the patient's clinical needs and insurance coverage. Many patients at BMC are uninsured or underinsured. These patients are apt not to be discharged to a post-acute facility due to lack of insurance. The care manager will identify these patients and discuss with the interdisciplinary team the level of care the patient requires post- discharge. They will identify the needs of the patient, such as physical therapy/ occupational therapy needs, long term IV antibiotics, wound care, family teaching, etc. Social support is also identiied if it is a barrier to care progression or discharge. The three areas the decanter program ofers are short-term rehabilitation, long-term care and hospice services. Another aspect of care management that people may not be aware of is the general inpatient hospice (GIP) program. Nurse care managers can suggest to the physicians and nursing staf that if a patient is imminently dying and too sick to be moved, patients can be converted to general inpatient hospice status for comfort measures. Care management ofers the patient and family the beneits of hospice care while here at the hospital. Families also receive up to 13 months of bereavement support. Established in 2018, the Guardianship Program continues to thrive. This program was developed by a multi-disciplinary group of departmental stakeholders, legal afairs, business strategy , social work, care management, psychiatry and hospital service. They found that using outside counsel and establishing a guardianship oversight group to regularly review the status of patients admitted longer than the hospital's average length of stay was key to the program's success. As one social worker states, \"there has been major stress and time lifted of the family . Also, the guardianship process has moved exponentially faster and therefore fewer internal meetings reviewing alternative discharge planning options (even if there were no alternatives).\"In 2019, Care Management established high-risk meetings with legal afairs, patient advocacy , social work, care manager, business strategy , patient inance and appropriate hospital services for high-risk patients with the goal to identify patients \"stuck \"in the hospital (or at risk) who do not require hospital level of care and be able to intervene as soon as possible. The group discusses and reviews barriers/needs, develops interventions to support a safe discharge, and assist care managers and social workers with planning for the most diicult dispositions. They also mobilize additional resources as appropriate. Overall, having these high-risk meetings with a multidisciplinary group has been beneicial to the organization to creatively problem solve and identify worklows or resources to help patients. Other niche programs have been established with care management leadership including: The 4E triad: Nurse managers, nurses, physician and care management leadership conduct meetings with the strategy team to work on unit speciic initiatives with the goal to decrease length of stay and improve the patient experience by setting expectations related to joint replacement surgery . Multi-D collaboration: The pre-procedure team, care management, nursing, surgeons, rehabilitation services and strategy work to operationalize target discharge dates and ensure consistent and accurate information is provided for patients along the continuum of care. Early results showed 16 bed days were saved by the intervention. \"I think patients are better prepared for their surgery and have a better understanding of what to expect post-op after meeting with Sheryl. It helps tremendously when identifying post-hospital resources needed when it is discussed pre-op. I also think the anticipated discharge date helps everyone on the team speaking and thinking the same. The collaboration between pre-and post-op managers has been amazing!\" said care manager Maryellen Doucette. These programs have helped bring change to the hospital's overall length of stay and assisted the care manager and the rest of the healthcare to a discharge plan.Hospital management is no longer about utilization review and discharge planning. Hospital care managers are now expected to align their practice activities with medical staf practice, inluence clinical costs associated with practice variations, and overcome obstacles to progression-of-care. They promote coordination of care among various caregivers, assimilate more information about economic factors, proactively advocate on behalf of the patient, facilitate seamless hand- ofs to community resources and understand the impact of political trends on funding. In very practical terms, it's a patient-centered approach to working with physicians and the clinical team to ensure the patient gets the right treatment, in the right place at the right time. The care manager follows a speciic number of patients and performs an initial and on-going case management assessment to determine care coordination and discharge planning needs, based on the patient's condition and presentation. The team's utilization review responsibilities include evaluation of all cases within 24 hours of admission to facilitate care coordination and discharge planning and to determine if social work intervention is required. She/ he applies standardized approved criteria for medical necessity . There is too an on-going concurrent daily medical record review to measure patient progress against anticipated discharge, level of care and length of stay . They ensure that the patient receives the appropriate services and has an appropriate length of stay , as well as assist with obtaining the approval from the insurance provider. Discharge planning starts on the day of admission. The care manager collaborates with the clinical team and medical providers team to initiate the anticipated discharge plan. The care manager facilitates communication within the healthcare team to coordinate the patient's anticipated discharge plan of care. She/he acts as the patient advocate by negotiating for, and coordinating resources with the payer, agency and vendor systems to expedite care and avoid care delay days and denials of payment. The Complex Roles of the Care Management TeamMany Faces Create our Greatness 33Periop 101 In 2016, the operating rooms (OR) at Boston Medical Center (BMC) were heavily dependent on travel nurses with as many as 17 travelers in one of our OR suites at one time. While travel staf are clinically skilled, levels of expertise vary tremendously , and the limited contract time creates high turnover. High staf turnover creates challenges on several levels including nurse educator time (and other facility resources) for onboarding and orientation of each new traveler, constant precepting by the rest of the staf, and most importantly , inconsistencies in the team dynamics during surgery . The OR is a highly technical and complicated practice setting requiring a comprehensive, extensive, and expensive orientation while the mean age of OR nurses nationally is continually edging toward the age of retirement. This has created a shortage of experienced OR nurses responding to our recruitment eforts. T o meet our staing needs and limit our dependence on travelers, BMC has created an innovative collaborative relationship with a local school of nursing for experienced nurses who want to work in the OR. The BMC OR nurse educator developed a program with the college to train nurses to work in the OR using the evidence- based Association of periOperative Nurses' (AORN's) Periop 101 Program in conjunction with other resources. The didactic classroom preparation is completed at the school of nursing, skills labs are done in the Simulation Lab at BMC, and then the registered nurse interns are placed in the OR at BMC or other local hospitals for a precepted clinical experience. This clinical experience allows the nurse intern to learn hands-on clinical skills from an experienced OR nurse while the OR team interacts with the nurse intern evaluating their learning and potential it with their team. BMC has conducted two internal transition programs ofering this training paid for by BMC. Interested BMC nurses applied, were interviewed, and ofered an opportunity to shadow for a day in the OR to assure the desire to work in this setting. A total of nine internal transition nurses have been trained in this manner through the program. In addition to those internally transferred, the OR has hired 14 additional new OR nurses from this program for a total of 23 new OR nurses. This program has been a huge success on multiple levels, providing an avenue for BMC and other Massachusetts nurses to build a foundation of perioperative knowledge and skills enabling them to apply for OR jobs, many of whom have been hired directly into their clinical site, and from our own standpoint, building our OR team with hand selected and home grown (trained) OR nurses. We have retained 19 of these nurses to date, decreasing our dependence on traveler OR RNs signiicantly . T oday we have only four nurse travelers across both OR settings. photo by Donna Amado34 Boston Medical Center Nursing Department Medical/Surgical Charge Nurse Development Program The charge nurse, a clinical nurse leadership position, is the natural role for succession to the nurse manager position. BMC nursing leadership believed that a succession plan should focus on improving communication and developing leadership skills in order for charge nurses to successfully assume the nurse manager role. Charge nurses are involved in decisions that afect patients and the unit; and have an enormous impact on whether an organization meet its goals. As demands for quality outcomes increased, a commitment to decreasing patient harm was adopted; the realization of empowering the charge nurses was recognized as a viable option to provide bench strength to the nurse manager ranks. As future nurse managers, the complexities in healthcare required more than an expert clinician; it involves understanding the importance of communication and leadership. The succession planning program was comprised of a pre-assessment, followed by three workshops to improve knowledge in professionalism, communication and leading teams, and the business of healthcare. The program concluded with a post-assessment. The assessment tool and content for the workshops were adopted from the American Organization for Nurse Leaders(AONL), TeamSTEPPS\u00ae, and the Comprehensive Unit-Based Safety Program (CUSP). The program began with participants completing the American Organization of Nurse Leaders (AONL) Nurse Manager pre-assessment, anonymously . Participants identiied their current skills using a four- point (novice, advanced beginner, competent, and expert) Likert scale. The assessment was focused in three areas: The Leader Within: Creating the Leader in Y ourself; The Art: Leading the People; and, The Science: Managing the Business. The next step in the program was to introduce new knowledge utilizing three workshops, the main focus was the TeamSTEPPS\u00ae curriculum. At the end of the workshops, the charge nurses were invited to take the American Organization of Nurse Leaders Nurse Manager post-assessment. The three workshops were developed and focused on improving the communication skills of the 24 medical-surgical charge nurses to help prepare them to take on the nurse manager role. Each session was presented in an interactive format allowing for the content and materials to be presented, practiced, and discussed. The TeamSTEPPS\u00ae workshop helped the charge nurses learn and practice the skills they needed to communicate efectively with their colleagues. It is an efective strategy that introduces tools to improve patient safety by enhancing leadership skills. T eamSTEPPS ofers several solutions to improve patient safety . One of the highlights of its education is communication. Communication is the leading cause of errors in healthcare. TeamSTEPPS\u00ae also supported the importance of promoting relationships within the team for improving patient care. Efective communication strategies are crucial in building team trust. T eamSTEPPS\u00ae is identiied as an evidence- based program that taught the importance of efective communication and the ability to manage conlict within teams. A lack of cohesiveness and mutual understanding leads to conlict that afects patient outcomes. It is crucial that leaders work together to resolve barriers. Implementing this evidence-based workshop facilitated the importance of charge nurses' understanding of their work from three perspectives, professional development, eicient communication, and healthcare business to inluence the team and patient outcomes.Many Faces Create our Greatness 35 Additional workshops on professionalism and the business of healthcare were also presented. They were conducted by individuals who had experience in the topic. The sessions were presented using video vignettes and case studies. They allowed charge nurses to apply the content learned to current problems. The scenarios were equivalent to situations that occur in the clinical environment. It gave the participants an opportunity to think about professional practice by applying action learning techniques to solve problems. Presenters were asked to use an interactive discussion to engage participants. Questions were encouraged to clarify and promote further discussion. The professionalism workshop aligned with the AONE's 'leader within' domain. The Role of the Nurse Leader was from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Comprehensive Unit- Based Safety Program (CUSP). One of the principals of CUSP is the importance of culture owned at the unit level. The content supported learning by clarifying the role and responsibilities of new leaders. It supported professionalism by addressing the leader's position and responsibilities. The CUSP kit included facilitator notes, video vignettes, and PowerPoint slides to highlight professional development and work alignment. It helped the charge nurses understand their role while engaging in relective practice. The business of healthcare workshop was presented using concepts from AONE's Science Domain: Managing the Business. It included an explanation of external policy decisions and how they afected the systems in the medical center. It included reimbursement and challenges with current policy decisions. The participants learned the importance of collaboration, and quality care, through a inance lens. The workshop also identiied how the participant's work afected the medical center's bottom line and was key to its success. Nursing consumes a large portion of the medical center's budget and resources. The workshop helped them understand healthcare business from an external and internal perspective. The facilitator helped participants understand the business of healthcare from a unit perspective.At the conclusion of the 3 workshops, the post- assessment was administered anonymously on paper. The post-assessment results helped to evaluate if there was a perceived change after the workshops; it also provided insight for future charge nurse needs. The post assessment demonstrated great improvement in communication and leadership. 63% of attendees noted positive changes that were greater than ifty percent. The Leader Within domain had 20 questions, 60% had changes that were greater than ifty percent. Anecdotal discussions revealed the charge nurses wanted to learn more about the business of healthcare and how it inluenced their work. The project broadened the knowledge of charge nurses and helped them understand the medical center's decisions and their role in that process. They learned to be conident communicators who had a positive impact on patient care. The project also supported leadership development and clarity of the charge nurse role.36 Boston Medical Center Nursing DepartmentMaternal Child Health (MCH) Preceptor Orientation A core group of Labor and Delivery expert nurses that frequently precept inexperience d new nurses, identiied that these nurses struggled after the end of orientation on Labor and Delivery and at times were overwhelmed by the pace and the acuity of the unit. They had approached the unit manager Michele Schultz and unit educator Lynne Lambert to discuss what they may do as a preceptor group to redesign orientation and add consistenc y to the program. The preceptor group met weekly for several months to discuss the pace of orientation and the structure of the didactic learning. The preceptors considered how they could bet ter seek out experiences that aligned with the nursing practice so that the new lea rner could apply their knowledge at the bedside. They articulated the importance of starting with the fundamentals of labor an d birth. They emphasized the importance of weaving in the art of labor and delivery nursing care and the role in supporting physiologic birth, so the learner makes human-to-h uman connections with their patients from the beginning of their experience. They had recommendations for placement of didactic education in the orientation and wanted to bring in various methods of learning from diferent sources i.e., fetal monitoring eLearnings, fetal monitoring classroom learning, spinning babies (tech niques on positioning that supports physiologic birth), AWHONN classroom learnings facilitated by our unit-based educators, and circulating and scrub nurse trainings. The group discussed when and how to assist the new nurse in gaining skills to care for high-risk maternity patients and the challenges of when the normal patient turns abnormal. Using Benner's model of novice to expert, they articulated and shared experiences of how to bring the new nurse on a 5-6-month journey of skill acquisition. The preceptors thought it was important to use simulation learnings especially for those experiences that need accuracy and timing. In their recommendations, they apprec iated and hoped that this type of learning would best prepare the nurse for competent performance in an emergency . Their work has been critical in the design of Labor & Delivery orientation of new staf.Many Faces Create our Greatness 37Dedicated Education Unit The decision to create a Designated Education Unit (DEU) at BMC for the purpose of onboarding new graduate nurses to the medical-surgical division was multifactorial. In 2018, there were a high number of new to practice nurses being onboarded, and Nursing Professional Development Specialists and Nurse Managers were noting the diiculty of providing a comprehensive orientation for these staf. The nursing preceptors at this time were feeling overburdened as new to practice nurses require a great deal of support and guidance through their transition to professional practice. Creating a comprehensive orientation that focuses speciically on the learning styles and social needs is essential to improve the transition from academia to professional nurse. The decision was made to utilize a certiied Nursing Professional Development Specialist (NPDS) in an expanded role to oversee the clinical orientation in combination with a dedicated nursing education unit and nurse manager. This nursing unit was chosen during a large reconiguration of the nursing units within the hospital. At this time nurses had an opportunity to choose what nursing unit they wanted to work on. The nurses who chose to work on the dedicated education unit were eager to be a part of this new project. To support the onboarding of the new graduate nurses on the unit much of the staf enrolled in a preceptor course/workshop to further hone their skills. This new DEU model allowed for a standardized onboarding of new graduate nurses in an expanded orientation program ensuring an introduction to the professional role of a nurse, quality care, evidence-based practice and hands-on skill development. The development of this program was based upon the identiied need to ease transitions of new nurses into the professional role of nursing as well as creating a standardized experience for all new nurses. The evidence- based curriculum was based on Benner's novice-to-expert framework and inclusion of Tanner's Model of Clinical Judgement was incorporated into the program to enhance the development of \"clinical knowledge through expert guidance and coaching\". A successful transition needs an environment that supports the new nurse during this transition (Casey , et al., 2004). Learning objectives were developed based upon evidence-based practice and areas of patient safety identiied in the literature and within the institution. The curriculum designed for the DEU and outcome measures are new graduate nurse centered and emphasize the knowledge, skills, and attitudes these nurses should be able to demonstrate upon completion of the DEU orientation. The DEU model consists of a ive-week orientation with direct oversight by a nursing professional development specialist. The orientation occurs on an adult medical nursing unit, 6 East, and is purposeful in the application of hands-on skills, introduction of evidence-based practice, professional development, and delivery of quality care. The NPDS works one-on-one with the new hires, providing guidance to the many aspects of patient care. This includes an introduction to the electronic health record, integration of evidence-based practice guidelines to daily practice, introduction to the environment of quality improvement, standardized measurement data such as the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators and exposure to HCAHPS, also known as the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems. The integration of patient safety and quality care occurs in a classroom setting as well as through daily clinical conferences.F eedback received from the staf who have oriented through the DEU has been overwhelmingly positive. The end of the irst 12 months, 39 new RNs have oriented with a 91.3 percent retention rate. Ongoing support for the new graduate nurses continues for an additional 5 months after DEU orientation with the Nurse Residency Program. Classroom and simulation-based curriculum incorporates hands-on skills and simulation to provide additional supports for the transition to professional nurse and lifelong learners. \"I had a wonderful experience on the DEU\", \"I am so grateful to have the opportunity to participate in this program\", \"I love the classes that extend beyond the DEU\", and \"the simulation allows for me to practice skills I will need in my clinical area\", said the new graduate nurses. Due to the success of this program a second nursing unit has been created to function as a DEU. The model mirrors the original model with a designated nursing professional development specialist who has direct oversight of the new graduate nurses and a designated nurse manager to oversee their onboarding.

They wanted to improve the collaboration and communicat ion with their NICU colleagues and ultimately decrease serious reportable events. In c ollaboration with the Medical Director for Quality in the NICU and the Nurse Manager in the NICU, th ey decided to apply for a safety grant sponsored by the Quality and Patient Safety departme nt. They hoped to help their NICU colleagues with teams training education and sponsor the roll out to the NICU interdisciplinary team so that they could continue the mission of team s training communication from mother to baby in the NICU. In collaboration with their NICU colleagues, they developed a budget that incorporated supplies, training sessions, speakers, and staf development that would need to accompl ish their tasks. They invited Teams Training experts from BIDMC to speak at a day-lon g session that would serve to refresh obstetric team members and a core group of NICU teammates to introduce the concepts of teams training for their team. The obstetric nurses had hoped to reinforce the communication concepts in the newl y formed huddles with purposeful integration into obstetric simulation. The NICU teams found various ways to use the information and skills in resuscitative simulations and in da ily communication routines planning NICU care. The project inluenced other safety projects on the unit such as \"52 weeks of safety\" clinical pearls that enhance safety and safety interdisciplinary board rounds. These st af have made a great contribution to Maternal Child Health at BMC. photo by Ed CollierTOTAL PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROGRAM OFFERINGS6,372297PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS PROVIDED 4,018NURSES ATTENDEDCONTACT HOURS PROVIDED 1,020Professional Development Activities BMC is committed to providing nurses with opportunities for obtaining continuing professional development and contact hours. BMC has its own Provider Unit through American Nurses Association, Massachusetts, and is approved to provide nurses with contact hours for programs. In 2019, the BMC Provider Unit almost doubled the number of programs and contact hours since last year and reached more nurses and other participants than previous years. By the numbers: Professional Development at BMC Nursing Professional Development (NPD) is comprised of 21 nursing professional development specialists who represent all the specialties at BMC\u2014medical/s urgical, critical care, maternal child health, emergency services, perioperative services, central education including simulation and primary care. They provide both nursing focused and interprofessional targeted programs. Nursing continuing professional development in the specialty areas include broad topics such as substance use disorder and domestic violence. BMC was the irst provider unit that had a Massachusetts Board of Registration in Nursing (BORN) approved Domestic & Sexual Violence Training pursuant to MGL that all LPNs, RNs, and APRNs needed to complete for their license renewal for 2020. This course assists in providing much needed knowledge for our patient population. The patient population of BMC is also impacted by the current substance use epidemic and the provider unit provides multiple programs addressing continuing nursing professional development on this social determinant of health afecting our community . Other specialty knowledge courses include Trauma Care Everywhere (medic al surgical level trauma course), transgender care, chemotherapy simulat ions, introduction to cancer care, and a SICU hearts and minds course. Additionally , NPD has ofered resiliency trainings that included Reiki 1 and 2, Resiliency 1 and 2, Aromatherapy , and the Annual Integrative Nursing Conference. In 2019, the Nursing Professional Development provided over 296 programs with about half of those targeting interprofessional audiences. Many of the nursing and interprofessional programs utilized simulation based active learning to engage an d reinforce knowledge, skills and practice over passive methods of lecture only learning. BMC has committed to a Magnet journey and supports the continuing professional development and education progression of its nursing staf. The ongoing goal is to provide more oferings in professional development focused on certiication and specialty nursing. We continue to meet the needs of the learners determined b y a self-assessment and identiied needs assessment by key stakeholders a s well as by evidence-based trends.

They exemplify the kind of nurse our patients, families, and staff look to for support. The DAISY Award is an international nursing recognition program that was established in 1999 by the family of Patrick Barnes, who died at the age of 33 from complication of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP). As a way to turn their grief into something positive, the Barnes Family came up with the DAISY Award, an acronym for Diseases Attacking the Immune System. The Barnes family believes nurses are the unsung heroes of our society who deserve far more recognition and honor for the compassionate care they provide to patients every day.
