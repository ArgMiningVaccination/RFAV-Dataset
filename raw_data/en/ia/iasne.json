INTRODUCTION TO RELIANCE -BASED EVALUATION 1.1 Purpose This guideline is intended to provide information and guidance to applicants/HCRs on the prescribed requirements and process to be followed, in cases where a new registration or variation application is submitted to SAHPRA with the applicant/HCR requesting a reliance -based evaluation. 1.2 Legislative provisions The Medicines and Related Substances Act (101/1965), as amended, details under section 2B(2)(a)(2)(b) that: (2)(a) The Authority may - liaise with any other regulatory authority or institution and may, without limiting the generality of this power, req uire the necessary information from, exchange information with and receive information from any such authority or institution in respect of - (i) matters of common interest; or (ii) a specification investigation; and (2)(b) enter into agreements to co -opera te with any regulatory authority in order to achieve the objects of this Act. Regulation 16 to this Act, furthermore, states that: (8) In the case where a medicine in respect of which an application for registration is made, is or was registered wit h any regulatory body outside the Republic, the following information in respect of such medicines shall accompany the application: (a) a copy of the certificate of registration; (b) professional information relating to the medicine; (c) conditions of such registra tion; and (d) any other information as may be required by the Authority. 1.3 RELIANCE -BASED EVALUATION PATHWAYS The World Health Organisation defines reliance as \"[t]he act whereby the regulatory authority in one jurisdiction may take into account and give significant weight to - i.e. totally or partially rely upon - evaluations performed by another regulatory autho rity or trusted institution in reaching its own decision. The relying authority remains responsible and accountable for decisions taken, even when it relies on the decisions and information of others.\" Wherever possible, SAHPRA will leverage these pathways , relying on the evaluation efforts of Recognised Regulatory Authorities (RRAs) in order to reduce evaluation times. Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 6 Reliance -based evaluation pathways for medicines applications for new registrations and variations in South Africa will follow one of thr ee evaluation / review pathways: a) Abridged review b) Verified review c) Recognition Note that pathways (a), (b) and (c) replace the prior Abbreviated Medicines Review Process (AMRP). The application of and use -cases for reliance -based evaluation pathways differ between the Clinical and PEM units (see Section 2.2 below). 2. GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE RELIANCE -BASED EVALUATION PATHWAYS a) Abridged review: A streamlined review based primarily on unredacted assessment reports from RRAs, replacing the need to evaluate all of the data (and summaries thereof) submitted in support of an application. b) Verified review: A streamlined review based p rimarily on verifying, instead of evaluating, information submitted in the application against information which has already been approved by SAHPRA or an RRA. Note that unredacted reports are required for PEM verified reviews as a fall -back option for eva luators c) Recognition: A streamlined registration / approval process based on directly recognising the outcome of a review from an RRA with which SAHPRA shares a recognition agreement. Note: SAHPRA is currently in the process of negotiating recognition a greements with RRAs. Once such an agreement is in place, SAHPRA will publish a framework for the practical implementation thereof. The guiding principle is that applications approved by RRAs with which SAHPRA shares a recognition agreement may not need to be evaluated separately by SAHPRA. Please note that this is not to be confused with collaborative / work -sharing procedures, e.g. Zazibona. The abridged and verified review processes do NOT involve an abbreviated application - all data and information re quired for a full review should be submitted, i.e. the full CTD module structure, as well as the SCoRE document. Evaluators may still need to review data in the dossier as required (even when presented with unredacted reports). Any and all decisions regarding approval and final registration will be made by SAHPRA, in consideration of multiple factors including an RRA registration. 2.1 SAHPRA'S RECOGNISED REGULATORY AUTHORITIES To qualify for a reliance evaluation pathway, an applicati on must have been approved by one or more of the RRAs with which SAHPRA aligns itself. SAHPRA's current RRAs include: European Medicines (EMA Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 7 European Medicines Agency Decentralised Procedure (EMA DCP) (no restrictions on which member state acts as the reference member state) Health Canada Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), UK Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), Japan Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic) Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) Two additional procedures can be used for reliance / collaborative review, which are not strictly regulatory authorities: World Health Organisation Prequalification (WHO PQ) Zazibona collaborative procedure 2.2 INDEPENDENT APPLICATION OF RELIANCE F OR CLINICAL AND PEM A given application often differs in complexity for Clinical versus PEM evaluation. For example, a typical application for a generic / multisource medicine requires a relatively straightforward verification of PIs for Clinical, yet PEM faces the added complexity of bioequivalence. As a result, SAHPRA's reliance pathways are applied independently for PEM and Clinical. This has the following two key implications: Evaluation pathways may differ for PEM and Clinical evaluation (e.g., Clin ical may follow a verification procedure, while PEM follows a full review, based on the nature of the application and the quality of reliance documents submitted) The RRAs referenced in an application may differ for PEM and Clinical evaluation (e.g., C linical may refer to the SAHPRA -approved local innovator PI and latest EMA SmPC as part of a verified review, while the PEM evaluation makes reference to information approved by the TGA). This approach widens the use of reliance, by not limiting an appli cation to the same pathway / reference RRA for PEM and Clinical evaluation. 2.3 TECHNICAL SCREENING OF APPLICATIONS Applicants are to provide SAHPRA with the intended evaluation pathways for PEM and Clinical evaluation, along with a brief motivation . The intended evaluation pathways should be indicated on the new registration / variation validation template in the relevant sections. Providing the intended pathways prevents unnecessary screening for reliance documentation in instances where a full rev iew is intended by the applicant. Decisions related to an application's final evaluation pathway and the extent of reliance on a RRA's evaluation are fully at SAHPRA's discretion and will depend on the availability and quality of reliance documentation s ubmitted. SAHPRA will share screening queries with applicants regarding insufficient reliance documentation to ensure that as many applications as possible qualify for abridged and verified Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 8 reviews. Where applicable, applications will default to a full rev iew in the absence of a suitable reliance pathway. 2.4 UNREDACTED ASSESSMENT REPORTS AND THE LETTER OF ACCESS Where indicated as a requirement for an abridged or verified review, applicants are to provide SAHPRA with full, unredacted assessment reports from an RRA (submitted in Module 1.10). The following requirements apply: Unredacted assessment / evaluation reports should at least include safety, efficacy and quality report(s) prepared by the RRA upon which the registration / approval decision was based. Where unredacted assessment / evaluation reports from the RRA are in a language which is not English, translated versions need to be provided. In instances where applicants do not have access to relevant unredacted assessment reports, SAHPRA requires a signed Letter of Access, appended to the Letter of Application in Module 1 (see Appendix 1 for templa te), included in the application. This allows SAHPRA to request unredacted reports from the associated RRA(s). However, SAHPRA does not guarantee that these reports will be obtained. For a given RRA, only one letter should be signed covering both ME&R and Clinical access to the unredacted reports. The Letter of Access must also be signed by the MAH in the associated RRA country or by the principal from whom the dossier is purchased. Note that SAHPRA prefers receiving unredacted reports directly from the app licant and has introduced the Letter of Access only for instances where this is not possible. If the reports are not obtained, the application in question will most likely default to a full review, extending evaluation time. 3. PRINCIPLES OF RELIANCE -BASED EVALUATION - CLINICAL For PI/PIL content, SAHPRA will be using reliance wherever applicable. As per the documentation requirements in section 4, this typically involves the submission of the latest approved (and attainable) PI/PIL from a regulatory authority with which SAHPRA a ligns itself (Recognised Regulatory Authority - RRA). SAHPRA considers PI/PILs previously approved by the EMA (either Centralised Procedure or Decentralised Procedure) as a default reference for reliance pathways. Alternatively, applicants can provide an a pproved PI/PIL from any other RRA. Note that an application for an API that has not yet been registered by SAHPRA will be considered as a New Chemical Entity (NCE) in South Africa, regardless of whether the molecule has already been registered by other re gulatory authorities. 3.1 ABRIDGED REVIEW The abridged review is based primarily on the overviews of pre -clinical and clinical data in CTD Modules 2.4 and 2.5. All supporting documents as stipulated in Section 4 of this guideline should be included in the submission in order to qualify for an abri dged review. Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 9 All NCE and biological applications, generic applications with clinical data, Type II variations and EAs that have prior approval from an RRA will be considered for an abridged review. In addition, all applications for biosimilar medicines w ill be considered for an abridged review. An abridged review is indicated specifically for the following types of applications: 3.1.1 Monocomponent medicines For registration of an NCE already approved by an RRA For registration of an NCE based on well -established use (relying on literature), where the medicine has already been registered on the same basis by an RRA For a monocomponent multisource medicine / generic registered by an RRA, and where clinical data generated with the generic has been supplied in support of the application Biological medicine registered by an RRA Biosimilar medicine where the reference biological medicine has already been registered by SAHPRA 3.1.2 Multicomponent medicines For a multicomponent fixed dose combination of two or more chemical entities, where the combination is not registered by SAHPRA, but registered by a RRA 3.1.3 Type II variations For Type II variations where the amendment applied for has already been approved by an RRA (e.g. additional/amended therapeutic indications, posology and method of administration) 3.1.4 EAs For all EAs which have not yet been approved by SAHPRA for a given molecule, but have been approved by an RRA 3.2 VERIFIED REVIEW The verified review is initiated to limit the evaluation time of generic applications for APIs already registered by SAHPRA. The verified review is effectively a comparison of an applicant's proposed PI against an up -to date reference PI (from a Clinical safety perspective). The primary reference is the latest approved PI of the associated local innovator product. The la test-approved foreign innovator PI may be supplied as an additional/alternative reference only where the local innovator is materially outdated or no longer marketed (see 2.16 Guideline on Professional Information for Human Use for which sections require c omplete localisation to the SA innovator product). All Type IB variations, and generic applications (without clinical data) for APIs already registered by SAHPRA will be considered for a verified review. In addition, EAs which have already been approved by SAHPRA will be considered for a verified review. A verified review is indicated specifically for the following types of applications: Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 10 3.2.1 Monocomponent medicines For duplicates/clones medicines registered by SAHPRA For a multisource medici ne/generic with identical therapeutic indications, formulation/dosage form and strength for APIs previously approved by SAHPRA 3.2.2 Multicomponent medicines For a multicomponent fixed dose combination of two or more chemical entities, where the combination is already registered by SAHPRA 3.2.3 Type IB variations For all Type IB variations reviewed by SAHPRA 3.2.4 EAs For all EAs which have already been approved by SAHPRA for a given molecule For all EAs related to new pharmaceutical forms which follow the same route of administration as that which has already been approved by SAHPRA (e.g., EA for a capsule, where SAHPRA has already approved use of a tablet)1 1Regardless of whether SAHPRA or a RRA has previously approved the EA for a given molecule (i.e. the EA for a capsule may not have been approved by SAHPRA or a RRA, but the application qualifies for verification as SAHPRA has previously app roved the same [oral] route of administration). 4.

PRINCIPLES OF RELIANCE -BASED EVALUATION - QUALITY & BIOEQUIVALENCE Reliance -based evaluation will be based on the following principles: Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 12 Reliance is applicable for both new registration and variation applications (Type IB and Type II). The application submitted for registration by SAHPRA should be the same as the most updated product on record at the RRA, i.e. all approved variations for the RRA's registered product should be incorporated in the application submitted for registration by SAHPRA. Pending variations with the RRA should not be included in the application submitted to SAHPRA in order for the application to qualify for reliance. 5.1 ABRIDGED REVIEW REQUIREMENTS An abridged review is a reliance -based review comprising: Validation by SAHPRA to ensure that the product application submitted for registration by SAHPRA is the same as the product registered by the specified RRA Evaluation of Module 1: Regional administrative information (as required) Evaluation of spec ific aspects of the dossier, depending on the type of application submitted An abridged review is applicable to the following types of applications: i.

Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 14 7. GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE (GMP) INSPECTIONS Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) describes a set of principles and procedures that, when followed, ensure that medicines and related substances are of high quality, safety and efficacy. SAHPRA is a participating authority of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Coop eration Scheme (jointly known as PIC/S). PIC/S aims to develop international standards between countries and pharmaceutical inspection authorities, to provide harmonised and constructive co -operation in the field of GMP. PIC/S affiliation is subject to ini tial and periodic assessment of the participating authority to ensure that it has equivalent legislation, regulatory and enforcement procedures and inspection capacity. Besides employing a reliance approach to PIC/S affiliated authorities, SAHPRA Inspector ate also applies reliance to WHO and ZAZIBONA inspections. 7.1 PRINCIPLES OF GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE RELIANCE GMP agreements with competent international regulatory authorities support information sharing and other desirable objectives for interna tional regulatory collaboration. These agreements do not permit automatic acceptance of the decisions of the other party, but may be used to enhance regulatory oversight and significantly reduce regulatory burden without diminution of compliance. Manufac turers of medicines supplied in the South African market must demonstrate compliance with the relevant code of GMP. This is usually, but not always, done through an on -site inspection and with acceptable documentary GMP evidence. GMP approval guidance fo r sites involved in the manufacture of products can be found below. Please note that adherence to these requirements does not guarantee a site will be deemed GMP compliant by SAHPRA. SAHPRA reserves the right to request additional documentation, schedule an inspection or reject any sites regardless of adherence to the below requirements The site has been approved by a recognised regulator AND The site was approved by the recognised regulator within the previous 3 years AND The dosage form of the product within the application is within the same dosage form grouping as the dosage form approved by the recognised regulator AND The product type a pplied for is the same as the product type approved by the recognised regulator AND The activities applied for by the applicant are the same activities that have been approved by the recognised regulator See the latest GMP guideline for the recognized regulators, dosages, product types and activity groupings 8. CLINICAL TRIAL APLLICATION Clinical Trial data is crucial in supporting the safety and efficacy of the product intended for registration. During the review process the Authority consider info rmation regarding the review status of the clinical trial with other Regulatory Authorities, as requested in the application form. As most of the clinical trials Reliance Guideline March 2022 5.08_ Reliance Guideline_ Mar 22_V3 Page 15 are multi -center trials, the Authority will further take into consideration proper monitoring of trial and local conditions or prevalence of disease within the context of SA. 9 PHARMARCOVIGILANCE The vigilance is important for ensuring that health products available on the South African markets are safe, effective and of acceptable quality and performance throughout the life cycle of the product. In order to ensure that the Authority fulfills its mandate of monitoring the benefit -risk profile of the health products, the Authority will take into account the safety information communicated or act ions taken by other Recognised Regulatory Authorities. The Authority takes into account and gives significant weight to assessments performed by Recognised Regulatory Authorities in reaching its own regulatory decision. Furthermore, SAHPRA is an independen t Authority and therefore is responsible and accountable for the decisions taken, even when it relies on the decisions and information from other Regulatory Authorities.
