PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES The Texas Legislature, through the 2012-2013 Ge neral Appropriations Ac t and Senate Bill 7, instructed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) to expand its use of pre- paid Medicaid managed care to achieve program savings, while also preserving locally funded supplemental payments to hospitals. The State of Texas submitted a section 1115 Demonstration proposal to CMS in July 2011 to expand risk-based managed care statewide consistent with the existing STAR section 1915 (b) and STAR+PLUS section 1915(b)/(c) waiver programs, and thereby replace existing Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) or fee-for- service (FFS) delivery systems. The state sought a section 1115 Demonstrat ion as the vehicle to both expand the managed care delivery system , and to operate a funding pool, supported by managed care savings and diverted supplemental payments, to reimburse providers for uncompensated care costs and to provide incent ive payments to participating hospitals that implement and operate delivery system reforms. The STAR and STAR+PLUS managed care programs will cover most beneficiaries statewide through three geographic expansions. The firs t expansion occurred on September 1, 2011, under existing section 1915(b) and sect ion 1915(c) authorities, and th e second expansion occurred in March 2012, under section 1115 authority. A th ird expansion of STAR+PLUS will occur September 1, 2014 under section 1115 authority as a result of an amendment to the demonstration. STAR is the primary managed care program serving low-income families and children, and STAR+PLUS provides acute and long-term servi ce and supports to the aged, disabled, and chronically ill. Medicaid eligible adults who ar e not enrolled in Medicare, meet th e level of care for Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), and reside in the MRSA, must enroll in a Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 4 of 454 STAR managed care organization (M CO); children meeting these criteria can voluntarily enroll in STAR. STAR MCOs in the MRSA will provide acute care services, and will coordinate acute and long-term care services w ith section 1915(c) waivers, such as the Community Based Alternatives Program and the Community Living Assistance and Support Services Program, that exist outside of this sect ion 1115 demonstration. STAR+PLUS, which serves beneficiaries meeting an institutional level of care (LOC) in the home or community, did not operate in th e MRSA during the March 2012 expansion, but effective September 1, 2014, Medicaid eligible adults over age 21 who meet STAR+PLUS eligibility criteria and reside in the MRSA must enroll in ST AR+PLUS. Clients under 21 who meet the criteria will be able to voluntarily enroll in STAR +PLUS effective September 1, 2014, thus will not be required to enroll. STAR and STAR+PLUS beneficiarie s receive enhanced behavioral health services consistent with the requirements of the Mental Health Parity Act. As of March 2012, STAR+PLUS beneficiaries began receiving inpatient serv ices through the contracted managed care organizations (MCOs). STAR+PLUS MCOs will al so provide Medicaid wrap services for outpatient drugs and biological products to dual eligible beneficiaries for whom the State has financial payment obligations. Additionally, Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21 will receive the full array of primary and preventive dental services require d under the State plan, through contracting pre-pa id dental plans. Effective March 6, 2014, cognitive rehabilitation therapy services (CRT) will be provided through the STAR+PLUS HCBS program. Effective September 1, 2014, the following a dditional benefits will be provided: acute care services for beneficiaries receiving se rvices through an inte rmediate care facility for individuals with intellectua l disabilities or a related condi tion (ICF/IID), or an ICF/IID waiver will be provided through STAR+PLUS; employme nt assistance and supported employment will be provided through the STAR+PLUS home and community based services (HCBS) program; mental health rehabilitation services will be provided via managed care; and mental health targeted case management fo r members who have chronic mental illness will be provided via managed care. Effective March 1, 2015, nursing facility se rvices will be a covered benefit under STAR+PLUS managed care for adults over the age of 21, Note: The NorthSTAR waiver in the Dallas servi ce delivery area is not ch anging as a result of the September 1, 2014 and the March 1, 2015 STAR+PLUS expansions. Beginning January 1, 2014, children ages 6 - 18 w ith family incomes between 100 - 133 percent of the federal poverty level were transferred from the state's separate Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to Medicaid in acco rdance with section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) of the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 5 of 454 Act. Under the demonstration these targeted lo w-income children (M-C HIP) are required to enroll in managed care. For the purposes of eligib ility and benefits, these children are considered a mandatory Medicaid group for poverty-level re lated children and title XIX eligibility and benefit requirements apply. The state may clai m enhanced match from the state's title XXI allotment for these M-CHIP children in accord ance with title XXI funding requirements and regulations. All references to CHIP and title XXI in this do cument apply to these M-CHIP children only. Other requirements of title XXI (f or separate CHIP programs) are not applicable to this demonstration. Savings generated by the expansion of managed care and diverted supplemental payments will enable the state to maintain budget neutralit y, while establishing two funding pools supported by Federal matching funds, to provide payments for uncompensated care costs and delivery system reforms undertaken by participating hospitals an d providers. These paym ents are intended to help providers prepare for new coverage demand s in 2014 scheduled to take place under current Federal law. The state proposes that the per centage of funding for uncompensated care will decrease as the coverage reforms of the Pa tient Protection and Affordable Care Act are implemented, and the percentage of funding for delivery system improvement will correspondingly increase. Texas plans to work with private and public hospi tals to create Regional Healthcare Partnerships (RHPs) that are anchored financ ially by public hospitals and/or local government entities, that will collaborate with participating providers to identify performance areas for improvement that may align with the following four broad categories: (1) infrastructure development, (2) program innovation and redesign, (3) quality improvements, and (4) population focused improvements. The non-Federal share of funding po ol expenditures will be largel y financed by state and local intergovernmental transfers (IGTs). Texas will continue to work with CMS in engaging provider stakeholders and developing a sustainable framew ork for the RHPs. It is anticipated, if all deliverables identified in this demonstration's STCs are satisfied, incentive payments for planning will begin in the second half of the first Demonstration Year (DY). Through this demonstration, the state aims to: Expand risk-based managed care statewide; Support the development and maintenance of a coordinated care delivery system; Improve outcomes while containing cost growth; Protect and leverage financing to improve a nd prepare the health care infrastructure to serve a newly insured population; and Transition to quality-based payment systems across managed care and hospitals.

The state will maintain minutes from these meetings and use them in evaluating program operations a nd identifying necessary program changes. Copies of committee meeting minutes will be made available to CMS upon request and the outcomes of the meetings may be discussed on the demonstration monitoring calls. MCO Participant Advisory Committees. The state shall require each MCO, through its contracts, to create and ma intain participant advisory committees through which the MCO can share information and capture enro llee feedback. The MCOs will be required to support and facilitate partic ipant involvement and submit meeting minutes to the State. Copies of meeting minutes will be made available to CMS upon request. Independent Consumer Supports. To support the beneficiary's experience receiving medical assistance and long term services a nd supports in a managed care environment, the State shall create and maintain a system of consumer supports independent from the managed care plans to assist enrollees in understanding the coverage model and in the resolution of problems regarding services, coverage, access and rights. i. Core Elements of the Independe nt Consumer Support System. A. Organizational Structure . The Independent Consumer Supports System shall operate independent ly from any STAR+PLUS MCO. The organizational structure of th e support system shall facilitate transparent and collaborative oper ation with beneficiaries, MCOs, and state government. B. Accessibility . The services of the Independent Consumer Supports System will be available to all Me dicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 18 of 454 STAR+PLUS receiving Medicaid long-term services and supports (institutional, residential and co mmunity based). The Independent Consumer Supports system will be accessible through multiple entryways (e.g., phone, internet, office) and will have the capacity to reach out to beneficiaries and/or authorized representatives through various means (mail, phone, in person), as appropriate. C. Functions . The Independent Consumer Supports system will be available to assist beneficiarie s in navigating and accessing covered health care services and supports. Where an individual is enrolling in a new delivery system, the services of this system help individuals understand their choices and resolve problems and concerns that may arise between the individual and a provider/payer. The following list encompasses the system's scope of activity. 1. The system will offer beneficiaries support in the pre- enrollment stage, such as unbiased health plan choice counseling and general program-related information. 2. The system will serve as an access point for complaints and concerns about health plan en rollment, access to services, and other related matters. 3. The system will be available to help enrollees understand the hearing, grievance, and appeal rights and processes within the health plan as well as the fair hearing, grievance, and appeal rights and processes available at the state level and assist them through the process if needed/requested. D. Staffing and training . The Independent Consumer Supports system will include individuals who are knowledgeable about the state's Medicaid programs; beneficiar y protections and rights under Medicaid managed care arrangemen ts; and the health and service needs of persons with complex need s, including those with a chronic condition, disability, and cognitive or behavioral needs. In addition, the Independent Consumer Supports System will ensure that its services are delivered in a cu lturally competent manner and are accessible to individuals with limited English proficiency. The system ultimately developed by the state may draw upon existing staff within the chosen organi zational structure and provide substantive training to ensure core competencies and a consistent consumer experience. E. Data Collection and Reporting . The Independent Consumer Supports System shall track the vo lume and nature of beneficiary complaints and the resolution of such complaints on a schedule and manner determined by the state, but no less frequently than quarterly. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 19 of 454 This information will inform the st ate of any provider or contractor issues and support the reporti ng requirements to CMS. ii. Independent Consumer Supports System Pl an.

An approved Independent Consumer Support System Plan required will become Attachment L. Changes to Attachment L must be submitted to CMS for review and approval subject to STC 7. The state will evaluate the impact of the Independent Consumer Support Program in the demonstration Evaluation per Section XVI of these STCs. 21. Managed Care Delivery Systems. The state has been granted the authority (subject to Readiness Review, as discussed below) to operate managed care programs in the areas described in paragraphs 18 and 19; therefore, a demonstration amendment is not required to implement expansions in these service ar eas. However, any proposed changes in Demonstration authorities; implementation of managed care after June 1, 2012, in the service areas provided in Columns C, D, and E in Table 1; or changes in the populations included or excluded in the authorized serv ice areas will require an amendment to the demonstration as outlined in STC 7. 22. Readiness Review Requirements for September 1, 2014 expansion. The state will submit to CMS, documentation regarding network ad equacy and capacity for the September 1, 2014, expansion and the March 1, 2015 nursing faci lity expansion, as described below: a) The Readiness Review for the September 1, 2014, and March 1, 2015, expansions will consist of the following elements: i.

CMS will provide the state its reasons, in writing, for requesting the postponement, which may be based on findings from the readiness review, and will modify the approved demonstration as necessary to reflect the delay. CMS will endeavor to make any postponement request before June 1, 2014 for the September 1, 2014, expansion and before December 1, 2014, for the March 1, 2015, expansion, but reserves the right to make a request later should new material information become availabl e that would give gr ounds for postponement. e) Attempts To Gain an Accurate Beneficiary Address. The state will complete return mail tracking after first enrollment notification mailing and throughout the first 90 days of implementation. The state will use inform ation gained from return mail to make additional outreach attempts through other me thods (phone, email, etc.) or complete other beneficiary address analysis fr om previous claims to strengt hen efforts to obtain a valid address. f) Verification of Beneficiary's MCO Enrollm ent. The state shall implement a CMS approved process for an MCO, network and non-network providers, or the State to confirm enrollment of enrollees who do not have a card or go to the wrong provider. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 21 of 454 g) Sample Notification Letters. The state must send sample be neficiary notification letters to the existing Medicaid providers, either through direct mailing, posted on the STAR+PLUS website, or other wi dely distributed method, so providers are informed of what is being told to the beneficiaries regarding their transi tion to STAR+PLUS. h) Educational Activities for Beneficiaries and Provi ders. The state will conduct a series of educational events for beneficiaries and pr oviders throughout the st ate during the five months prior to the implementation of th e September 1, 2014, STAR+PLUS expansion. i. Beneficiary educational events will consis t of state and MCO staff traveling to locations throughout the stat e to provide enrollees a nd potential enrollees with information about STAR+PLUS and the MC Os. Events will be focused on the various demonstration populations includi ng the elderly and HCBS participants. The educational events will educate beneficiaries on their MCO enrollment options, rights and responsibilities, and other important program elements. This effort will include, at a minimum, participation of ombudsman and any other relevant group providing enrollment suppor t for beneficiaries. All informational materials will include contact numbers for the State Call Center and other contracted entities (e.g., fiscal inte rmediary, ADRCs) that can provide beneficiaries with enrollment support. ii. Provider education events will be conducte d primarily by the MCOs with the state in attendance. Events will occur throughout the st ate at times and places that will allow providers and their administrative st aff, as appropriate, to attend. MCOs and the state will educate providers about the goals of STAR+PLUS and the MCOs will train providers and their admini strative staff on basic processes and procedures. i) State Operated Call Center. The state must operate a call center independent of the MCOs for the duration of the demonstration. This can be achieved either by providing the call center directly or through other stat e contracted entities (e.g. ADRCs, Fiscal Intermediary). This entity should be able to help enrollees in making independent decisions about MCO choice, provide access to other state resources and enable enrollees to voice complaints about each of the MCOs independent of the MCOs. j) Call Center Response Statistics. During the first 30 days of implementation the state must review all call center response statistics daily to ensure all contracted entities are meeting requirements in their c ontracts. If deficiencies ar e found, the state and the entity must determine how they will remedy the defici ency as soon as possible. After the first 30 days, if all entities are consistently m eeting requirements, the state can lessen the review of call center statistics, but must still review all statis tics at least weekly for the first 180 days of implementation. Data and information regarding call center statistics, Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 22 of 454 including beneficiary questi ons and concerns, must be made available to CMS upon request. k) Implementation Calls with the MCOs. During the initial implementation of the STAR+PLUS expansion, the state must hold re gular calls with the MCOs to discuss any issues that arise. The calls should cover all MCO operations and determine plans for correcting any issues as quickly as possible. The state must maintain weekly calls for the first 90 days and bi-weekly calls for the next 90 days. After the first 180 days of the program, the state may move to the regular timeframe intended for meeting with each of the MCOs. l) State Review of Beneficiary Complaints, Grievances, and Appeals . During the first six months of the STAR+PLUS expansion, the stat e must review complaint, grievance, and appeal logs for each MCO and data from the state or MCO operated incident management system on a monthly basis, to understand what issues beneficiaries and providers are having with each of the MCOs. This review should be particularly focused on issues raised by populations that were tr ansitioned from a 1915(c) waiver. The state will use this information to implement any immediate corrective actions necessary. The state will continue to mon itor these statistics throughout the demonstration period and report on them in the quarterly reports. Data and information regarding the beneficiary complaints, grievances, and appeals pro cess must be made available to CMS upon request. 23. Contracts. No FFP is available for ac tivities covered under contracts and/or modifications to existing contracts that are subject to 42 CFR 438 requirements prior to CMS approval of such contracts and/or contract amendments. The state shall submit any supporting documentation deemed necessary by CMS. The state will provide CMS with a minimum of 45 days to review and approve changes. CMS reserves th e right, as a corrective action, to withhold FFP (either partial or full) for the demonstration, unti l the contract compliance requirement is met. 24. Network Requirements . The state must, through contract with MCOs, ensure the delivery of all covered benefits, including high quality care. Services must be delivered in a culturally competent manner, and the MCO network must be sufficient to prov ide access to covered services to the low-income population. In a ddition, the MCO must coordinate health care services for demonstration populations . The following requirements must be met by the State through its MCOs for the duration of the demonstration. a) Special Health Care Needs. Enrollees with special health care needs must have direct access to a specialist, as appropr iate for the individual's health care condition, as specified in 42 C.F.R. 438.208(c)(4). b) Out of Network Requirements. The state, through MCOs, must provide demonstration populations with all demonstra tion program benefits describe d within these STCs, and as specified in 42 CFR 438.206(b)(4), and mu st allow access to non-network providers, Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 23 of 454 without extra charge, when services cannot be timely furnished through a geographically accessible preferred provider network. c) Timeliness. The state, through its MCOs, must comp ly with timely access requirements, and ensure their providers comply with thes e requirements. Providers must meet state standards for timely access to care and servic es, considering the urgency of the service needed. Network providers must offer office hours at least equal to those offered to the MCO's commercial line of business enrollees or Medicaid fee-for-service participants, if the provider accepts only Medicaid patients. C ontracted services must be made available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, when me dically necessary. The State, through the MCO contracts, must establish mechanisms to ensure and monitor provider compliance, and must take corrective action when noncompliance occurs. d) Credentialing.

Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 34 of 454 a) Auto-Assignment. If a potential beneficiary does not choose a managed care organization within the time frames defined in (a), he or she may be auto-assigned to a managed care organization. When possible, the auto-assignment algorithm shall take into consideration the beneficiary's history with a primary care provider, and when applicable, the beneficiary's history with a nur sing facility. If this is not possible the State will equitably distribute be neficiaries among qualified MCOs. b) The State may automatically re-enroll a beneficiary in the same managed care organization if there is a loss of Medicaid eligibility for six months or less. 32. Disenrollment or Transfer. Individuals should be inform ed of opportunities no less than annually for disenrollment and ongoing plan c hoice opportunities, regularly and in a manner consistent with 42 CFR 438 and other requiremen ts set forth in the Demonstration Special Terms and Conditions. a) MCO Transfer at Request of Beneficiary. Beneficiaries may request transfer to another managed care organization in the serv ice area through the enrollment broker at any time. b) Transfer to FFS at Request of Beneficiary Recipients that are voluntarily enrolled in a managed care programs may request disenrollm ent and return to tr aditional Medicaid. Mandatory recipients must re quest disenrollment from mana ged care in writing to HHSC; however, HHSC considers disenrollment from ma naged care only in rare situations, when sufficient medical documentation establishes that the MCO cannot provided the needed services. An authorized HHSC representativ e reviews all disenrollment requests, and processes approved requests for disenrollmen t from an MCO. The Enrollment Broker provides disenrollment education and offe rs other options as appropriate. c) Transfer to FFS at Request of MCO. A managed care organization has a limited right to request a beneficiary be disenrolled from the managed care organization without the beneficiary's consent. HHSC must approve any managed care organization request for disenrollment of a beneficiary for caus e. HHSC may permit disenrollment of a beneficiary under the following circumstances: i. The beneficiary misuses or loans his or her managed care organization membership card to another person to obtain services; or ii. The beneficiary is disruptive, unruly, thre atening or uncooperative to the extent that his or her membership seriously impairs th e MCO's or provider's ability to provide services to the beneficiary, or to obtain new beneficiaries, and the beneficiary's behavior is not caused by a physical or behavioral health condition; or Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 35 of 454 iii. The beneficiary consistently refuses to co mply with managed care restrictions (e.g., repeatedly using the emergency room in combination with refusing to allow the managed care organization to treat the underlying medical condition). The managed care organization must take reason able measures to correct the beneficiary's behavior prior to requesting disenrollment. Reasonable measures may include providing education and counseling regarding the offens ive acts or behaviors. HHSC must notify the beneficiary of HHSC's decision to disenroll the beneficiary, if all reasonable measures have failed to remedy the problem. If the beneficiary disagrees with the deci sion to disenroll the beneficiary from the managed care organizati on, HHSC must notify the beneficiary of the availability of the complaint procedure and HHS C's fair hearing process. The managed care organization cannot request a disenrollment base d on adverse change in the member's health status or utilization of servi ces that are medically necessary for treatment of a member's condition. d) Impact of Nursing Facility Entry on Enrollment in STAR and STAR+PLUS. i.

The STAR+PLUS HCBS Program provides long-term care services and supports as identified in Table 5 to two groups of people, as defined below: i. STAR+PLUS 217-Like HCBS Group. This group consists of persons age 21 and older, who meet the NF level of care (L OC), who qualify as members of the 217-Like HCBS Group, and who need and are receiving HCBS as an alternative to NF care. The Demonstration population includes pers ons who could have been eligible under 42 CFR 435.217 had the state continued its s ection 1915(c) HCBS waiver for persons who are elderly and/or physically disabl ed. This group is subject to a numeric enrollment limitation, as described below. (A) Interest List for STAR+PLUS 217-LIKE HCBS Group. The state will operate an interest list for the STAR+PLUS 217-Like HCBS population in the demonstration. An interest list is a waiting list that an individual is placed on when they express interest in enrollme nt, to the state or local agency that determines eligibility for STAR +PLUS. Individuals meeting all eligibility criteria are enrolled into this population on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis from the interest list, except that persons entering the demonstration through Money Follows the Person (MFP) are placed at the h ead of the interest list. These lists must be managed on a statewide basis us ing a standardized assessment tool, and in accord with criteria establis hed by the state. Interest list policies must be based on objective criteria and applied consiste ntly in all geographic areas served. Persons living in the service areas provided in Column B, E, and F of Table 1 that are on an interest list for the CBA 19 15(c) waiver program at the time of Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 42 of 454 transition to STAR+PLUS must be include d in the STAR+PLUS interest list, and be offered enrollment in the same priori ty order as would have occurred if STAR+PLUS had been in place at the tim e of their initial application.

Column C reflects changes that take eff ect September 1, 2014: (1) an estimated 4,344 number of CBA 1915(c) participants who ar e SSI-related who will transfer to HCBS in demonstration year four due to the e xpansion of STAR+PLUS, (2) an estimated 582 individuals who are SSI related and will move from the CBA interest list into HCBS, and (3) approximately 72 SSI-related individuals who will enroll in HCBS through the MFP Demonstration. The number of SSI-related participants is assumed to follow normal STAR+PLUS enrollment gr owth in demonstration year five. Table 4b. Unduplicated Number of Pa rticipants for the SSI-Related Eligible Group Demonstration Year Column A Column B Column C Total DY 1 16,587 6,336 n/a for STAR+PL US HCBS Benefits. Individuals can be eligible for HCBS under STAR+PLUS depending upon their medical and / or functional needs, financial eligibility designation as a member of the 217-Like STAR+PLUS HCBS Group or an SSI-related recipient, and the ability of the St ate to provide them with safe, appropriate, and cost-effective LTC services. Medical and / or functional needs are assess ed according to LOC criteria published by the State in State rules. Th ese LOC criteria will be used in assessing eligibility for STAR+PLUS HCBS benefits through the 217-Like or SSI-related eligibility pathways. For an individual to be eligible for HCBS services, the State must have determined that the individual's cost to provide services is equal to or less than 202 percent of the cost of the level of car e in a nursing facility. e) Freedom of Choice. The service coordinators employed by the managed care organizations must be required to inform each applicant or member of any alternatives available, including the choice of institutiona l care versus home and community based services, during the assessment process. The Freedom of Choice Form must be incorporated into the Service Plan. The a pplicant or member must sign this form to indicate that he or she freely choices waiver services over institutional care. The managed care organization's service coordina tor also addresses living arrangements, choice of providers, and available third party resources durin g the assessment. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 45 of 454 f) Service Plan. In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7 441.301(b)(1)(i), a participant-centered service plan of care must be developed for each participant. All waiver services must be furnished pursuant to the service plan, accord ing to the projected frequency and type of provider. The service plan must also desc ribe the other services, regardless of the funding source, and the informal supports that complement waiver services in meeting the needs of the participant. The service pl an is subject to the approval of the HHSC. Federal financial participati on (FFP) may not be claimed for waiver services furnished prior to the development of th e service plan or for services that are not included in the service plan. g) Benefit Package under the ST AR+PLUS HCBS Program. The following Table 5 describe the benefits available to HCBS participants, whether in the 217-Like HCBS Group or the SSI-related group, that are provider-directed and, if the participant elects the option, self-directed. The services are further defined in Attachment C. Table 5 HCBS Services Service Provider Directed Participant Directed Personal Assistance Service X X Respite X X Financial Management Services X Support Consultation X X Adaptive Aids and Medical Supplies X Adult Foster Care X Assisted Living X Dental Services X Emergency Response Services X Home Delivered Meals X Minor Home Modifications X Nursing X X Occupational Therapy X X Physical Therapy X X Speech, Hearing, and Language Therapy X X Transition Assistance Services X Cognitive Rehabilitation Therapy (Effective March 6, 2014) X X Supported Employment Services (Effective September 1, 2014) X X Employment Assistance Services (Effective September 1, 2014) X X h) Self-Direction of Home and Community Based Services.

The services, goods, and supports that a participant self-direct s will still be included in the calculations of the participant's budget. Participant's budge t plans will reflect the plan for purchasing these needed services, goods, and supports. i. Information and Assistance in Suppo rt of Participant Direction. The state shall have a support system that provides pa rticipants with in formation, training, counseling, and assistance, as needed or de sired by each participant, to assist the participant to effectively direct and mana ge their self-directe d services and budgets. Participants shall be informed about self-dir ected care, including f easible alternatives, before electing the self-direc tion option. Participants shall also have access to the support system throughout the time that they are self-directing their care. Support activities must include, but are not limited to, financial management services and support consultation, defined as follows. (A) Financial Management Services. Financial management services provide assistance to members with managing funds associated with the services elected for self-direction. Financial management services include initial orientation and ongoing training related to re sponsibilities of be ing an employer, and adhering to legal requirements for employers. The fina ncial management services providers, referred to as the Financial Management Services Agency (CDSA), serves as the member's employer-agent, which is th e Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) designation of the entity responsible for making paya bles and withholding, and filing and depositing taxes on be half of the members. As the employer-agent, the CDSA files required forms and report s to the Texas Workforce Commission. (B) Support Consultation. Support Consultation offers pr actical skills training and assistance to enable an individual to successfully direct those services the individual elects for participant-direction. This service is pr ovided by a certified support advisor, and includes skills trai ning related to recr uiting, screening, and hiring workers, preparing j ob descriptions, verifying employment eligibility and qualifications, completion of documents required to employ an individual, management of workers, and development of effective back-up plans for services considered critical to the individual's health and welf are in the absence of the regular provider or an emergency situat ion. Support consultation is provided only by a certified support advisor ce rtified by the Department of Aging and Disability Services. ii. Participant Direction by Representative. The participant who self-directs one or more services may appoint a volunteer desi gnated representative to assist with or perform employer responsibilities to the extent approved by the participant. The participant documents the employer res ponsibilities, and that only a non-legal representative freely chosen by the participant or legally authorized representative may serve as the designated representative to assist in performance of employer Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 47 of 454 responsibilities, to the ex tent desired by the individua l or legally authorized representative. The partic ipant documents the employer responsibilities that the designated representative may and may not perform on the participant's behalf. iii. Participant Budget Authority. The participant's budget authority is operated and developed as follows: (A) The participant has budget authority a nd decision-making authority over the budget to reallocate funds among services in cluded in the budget; to determine the amount paid for services within the State' s established limits; to substitute service providers and to schedule the provision of services; to specify additional service provider qualifications consistent with established criteria; to specify the provision of services consistent with serv ice specifications in Attachment C for services that may be self-directed as sp ecified in Table 5; to identify service providers and refer for provider enrollm ent; to authorize payment for waiver goods and services; and to review and approve provider invoices for services rendered. (B) All participants, in conjunction with the CDSA, must develop a budget based on the service plan. The amount of funds incl uded in the service plan is calculated by the service planning team based on th e planned waiver services and the adopted reimbursement rate. The service plan is developed in the same manner for the participant who elects to have se rvices delivered through the consumer directed services option as it is for the participant w ho elects to have services delivered through the traditional provider-managed option. With approval of the CDSA, the participant may make revisions to a specific service budget that does not change the am ount of funds available for the service in the approved service plan. Revisions to the service plan amount available for a particular service, or a request to shift funds from one self-dir ected waiver service component to another, must be justified by the participant's service planning team and authorized by the MCO. (C) Modifications to the partic ipant directed budget must be preceded by a change in the service plan. iv. Disenrollment from Self-Direction. A participant may vol untarily disenroll from the self-directed option at any time and return to a traditi onal service delivery system. A participant may also be involuntarily di senrolled from the se lf-directed option for cause, if continued participat ion in the consumer directed services option would not permit the participant's health, safety, or welf are needs to be met, or the participant or the participant's representative, when provided with additional support from the CDSA, or through Support Consultation, has no t carried out employer responsibilities in accordance with the requirements of this option. If a participant is terminated Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 48 of 454 voluntarily or involuntarily from the self-d irected service delive ry option, the State will transition the participant to the tradit ional agency direction option and will have safeguards in place to ensure continuity of services. i) Fair Hearing. For standard appeals, members ha ve a right to access the fair hearing process at any time. For expedited appeals, members must exhaust the MCO's expedited appeals process before making a request for an expedited HHSC fair hearing. Procedures related to fair hearings are described in Attachment F. j) Participant Safeguards . The state must follow all me mber safeguard procedures as described in Attachment G of these STCs. 42. Quality Improvement Strategy for the STAR+PLUS HCBS Program. The state will abide by the Quality Improvement Strategy that existed under the section 1915(c) waivers under the STAR+PLUS program prior to this Demonstration. The Quality Improvement Strategy is described in detail in Attachments D and E. This Quality Improvement Strategy will remain in full force until CMS approves the comprehensive quality strategy described in paragraph 27. VI.

Funds may be used to defray the actual uncompensated cost of medical services that meet the definition of \"medical assistan ce\" contained in section 1905(a) of the Act, that are provided to Medicaid e ligible or uninsured individuals incurred by hospitals, clinics, or by other provider t ypes, as agreed upon by CMS and the state and defined at subparagraph (iv) below. Expenditures must be claimed in accordance with CMS-approved claiming protocols for each provider type and application form in Attachment H. FFP is not available fo r any UC Payments other than Transition Payments in DY 1 prior to CMS approval of the claiming protocol and application for that particular provider type for which paym ents are sought. For any provider seeking to receive UC Payments in DY1, the tota l payment under the Medicaid state plan, Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) a llotment, UC Payments, and Transition Payments cannot exceed the actu al cost of providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured as defined in th e cost claiming protocol. i. UC Application. To qualify for a UC Payment, a provider must submit to the state an annual UC Application that will collect cost and paymen t data on services eligible for reimbursement under the UC Pool. Data collected from the application will form the basis for UC Payments made to indivi dual hospitals and non- hospital providers. The state must require hospitals to report data in a manner that is consistent with the Medicare 2552-96 cost report, or for non- hospital providers, a CMS-approved cost report consistent with Medicare cost reporting principles. (A) After CMS has approved the applicable protocol, the state may begin accepting applications from providers for UC Paym ents in DY 1. Thereafter, providers are required to submit their UC Applications to the State by September 30 of each year, in order to qualify for a UC Pool payment for the DY that begins on October 1st. (B) Cost and payment data included on the appl ication must be based on the Medicare 2552-96 cost report, or for non-hospital providers, a CMS-approved cost report consistent with Medicare cost reporting pr inciples for a federal fiscal year (FFY) Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 50 of 454 that is two years prior to the DY in whic h UC Payments are to be made, in order to allow time for providers to finalize thei r cost reports from that data year and submit their application data to HHSC. (For example, FFY 2010 would be the data year for UC Payments under the UC pool in DY 1.) The state may trend the data to model costs incurred in the year in which payments are to be made. Subsequent DY applications will be used to reconcile estimates for prior years. For example, uncompensated care cost data from a DY 3 application will be used to determine the actual uncompensa ted care for DY 1 UC Payments for a qualifying provider. Any overpayments id entified in the reconciliation process that occurred in a prior year must be recouped from the provider, with the FFP returned to CMS. During the reconciliati on process, if a provider demonstrates that it has allowable uncompens ated costs consistent with the protocol that were not reimbursed through the ini tial UC Payment (based on application figures), and the state has available UC Pool funding for the year in which the costs were accrued, the state may provide reimburs ement for those actual documented unreimbursed UC costs through a prior period of adjustment. (C) Any provider that meets the criteria belo w may submit a UC Application to be eligible to receive a UC Payment. (I) Private providers must have an executed indigent care affiliation agreement on file with HHSC. (II) Only providers participating in a RHP ar e eligible to receive a UC Payment, although exceptions may be approved by CMS on a case by case basis. (D) When submitting the UC Application, pr oviders may request that cost and payment data from the data year be adjust ed to reflect increases or decreases in costs, resulting from changes in opera tions or circumstances. A provider may request that: i. Costs not reflected on the filed cost report, but which would be incurred for the spending year, be included when calculating payment amounts; or ii. Costs reflected on the filed cost repo rt, but which would not be incurred for the spending year, be excluded when calculating payment amounts. Adjustments described in subparagraphs (I) and (II) above cannot be considered as part of the application for reconciliation of a prior year payment. Such costs must be properly documented by the provi der, and are subject to review by the State. Such costs are subject to reconcilia tion to future year applications to ensure that providers actually incurred such eligible uncompensated costs. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 51 of 454 (E) All applicable inpatient and outpati ent hospital UC payments, including Transition Payments, received by a hospital provider count as title XIX revenue, and must be included as offsetting reve nue in the State's annual DSH audit reports. Providers receiving both DSH and UC Payments cannot receive total payments under the State plan and the UC Pool (related to inpatient and outpatient hospital services) that exceed the hospital's total eligib le uncompensated costs. UC Payments for physicians, non-physicia n professionals, pharmacy, and clinic costs are not considered inpatient or outpatient Medicaid payments for the purpose of annual hospital specific DSH limits and the DSH audit rule. All reimbursements must be made in accor dance with CMS approved cost-claiming protocols that are consistent with th e Medicare 2552-96 cost report or, for non- hospital providers, a CMS approved cost re port consistent w ith Medicare cost reporting principles. ii. UC Payment Protocol. The state must submit for CMS approval a funding and reimbursement protocol that will establish rules and guidelines fo r the State to claim FFP for UC Payments. The state may not claim FFP for any UC Payments until a draft UC Protocol is submitted to CMS by March 1, 2012, and such protocol is approved by CMS. The approved UC Payment Protocol will become Attachment H to these STCs. The UC Payment Protocol mu st include precise defi nitions of eligible uncompensated provider costs and revenues that must be included in the calculation of uncompensated cost. The Protocol will also identify the allowable source documents to support costs; it will include detailed instructions regarding the calculation and documentation of eligible co sts, the tool used by the State and providers to apply for UC Payments, and a timetable and reconciliation of payments against actual cost documentation. This process will align the application process (based on prior cost periods) to the reconc iliation process (using the application costs from subsequent years to reconcile earlier payments). Protocols will contain not only allowable costs and revenues, it will also indicate the tw elve (12) month period for which the costs will apply. The State must submit a UC Payment Protocol for each non-hospital provider type that may seek UC payments. FFP will not be available for UC Payments made to a non-hospital provider type until a cost-claimi ng protocol consistent with the Medicare cost reporting principles is approved by CMS. . iii. UC Payments to Hospitals and Physician Groups in DY 1. The state will allow eligible hospitals and physicia n groups (see paragraph 44(b) Transition Payments) to submit a CMS-approved UC Application in DY 1 to be eligible for UC Payments in DY 1. Eligible hospitals and physician gr oups that do not submit a UC Application will only be eligible for Transition Paymen ts in DY 1, as described in section (b) below. For eligible hospitals and physicia n groups that submit a UC Application, the State will reconcile the Transition Payments and UC Payments made to ensure the total UC Pool payments paid in DY 1 do not exceed the total amount of actual UC Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 52 of 454 costs in that year. Hospit als and physician groups that are paid based on the UC Application will be subject to the reconc iliation provisions described in subsection (a)(i)(B) above. All UC and Transition Pa yments made for DY 1 are subject to UC Pool annual limits for DY 1. iv. UC Payments to Non-Hospital Providers. UC Payments may be provided only to the following qualifying non-hospital providers: physician practice groups, government ambulance providers, government dental provi ders, and other providers in rural RHPs with no public hospitals. The state cannot clai m FFP for UC Payments made to providers of the types listed here until CMS has approved an uncompensated care protocol specific to that provider type, which will be incorpor ated into Attachment H. UC Payments are considered to be Medicaid payments to provide rs and must be treate d as Medicaid revenue when determining total title XIX funding receiv ed, in particular for any provider utilizing certified public expenditures as the non- Federal share of a Medicaid payment. v. Annual Reporting Requirements for UC Payments . The state will submit to CMS two reports related to the amount of UC Payments made from the UC Pool per Demonstration year. The reporti ng requirements are as follows: a. By December 31st of each Demonstration year, starting with DY 2, the State shall provide the following information to CMS: i. The UC payment applications submitted by eligible providers; and ii. A chart of estimated UC Payments to each provider for a DY. b. Within ninety (90) days after the end of each Demonstration year, beginning with the end of DY 2, the State shall provide the following information to CMS: i. The UC Payment applications submitted by eligible providers; ii. A chart of actual UC payments to each provider for the previous DY; iii. For reconciliation payments to provide rs, the UC payments made to the provider in the prior Demonstration year and the reconciliation costs against the actual payments made to said provider. b. Transition Payments. During DY 1 only, the state will make Transition Payments to hospitals and physician groups that received supplemental payments under the Medicaid State plan for claims adjudicated during FFY 2011. This transition period ensures that these providers are eligible to secure historical Medicaid f unding as the state develops the pool payment methodologies. These Transition Payments are available only during DY 1 subject to UC pool annual limits for DY 1. No protocol must be approved by CMS for the state Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 53 of 454 to make Transition Payments; instead, Transi tion Payments are subject to the following requirements: i) A hospital or physician group is eligible to receive Transition Payments if it: (A) Is enrolled as a Texas Medicaid provider; (B) Received a supplemental payment under the Medicaid State plan for claims adjudicated in one or more months between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011; (C) Has a source of intergovernmental tran sfer (IGT) or State general revenue appropriated as the non-federal share of the Transition Payment consistent with section 1903(w) of the Act; and (D) Submitted any documentation that would have been required to receive a supplemental payment under the State Plan to HHSC before September 30, 2011, and submits any other documentation requested by HHSC. ii. Transition Payments will be based on the following methodology: (A) Participating hospitals and physician groups will be eligible to receive total Transition Payments equal to the amount the provider received in supplemental payments for claims adjudicated during FFY 2011, annualized to cover the entire twelve (12) month period of DY 1. (B) Participating providers are eligible to receive one-fourth of their total Transition Payment amount each quarter in DY 1, beginning October 1, 2011, through the quarter ending September 30, 2012. (C) The state must provide CMS with a list of all hospitals and phys ician groups that will receive Transition Payments under th is section, as well as the amounts of 2011 State plan supplemental payments and 2012 (DY 1) Transition Payments. The state must identify the source of funding for each DY 1 Transition Payment as a part of this list. (I) The state will provide a list of estimated maximum Transition Payments within forty-five (45) days of approval of the Demonstration; and (II) The state will provide a list of actual Tr ansition Payments made within ninety (90) days of the end of DY 1. iii. For hospitals qualifying for and receiving DSH payments for FFY 2012, Transition Payments are considered title XIX payments and must be treated as revenues when determining DSH Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 54 of 454 eligible uncompensated costs as part of the annual DSH audits, except for transition payments related to hospital- based physician practice groups. iv. The supplemental provider payments to hos pitals and physicians made in November and December 2011 under the Medicaid State plan in the amount of $466,091,028 will be considered as if they were payments under this Demonstration, and will be included in the budget neutrality test, and the amount availabl e as payment from the UC Pool. The state may count these payments under the UC Pool limit for any of the five years of the demonstration. v. The state may not receive FFP for UC Paymen ts, other than those described here in paragraph 44(b), until the UC Protocol is approved by CMS. 45. Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Pool. The DSRIP Pool is available for the development of a progr am of activity that supports hospitals' efforts to enhance access to health care, the quality of care, and the health of the patients and families they serve. The program of activity funded by the DSRIP shall be based in Regional Healthcare Partnerships (RHPs) that are directly responsive to the need s and characteristics of the populations and communities comprising the RHP. Each RHP will have geographic boundaries, and will be directed and financiall y supported by a public hospital or a local governmental entity with the authority to ma ke intergovernmental tr ansfers (IGTs). In collaboration with participating providers, the public hospital or local governmental entity will develop a delivery reform and incentive plan that is rooted in the intensive learning and sharing that will accelerate meaningful improve ment within the providers participating in the RHP. Individual hospitals' DSRIP proposal s must flow from the RHP plans, and be consistent with the hospitals' shared mission and quality goals within the RHP, as well as CMS's overarching approach for improving heal th care through the simultaneous pursuit of three aims: better care for indi viduals (including access to care, quality of care, and health outcomes; better health for the population; and lower cost through improvement (without any harm whatsoever to individuals, families or communities). a) Focus Areas. There are 4 areas for which f unding is available under the DSRIP, each of which has explicit connection to the achievement of the Three Part Aim. Projects will be identified within the fo llowing categories, and included in the full list of projects provided in the RHP Pla nning Protocol, and may include projects such as those identified below within each category. ii. Category 1: Infrastructure Development - This category lays the foundation for delivery system transformation through inve stments in technology, tools, and human resources that will strengthen the abili ty of providers to serve populations and continuously improve services: Expand primary care capacity, Expand behavioral healthcare capacity, Expand specialty care capacity, Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 55 of 454 Expand clinical and administrative reporting systems that support quality improvement, Increase training of primary care workforce, and Expand reporting and HIT systems and capabilities. iii. Category 2: Program Innovation and Redesign - This category includes the piloting, testing, and replicat ing of innovative care models: Primary care redesign, Behavioral healthcare redesign, Increase specialty care acce ss/redesign referral process, Adoption of medical homes, Expansion of chronic care management models, Implement /expand care transition programs, and Implement real-time Hospital acquired Infections (HAI) system. iv. Category 3: Quality Improvements - This category includes outcome reporting and improvements in care that can be achieved within four years. v. Category 4: Population Focused Improvements - This category includes reporting measures across several domains selected by a RHP based on community assessments that demonstrate the impact of delivery syst em reform investments made in previous years under the Demonstration. The domains may include: Patient experience, Preventive health, Care coordination, and At-risk groups. b. Regional Healthcare Partnerships. Regional Healthcare Partnerships will be developed throughout the state to more eff ectively and efficiently deliver care and provide increased access to care for low-in come Texans. Each RHP will include a variety of healthcare providers to adequate ly respond to the needs of the community, and the process of forming each RHP will evidence meaningful participation by all interested providers. Each RHP will be anchored financially (i.e. single point of contact for the RHP) by a public hosp ital (or in areas with no public hospital, anchored financially by the governmental entity providing IGTs to su pport funding pool payments) that will be responsible for deve loping the RHP's DSRIP plan in coordination with other identified RHP provi ders. To the extent that the public hospital is a government entity eligible to participate in the funding of the Medicaid program, they may be the source of the non-Federal share. The RHP DSRIP plan will identify the community needs, the projects, and investments under the DSRIP to address those needs, community healthcare partners, the he althcare challenges, a nd quality objectives within the RHP and the metrics described in state protocol associat ed with each project Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 56 of 454 and quality objective. These plans must be submitted to the state and CMS for approval, and must delineate total DSRIP fundi ng associated with the plan. c. Hospital DSRIP Plans within the RHP. RHP anchoring entities providing IGT for Uncompensated Care (UC) DSRIP Paymen ts within an RHP will develop RHP plans in good faith, to leverage public and non-public hospital and other community resources to best achieve delivery system transformation goals within RHP areas consistent with the Demonstration's requirements. RHP plan s shall include estimated funding available by year to support UC and DSRIP payments, and specific allocation of funding to UC and to DSRIP projects proposed within th e RHP plan. RHP anchoring entities shall provide opportunities for public input to the development of RHP plans, and shall provide opportunities for discussion and review of pr oposed RHP plans prior to plan submission to the state. In accordance with the guideli nes specified in the RHP Planning Protocol (see paragraph 45(d)(ii)(A) RHP Planning Protocol ), a final RHP DSRIP Plan must include maximum payment amounts for UC and DSRIP Payments. These amounts may be proportionally adjusted based on available non-Federal share. d. DSRIP Plans and Protocols. The state may not claim DSRI P funding until the following milestones have been met: i. By March 31, 2012, the state must submit to CMS for approval a document that describes the State's plan for and status on formi ng the RHPs, identifying the public hospitals directing each RHP, and the gene ral projects and quality measur es to be addressed in each RHP DSRIP, and potential provider partners that will comprise the RHP. ii. No later than August 31, 2012, CMS, the state and Texas hospitals will, through a collaborative process, finalize the followi ng two protocols to implement the DSRIP program. (A) RHP Planning Protocol : This protocol will include a master list of potential project/interventions for each Category 1-4 and related milestones, and metrics which RHPs may select from, in developi ng their 5-year plans. When developing the RHP Planning Protocol, the state should consider ways to structure the different projects that will facilitate the collection, dissemination, and comparison of valid quantitative data to support the Evaluation Desi gn required in Section X. From these, the state must select a pref erred research plan for the applicable research question, and provide a rationale fo r its selection. To the extent possible, RHPs should use similar metrics for similar projects across RHPs to enhance the evaluation and learning experience between RHPs. To facilitate evaluation, the RHP Planning Protocol must identify a core set of Category 3 and Category 4 metrics that all participating hospitals mu st be required to report. This RHP Planning Protocol will become Attachment I. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 57 of 454 (B) Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol: This protocol will include information on State and CMS review and approval processes for RHP plans, RHP and State reporting requirements, incentive payment mechanisms and payment methodologies, and penalties for mi ssed milestones. This protocol will become Attachment J. vi. No later than October 31, 2012, urban and rural RHPs must submit their final RHP DSRIP Plans to the State and CMS for approval. Except for Category 3 for non- hospital RHPs, the final RHP DSRIP Plan s must address all four focus areas described in paragraph 45(a). The final RHP DSRIP Plan must also identify the metrics that will be used by each provider se lecting that project within the RHP, so that all providers selecting a particular project or quality measure will be held to the same standard reporting requirement. The final RHP DSRIP Plan will also include payment methodologies for each metric pr oviding an annual maximum budget for each final RHP DSRIP Plan, and penalties for missed milestones. vii. Payments from the DSRIP Pool may begin during DY 1, based on approved final RHP DSRIP Plans and successful completion of the metrics associated with DSRIP incentive payments. The State will not cl aim FFP for DSRIP Payments until the RHP Planning Protocol and Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol are approved by CMS. e. DSRIP Payments are Not Direct Reimburseme nt for Expenditures or Payments for Services. Payments from the DSRIP pool are in tended to support and reward hospital systems and other providers for improvements in their delivery systems that support the simultaneous pursuit of improving the experi ence of care, impr oving the health of populations, and reducing per capita costs of health care. Payments from the DSRIP Pool are not considered patient care revenue, and shall not be offset ag ainst disproportionate share hospital expenditures or other Medicaid ex penditures that are rela ted to the cost of patient care (including stepped down costs of administration of such care) as defined under these Special Terms and Conditions , and/or under the State Plan. 46. Limits on Pool Payments. Expenditures eligible for FFP for UC Pool and DSRIP Pool in each DY may not exceed the amounts shown in Table 6. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 58 of 454 Table 6. Pool Allocations According to Demonstration Year (total computable) Type of Pool DY 1 (2011-2012) DY 2 (2012- 2013) DY 3 (2013- 2014) DY 4 (2014-2015) DY 40% 47. Assurance of Budget Neutrality. a. By October 1 of each year, the State must submit an assessment of budget neutrality to CMS, including a summation of all expenditu res and member months already reported to CMS, estimates of expenditures already incu rred but not reporte d, and projections of future expenditures and member months to the end of the Demons tration, broken out by DY and Medicaid Eligibility Group (M EG) or other spending category. b. Should the report in (a) indicat e that the budget neutrality Annual Target for any DY has been exceeded, or is projected to be exceeded, the State must propose adjustments to the limits on UC Pool and DSRIP Pool limits, su ch that the Demonstration will again be budget neutral on an annual basis, and over th e lifetime of the Demonstration. The new limits will be incorporated through an amendment to the Demonstration. 48. Transition Plan for Funding Pools. No later than March 31, 2015, the State shall submit a transition plan to CMS based on the experien ce with the DSRIP pool, actual uncompensated care trends in the State, and investment in value based purch asing or other payment reform options. 49. 1115A Duals Demonstration Savings. When Texas' section 1115(a) demonstration is considered for an amendment, renewal, and at the end of the duals demonstration, CMS' Office of the Actuary (OACT) will estimate and certify actual title XIX savings to date under the duals demonstration attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration. This amount will be su btracted from the 1115(a) budget neutrality savings approved for the renewal. Specifically, OACT will estimate and certify act ual title XIX savings attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration following the methodology below. The actual title XIX savings attributable to populations and servic es provided under the 1115(a) demonstration are equal to the savings percentage specified in the 1115A duals Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 59 of 454 demonstration MOU multiplied by the Medica id portion of the 1115A demonstration capitation rate and the number of 1115A duals demonstration be neficiaries enrolled in the 1115(a) demonstration. The Medicaid portion of the 1115A Demonstration capitation rate is reviewed by CMS's Medicare and Medi caid Coordination Office (MMCO), MMCO's contracted actuaries and CMS' Office of th e Actuary (OACT), and was certified by the state's actuaries. Per the 1115A duals demons tration MOU, the actual Medicaid rate paid for beneficiaries enrolled in the 1115A demons tration is equivalent to the state's 1115A Medicaid capitation rate minus an established savings percentage (as outlined in the chart below). The state must track the number of member months for every Medicare-Medicaid enrollee (MME) who participates in both the 1115(a) and 1115A demonstration. The table below provides an illustrative ex ample of how the savi ngs attributable to populations and services provided under th e 1115(a) demonstrati on is calculated A. 1115A Demonstration Year B. Medicaid Capitation Rate (hypothetical) C. Medicaid Savings Percentage Applied Per MOU (average) D. Savings Per Month (B*C) E. Member Months of MMEs who participated in 1115A and 1115(a) Demos (estimated) F. $55.00 PMPM $55,000 In each quarterly report, the state must provi de the information in the above-named chart (replacing estimated figures with actual data ). Should rates differ by geographic area and/or rating category within the 1115A demo nstration, this table should be done for each geographic area and/or rating ca tegory. In addition, the state must show the \"amount subtracted from the 1115(a) budget neutrality savings\" in the updated budget neutrality Excel worksheets that are submitted in each quarterly report. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 60 of 454 Finally, in each quarterly CMS-64 submission a nd in each quarterly report, the state must indicate in the notes section: \"For purposes of 1115(a) de monstration budget neutrality reporting purposes, the state reports the following information: Number of Medicare-Medicai d enrollees served under th e 1115 duals demonstration = [Insert number] Number of member months = [Insert number] PMPM savings per dual beneficiary enroll ed from the 1115A duals demonstration = [Insert number] The State must make the necessary retroa ctive adjustments to the budget neutrality worksheets to reflect modifications to the rates paid in the 1115A demonstration. This must include any Medicaid payment triggered by the risk corridor , IGTs, or other retroactive adjustments. The State must add additional columns to the chart above in subsequent quarterly reporting to refl ect those adjustments. VII. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS This project is approved for title XIX expenditu res applicable to serv ices rendered during the demonstration period. Effective January 1, 2014 , this project is approved for title XXI expenditures applicable to services rendered dur ing the demonstration pe riod for certain children ages 6-18 between 100-133% FPL. This section de scribes the general fina ncial requirements for these expenditures. 50. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. The state must provide quart erly title XIX expenditure reports using Form CMS-64, to separately repor t total expenditures for services provided through this Demonstration under section 1115 authority that are subject to budget neutrality. This project is approved for expenditures applicab le to services rendered during the Demonstration period. CMS shall pr ovide FFP for allowable Demonstration expenditures, only as long as they do not exceed the pre-defined limits on the costs incurred, as specified in Section VIII. The state shall provide quarterly title XXI expenditure reports using the Form CMS64.21U/CMS64.21UP to report total title XXI e xpenditures for services provided to M- CHIP children under the section 1115 authority until its XXI allotment is spent and then using the 64.9/64.9P Waiver form with waiv er name of \"THTQIP-M-CHIP.\" CMS will provide Federal financial participation (FFP) for allowable Texas title XXI demonstration expenditures that do not exceed the state's av ailable title XXI fundi ng and then Federal participation at the enhanced rate under Titl e XIX once the state's Title XXI funding is fully exhausted. 51. Expenditures Subject to the title XIX B udget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. a. All expenditures for Medicaid se rvices for demonstration pa rticipants (as defined in paragraphs 28 [Table 2], 29, 33 [Table 3] , and 41 [Table 5]) are demonstration Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 61 of 454 expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, except expenditures for the services listed as follows: i. Nursing facility services (for date s of service before March 1, 2015); ii. Medical transportation; iii. Medicare premiums; iv. In Column D counties only, Community Base d Alternatives 1915(c) waiver services, primary home care and day activity and health services (for dates of service before September 1, 2014), and v. Other 1915(c) waiver programs as follows : Medically Dependent Children Program (TX 0181), Consolidated Waiver Program (TX 0373 and TX 0374), with Home a nd Community-Based Services (TX 0110), Community Living Assistance and Support Services (TX 0221), Texas Home Living (TX 0403), and Youth Empowerment Services (TX 0657). b. All Funding Pool expenditures (as defined in Section VI) are Demonstration expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit. 52. Reporting Expenditures in the Demonstration. The following describes the reporting of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit: a. Use of Waiver Forms. In order to track expenditures under this Demonstration, the State must report Demonstration expenditures th rough the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS-64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual (SMM). All Demonstration expenditures claime d under the authority of title XIX of the Act, and subject to the budget neutrality expend iture limit, must be reported each quarter on separate Forms CMS-64.9 Waiver and/ or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the Demonstration Project Number ( 11-W-00278/6) assigned by CMS. b. Reporting By Date of Service. In each quarter, Demonstra tion expenditures (including prior period adjustments) must be totale d and reported on separate Forms CMS-64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver by Demonstr ation Year (DY). The DY for which expenditures are reported is identified usi ng the project number extension (a 2-digit number appended to the Demonstration Projec t Number). Expenditures must be assigned to DYs on the basis of date of service (ex cept for pool payments, as discussed below). The date of service for premium payments is identified as the DY that includes the larger share of the month for which the payment is principally made. Pool payments must be reported by DY as follows: Transition payments must be reported for DY 1, UC Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 62 of 454 payments must be reported in a manner cons istent with the payment timeframes specified in the UC Pool Protocol, and DSRIP paymen ts must be reported based on the payment methodologies and annual maximum budgets specif ied in the final master DSRIP plans. DY 1 will be the year beginning October 1, 2011, and ending September 30, 2012, and subsequent DYs will be defined accordingly. c. Use of Waiver Forms. Each quarter, the State must identify separate forms CMS-64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver by Waiver Name to report expenditures that belong in the following categories: i. \"THTQIP-Adults\" - Medicaid service expendi tures for all partic ipating individuals whose MEG is as Adults; ii. \"THTQIP-Children\" - Medicaid service expe nditures for all participating individuals whose MEG is defined as Children; iii. \"THTQIP-AMR\" - Medicaid service expenditu res for all participating individuals who are aged, or who are disabled and ha ve Medicare, except for 1915(c) waiver services described in (v) below; iv. \"THTQIP-Disabled\" - Medicare service expe nditures for all participating individuals who are disabled and do not have Medicar e, except for 1915(c) waiver services described in (v) below; v. \"THTQIP-CBA 1915(c)\" - Expenditures for CBA 1915(c) waiver services for all individuals who reside in Column E counties that are not Column B counties (only used for expenditures with dates of service between October 1, 2011 and the implementation date of the Marc h 2012 STAR+PLUS expansion); vi. \"THTQIP-UC\" - All expenditures that count against UC Pool limits, except those described in (vii); vii. \"THTQIP-UC UPL\" - Medicaid State plan supplemental provider payments to hospitals or physician groups made between October 1, 2011 and the approval date of the Demonstration; and viii. \"THTQIP-DSRIP\" - All DSRIP Pool expenditures. ix. \"THTQIP-QUALIFIED\" - Medicaid servic e expenditures for all participating individuals whose MEG is defined as Qua lified aliens. Title XXI expenditures for this group are excluded from budget neutrality but are counted against the Title XXI allotment as described in paragraph (d) below. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 63 of 454 x. \"THTQIP-M-CHIP\" - All expenditures for children who are ages 6-18 and between 100-133% FPL, or children served in CH IP on December 31, 2013 due to assets in excess of Medicaid eligibility limits. Th ese are children who meet the definition of \"targeted low-income child\" specified in section 2110 (b)(1) of th e Social Security Act. Title XXI expenditures for this group are excluded from budget neutrality but are counted against the Title XXI allotment as described in paragraph (d) below. d. Title XXI Funded Groups in the Waiver. Expenditures for THTQIP-Qualified and THTQIP-M-CHIP under title XXI must be reported on separate Forms CMS-64 .21U and/or 64.21UP in accordance with the instructions in section 2115 of the St ate Medicaid Manual, identified using Waiver Name \"THTQIP-M-CHIP\" or \"THTQIP-QUALIFIED.\" i. Title XIX funds for children who are ages 6-18 and between 100-133% FPL meeting the definition of \"targeted low-income ch ild\" specified in section 2110(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (M-CHIP children) are available under this demonstration if the state exhausts its title XXI allotment once timely notification as described in subparagraph (iii) ha s been provided. ii. If the state exhausts its title XXI allotment prior to the end of a Federal fiscal year, title XIX Federal matching funds are availa ble for these M-CHIP children. During the period when title XIX funds are used, expe nditures related to this demonstration population must be reported as waiver expenditures on the Forms CMS 64.9 Waiver and/or CMS 64.9P Waiver, identified usi ng Waiver Name \"THTQIP-M-CHIP.\". To initiate this: 1. The state shall provide CMS with 120 days prior notice before it begins to draw down title XIX matching funds for the M-CHIP children demonstration population; 2. The State shall submit: c. An updated budget neutrality assessment that includes a data analysis which identifies the specific \"with waiver\" impact of the proposed change on the current budget neut rality expenditure cap. Such analysis shall include current total computable \"with waiver\" and \"without waiver\" status on both a su mmary and detailed level through the current extension approval peri od using the most recent actual expenditures, as well as summary and detailed projections of the change in the \"with waiv er\" expenditure total as result of the proposed change which isolates (b y Eligibility Group) the impact of the change; d. An updated CHIP allotment neutrality worksheet. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 64 of 454 iii. If the state exhausts its title XXI allotment pr ior to the end of a Federal fiscal year, the expenditures attributable to the M-CHIP children demonstration population will count toward the budget neutrality expenditure cap calculated under STC58, using the per member per month (PMPM) amounts for TANF Children described in STC 58(b)(ii), and will be considered expend itures subject to the budget ne utrality cap as defined in STC 56(a). e. Pharmacy Rebates. Because pharmacy rebates are not reflected in the data used to determine the budget neutrality expenditure limit, all pharmacy rebates must be reported on Forms CMS-64.9 Base or Forms CMS-64.9P Base, and not on any waiver form associated with this Demonstration. f. Cost Settlements. For monitoring purposes, cost settlements related to the Demonstration must be recorded on Line 7 or 10.B, in lieu of Line 9. For any other cost settlements (i.e., those not attr ibutable to this Demonstration), the adjustments should be reported, as instructed in th e State Medicaid Manual. The amount of non-claim specific cost settlements will be allocated to each DY based on the larger share of the coverage period for which the cost settlement is made. g. Premium and Cost Sharing Adjustments. Premiums and other applicable cost-sharing contributions that are collected by the State from enrollees under the Demonstration must be reported to CMS each quarter on Form CMS-64 Summary Sheet Line 9D, columns A and B. In order to assure that thes e collections are properly credited to the Demonstration, premium and cost-sharing collect ions (both total computable and Federal share) should also be reported separately by Demonstration Year on the Form CMS-64 Narrative. In the calculation of expenditure s subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, premium collections applicable to Dem onstration populations will be offset against expenditures. These section 1115 premium co llections will be included as a manual adjustment (decrease) to the Demonstration' s actual expenditures on a quarterly basis. h. Mandated Increase in Physician Payment Rates in 2013 and 2014. Section 1202 of the Health Care and Educa tion Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. Law 110-152) requires state Medicaid programs to pay physicians for primary care services at rates that are no less than what Medicare pays, for servi ces furnished in 2013 and 2014. The federal government provides a Federal medical assist ance percentage of 100 percent for the claimed amount by which the minimum payment exceeds the rates paid for those services as of July 1, 2009. The state may exclude from the budget neutrality test for this demonstration the portion of the increase for which the federal government pays 100 percent. These amounts should be re ported on the base forms CMS-64.9, 64.21, or 64.21U (or their \"P\" counterparts), and not on any waiver form. i. Administrative Costs. Administrative cost s are not included in the budget neutrality expenditure limit, but the State must separately track and report additional administrative Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 65 of 454 costs that are directly attri butable to the demonstration. All attributable administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS-64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver, using Waiver Name \"TX Reform Admin.\" j. Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol. The state must maintain a CMS-approved Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol, to be incorporated as Attachment K to these STCs, which explains the process the State will use to determine administrative costs incurred under the demonstration. CMS will pr ovide Federal financial participation (FFP) to the State at the regular 50 percent match rate for administrative costs incurred according to limitations set forth in the approve d Administrative Cost Claiming protocol. No FFP is allowed until a claimi ng protocol is approved by CMS. k. Claiming Period . All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditure s. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including any co st settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2-year period, the State must continue to identify separately on the CMS-64 waiver forms, the net expenditures rela ted to dates of serv ice during the operation of the section 1115 demonstration, in order to account for thes e expenditures properly to determine budget neutrality. 53. Reporting Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months for Demonstration participants. a. For the purpose of calculating the budget neut rality expenditure limit, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the quarterly report require d under paragraph 65 of these STCs, the actual number of eligible member months for all demons tration participants, according to the MEGs defined in paragraphs 28 (Table 2) and 29. b. To permit full recognition of \"in-process\" e ligibility, reported member month totals may be revised subsequently, as needed. To doc ument revisions to totals submitted in prior quarters, the State must report a new table wi th revised member month totals indicating the quarter for which the member month report is superseded. c. The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For exampl e, a person who is eligible for 3 months contributes 3 eligible member months to the to tal. Two individuals, who are eligible for 2 months each, contribute 2 eligible member months to the total, for a total of 4 eligible member months. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 66 of 454 54. Standard Medicaid and CHIP Funding Process. a. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the Demonstration. The State must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and Federal share) subject to the budget neutrality e xpenditure limit, and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each Federal fiscal year on the Form CMS-37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and Stat e and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS shall make Federal funds available ba sed upon the State's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the State must submit the Form CMS-64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconc ile expenditures reported on the Form CMS-64 with Federal funding previously made availabl e to the state, and in clude the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. b. The standard title XXI funding process will be used during the demonstration for M- CHIP children. The state must estimat e matchable M-CHIP expenditures on the quarterly Form CMS-37. As a footnote to the CMS-37, the state shall provide updated estimates of expenditures for the M-CHIP children demonstration populations. CMS will make Federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quart er, the state must submit the Form CMS-61.21 U-Waiver quarterly CHIP expenditure report. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS-64.21U-waiver with Federal f unding previously made available to the state, and include the reconcil ing adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 55. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration . Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non-Fe deral share of fundi ng (see paragraph 55, Sources of Non-Federal Share ), CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable Federal matching rates for the Demonstration as a whole as outlined below, subject to the budget neutrality limits described in section X of these STCs: a. Administrative costs, in cluding those associated with the administration of the Demonstration; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjust ments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid State plan and waiver authorities; c. Net expenditures and prior period adju stments, made under approved Expenditure Authorities granted through section 1115(a)(2 ) of the Act, with dates of service during the operation of the Demonstration; d. Net expenditures for Funding Pool payments. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 67 of 454 56. Sources of Non-Federal Share. The state certifies th at the matching non-Federal share of funds for the demonstr ation is state/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the ma tch for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non-Federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non-Federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a. CMS may review, at any time, the sources of the non-federal share of funding for the demonstration. The State agrees that a ll funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program shall require the State to provide information to CMS regarding all so urces of the non-Federa l share of funding. c. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 per cent of the STAR and STAR+PLUS reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as a demonstration expenditure. Moreover, no pre-arranged agreem ents (contractual or otherwise) may exist between the health care providers and the State and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Me dicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding th at payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as paymen ts related to taxes (including health care provider-related taxes), fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medica id payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. VIII. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRA LITY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION 57. Limit on Title XIX and XXI Funding. a) The state shall be subject to a limit on the am ount of federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expe nditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. The limit is determined by using a per capita cost method, with an aggregate adjustment for projected su pplemental provider payments. The budget neutrality expenditure targ ets are set on a yearly ba sis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. Actual expenditures subject to the budge t neutrality expenditure limit shall be reported by the state using the procedures described in Section VII. b) The state will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal title XXI funding that the state may receive on demonstration expe nditures for M-CHIP children during the demonstration period. Federal title XXI funding available for demonstration expenditures for M-CHIP children is limited to the state's available allotment, including currently availabl e reallocated funds and contingency funds. Should the state expend its available title XXI Federa l funds for the claiming period, no further enhanced title XXI Federal matching funds will be available for costs of the approved Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 68 of 454 title XXI child health program or demons tration until the next allotment becomes available. i. Exhaustion of title XXI Funds. After the State has exhausted title XXI funds, expenditures for M-CHIP children, may be claimed as title XIX expenditures. The State shall repor t expenditures for these children as waiver expenditures on the Forms CMS 64.9 Waiver and/or CMS 64.9P Waiver in accordance with paragraph 51.d. ii. Exhaustion of title XXI Funds Notification. The State must notify CMS in writing of any anticipated title XXI shortfall at least 120 days prior to an expected change in claiming of expenditures for the M-CHIP children. The State must follow Medicaid State pl an criteria for these beneficiaries unless specific waiver and expenditure authorities are granted through this demonstration. 58. Risk. Under this budget neutrality ag reement, Texas shall be at risk for the per capita cost of participating Medicaid a nd demonstration eligibles, but not for the number of demonstration eligibles. In this way, Te xas will not be at risk for changing economic conditions that impact enrollment levels; how ever, by placing Texas at risk for the per capita costs for Medicaid and demonstration eligibles, CMS assures that the Federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 59. Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit . The following describes the method for calculating the budget neutra lity expenditure limit: a. For each DY of the budget neutrality agreement, an Annual Target is calculated as the sum two components. i. The Per Capita Component is the sum of six sub-components, calculated as the projected per member per month (PMPM) cost, times the actual number of member months (reported by the State in accord ance with paragraph 52) for the MEGs identified in (b) below. ii. The Aggregate Component is a projection of what certain supplemental payments to providers would have cost each year in the absence of the Demonstration, as shown in (c) below. b. The following tables give the projected PMPM costs to be used in the Per Capita Component calculation in each DY. PMPM cost s for four of the six sub-components are shown in Table 8a, and for the remaining tw o sub-components are shown in Table 8b. i. Table 8a gives the projected without-waiver costs of medical services for included populations. The Base Year PMPMs incl ude fee-for-service claims and capitation Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 69 of 454 payments for Medicaid State plan servi ces and 1915(c) home and community based services, and an attributed share of inpa tient hospital supplemental payments, divided by base year member-months. FY 2012 Presid ent's Budget Medicaid Baseline trends are used to project without-waiver PMPM costs. ii. The PMPM amounts shown in Table 8b repr esent additional without-waiver costs that would have occurred for Adults and Ch ildren had the State carried out its plan to carve inpatient hospital services out from the capitated benefit for current STAR participants. These amounts follow the same President's Budget trends as the corresponding rows in Table 8a; however, per mutual agreement, these amounts will phase down to $0, starting in DY 3. The Base Medical PMPMs for AMR include NF costs, starting March 1, 2015 (DY 4). Table 8a - Projected PMPM Costs, Base Medical and Included UPL MEG Base Year PMPM (SFY 2010) Trend DY 1 DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 AMR FFSE and STAR UPL MEG Base Year PMPM (SFY 2010) Trend DY 1 DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 Adults The following table shows the calculation of the Aggregate Component for each DY. These projections were developed by the state and accepted by CMS, and are based on historical trends in supplemental payment am ounts and UPLs. They represent what the state would have paid in supplemental pr ovider payments in the absence of the demonstration. Table 9-- Aggregate Component Payment Stream DY 1 DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 Inpatient Hospital UPL for Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 70 of 454 Payment Stream DY 1 DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 Hospital UPL neutrality expe nditure limit is the Federal share of the combined total of the Annual Targets for all DYs, and is calculated as the sum of the A nnual Targets times the Composite Federal Share (defined in (e) below). This limit represents the maximum amount of FFP that the State may receive for title XIX expenditures during the Demonstration period. e. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP received by the State on actua l Demonstration expenditures during the approval period (as reported through the MB ES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C) by total computable Demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. f. CMS policy requires that budget neutral savi ngs cannot be derive d from hypothetical populations. In this Demonstration, the STAR+PLUS 217-Like HCBS Eligibility Group is the only hypothetical population. On re quest from CMS, the State must provide separate expenditure and member month totals by MEG for individuals in the STAR+PLUS 217-Like HCBS Eligib ility Group to allow any sa ving attributable to that group to be netted out of the budget neutrality calculation. 60. Future Adjustments to the Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutra lity expenditure limit to be c onsistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new Federal statutes, or policy interpretations implemented through letters, me moranda, or regulations with respect to the provision of services covered under this demons tration. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutral ity expenditure limit if any hea lth care-related tax that was in effect during the base year with respect to the provision of services covered under this Demonstration, or provider-related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of th e provider donation and health care-related tax provisions of section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act. Adjust ments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermi ssible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 61. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality . CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration rather than on an annual basis. However, if the State exceeds the calculated cumulative target limit by the percentage identified below for any of the DYs, the state shall submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 71 of 454 DY Cumulative Target Definition Percentage DY 1 Cumulative budget neutrality cap plus: 3 percent DY 2 Cumulative budget neutrali ty cap plus: 1 percent DY 3 Cumulative budget neutrality cap plus: 0.5 percent DY 4 Cumulative budget neutrality cap plus: 0 percent DY 5 Cumulative budget neutrality cap plus: 0 percent 62. Exceeding Budget Neutrality . If the budget neutrality expend iture limit has been exceeded at the end of this demonstrati on period, the excess Federal fund s shall be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is termin ated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, the budget neutrality test shall be based on the ti me elapsed through the termination date. 63. Future Managed Care Rates . The state will proceed with separate rate structures for institutional and home and community-based se rvices (HCBS) populations in managed care. The state will identify the current (March 2015) baseline of persons receiving HCBS and those receiving institutional services. By D ecember 31, 2015, the state will provide CMS an update based on early managed care experience on the mix of institutional and HCBS care, and if needed, will establish a goal in coordination with CMS to rebalance the mix of institutional and community-based services. In September of 2016, the state will provide evidence of progress towards that rebalanci ng goal, including identifying the number of community and institutional residents and evalua ting the effectiveness of measures taken to promote access to community-based care. Depe nding on the progress of this rebalancing, CMS may require the state, within a reasonabl e time frame, to develop and implement a blended managed care rate structure for th e institutional and community populations. IX. GENERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 64. General Financial Requirements. The state will comply w ith all general financial requirements under title XIX set forth in these STCs. 65. Reporting Requirements Relating to Budget Neutrality. The state will comply with all reporting requirements for monitoring budget neut rality set forth in these STCs. The State must submit any corrected budge t neutrality data upon request. 66. Monthly Calls. CMS shall schedule monthly conference calls with the state. The purpose of these calls is to discuss any significant actu al or anticipated developments affecting the demonstration. Areas to be addressed include, but are not limited to: a. The health care delivery system; b. Enrollment, quality of care, and access to care; c. The benefit package; Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 72 of 454 d. Performance of hospitals according receiving incentive payments as described in the STCs; e. Audits, lawsuits; f. Financial reporting and budge t neutrality issues; g. Progress on evaluations; h. State legislative developments; and i. Any Demonstration amendments, concept pa pers or State plan amendments under consideration by the State. CMS shall update the state on any amendments or concept papers under review as well as federal policies and issues that may aff ect any aspect of the demonstrat ion. The state and CMS (both the Project Officer and Regional Office) shall jointly develop the agenda for the calls. 67. Demonstration Quarterly Reports. The state will submit progress reports 60 days following the end of each quarter (Attachment B) . Information required for the first quarter of DY 1 (December 2011 - February 2011) will be in cluded in the second quarter report for DY 2 (March 2012 - May 2012). The intent of these reports is to present the State's analysis and the status of the various operati onal areas. These quarter ly reports will include, but are not limited to : a. A discussion of the events occurring during th e quarter or the antici pated to occur in the near future that affect health care deliver y, enrollment, quality of care, access, the benefit package, and other operational issues; b. Action plans for addressing any policy, operation s, and administrative issues identified; c. Monthly enrollment data during the quarter and Demonstration Year to Date by eligibility group; d. Budget neutrality monitoring tables; e. Grievance and appeals filed during the quarter by beneficiar ies in STAR and STAR+PLUS 68. Demonstration Annual Report. The state will submit a draft annual report documenting accomplishments, project status, quantitative, and case study findings, utilization data, and policy and administrative difficulties in the ope ration of the demonstration. The state will submit the draft annual report no later than 120 da ys after the end of each operational year. Within 60 days of receipt of comments from CMS, a final annual report will be submitted for the Demonstration Year to CMS. 69. Transition Plan for the Expansio n of Medicaid Eligibility in 2014. On or before November 1, 2012, the state is required to subm it a draft a transition plan describing how the state plans to coordinate the transition of any individuals enrolled in the demonstration Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 73 of 454 who may become eligible for a coverage opti on available under the Affordable Care Act without interruption in coverage to the extent possible. The plan must also describe the steps the state will take to support adequate provider networks for Medicaid State plan populations in 2014. The Plan will include a proposed schedule of activities th at the State may use to implement the Transition Plan. Af ter submitting the initial Transition Plan for CMS approval, the state must include progr ess updates in each quarterly and annual report. The Transition Plan sha ll be revised as needed. X. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 70. Submission of a Draft Evaluation Plan. The state shall submit to CMS for approval a draft evaluation design for an overall evalua tion of the demonstra tion no later than 120 days after CMS approval of the demonstrati on. The draft evaluation design must discuss the outcome measures that shall be used in evaluating the impact of the demonstration during the period of approval. It shall disc uss the data sources, including the use of Medicaid encounter data, and sampling me thodology for assessing these outcomes. The draft evaluation design must include a detaile d analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration shall be isolated fr om other initiatives occurring in the state. The draft design shall identify whether the st ate will conduct the eval uation, or select an outside contractor for the evaluation. a. Domains of Focus. The Evaluation Design mu st, at a minimum, address the research questions listed below. For questions that cover broad subject areas, the state may propose a more narrow focus for the evaluation. i. What is the impact of the managed care expansion on access to care, the quality, efficiency, and coordination of care, and the cost of care? This impact should be measured for health care serv ices in general, as well as specifically evaluating the following: What is the impact of including pharmacy benefits in the capitated managed care benefit on access to prescription drugs? Do es the effect vary by service area? What is the impact of managed dental car e on the likelihood that children receive recommended dental services? For exam ple, have the dental managed care organizations been successful in meeting th e target utilization measures set in the State's dental performance dashboard? How does the State's Experience Rebate provision compare to Medical Loss Ratio regulation as a strategy for ensuri ng that managed care plans spend an appropriate amount of thei r premium revenue on medical expenses? Would the same plans return approximately the same amounts to the State under a Medical Loss Ratio requirement as under the Expe rience Rebate, or would the results differ? Are there changes th at could be made to either model to improve upon the intended purpose of such mechanisms? What is the impact of including the non-beha vioral health inpatient services in the STAR+PLUS program in terms of access to and quality of care and program financing? Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 74 of 454 What is the impact of carving in behavi oral health services to STAR and STAR+PLUS as compared to the carving out of behavioral health services in the service area of the NorthSTAR 1915(b) wa iver on coordination and quality of care? What is the impact of the STAR+PLUS nursing facility carve-in on quality of care? ii. What percentage of providers' uncompens ated care cost was made up by payments from the UC Pool? What was the distribu tion of percentage of UC Pool funds and DSRIP funds among types of providers (hos pitals v. community providers, public hospitals vs. other hospitals)? iii. Were the Regional Health Partnerships able to show quantifiable improvements on measures related to the goals of: (A) Better Care for Individuals (including access to care, quality of care, health outcomes), (B) Better Health for the Population, and (C) Lower Cost Through Improvement, especially with respect to per capita costs for Medicaid, uninsured, and underinsured popul ations, and the cost-effectiveness of care? (D) To what degree can improvements be attr ibuted to the activ ities undertaken under DSRIP? iv. How effective were the Regional Health Pa rtnerships as a gove rning structure to coordinate, oversee, and finance paymen ts for uncompensated care costs and incentives for delivery system reform? If issues were encountered, how were they addressed? What was the cost-effectivene ss of DSRIP as a program to incentivize change? How did the amount paid in incentives compare with the amount of improvement achieved? v. What do key stakeholders (covered indi viduals and families, advocacy groups, providers, health plans) perc eive to be the strengths and weaknesses, successes and challenges of the expanded managed care pr ogram, and of the UC and DSRIP pools? What changes would these stakeholders recommend to improve program operations and outcomes? b. Evaluation Design Process: Addressing the rese arch questions listed above will require a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. When developing the RHP Planning Protocol, the State shoul d consider ways to structure the different projects that will facilitate the collection, dissemination, and comparison of valid quantitative data to support the Evaluation Design requir ed in Section X. From these, the State must select a preferred research plan for th e applicable research question, and provide a rationale for its selection. To the extent applicable, the follo wing items must be specified for each design option considered: Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 75 of 454 i. Quantitative or qualitative outcome measures; ii. Proposed baseline and/or control comparisons; iii. Proposed process and improvement out come measures and specifications; iv.

The State allows a member to select a relative or legal guardian, other than a spouse, to be the member's provider for this service if the relative or le gal guardian meets the requirements to provide Attachment C HCBS Service Definitions Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 86 of 454 Service Service Definition this service. There is a lifetime limit of $7,500 per member fo r this service and $300 yearly for repairs.

Once the $7,500 cap or a higher amount approved by HHSC is reached, only $300 per year per member, excluding the fees, will be allowed for repairs, replacement, or additional modifications. The home and community support services provider is responsible for obtaining cost-effective modifi cations authorized on the member's ISP by the managed care organization. Nursing Nursing services are those services that are within the scope of the Texas Nurse Practice Act and are provided by a registered nurse (or licensed vocational nurse under the supervision of a registered nurse), licensed to practice in the State. In the Texas State Plan, nursing services are provided only for acute conditions or exacerbations of chronic conditions lasting less than 60 days. Nursing services provided in the waiver cover ongoing chronic conditions such as medication administration and supervising delegated tasks. This broadens the scope of these services beyond extended State plan services. Occupational Therapy Occupational therapy consists of interventions and procedures to promote or enhance safety and performance in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, education, work, play, leisure, and social participation. Occupational therapy services consist of the full range of activities provided by a licensed occupational therapist, or a licensed occupationa l therapy assistant under the direction of a licensed occupational therapist, acting within the scope of his/her State licensure.

The attendant may perform certain tasks if delegated and supervised by a registered nurse in accordance with Board of Nursing rules found in 22 Texas Administrative Code, Part 11, Chapter 224. The home and community support services agency registered nurse is responsible for de legating any task to the attendant, and the home and community support services agency must maintain a copy of the delegation requirements in the member's case record. Health Maintenance Activities are limited to tasks that enable a member to remain in an independent living environment and go beyond activities of daily living because of the Attachment C HCBS Service Definitions Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 87 of 454 Service Service Definition higher skill level required. A registered nurse may determine that performance of a health maintenance activity for a particular me mber does not constitute the practice of professional nursing. An unlicensed person may perform health maintenance activities without delegation. (See Board of Nursing rules at 22 Texas Administrative Code, Part 11, Chapter 225.) Licensed therapists may choose to instruct the attendants in the proper way to assist the member in follow-up on th erapy sessions. This assistance and support provides reinforcement of instruction and aids in the rehabilitative process. In addition, a registered nurse may instruct an attendant to perform basic interventions with members that would increase and optimize functional abilities for maximum independence in performing activities of daily living such as range of motion exercises. The following contingencies apply to providers : Texas does not allow service breaks of personal assistance services for health and sa fety reasons; therefore, providers are required to have back-up attendants if the regular attendant is not available. The provider nurse may provide personal assistan ce services if the regular a nd back-up attendants are not available and nurse delegation is authorized. The State allows, but does not require, a member to select a relative or legal guardian, other than a spouse, to be the member's provid er for this service if the relative or legal guardian meets the requirements to provide this service. Personal assistance services will not be provided to members residing in adul t foster care homes, assisted living facilities, or during the same designated hours or time period a member receives respite care. Physical Therapy Physical therapy is defined as specialized techniques for evaluation and treatment related to functions of the neuro-musculo-skeletal systems provided by a licensed physical therapist or a licensed physical therapy assi stant, directly supervised by a licensed physical therapist. Physical therapy is the evaluation, examination, and utilization of exercises, rehabilitative procedures, massage, ma nipulations, and physical agents (such as mechanical devices, heat, cold , air, light, water, electricity, and sound) in the aid of diagnosis or treatment. Physical therapy services consist of the full range of activities provided by a licensed physical therapist, or a license d physical therapy assistant unde r the direction of a licensed physical therapist, acting within the scope of state licensure. Physical therapy services are available through this waiver program only after benefits available through Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party resources have been exhausted. The State allows a member to select a relative or legal guardian, other than a spouse, to be the member's provider for this service if the relative or legal guardian meets the requirements to provide this service. Respite Respite care services are provided to indivi duals unable to care for themselves, and are furnished on a short-term basis because of the absence of or need for relief for those persons normally providing unpaid services. Respite care may be provided in the following locations: member's home or pl ace of residence; adult foster care home; Medicaid certified NF; and an assisted living f acility. Respite care services are authorized by a member's PCP as part of the member's care plan. Respite services may be self- directed. Limited to 30 days per year. There is a process to grant exceptions to th e annual limit. The managed care organization reviews all requests for exceptions, and consults with the service coordinator, providers, and other resources as appropriate, to make a professional judgment to approve or deny Attachment C HCBS Service Definitions Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 88 of 454 Service Service Definition the request on a case-by-case basis. Member s residing in adult foster care homes and assisted living facilities are not eligible to re ceive respite services. Other waiver services, such as Personal Assistance Services, may be provided on the same day as respite services, but the two services cannot be provided at the exact same time. Speech, Hearing, and Language Therapy Speech therapy is defined as evaluation and treatment of impairments, disorders, or deficiencies related to an individual's speech and language. The scop e of Speech, Hearing, and Language therapy services offered to HCBS participants exceeds the State plan as the service in this context is available to adults. Speech, hearing, and language therapy services are available through the waiver program only after benefits available through Medicare, Medicaid, or other third party resources have been exhausted. The State allows a member to select a relative or legal guardi an, other than a spouse, to be the member's provider for this service if the relative or le gal guardian meets the requirements to provide this service. Support Consultation Support consultation is an optional service com ponent that offers prac tical skills training and assistance to enable a member or his le gally authorized representative to successfully direct those services the member or the le gally authorized repr esentative chooses for consumer-direction. This service is provided by a certified support advisor, and includes skills training related to recruiting, scre ening, and hiring workers, preparing job descriptions, verifying employment eligibility and qualifications, completion of documents required to employ an individual, managing workers, and development of effective back-up plans for services considered critical to the member's health and welfare in the absence of the regular provider or an emergency situation. Skills training involves such activities as training and coaching the employer regarding how to write an advertisement, how to interv iew potential job candidates, and role-play in preparation for interviewing potential employees. In addition, the support advisor assists the member or his or her legally authorized representative to determine staff duties, to orient and instruct staff in duties and to schedu le staff. Support advisors also assist the member or his or her legally authorized representative with activities related to the supervision of staff, the evaluation of the job performance of staff, and the discharge of staff when necessary. This service provides sufficien t information and assistance to ensure that members and their representatives understan d the responsibilities involved with consumer direction. Support consultation does not address budget, tax, or workforce polic y issues. The State defines support consultation activities as the types of support provided beyond that provided by the financial management services provider. The scope and duration of support consultation will vary depending on a member's need for support consultation. Support consultation may be provided by a certified support advisor associated with a consumer directed services agency selected by the member or by an independent certified support advisor hired by the member. Support consultation has a specific reimbursement rate and is a component of the member's service budget. In conjunction with the service planning team, members or legally authorized representatives determine the level of support consultation necessary for incl usion in each member's service plan. Supported Employment Assistance provided, in order to sustain competitive employment, to an individual who, because of a disability, requires intensive, ongoing support to be self-employed, work Attachment C HCBS Service Definitions Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 89 of 454 Service Service Definition Services from home, or perform in a work setting at which individuals without disabilities are employed.

Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 90 of 454 Since 1991, the Texas Health and Human Serv ices Commission (HHS C) has overseen and coordinated the planning and de livery of health and human service programs in Texas. HHSC was established in accordance with Texas Governme nt Code Chapter 531 and is responsible for the oversight of all Texas health and human service agencies. It is the goal of HHSC to use its Quality Improvement Strategy to: Transition from volume-based purchasing models to a pay-for-performance model; Improve member satisfaction with care; and Reduce payments for low quality care. It is the intention of HHSC to achieve these goals through the mechanis ms described in this Strategy, including: Program integrity monitoring through bot h internal and external processes; Implementation of financial incentives for high performing MCOs (MCOs) and financial disincentives for poor performing MCOs; and Developing and implementing targeted initia tives that encourage the adoption by MCOs of evidence-based clinical a nd administrative practices. HHSC's fundamental commitment is to contract fo r results. HHSC defines a successful result as the generation of defined, measurable, and bene ficial outcomes that satisfy the contract requirements and support HHSC' s missions and objectives. TEXAS HEALTH CARE TRANSFORMATION AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM 1115 WAIVER The Texas Healthcare Transformation and Qu ality Improvement Program 1115 Waiver, known as the 1115 Transformation Waiver, is a five -year demonstration waiver running through September 2016 that allows the state to expand Medicaid managed care, including pharmacy and dental services, while preserving federal hospital funding historica lly received as Upper Payment Level payments. There are multiple programs included in the 1115 Transformation Waiver: STAR Medicaid's State of Texas Access Reform (STA R) program is the managed care program in which HHSC contracts with MCOs to provide, arrange for, and c oordinate preventative, primary, and acute care covered services, including pharmacy. As of March 1, 2012, adults receiving SSI and resi ding in the Medicaid Rural Service Area were mandatorily enrolled in STAR, as were adults residing in the Medicaid Rural Service Area who were enrolled in Department of Aging and Di sability Services' 1915(c) waiver programs. Children receiving SSI and residing in the Me dicaid Rural Service Area were voluntarily Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 91 of 454 enrolled in STAR. Some childre n residing in the Medicaid Ru ral Service Area and receiving Department of Aging and Disabil ity Services 1915(c) waiver progr am services were voluntarily enrolled in STAR, while others were required to enroll. Beginning January 1, 2014, children who previously received foster care and who are ages 18-20 years old were mandated into the managed care m odel, but allowed to choose between STAR or STAR Health. STAR Health is the existing managed care program for children in foster care. Children who previously received foster care and who are ages 21 to 25 are mandatory in STAR. Beginning September 1, 2014, individuals residing in the Medicaid Rural Service Area and receiving SSI or Department of Aging and Disa bility Services 1915(c) waiver services were mandatorily STAR+PLUS STAR+PLUS is the agency's pr ogram for integrating the deli very of acute and long-term services and supports through a managed care sy stem. STAR+PLUS enrollment is mandatory for adults receiving SSI and non-SSI adults w ho qualify for STAR+PLUS home and community- based services. STAR+PLUS opera tes in the Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Harris, Hidalgo, Jefferson, Lubbock, Nueces, Tarrant and Travis Service areas. Acute, pharmacy, and long-term services and supports are coordinated and provided throug h a provider network contracted with MCOs. Children under age 21 who receive SSI ma y voluntarily enroll in STAR+PLUS. Beginning September 1, 2014, STAR+PLUS expanded to the Medicaid Rural Service Area, becoming a statewide program. Enrollment was mandatory for acute care services for individuals not enrolled in Medicare who are receiving 1915(c) waiver services through Community Living Assistance and Support Service, D eaf Blind with Multiple Disabilities, Home and Community-based Services program, and Texas Home Living, and individuals in an intermediate care f acility for individuals with an intellectual disabili ty or related condition. STAR+PLUS enrollment was voluntary for acute car e services for children under the age of 21 receiving services from one of the above listed 1915(c) waiver s as well as the Medically Dependent Children Program and the Youth Empow erment Services program. Adult residents of nursing facilities who receiv e Medicaid were also mandatorily enrolled into STAR+PLUS. STAR+PLUS Home and Community-based Services The STAR+PLUS home and community-based services program provides long-term care services and supports to members age 21 and older, who meet nursing facility level of care, and who need and are receiving home and community-bas ed services as an alternative to nursing facility care. The 1115 Transformation Waiver population includes indivi duals who could have been eligible under 42 CFR 435.217 had the Stat e continued its Section 1915(c) home and community-based services waiver for individuals who are elderly and i ndividuals with physical disabilities. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 92 of 454 On September 1, 2014, the Department of Aging and Disability Services Community Based Alternatives waiver program was terminated. A ll remaining individuals receiving Department of Aging and Disability Services Community Based A lternatives services were transitioned into the STAR+PLUS home and community based services program. Dental Effective March 1, 2012, children' s Medicaid dental services are provided through a managed care model to children under age 21 who are eligible for Medicaid Texas Health Steps Comprehensive Care services or SSI. Children residing in institutional settings or receiving STAR Health services receive dental through a fee-for-service model. Members who receive dental services through a Medicaid managed care dental plan are requ ired to select a dental plan and a main dentist. A main dentist serves as the client's dental home and is responsible for providing routine care, maintaining the continuity of patient care, and initiating referrals for specialty care. The 1115 Transformation Waiver does not includ e any provisions for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or STAR Health programs, which are c overed under separate agreements. The primary goal of the 1115 Transformation Waiv er is to preserve Upper Payment Level payments by creating two pools of funds into wh ich those payments would be distributed. Uncompensated Care Pool Uncompensated Care Pool payments are designed to help offset the costs of uncompensated care provided by the hospital or other providers. Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Pool The Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment pool is intended to incentivize hospitals and other providers to transform thei r service delivery practices to improve quality, health status, patient experience, coordinati on, and cost-effectiveness. Under the 1115 Transformation Waiv er, eligibility to receive Uncompensated Care or Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments requires partic ipation in a Regional Healthcare Partnership. Regional Healthcare Partnerships collaborate with participating providers to establish a plan designed to achieve quality outcomes and learn more about local needs through population-based reporting. Performing providers in a Regiona l Healthcare Partnership can access waiver Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment funding by performing improvement projects leading to quality outcomes. Performance im provement projects and outcome reporting in the Regional Healthcare Partnership plans ali gn with the following four categories: Infrastructure development; Program innovation and redesign; Quality improvements; and Population-focused improvements. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 93 of 454 Counties and other entities provi ding state share determine how their funds are used in the Regional Healthcare Partnership consistent with waiver requirements. Participants develop a regional plan identifying partners, community n eeds, proposed projects, and funding distribution. These plans provide the basis for: Voluntarily improving regional access, quality, cost-effectiveness and collaboration; Identifying transformation programs, performa nce metrics, and incentive payments for each participating performing provider consis tent with the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment menu of projects; and Eligibility to earn incentive payments. Each partnership must have an anchoring entit y, which acts as a primary point of contact for HHSC in the region and is responsible for s eeking regional stakehol der engagement and coordinating development of the regional plan. In order to achieve and sustain success at re sponding to community needs, providers and communities will need to apply be st practices in continuous quali ty improvement. Most notably, learning collaboratives are essential to the succ ess of high quality health systems that have achieved the highest level of perf ormance. Participants are str ongly encouraged to form learning collaboratives to promote sharing of challenge s and testing of new ideas and solutions by providers implementing similar projects in each Regional Healthcare Partnership. These regionally-focused learning collaboratives also can inform the learning collaborative conducted annually during demonstration year s three through five to share learning, experiences, and best practices acquired from the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program across the State. Regional Healthcare Partnerships can be a natural hub for this type of shared learning by connecting providers who are working together on common challenges in the community, but providers and Regional Healthcare Partnerships are also encour aged to connect with others across Texas to form a \"community of communi ties\" that can connect on an ongoing basis to share best practices, breakthrough ideas, challeng es and solutions. This will allow regions to learn from each other's challenges and develop shar ed solutions that can accelerate the spread of breakthrough ideas across Texas. BASIS FOR QUALITY IM PROVEMENT STRATEGY In accordance with Federal regulations, the State must develop a quality strategy to reflect all managed care programs and plans operating unde r the 1115 Transformation Waiver. The State must also provide the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS ) with annual reports on the implementation and effectiveness of the update d comprehensive Quality Strategy as it affects the 1115 Transformation Waiver. The Code of Federal Regulations includes requirements outlining the components of a state quality stra tegy. The underlying requirement is that the contract between the State and the MCOs must incl ude specified elements related to quality.

STRUCTURE OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY The 1115 Quality Improvement Strategy encompa sses multiple programs and divisions within HHSC, including Quality Assurance, Health Plan Management, the Office of Health Policy and Clinical Services, as well as advisory committees , and the external quality review organization. This section describes each of these pr ograms and their role in the Strategy. External Quality Review Organization The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires state Medica id agencies to provide an annual external independent review of quality outcomes, timeline ss of services, and access to services provided by a Medicaid MCO and prepaid inpatie nt health plans. To comply with this requirement, and to provide HHSC with data analysis and informati on to effectively manage its Medicaid managed care programs, HHSC contracts wi th an external quality review organization for Medicaid managed care and CHIP. In collaboration with the external quality review organization, HHSC evaluates, assesses, monitors, guides, and di rects the Medicaid mana ged care programs and organizations for the State. Since 2002, Texas ha s contracted with the Un iversity of Florida's Institute on Child Health Policy to conduct exte rnal quality review organization activities. The Institute of Child Health Policy perfor ms the following three CMS-required functions: Validation of performance improvement projects; Validation of performance measures; and A review to determine MCO compliance with certain federal Medicaid managed care regulations. The Institute of Child Health Policy also c onducts focused quality of care studies, performs encounter data validation and cer tification, assesses member sa tisfaction, provides assistance with rate setting activities, and completes other reports and data analysis as requested by HHSC. The external quality review or ganization develops studies, su rveys, or other analytical approaches to assess enrollee's quality and out comes of care and to id entify opportunities for MCO improvement. To facilitate these activitie s, HHSC ensures that the Institute of Child Health Policy has access to enrollment, health care claims and encounter, and pharmacy data. HHSC also ensures access to im munization registry data. Th e MCOs collaborate with the Institute of Child Health Policy to ensure medi cal records are availabl e for focused clinical reviews. In addition to these activities, the Inst itute of Child Health Policy collects and analyzes data on potentially preventable events for the De livery System Reform Incentive Payment Pool projects. HHSC Medicaid/CHIP Division Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 95 of 454 The Medicaid/CHIP Division develops and oversee s the Texas Medicaid and CHIP policies that determine client services and provider reimbur sements while complying with federal program mandates. The Medicaid/CHIP Division develo ps fee-for-service and managed care services through key program areas such as implementa tion and operations of the 1115 Transformation Waiver and Cost Containment, Policy Devel opment, Medicaid-related Health Information Technology, the Vendor Drug Pr ogram, Program Operations, Project Management, and Operations Coordination. HHSC Medicaid/CHIP- Pr ogram Operations Program Operations' objectives are to: provide better access to healthcare services, improve quality of services and service delivery, prom ote service-appropriate utilization, and contain costs. Program Operations' major activities include: Developing and operating managed care models to provide a medical and dental home; Developing and maintaini ng provider networks; Performing utilization reviews and utilization management; Managing Medicaid and CH IP contracts; and Quality assessment and performance improvement. Program Operations- Program Management Program Management implements initiatives that directly affect Medicaid and CHIP service delivery. Program Management provides progra m expertise and coordi nates with HHSC MCO managers, quality analysts, and HHS C contracts, finance, and polic y development units to refine existing or implement new healthcare delivery models. Program Management staff manage program and policies of the various managed care programs, including STAR, STAR+PLUS, CHIP, and Dental, and the fee-for-service Texas Medicaid Wellness Program. Program Management also manages certain state or fede rally-directed projects for the Medicaid/CHIP Division, monitors MCO compliance with the Linda Frew, et al. vs. Kyle Janek lawsuit, and works with the external quality review or ganization on quality-improvement initiatives. Program Operations- Quality Assurance The Quality Assurance unit of Program Manageme nt is the primary liaison between HHSC and the external quality review orga nization, and between the MCOs a nd the external quality review organization. This includes pr oviding oversight of the extern al quality review organization contract. The unit is re sponsible for working with the extern al quality review organization to develop and implement quality programs, in cluding pay for performance programs, and reviewing and analyzing data pr oduced by the external quality review organization related to those quality programs. The Quality Assurance unit also provides technical assistance to other areas of HHSC and to the various provi ders, MCOs, and stakeholder groups. Program Operations- Finance The Finance section monitors MCO financial compliance with the Uniform Managed Care Contact and the Uniform Managed Care Manual. This group has primary responsibility for: Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 96 of 454 Monitoring financial performance of MCOs , including the financial aspects of subcontracts and affiliate relationships, and recommending strategies to address issues and concerns; Reviewing and validating MCO financial deliverables; Administering the recovery of excess profits through the expe rience rebate process; Managing the MCO external audit process; Developing financial reporting principles; Supporting Health Plan Management and othe r stakeholders within the Medicaid/CHIP Division regarding financial re porting and rela ted issues; Providing ad hoc analysis as requested; Providing financial expertise for request fo r proposal and contract amendments; Responding to and implementing recommendations of State and HHSC internal auditors; and Performing financial aspects of MCO readiness reviews. The Finance section calculates the amounts of pa yments and recoupments based on results of MCO financial incentive programs. Program Operations- Health Plan Management Health Plan Management monitors MCO compliance with the Uniform Managed Care Contract , the Uniform Managed Care Manual , Texas Government Code \u00a7533 and \u00a7531, and Texas Administrative Code \u00a7353 and \u00a7354. Health Pl an Management's major activities include monitoring of service deliver y, provider networks, claims processing, deliverables, and marketing and other administrative requirement s. Monitoring of se rvice delivery includes evaluating and trending provider an d client complaints. It also includes monitoring service coordination, MCO call center serv ices, claims processes, and en counters. Monitoring provider networks involves analyzing MCO provider data and geographic access reports, and includes review of provider turnover rates, network panel status reports, a nd provider directories. Health Plan Management also assists with the resolution of complex issues; facilitates internal and external stakeholder meetings; ob tains and develops polic y clarifications; data and premium payment issues; and cl arifies contract requirements. Health Plan Management staff reviews MCO marketing materials for complian ce with the Uniform Managed Care Marketing Policy and Procedures Manual. MCOs report specific data to Health Plan Management each fiscal quarter. Health Plan Management staff compiles this information by MCO, program, and service area. Each MCO may have multiple quarterly reports, which are used for monitoring purposes. These reports capture data on the following elements: Enrollment; Provider network status; Member hotline, behavioral health crisis hotline, and provider hotline performance; MCO complaints and appeals (member and provider); Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 97 of 454 Complaints received by state ag encies (member and provider); Claims; and Encounter reconciliation. While the MCO is the initial point of contact to address member or prov ider concerns, Health Plan Management will assist with issues that have been escalated to HHSC. Inquiries and complaints are referred to Health Plan Manageme nt from a variety of s ources including elected officials, the Office of the Ombudsman, and other agencies and departments. Provider inquiries and complaints are received directly from provi ders through email. Health Plan Management also receives information on cases that have been overturned on appeal to track and address any issues in which it appears MCOs may have denied services inappropriately. Based on findings from monthly and quarterly self-reported perf ormance data, onsite visits, member or other complaints, financial status, and any other source, H ealth Plan Management may impose or pursue one or more of the follo wing remedies for each item of material non- compliance in accordance with the Uniform Managed Care Contract: Assessment of liquidated damages; Accelerated monitoring of th e MCO, which includes more frequent or extensive monitoring by HHSC; Requiring additional financial or programmatic reports to be submitted by the MCO; Requiring additional or more detailed financia l or programmatic audits or other reviews of the MCO; Terminating or declining to renew or extend an MCO contract; Appointing temporary MCO management under the circumstances described in 42 CFR \u00a7438.706; Initiating or suspending member disenrollment; Withholding or recouping payment to the MCO; and Requiring forfeiture of all or pa rt of the MCO's performance bond. Health Plan Management determines the scope and severity of the remedy on a case-by-case basis. HHSC Medicaid/CHIP- 1115 Healthcare Transfor mation and Quality Improvement Waiver Operations The 1115 Transformation Waiver Operations area oversees the implementation and roll-out of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment portion of the waiver. Major activities have included: Review and submission of more than 1,300 pr oposed Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment projects from all 20 Regional Healthcare Partnerships to CMS; Review and submission of outcome meas ures associated with each project; Development of policies and protocols, re porting process, tools, and guidelines; Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 98 of 454 Provision of ongoing and extensive technica l assistance for Regional Healthcare Partnership anchoring entitie s and providers related to areas including project plan corrections, milestone and metrics reporting, and outcome measures; Ongoing and extensive submission of information to CMS to support waiver implementation; Review of metric reporting; Establishing formal waiver evaluation in coordination with HHSC Strategic Decision Support; and Development of the monitoring for Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment projects that will occur through contract procurement. HHSC Medicaid/CHIP- Oper ations Coordination The Operations Coordination area develops, ove rsees, and performs f unctions related to information technology operational systems pr ocessing, data management, analysis, and reporting. Operations C oordination works on eligibility and enrollment operations within the Medicaid/CHIP Division, information technol ogy program development and oversight, and provider claims oversight. This section of HHSC provides data that is used for multiple quality purposes, including tracking rates of potentially preventable events and sharing encounter data with the external quality review organization. Operations Coor dination also manages the vendor responsible for housing the data. HHSC Financial Services- Actuarial Analysis Actuarial Analysis calculates the capitated premiu m rates paid to the Me dicaid and CHIP MCOs. HHSC uses an external actuar y to certify these rates as meeting the actuarial soundness guidelines established by CMS. Actuarial Anal ysis is also involved with benefit and rate changes, program expansions, and legislative ma ndates that affect MCOs. Finally, Actuarial Analysis provides actuarial support services for other HHSC activities , including initiatives related to the 1115 Transf ormation Waiver. Key quality-related activities with which Actuarial Analysis is involved include financial incentive programs, data certification, and implementation of provider-level and MCO-level disincentives related to potentially preventable events. HHSC Financial Services- St rategic Decision Support Strategic Decision Support provid es research and analytic support to the Health and Human Services Enterprise. Broadly, Strategic Decision Support staff: Conducts quantitative analysis of health and human services program data; Compiles, analyzes, and reports relevant th ird-party data (e.g., Census Bureau, Labor Statistics, CDC programs); Collects, analyzes, and reports survey data; Conducts program evaluation studies; and Conducts innovative research studies on vari ous topics of interest to executive management staff. HHSC Office of Health Policy and Clinical Services Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 99 of 454 The Office of Healthcare Quality Analytics, Re search, and Coordination Support works within the health and human services system and with external stakeholders to improve enterprise collaboration and coordination on quality initiative s, and to reduce duplication of efforts. The program is charged with identifying initiativ es that focus on increased quality and cost effectiveness, promote transparency and effi ciency, and enhance internal and external understanding of quality and performance. Th e Office of Healthcare Quality Analytics, Research, and Coordination Support is responsible for several special projects related to quality and efficiency improvement. Several examples of high impact projects are listed below. Behavioral Health Organization and MCO Coordination The Office of Healthcare Quality Analytic s, Research, and Coordination Support has spearheaded an effort to bette r coordinate behavioral health care and physical healthcare by improving the communication capabili ties of the NorthSTAR behavior al health organization and the MCOs operating in the NorthSTAR service ar ea. A successful outcome will be improved quality of care, largely demonstrated by a reduction in potentially preventable events, particularly potentially preventabl e emergency department visits. Alternative Provider Payment Structures Using initial funding from an Agency for Health care Research and Quality grant administered by Rutgers University, HHSC has focused on a series of quality measures related to antipsychotic medication prescribing and mental health treatment practices with in the MCO/behavioral health organization model. HHSC has begun to share pe rformance related information with the MCOs and behavioral health organizati ons and is engaging them in di scussions regarding intervention strategies. Interagency Collaboration on Strategies to Promote Improved Birth Outcomes Prenatal care, delivery, newborn care, and pos tpartum care represent areas of ongoing quality improvement and cost savings. HHSC recognizes that often this requires close coordination among the HHS agencies, namely with the Depa rtment of State Health Services. The Department of State Health Serv ices is Texas' public health agency. HHSC and the Department of State Health Services have formed interagency workgroups focused on targeted projects of mutual concern in this area. Committees Multiple quality-focused advisory committees provide HHSC and the Legislature recommendations on quality-related activities. The Medicaid and CHIP Quality-Based Payment Advisory Committee was established by Senate Bill 7, 82 nd Legislature, Re gular Session, 2011. This committee was created to advise HHSC on establishing reimbursement policies and systems that reward high quality and cost-effective care, on outcome and process measures, and on standards and benchmarks used to measure performance. Senate Bill 7 of the 83rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, created the STAR+PLUS Quality Council, which began meeting in 2014. This council is charged with advising HHSC on th e development of policy recommendations that Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 100 of 454 will ensure eligible recipients receive quality, person-centered, consumer-directed acute care services and long-term services and supports under the STAR+PLUS program. Texas Institute of Healthcare Quality and Efficiency The Legislature established the Texas Institute of Healthcare Quality and Efficiency (the Institute) during the 82nd Legislature, First Called Session, 2011, to improve health care quality, accountability, education, and cost containment by encouraging provider collaboration, effective delivery models, and coordination of services. The Institute has a wide scope, encompassing the broader health care system in Te xas, including Medicaid and CH IP. The Institute is charged with making legislative recommendations in three key areas: improving quality and efficiency of health care delivery; improving reporting, consolidation, and tr ansparency of health care information; and implementing and supporting innova tive health care coll aborative payment and delivery systems. Within this overarching framework, the Institute will study and issue recommendations on various aspect s of health care, including: Quality-based payment systems that align payment incentives with high-quality, cost- effective health care; Alternative health care delivery systems th at promote health care coordination and provider collaboration; Quality of care and efficiency outcome measurements that are effective measures of prevention, wellness, coordinati on, provider collaboration, and co st-effective health care; Improvements related to the re porting of health-related data collected by the state that reduce administrative burdens associated with reporting, while increasing consumer access to and use of data; and Methods to evaluate health care collaborative eff ectiveness. The Institute draws expertise from a governor-appoi nted board of directors that is composed of health care providers, payors, consumers, and health care quality experts, in addition to representatives from several state agencies. HHSC has also established an Executive Steering Committee of the HHS System agencies to s upport the Institute in a coordinated and collaborative manner across the HHS System. Management Information System Requirements MCOs are required to maintain a Management Information System (MIS) that supports all functions of the MCO's processes and procedures for the flow and use of MCO data. They must have hardware, software, and a network and co mmunications system with the capability and capacity to handle and operate all MIS subs ystems for the following operational and administrative areas: Enrollment/Eligibility Provider Network Encounter/Claims Processing Financial System Utilization/Quality Improvement Reporting Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 101 of 454 Interfaces Third Party Liability Reporting Intersection of Roles Each of these areas is responsible for complex unique activitie s and serves a specific purpose in the overall Texas Medicaid quality system. Thei r distinct roles intera ct with each other to fluctuating degrees, largely di ctated by specific projects and needs of the agency and stakeholders. The diagram found in Attachment C of this document summarizes the roles and interactions of these units. EVIDENCE-BASED CARE AND QUALITY MEASUREMENT HHSC's mission is to create a customer-centered, innovative, and adaptable managed care system that provides the highest quality of care to indi viduals served by the agency while at the same time ensuring access to services. To th is end, the 1115 Transformation Waiver goals and objectives include improving outcomes and tran sitioning to quality-based payment systems across managed care and hospitals. The 1115 Qual ity Improvement Strategy is intended to outline the internal and external resources, mechan isms, and initiatives that together will achieve these goals. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 102 of 454 Measurement Texas relies on a combination of established sets of measures and state-developed measures that are validated by the external quality review orga nization. This approach allows the State to collect data comparable to nati onally recognized benchmarks and ensure validity and reliability in collection and analysis of data that is of par ticular interest to Texas. Resources used by Texas include: National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS\u00ae) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Pediatric Quality Indicators /Prevention Quality Indicators 3M Software for Potentially Preventable Events Consumer Assessment of Healthca re Providers & Systems (CAHPS\u00ae) Surveys Tools for Obtaining and Disseminating Information Related to Quality The analysis and dissemination of quality data is primarily conducted us ing MCO-generated data and reports and external quality review organization data an alysis and summary reports. Mechanism for Identifying Race, Ethnici ty, and Primary Language of Members The State obtains race, ethnicity, and primary la nguage spoken by a member from the enrollment form completed by that member. Applications are processed through the Texas Integrated Eligibility Redesign System (TIERS) and routed to a third-party enrollment broker. The enrollment broker transmits a file containing the race/ethnicity and primary language of each enrollee to the MCOs monthly. Encounter Data Requirements MCOs are required to submit complete and accura te encounter data for all covered services, including value-added services, at least monthly to a data wa rehouse for reporting purposes. The data file must include all encounter data and encounter data adjustme nts processed by the MCO no later than the 30th calendar day after the la st day of the month in which the claim was adjudicated. The Texas Medicaid claims administrator contract or developed and maintains the data warehouse and is responsible for collect ing, editing, and stori ng MCO encounter data. HHSC contracts with the external quality re view organization to certify the accuracy and completeness of MCO encounter data. The da ta certification reports support rate-setting activities and provide information relating to the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the MCO encounter data. Certificati on reports include a quality assessm ent analysis to assure data quality within agreed standards for accuracy, a summary of amounts paid by service type and month of service, and a comparis on of paid amounts reported in the encounter data to financial statistical reports pr ovided by the MCOs. Encounter data must follow the format and data elements as described in the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act-compliant 837 Companion Guides and Encounter Submission Guidelines. HHSC specifies the method of tran smission, the submission schedule, and any other Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 103 of 454 requirements in the Uniform Managed Care Manual . Original records must be made available for inspection by HHSC for valida tion purposes. Encounter data that does not meet quality standards must be corrected and returned within a time period specified by HHSC. Managed Care Organization-Generated Data and Reports Quality Assessment and Pe rformance Improvement Each MCO must develop, maintain, and opera te a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program that meets state and federa l requirements. The MCO must approach all clinical and nonclinical aspects of quality assessment and performance improvement based on principles of Continuous Quality Improveme nt/Total Quality Management and must: Evaluate performance using objective quality indicators; Foster data-driven decision-making; Recognize that opportunities fo r improvement are unlimited; Solicit member and provider input on performance and Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement activities; Support continuous ongoing measurement of clin ical and non-clinical effectiveness and member satisfaction; Support programmatic improvements of clin ical and non-clinical processes based on findings from ongoing measurements; and Support re-measurement of effectiveness and member satisfaction, and continued development and implementation of improve ment interventions as appropriate. The MCO must adopt at least tw o evidence-based clinical prac tice guidelines per program (e.g., STAR, STAR+PLUS). Practice guide lines must be based on valid and reliable clinical evidence, consider the needs of the MCO's members, be adopted in consultation with network providers, and be reviewed and updated periodically, as appropriate. The MCO must adopt practice guidelines based on members' health needs and oppor tunities for improvement identified as part of the Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement Program. Performance Improvement Projects The external quality review organization recommends topics for performance improvement projects based on MCO performance results, da ta from member survey s, administrative and encounter files, medical records, and the imm unization registry. HHSC selects two of these goals, which become projects that enable each MCO to target specific areas for improvement that will affect the greatest num ber of members. These projects are specified and measurable, and reflect areas that present significant oppor tunities for performance improvement for each MCO. When conducting performance improvement projects, MCOs are required to follow the ten-step CMS protocol published in the CMS Ex ternal Quality Review Organization Protocols.

The MCOs complete the administrative interv iew tool online and ar e required to provide supporting documentation. For example, when describing disease management programs, the MCO must also provide copies of all evidenced -based guidelines used in providing care to members. The external quality review organi zation analyzes all responses and documents and generates follow-up questions for each MCO as necessary. The follow-up questions are administered during in-person si te visits and conference calls. Data Certification Reports The information contained in data certification re ports is used for actuarial analysis and rate setting, and meets the requirements of Texa s Government Code \u00a7533.0131, Use of Encounter Data in Determining Premium Payment Rates. Analyses include volume analysis based on service category, data validity a nd completeness, consistency anal ysis between encounter data and MCO financial summary reports, and validity and completeness of provider information (not performed for pharmacy data). Encounter Data Validation Report Encounter data validation ensures the data used for rate setting and calculating quality of care measures is valid. Encounter data validation is an optional external quality review organization activity per CMS but is highly recommended. Encounter data validation is the strongest approach to ensure that high qua lity data are available for anal ysis and reporting. The report summarizes the results of the external quality review organization's a ssessment of the accuracy of the information found in the MCOs' claims and encounter data compared to corresponding medical records. Quarterly Topic Reports Quarterly Topic reports provide additional info rmation on issues of importance to HHSC. Historically, Texas HHSC has reque sted special topic reports to obtain in-depth analyses and information on legislative topics. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 105 of 454 Summary of Activities Report Texas provides the Summary of Activities report to CMS annually as evidence of external quality review organization activit ies. The report includes an a nnual summary of all quality of care activities, performance improvement project information, MCO structure and processes, and a description of all findings and quality improvement activities. Survey Reports Quality of Care Reports CMS requires the external quality review organization to validate performance measures. This is done through analysis of data used to develop qua lity of care reports. Additionally, the external quality review organization calculates the quality of care measures that rely on administrative data (i.e., enrollment, health care claims and en counter data). This provides the state with a comprehensive set of measures calculated using National Committee for Quality Assurance-certified software and audited by a National Comm ittee for Quality Assurance-certified auditor. Historically, this data has been used to deve lop program-specific quality of care reports. Beginning in 2014, these reports were consolidated into a single behavioral and physical health report and a single dental re port. Data tables are s till available by program. FREW Report The Institute of Child Health Policy calculat es rates by plan code for Texas Health Steps checkups given to new and existing members based on the Medicaid Managed Care Texas Health Steps Medical Checkups Utilization Report instructions. The results are compiled and compared with MCO-submitted reports to determin e if the MCO-submitted reports are within an eight percent threshold of external qual ity review organizatio n calculated rates. TEXAS QUALITY INITIATIVES HHSC, together with the Institute of Child Health Policy, has developed multiple quality initiatives that are in various stages of implementation. Financial Incentive Programs Performance Based At-Risk Capita tion and Quality Challenge Award 3 The managed care contract stipulates that up to five percent of an MCO's capitation can be recouped based on performance based measures. This initiative gives HHSC an opportunity to focus MCO performance on specific measures that foster achievement of HHSC program goals and objectives. 3 The Performance Based At-Risk Capitation and Quality Challenge Award ended December 31, 2013. Final payment or recoupment based on performance in this program was made in the fall of 2014. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 106 of 454 Each MCO has the opportunity to achieve performan ce levels that enable it to receive the full at- risk amount. However, should an MCO not achie ve those performance levels, HHSC recoups a portion of the five percent at-risk amount. Some of the performance indicators are standard across the managed care programs while ot hers may apply to a specific program. Minimum achievement targets are developed based in part on: HHSC MCO program objectives of ensuring access to care and quality of care; Past performance of the HHSC MCOs; and National performance of Medicaid MCOs on HEDIS\u00ae and CAHPS\u00ae survey measures. rformance-based, at-risk of an MCO's capitation rate to the MCO program's Quality Challenge Award. HHSC uses these funds to reward MCOs that demonstrate superior clinic al quality, service deliv ery, access to care, or member satisfaction. HHSC determines the number of MCOs that will receive Quality Challenge Award funds annually based on the amount of the funds to be reallocated. Separate Quality Challenge Award payments are made for each of the MCO programs. HHSC considered the following factors when determ ining which measures to use in the At-Risk and Quality Challenge Program: Necessity of effective administrative proce sses and contract compliance for the five percent at-risk in the first measurement year; Emphasis on clinical process and outcome meas ures in the Quality Challenge Award in the first measurement year and the five percent At-Risk measures in the second measurement year; HEDIS\u00ae measure limitations due to data requirements. Some HEDIS\u00ae measures require one to two years of historical data to calculate and thus were not feasible for use at the newly established STAR and STAR+PLUS program sites. Measures with a history of low denominators (e.g., not enough members mee ting inclusion criteria for the measure) were excluded; and Identifying the appropriate number of m easures. Choosing too many measures can diffuse the focus and make it difficult to have meaningful impact while choosing too few can place too much risk on each measure. HHSC evaluates the performance-based At-Ris k and Quality Challenge Award methodology annually in consultation with the MCOs. HHSC may then modify the methodology as it deems necessary and appropriate to motivate, rec ognize, and reward MCOs for performance. Pay-for-Quality Program Senate Bill 7, 83 rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, focu ses on the use of outcome and process measures in quality-based payment systems th at focus on measuring potentially preventable events; rewarding use of evidence-based pr actices; and promoting healthcare coordination, collaboration and efficacy. To comply with legisl ative direction and to be st identify quality of care measures that reflect the needs of the popul ation served and areas of needed improvement, Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 107 of 454 the HHSC Medicaid/CHIP Division implemented the Pay-for-Quality Program, which replaces the At-Risk Quality Challenge program, beginni ng in 2014. The Pay-for-Quality Program uses an incremental improvement approach that provi des financial incentives and disincentives to MCOs based on year-to-year incremental impr ovement on pre-specified quality goals. The quality of care measures used in this initiative are a combin ation of process and outcome measures which include select pot entially preventable events as well as other measures specific to the program's enrolled populations. The Pay-for-Quality Program includes an at-risk pool that is four percent of the MCO capitation rate. In the Pay-for-Quality Program, points ar e assigned to each plan based on incremental performance on each quality measure, with positive points assigned for year-to-year improvements over a minimum baseline. Negative points are assigned fo r most year-to-year declines, with the exception of modest decreas es of plans whose performance is already performing within a specified range of the atta inment goal rate. The Pay-for-Quality Program model sets minimum baseline performance levels for the measures so that low performing MCOs would not be rewarded for substandard performa nce. Rewards and penalties are based on rates of improvement or decline over the baseline . All funds recouped from MCOs through the assignment of negative points are redistributed to MCOs through the rewarding of positive points. Each MCO pays in proportion to its total negative points and receives funds in proportion to its total positive points. No funds are returned to the State. Participation in this program is required for all Texas MCOs. Dental Pay-for-Quality Program The 2014 Dental Pay-for-Quality Program includes an at-risk pool that is a \"to be determined\" amount of the dental maintenance organization ca pitation rate. In the Dental Pay-for-Quality Program, points are assigned to each plan based on its incremental performance on each quality measure, with positive points assigned for year-to-year improvements over the minimum baseline and negative points as signed for most year-to-year d eclines. The Dental Pay-for- Quality Program model sets minimum baseline perf ormance levels for the measures so that low- performing dental maintenance organizations would not be rewarded for substandard performance. Rewards and penalties are based on rates of improvement or decline over the baseline. Plans would earn back their own at-r isk premium based on perf ormance of quality of care measures. In no instance would funding be redistributed from one dental maintenance organization to another; plans can only earn back their own four pe rcent premium that is at-risk. Performance Comparisons Performance Indicator Dashboards The Performance Indicator Dashboard includes a seri es of measures that identify key aspects of performance to support transparency and MCO accountability. The Performance Indicator Dashboard is not an all-inclusiv e set of performance measures; HHSC measures other aspects of the MCO's performance as well. Rather, th e Performance Indicator Dashboard assembles performance indicators that assess many of the most important dimensions of MCO performance Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 108 of 454 and includes measures that incentivize excellence. Th e Dashboard is shared on the HHSC website and includes minimum threshold standa rds as a means to gauge performance. Additionally, HHSC plans to begin including MCO performance data on these measures and sharing this information on the HHSC website. MCO Report Cards Texas Government Code \u00a7536.051 requires HHSC to provide information to Medicaid and CHIP members regarding MCO performance on outcome and process measures during the enrollment process. To comply with this requirement and other legislatively mandated transparency initiatives, HHSC develops annual MCO report car ds for each program service area to allow members to easily compare the MCOs on specific quality measures. MCO report cards will be posted on the HHSC website and included in Medicai d enrollment packets sent by the enrollment broker to potential members. Data Sharing and Transparency Texas Healthcare Learning Collaborative The Texas Healthcare Learning Collaborative is a secure web portal designed and run by the Institute of Child Health Policy. The Portal is an online learning collabo rative that includes a graphical user interface that allows MCOs, HHSC , and the Institute of Child Health Policy to visualize healthcare metrics. MCOs, HHSC staff, a nd Texas legislative staff are able to log in to the portal and generate graphical reports of plan and program specific performance. Through the Texas Healthcare Learning Collaborativ e Portal, HHSC and the Institute of Child Health Policy share monthly and quarterly reports with the MCOs about potentially preventable events. The reports are interactive and the mana ged care plans can query the data to create more customized summaries of the quality results.

The intent of this website is to consolidate information related to different quality and efficiency related initiatives in one place, and to promote better information dissemin ation. The Medicaid Quality Assurance and Improvement Website will serve as a tool for communication and information-sharing, about initiatives and other efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of the Texas Medicaid program, with external stakeholders such as health care providers, health plans, and the public, as well as internal HHS Enterprise divisions. The webs ite will also promote transparency and public reporting related to quality of care and efficiency of services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries, and provides a centralized location for stakeholde rs to access information such as MCO data, presentations, specialized reports, and committee information. Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Website Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 110 of 454 The primary purpose of the Delivery System Refo rm Incentive Payment website is to provide targeted technical resources for Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment participants. The website is also used to communicate general in formation regarding the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program to stakeholders. Examples of communication disseminated through the website include: Background and historical information on the waiver; New and updated policies, procedures, tools, and guidelines for Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment anchors and providers; Provider and Regional Healthcare Partnershi p-specific Excel workbooks used for reporting purposes; and Key Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment program dates and deadlines. Additionally, the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment website serves as a repository of waiver information related to amendments, pr ogram funding, Regional Healthcare Partnership Planning Protocols and plans, a nd instructional and technical assistance webinars for Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment anchors and providers. Innovation Texas is engaging in multiple activities to develop new strategies to measure and encourage quality service delivery in Medi caid managed care. Several ex amples of these activities are outlined below. Regional Healthcare Partnership Projects Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment pool payments are made to hospitals and other providers that develop programs or strategies to enhance access to health care, and to increase the quality and cost-effectivene ss of care provided and the health of the members served. In order to receive Delivery System Reform Incen tive Payment pool payments, a provider must participate in a Regional Health care Partnership that includes governmental entities providing public funds, Medicaid providers, and other stake holders. Participants must develop a regional plan that identifies community needs and proposed projects to meet those needs, and identifies partners and funding distribution. Ther e are four categories of projects: Category I (Infrastructure De velopment) lays the foundati on for the delivery system through investments in people, place s, processes and technology; Category II (Program Innova tion & Redesign) tests and replicates innovative care models; Category III (Quality Improvements) assesse s the effectiveness of Category 1 and 2 interventions; and Category IV (Population-based Improvements) re quires all regional health partnerships to report on the same measures. Long-Term Services and Suppor ts Performance Measures Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 111 of 454 The STAR+PLUS home and community-based se rvices program provides assistance with activities of daily living to allow members to re main in the most community-integrated setting available. It includes services available to all STAR+PLUS members as well as those services available only to STAR+PLUS me mbers from the following groups: Individuals age 65 and older who meet the nursing facility level of care; Adults age 21 and older with physical disabil ities who meet the nursi ng facility level of care; and Members eligible for SSI and SSI-related Medicaid who are 21 and older who meet the nursing facility level of care. For an individual to be eligible for home and community-based services, the State must have determined that the cost to provide home and co mmunity-based waiver services is equal to or less than 202 percent of th e cost of the level of care in a nursing facility. In the fall of 2013, HHSC convened a workgroup consisting of external stakeholders and representatives from the external quality review organization to develop a comprehensive set of performance measures that will pr ovide data that allows the State to evaluate the quality of home and community-based services long-term servic es and supports provided through Medicaid managed care. Attachment D of this document outlines the timeline for completion of this project. Senate Bill 7 Senate Bill (SB) 7, 83 rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, is a broa dly scoped bill that redesigns multiple aspects of Texas Medicaid, focusing on improved service delivery quality and efficiency. Key componen ts of SB 7 include: Establishment of a managed care clinical improvement program; The option for HHSC to create an incentive program that enrolls a higher proportion of members eligible for auto-enrollment into MCOs that meet pre-determined performance levels on selected metrics; Builds upon \u00a7536.003 in the Government Code requiring HHSC to include outcome and process measures based on potentially preventa ble events. Potentially preventable event outcome measures must allow for rate-based determination of health care provider performance compared to statewide norms a nd be risk-adjusted ba sed on severity of illness. Requirements are also added for the process and outcome measures developed by HHSC, including effective coordination of acute and long-term care services and reduction of preventable health care utilization and costs; Requires HHSC to develop quality-based payment systems in conjunction with stakeholders and to require MCOs to develop quality-based payment systems; Adds a requirement for HHSC to develop a we b-based system to pr ovide data to MCOs and providers on their quality metrics and how they measure against comparable peers; Requires HHSC to base a percentage of premiums paid to MCOs on performance measures that address potentially preventa ble events and advance quality improvement and innovation; Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 112 of 454 Directs HHSC to allow MCOs increased flex ibility to implement quality initiatives, including allowing for reductions in the inci dence of unnecessary institutionalization and using alternative payment systems such as shared savings models; Directs HHSC to adopt rules related to potentially preventa ble events and directs HHSC to report to hospitals on their performance related to these ev ents. The bill also requires HHSC to release hospital reports after one year only after receivi ng stakeholder input on the content included; Allows HHSC to exclude payments made unde r the Disproportionate Share Hospital and Upper Payment Limit systems to be based on the hospitals performance related to potentially preventable readmissions and other potentially preventable events; Directs HHSC to develop payment initiatives for health care provide rs that will, among other things, encourage the inte gration of acute care services and long-term care services and supports, including discharge planning from acute care services to community based long-term services and supports; Allows HHSC to implement quality-based payments for long-term services and supports if cost-effective and feasible; and Requires HHSC to adopt rules related to preventable costly service utilization by members receiving long-term care. HHSC is working to develop and enhance prog rams, systems, and polices to meet these directives. Potentially Preventable Events Potentially preventable events include inpati ent stays, hospital readmissions, potentially preventable complications, and emergency departme nt visits that may have been avoidable had the patient received high quality primary and pr eventive care prior to or after the event in question. High potentially preventa ble event rates may reflect inad equacies in th e health care provided to the patient in multiple settings, in cluding inpatient and outpatient facilities and clinics. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to pot entially preventable events in STAR and STAR+PLUS can assist HHSC and MCOs in developing intervention strategies to reduce their occurrence and to esti mate the potential cost savings associated with implementing these interventions. Potentially Preventable Admissions: These events are considered an indicator of poor availability, accessibility, and effectiveness of primary care, and the added burden to hospital resources can adversely influence the quality of care for all in need of inpatient services. Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 113 of 454 Potentially Preventable Readmissions: Potentially preventable readmissions to the hospital are costly, and present a particularly relevant challenge for the efficient delivery of health services in state Medicaid programs. Medicaid beneficiar ies are 70 percent more likely than people with private insurance to have an inpatient readmissi on. While a number of individual factors are known to influence potentially pr eventable readmissions - including age, severity of illness, and co-morbidities - poor access to primary care is thought to be a major contributing factor. Potentially Preventable Emergency Department Visits: These events are considered an indicator of poor availability, accessibilit y, and effectiveness of primary car e, and their added burden to emergency department resources can adversely affect the quality of care for all in need of urgent medical attention. Potentially pr eventable emergency department visits present a particularly relevant challenge for the efficient delivery of health services in state Medicaid programs. Research has found that Medicaid beneficiaries make up a disproportionate share of emergency department visits for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hy pertension. The occurrence of preventable emergency department visits can be influenced by chronic illness burden. However, compared to the general population, higher ra tes of potentially pr eventable emergency department visits for Medicai d beneficiaries are not explai ned by differences in disease prevalence or severity, but rather suggest a reduced likelihood of ongoing primary care. Potentially Preventable Complications: HHSC defines a potentially preventable complication as a harmful event or negative outcome with respect to a person, including an infection or surgical complication, that occurs after the person's admissi on to a hospital or long-term care facility; and may have resulted from the care, lack of care, or treatment provided during the hospital or long- term care facility stay rather than from a na tural progression of an underlying disease (Texas Administrative Code, Title 1, \u00a7354.1446 (relating to Potentially Preventable Complications)). FUTURE GOALS AND PROJECTS Administrative and St ate-Level Initiatives HHSC has concrete and specific goals for curre nt and future projects. These include: Improving internal HHSC coordinati on related to quality issues; Creating provider incentive programs; Fine-tuning a vision that will inform HHSC' s goals and guide HHS C in meeting those goals; Administrative simplification for MCOs and within HHSC; Program and policy changes as needed; and Improving access by expanding the provider network and enhancing the timeliness of care. To this end, in December 2013, HHSC formed a qua lity steering committee that is responsible for developing a vision for the quality improveme nt system for Texas services, and for guiding Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 114 of 454 future quality work. This group consists of cross-divisional staff and is co-chaired by representatives of the Office of Healthcare Quality Analytic s, Research, and Coordination Support and the Medicaid/CHIP Division's Health Information Technology section. The committee coordinates the quality improvement system effort across the Texas Health and Human Services Enterprise. Data Analytic Unit In response to a directive from Senate Bill 8, 83 rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, a new data analytic unit is being created in the Operations Coordination section of the Medicaid/CHIP Division. This unit will be responsible for establ ishing and overseeing a data analysis processes that is designed to: Improve contract management; Detect data trends; and Identify anomalies relating to: o service utilization o providers o payment methodologies o compliance with requirements in Medicaid o compliance with requirements in child health plan program managed care o compliance with requirements in fee-for-service contracts. This unit will also be responsible for providing quarterly legislative reports. HHSC is planning to update this Strategy to include all other Texas Medicaid managed care programs, creating a comprehensive strategy rather than using multiple, program-specific strategies. Future of the 1115 Transformation Waiver Senate Bill 7, 83 rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, requi res HHSC to carve nursing facility services into managed care. HHSC is currently working w ith the Department of Aging and Disability Services to develop a set of performance measures th at will be appropriate to gauge quality of care in the nursing faci lity environment, and that will incentivize MCOs to ensure a high level of quality of care. The workgroup tasked with devel oping this process includes both HHSC and Department of Aging and Disability Services staff, and is striving to leverage existing Department of Aging and Disability Services' pr ocesses to the greatest extent possible, while also taking into consideration service delivery factors that might benefit from additional focus after the nursing facility transiti on to managed care. A timeline for the activities of this group is included in Attachment E of this document. Senate Bill 7, 83 rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013, al so requires HHSC to conduct pilot initiatives and to evaluate carving additional lo ng term services and supports (LTSS) into a managed care model between 2016 and 2020. These LTSS services have traditionally been Attachment D Quality Improvement Program and Quality Improvement Strategy Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 115 of 454 provided by the Department of Ag ing and Disability Services in a fee-for-service model through 1915(c) waivers or intermediate care facilities for i ndividuals with an intell ectual disability or related condition. The Quality Improvement Strategy will be expanded to include those activities as appropriate through the tran sition and after final implementation. Senate Bill 58, 83 rd Legislative, Regular Session, 2013, dire cts HHSC to carve-in mental health targeted case management and mental health reha bilitative services into Medicaid managed care in order to provide better coordi nation of care by integrat ing physical and beha vioral health care for Medicaid recipients no later than Septembe r 1, 2014. These new services are anticipated to be added to STAR and STAR+PLU S by this required effective date. To help ensure this transition is successful, the external quality revi ew organization will continue to conduct member surveys of individuals receiving behavioral heal th services in both ST AR and STAR+PLUS. Future Initiatives Focused Analysis and Quality Improvement E fforts with MCOs on \"Superutilizers\" A recently added Uniform Managed Care Contract provision strengthens the requirements for MCOs to focus on the unique needs of hi gh cost, high utilizing populations (called \"superutilizers\"). This requires MCOs to subm it to HHSC their plans for targeting this group, including intervention strategies and resources dedicated to care management of this group. HHSC will have regular conference calls with MCOs over the year to discuss their efforts and encountered successes and barriers. This will allow HHSC to be tter assess MCO progress in this area. This also may help inform HHSC on certa in aspects of the mental health rehabilitative services and targeted case management \"carve-in \" to managed care, as many members identified as \"superutilizers\" are also recipients of those behavioral health services. Quality-Based MCO Enrollment Incentive Algorithm There are significant numbers of members who qualify for Medicaid who do not choose an MCO at the time of enrollment. While HHSC current ly has an auto-enrollment process for these members, HHSC is exploring potential algorithms that may be used to assign these members to high quality and high efficiency MCOs and dental maintenance organizations. HHSC will first evaluate the effects of the MCO report cards initiative to determine if the initiative shrinks the pool of members who do not actively choose an MCO. Based on that assessment, HHSC will determine whether to implement this initiative. Other State Strategies Regarding MCO Incentive and Disincen tive Approaches Currently, staff are working with an actuarial firm on assessing a nd inventorying strategies used by certain states, as well as having this firm assess HHSC's current approach. The goal is to identify promising practices that may furthe r promote provider payment reform and more efficient service delivery and provider practices.

This requires MCOs and dental main tenance organizations to submit to HHSC their plans for alternative payment structures with provid ers, including the type of structure they plan to use, the metrics used, the approximate dolla r amount and number of members impacted, and the evaluation process. This will allow HHSC to better assess MCO progress in this area. Review and Update of Qua lity Improvement Strategy The quality strategy will be reviewed and upda ted every two years at a minimum. The 1115 Waiver also requires the State to revise the st rategy whenever significa nt changes are made. Significant changes include: Changes made through the 1115 Transformation Waiver; Adding new populations to the managed care programs; Expanding managed care programs to new parts of the state; and Carving new services into the managed care programs.

An MCO's Member Handbook must include a notice regarding member rights and responsibilities, in compliance with the UMCM, Chapter 3.4 (relating to Medicaid Managed Care Member Handbook Required Critical Elements). III. Abuse, Neglect, and Ex ploitation Defined The following statutory definitions of abuse, neglect and exploitation (ANE) apply to investigations of alleged ANE: Chapter 48 of the Texas Human Resources Code (relating to Investigations and Protective Services for Elderly a nd Disabled Persons); Chapter 260A of the Texas Health and Safety C ode (relating to Reports of Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation of Residents of Certain Facilities); and Chapter 261 of the Texas Family Code, Subchapter E, Section 261.404 (relating to Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 159 of 454 Investigation of Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation in Certain Facilities). HHSC defines critical events or incidents in the managed care cont racts, Attachment 2, Article 2, as those that may bring harm, or create the potential for harm, to an individual. Critical events or incidents include but are not limited to: abuse, neglect, or exploitation; the unauthorized use of restraint, s eclusion, or restrictive interventions; serious injuries that require medical intervention or result in hospitalization; criminal victimization; unexplained death; medication errors; and other incidents or events that involve harm or risk of harm to a member. IV. Critical Incident System The state has a system to prevent, identify, report , investigate, and remediate critical incidents that occur within the delivery of MLTSS as well as to track and trend results in order to make system improvements. The obligation to report abuse, neglect, and exploitation is mandated by statute and HHSC clarifies roles, expectations, and re sponsibilities for provi ders and MCOs in the managed care contracts. The critical incident systems consists of numero us levels of participan t protection: prevention, identification, and reporting of ANE ; investigations of ANE; mon itoring findings; remediation of issues; and consumer support for members. In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7431.10(e), HHSC is the single state Medicaid agency and retains oversight and full administrative au thority over the waiver program. A. Prevention 1. Licensure Requirements The state, through the Department of Aging a nd Disability Services (DADS), licenses the following LTSS providers: Adult day care facilities (T AC Title 40, Chapter 98); Adult foster care, serving four or more indi viduals (licensing: TAC Title 40, Chapter 92); Assisted living facilities (T AC Title 40, Chapter 92); Home and community support services ag encies (TAC Title 40, Chapter 97); and Nursing facilities (TAC Title 40, Chapter 19). Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 160 of 454 Additional LTSS providers licen sed through other entities: Emergency response system providers (TAC T itle 25, Part 1, Chapter 140, Subchapter B); Licensed durable medical equipment providers (TAC Title 25, Part 1, Chapter 229, Subchapter X); Providers of cognitive reha bilitation therapy services; Occupational therapists (TAC Title 40, Part 12); Physical therapists (TAC Title 22, Part 16); and Speech therapists (TAC Title 22, Part 32). Prior to issuing licensure to the above healthcar e providers, the state screens those facilities or persons for prior disciplinary or criminal history in Texas and in other states. In accordance with Section 1919(e)(2) of the Social Security Act , the state maintains a registry of all nurse aides who are certified to provide services in nursing fa cilities and skilled nursi ng facilities licensed by DADS. (See: 42 U.S.C. 1396r(e)(2)) The Nurse Ai de Registry (NAR) lists nurse aides who are unemployable because of confirmed instances of abuse, neglect, expl oitation, misappropriation, or misconduct against a nursing facility resident . For those individuals that do not require licensure, in accordance with state law, DADS maintains an Employ ee Misconduct Registry (EMR) that includes the name s of unlicensed persons who are unemployable because of confirmed instances of abuse, neglect, e xploitation, misappropriati on, or misconduct in the DADS facilities listed above. (See: Texas Health a nd Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 253 (relating to Employee Misconduct Registry) All DADS-regulated facilities and agencies are required to check both the NAR and EMR before hiring an individual and annually thereafter. In addition, all MC Os are required to check both the NAR and EMR prior to contracting with an unlicensed or uncertifi ed LTSS provider, and annually thereafter. 2. Credentialing Unlicensed or Uncertified Providers by MCOs Through their credentialing process, the MCOs ensu re that the agencies they contract with have met all licensure requirements. According to the managed care contracts, before contracting with an unlicensed LTSS provider or LTSS provider not certified by a health and human services agency, such as minor home modification or home-delivered meals provi ders, the MCOs must take steps to verify that the provider: has not been convicted of a crime listed in Texas Health and Safety Code, \u00a7250.006; is not listed as \"unemploya ble\" in the EMR or the NAR maintained by DADS by searching or ensuring a search of such registries is conducted before hire and annually thereafter; is knowledgeable of acts that constitute abus e, neglect, or exploitation of a member; is instructed on and understands how to report su spected abuse, neglect, or exploitation; adheres to applicable state laws if providing transportation; and is not a spouse of, legally responsible person fo r, or employment supervisor of the member who receives the service, except as allowed in the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program 1115 Waiver.

Identification and Reporting 1. Obligation to Report Under state law, a person is requ ired to report suspected abuse, neglect, or expl oitation of an individual receiving waiver se rvices to the appropriate st ate agency. More specifically: Reports to the Department of Fami ly and Protective Services (DFPS): A person having cause to believe that an individu al who is elderly or who has a disability is in a state of abuse, neglect, or exploitation is required to re port the information immediately to DFPS. (See: Texas Human Resources Code, Title 2, Subtitle D, Chapter 48, \u00a748.051 (relating to Reports of Abuse Neglect , or Exploitation: Immunities)) A person having cause to believe that a child's p hysical or mental health or welfare has been adversely affected by abuse or neglect by a pe rson must report the information immediately to DFPS. (See: Texas Family Code, Title 4, Subtitle E, Subchapter B, \u00a7261.101 (relating to Persons Required to Report; Time to Report)) A professional who has cause to believe that a ch ild has been abused or neglected or may be abused or neglected must make a report to DFPS within 48 hours afte r the professional first suspects abuse or neglect. (See: Texas Family Code, Title 5, Subtit le E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.101(b)) Reports to DADS: If a person has cause to believe that an individu al who is elderly or w ho has a disability has been abused, neglected, or e xploited in a facility or by a provider operated, licensed, certified, or registered by DADS, the person shall report the information to DADS. (See: Texas Human Resources Code, Title 2, Subtit le D, Chapter 48, \u00a748.051 (relating to Reports of Abuse Neglect, or Exploitation: Immunities) ) This requirement is also addressed in Chapter 260A of the Health and Safety Code. A person, including an owner or employee of a facility, who has cause to believe that the physical or mental health or welfare of a resident has been or may be adversely affected by abus e, neglect, or exploi tation caused by another person shall report the abuse, neglect, or exploitation to DADS and law enforcement as appropriate under Chapter 260A of the Texas Health and Safety Code. (See: Texas Health and Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chap ter 260A, \u00a7260A.002 (relating to Reporting of Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation)) Reports regarding the suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a re sident of a facility regulated by DADS may also be made to a local or state law enforcement agency, which in turn will refer the report to DADS to ensure that DADS is made aware of the allegations of ANE. Additionally, reports alleging that a resident's health or safety is in imminent danger; that a resident has died because of the alleged conduct; that a resident has been hospitalized or treated in an emergency room because of the allege d conduct; that the alleged conduct involves a criminal act; or that a resident has suffered bodily injury due to the alleged conduct shall be Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 162 of 454 made to both DADS and the appropriate law enfor cement agency. (See: Texas Health & Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A. 005 (relating to Telephone Hotline; Processing of Reports)) State agencies receiving reports of suspected abus e, neglect, or exploita tion keep the reporter's identity confidential. (See: Texas Human Re sources Code, Title 2, Subtitle D, Chapter 48, \u00a748.101 (relating to Confidentiality); Texas Health & Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A.008 (relating to Confiden tiality); and Texas Family Code, Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.101 (relating to Persons Requ ired to Report; Time to Report)) The failure to report suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a child or of an individual who is elderly or who has a disability is considered a criminal offense. (See: Texas Human Resources Code, Title 2, Subtitle D, Chapter 48, \u00a748.052 (rela ting to Failure to Report; Penalty); Texas Health & Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A.012 (rela ting to Failure to Report; Criminal Penalty); and Texas Family Code, Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.109 (relating to Failure to Report; Penalty)) 2. Managed Care Contracts According to the managed care contracts, MCOs must train and educate their staff, providers, and subcontractors to understand abuse, neglect, and exploitation and a ll prevention, detection, reporting, investigation and remedi ation procedures and requirem ents. In addition, MCOs must educate members about abuse, neglect, and expl oitation and ensure that MCO staff such as member services staff and service coordinato rs are knowledgeable abou t how to identify and report a critical event or incident such as abuse, neglect, and e xploitation. MCOs must administer training for service coordination staf f that includes identification and reporting of critical events or incidents. In addition to the information pr ovided to all members, a financ ial management services agency (FMSA), provides members who elect the consumer directed serv ices option with training and written information related to reporting allegation s of abuse, neglect, and exploitation (See: TAC Title 40, Chapter 41). C. Investigation of Abuse, Negl ect, or Exploitation (ANE) 1. DFPS DFPS investigates reports of alleged ANE of indi viduals who are elderly or have a disability. This includes investigations of: an adult who is elderly or ha s a disability and is receiv ing services from a home and community support services agency (HCSSA) or in an unlicensed adult foster care home; an adult with a disability or a child residing in or receiving services from a local authority, local mental health authority (L MHA), or community center; or an adult with a disability receiving serv ices through consumer directed services. DFPS investigations are governed by Title 2 of the Texas Human Resources Code, Subtitle D, Chapter 48 (relating to Investiga tions and Protective Services for Elderly and Disabled Persons). Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 163 of 454 When DFPS receives ANE reports concerning an indi vidual in a facility licensed by another state agency and explicitly responsib le for investigating ANE in th at facility, DFPS forwards the report to that agency for investigation. 2. DADS DADS investigates reports of ANE of individuals who are elderly or have a disability that occur in a facility or are perpetrated by a provider, either of which ar e operated, licensed, or certified by DADS. These investigations are governed by Title 2 of the Texas Human Resources Code, Subtitle D, Chapter 48 (relati ng to Investigations and Protec tive Services for Elderly and Disabled Persons) and Title 4 of the Texas Heal th and Safety Code, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A (relating to Reports of Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation of Resi dents of Certain Facilities). Reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation of a child under the age of 18 receiving services from a HCSSA are investigated by DADS pursuant to T itle 2 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, Subtitle G, Chapter 142, \u00a7142.009 (relating to Surveys; Consumer Complaints). 3. Law Enforcement State law requires DFPS and DADS to notify the a ppropriate law enforcement agency of reports of abuse, neglect, or exploitation duri ng certain investiga tions. Specifically: DFPS and DADS are required to immediatel y notify the appropriate law enforcement agency when a caseworker or supervisor has cause to believe that an individual who is elderly or who has a disability has been abused, neglected, or exploited by another person in a manner that constitutes a crimin al offense under any law. This requirement does not apply when the law enforcement agency is the entity to report the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation to DADS or DFPS. (See: Texas Human Resources Code, Title 2, Subtitle D, Chapter 48, \u00a748.1522 (relating to Reports of Criminal Conduct to Law Enforcement)) Within 24 hours after the receip t of a report of abuse, ne glect, or exploitation of a resident of a DADS facility, DADS must report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement agency when the complaint allege s: a resident's health or safety is in imminent danger; a resident has recently died because of conduct al leged in the report of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or other complaint; a resident has been hospitalized or been treated in an emergency room because of conduc t alleged in the report of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or other complain t; a resident has been a victim of any act or attempted act described by Section 21.02, 21.11, 22.011, or 22.021 of the Texas Penal Code; or a resident has suffered bodily injury, as that term is defined by Section 1.07 of the Texas Penal Code, because of conduct alleged in the report of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or other complaint. (See: Texas Health & Safe ty Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A.007 (relating to Investigatio n and Report by Department)) DFPS and DADS must immediat ely notify the appropriate la w enforcement agency of any report that concerns the suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitati on of a child or the Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 164 of 454 death of a child from abuse or neglect. If DFPS or DADS finds eviden ce indicating that a child may have been abused, neglected, or exploited, DFPS or DADS must report the evidence to the appropriate law enforcement agency. (See: Texas Family Code, Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.402 (relating to Investigative Reports)) These requirements do not apply when the law enforc ement agency is the entity to report the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation to DADS or DFPS. Specifically, Section 22.04 of the Texas Penal Code makes it a criminal offense to intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, by act or intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly by omission, cause to a child, individual who is elde rly or an individual with a disability serious bodily injury; serious mental deficiency, impairment, or injury; or bodily injury. Section 32.53 of the Texas Penal Code ma kes it a criminal offe nse to intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause th e exploitation of a child, individual who is elderly, or an individual with a disability. All reports that allege abuse or neglect by a person responsible for a child's care, custody, or welfare received by a local or state law enforcemen t agency are referred immediately to DFPS or the designated agency. (See: Texas Family C ode, Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.105(a)) Furthermore, reports of abuse, neglect or expl oitation of an individual residing in a facility regulated by DADS received by a law enforcemen t agency are referred to DADS. (See: Texas Health & Safety Code, Title 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A.005 (re lating to Telephone Hotline; Processing of Reports)) If a child has been or may be the victim of conduc t that constitutes a criminal offense that poses an immediate risk of physical or sexual abuse of a child that coul d result in death or serious harm to the child, DFPS conducts a join t investigation with the appropr iate law enforcement agency. (See: Texas Family Code, Titl e 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7 261.301(f)) Additionally, if DFPS initiates an investigation and determines that the abuse or neglect does not involve a person responsible for the child's care, custody, or welfar e, DFPS refers the report to the appropriate law enforcement agency for further investigation. (See: Texas Family Code , Title 5, Subtitle E, Chapter 261, \u00a7261.105(d)). Upon receipt of a report of alle ged abuse, neglect, or exploita tion of a person residing in a facility licensed, operate d, certified or register ed by DADS, law enforcement must acknowledge the report and begin a joint inve stigation with DADS within 24 hour s after receipt of the report. (See: Texas Health & Safety Code, T itle 4, Subtitle B, Chapter 260A, \u00a7260A.017) D. Monitoring HHSC monitors ANE investigation findings as we ll as MCO compliance efforts. The state of Texas maintains overall responsibility for the ope ration of the critical incident system and engages in continuous process improvements. Protections against ANE are not limited to HHSC's jurisdiction, as other state and local entities have related responsibilities, described in Section C (relating to Investig ation of Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation (ANE)) of this Attachment. Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 165 of 454 E. Remediation HHSC has the authority to terminate or replace an MCO or its subcontractor(s), according to managed care contracts, if either are convicted of a criminal o ffense related to the neglect or abuse of members in connection with the delivery of an item or service. If an MCO fails to meet contractual requirements related to protection ag ainst or reporting of ANE , such as contracting with LTSS providers that fail to meet standards outlined in Sections A and B, then HHSC has authority to use a variety of remedies, up to and including contract termination. F. Member Support Texas maintains a consumer support system that is independent of the MCOs to assist members in understanding managed care and resolution of problems regarding services, benefits, access, and rights. Texas' independent consumer supports system (ICSS) consists of HHSC's Medicaid/CHIP Division, Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman), the state's managed care Enrollment Broker (EB, \"MAXIMUS\"), and community support from the Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs). These entities ope rate independently of any Medicaid MCO and work with beneficiaries and MCOs to ensure beneficiar ies seeking to enroll wi th a MCO understand the managed care program, MCO options, and the process for resolving issues. Data related to the ICSS is reported and monitored regularly, on at leas t a quarterly basis, by a ll entities discussed in this report. HHSC's Medicaid/CHIP Division provides guida nce to the MCOs on Medicaid policy and managed care program requirements, reviews MCO materials, monitors the MCOs' contractual obligations, answers managed car e inquiries, and resolves mana ged care complaints. HHSC's Medicaid/CHIP Division also monitors impl ementation of MCO corrective action plans and assesses damages when necessary. V. Restraints, Seclusions, and Medication Management DADS licenses adult foster care, assisted living providers, nursing facilities, HCSSAs, and adult day care providers. DADS oversight of medi cation management and use of restraint and seclusion is conducted primarily through licens ure inspections and complaint investigations. DADS is responsible for ensuring compliance wi th licensing requirements and inspects licensed providers for compliance with licensing require ments, such as medication management and authorized use of restraint and seclusion. DADS licensing inspections include medication administration review that is based on a sample of client and resident records. The state imposes penalties, such as administrative penalties an d license revocation, when harmful medication management practices are detected. DADS survey staff follow up to ensure plans of correction are properly implemented. DADS survey staff conduct follow-up surveys and inspections to ensure the provider has effectively implemented plans of correction requi red due to cited state violations. DADS tracks the number of validated instances of licensure violations. A. Restraint Pursuant to federal and state rule s, a waiver recipient has the right to be free from any form of restraint or seclusion used as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, or retaliation. (See: 42 CFR \u00a7438.100 (relating to Enrollee Rights), and TAC Title 1 \u00a7353.202 (relating to Member Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 166 of 454 Bill of Rights)) The state does permit the use of restraints in limited and appropriate circumstances, as detailed in this section. A ll allegations of improper restraints by providers licensed by DADS are referred to DADS for investigation. 1. Adult foster care (AFC) All AFC clients have the right to be free from physical or chemical restraints not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms or imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience. A provider may use physical or chemical restraints only if the use is aut horized in writing by a physician or if the use is necessary in an emergenc y to protect the resident or others from injury. A physician's written authorization for the use of restraint must specif y the circumstances under which the restraint may be used and the duration for which the restraint may be used. Except in a behavioral emergency, restraint may only be ad ministered by qualified medical personnel. The AFC provider must inform the resident verbally and in writing, before or at the time of admission, of his rights and respons ibilities, including those relate d to restraint and seclusion. HHSC applies and enforces these requirements for both licensed and unlicensed AFC facilities pursuant to the provisions in the STAR+PLU S Handbook. AFC providers w ho provide services to four or more unrelated individuals must be lic ensed as assisted living facilities (ALFs) and are also subject to the requirements discussed below. In addition, AFCs licensed as Type A or B ALFs are also subject to ALF restraint rules that are specific to Type A or Type B facilities. These rules are found under TAC Title 40, Chapter 92, \u00a792.41 (relating to Standards for Type A and Type B Assisted Living Facilities). Pursuant to these rules, all restrain ts for purposes of behavior manageme nt, staff convenience, or resident discipline are prohibited. A facility may use physical or chemical restraints only (1) if the use is authorized in writing by a physician and specifies : (a) the circumstances under which a restraint may be used; and (b) the duration for which the restraint may be used; or (2) if the use is necessary in an emergency to protect the resident or others from injury. A restraint must not be administ ered under any circumstance if it obstructs the resident's airway, including a procedure that places anything in, on, or over the resident's mouth or nose; impairs the resident's breathing by putting pr essure on the resident's torso; interferes with the resident's ability to communicate; or places the resident in a prone or supine position. After the use of restraint, the facility must, with the resident's consent, make an appointment with the resident's physician no later than th e end of the first working day after th e use of restraint and document in the resident's record that the appointment was made. If the resi dent refuses to see the physician, staff must document the refusal in the resident's record. As soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the use of restraint, the facility must notify the resident's legally authorized representative or an individual ac tively involved in the resident's care, if there is such a person, that the resident has been rest rained, unless the release of this information would violate other law. Staff at Type A or B ALFs mu st attend training which includ es practices to decrease the frequency of the use of restrain t and alternatives to restrain ts. Before or upon admission of a resident, a facility must notify the resident and, if applicable, the resident's legally authorized representative, of DADS' ru les and the facility's policies related to restraint. In order to decrease the frequency of the use of restrain t, facility staff must be aware of and adhere to the findings of Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 167 of 454 the required resident assessment. A facility may adopt policies th at allow less use of restraint than allowed by these rules. 2. Assisted living facility Assisted living facilities (ALFs) must comply with restrain t rules found in TAC Title 40, Chapter 92, \u00a792.125 (relating to Resident's Bill of Rights and Provider Bill of Rights). Pursuant to these rules, ALF residents have the ri ght to be free from physical and chemical restraints that are administered for the purpose of discipline or conven ience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. A provider may use physical or chemical restraints only if the use is authorized in writing by a physician or if the us e is necessary in an emergency to protect the resident or others from injury. A physician's writt en authorization for the use of restraint must specify the circumstances under which the restraint may be used and the duration for which the restraint may be used. Except in a behavioral em ergency, restraint may only be administered by qualified medical personnel. Furthermore, Type A and Type B ALFs must also comply with restraint rules in TAC Title 40, Chapter 92, \u00a792.41 (relating to Standards for Type A and Type B Assisted Living Facilities). Pursuant to these rules, all restraints for purpos es of behavior manageme nt, staff convenience, or resident discipline are prohibited. A facility may use physical or ch emical restraints only (1) if the use is authorized in writi ng by a physician and specifies: (a) the circumstances under which a restraint may be used; and (b) the duration for which the restraint may be used; or (2) if the use is necessary in an emergency to protect the resident or others from injury. A restraint must not be administ ered under any circumstance if it obstructs the resident's airway, including a procedure that places anything in, on, or over the resident's mouth or nose; impairs the resident's breathing by putting pr essure on the resident's torso; interferes with the resident's ability to communicate; or places the resident in a prone or supine position. After the use of restraint, the facility must, with the resident's consent, make an appointment with the resident's physician no later than th e end of the first working day after th e use of restraint and document in the resident's record that the appointment was made. If the resi dent refuses to see the physician, the facility must document the re fusal in the resident's record. As soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after the use of restra int, the facility must notify th e resident's legally authorized representative or an individual ac tively involved in the resident's care, if there is such a person, that the resident has been rest rained, unless the release of this information would violate other law. Staff at Type A or B ALFs mu st attend training which includ es practices to decrease the frequency of the use of restrain t and alternatives to restrain ts. Before or upon admission of a resident, a facility must notify the resident and, if applicable, the resident's legally authorized representative, of DADS' ru les and the facility's policies related to restraint. In order to decrease the frequency of the use of restrain t, facility staff must be aware of and adhere to the findings of the required resident assessment. A facility may adopt policies th at allow less use of restraint than allowed by these rules. 3. Nursing facility Nursing facilities must comply with restrain t rules found in TAC Title 40, Chapter 19, \u00a792.125 (relating to Nursing Facility Requirements for Li censure and Medicaid Ce rtification). Nursing Attachment G HCBS Participant Safeguards Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 168 of 454 facility providers may use restra ints, of any kind, only with the or ders of the attending physician. Residents must be informed in writing upon ad mission, and during their stay, of DADS' rules and the facility's policies rela ted to the use of restraint and involuntary seclusion. As part of orientation, and annually, each employee must recei ve instruction regarding restraint reduction. If restraints are used to treat a resident's medical condition, th e resident must be monitored hourly, and at a minimum, restraints must be released every two hours for a minimum of ten minutes, and the resident must be repositioned. Restraints that obstruct the resident's airway, impair the resident's breathing, in terfere with the resident's abili ty to communicate, or place the resident in a prone or supine pos ition are prohibited. Th e use of restraints a nd their release must be documented in the clinical record. 4. HCSSA Members receiving services from home health ag encies, licensed as HCSSAs, have the right to be free from restraint when it is used for someone else's conven ience or is meant to force the member to do something, or punish the member (TAC Title 1, Chapter 353, Subchapter C (relating to Member Bill of Rights and Responsibilities)). 5. Adult Day Care Centers Providers of day activity and health services (DAHS) require an adult day care (ADC) license issued by DADS in accordance with TAC Title 40, Chapter 98 (relating to Adult Day Care and Day Activity and Health Services Requirements). ADC providers must comply with licensure a nd program rules found in TAC Title 40, Chapter 98, \u00a798.61 (relating to General Requirements) an d \u00a798.62 (relating to Program Requirements). Pursuant to this section, ADC provi ders must provide a client with a written list of the client's rights, as outlined under the Texas Human Resource Code, Chapter 102, \u00a7102.004 (relating to List of Rights). \u00a7102.003 (relating to Rights of the Elderly) se ts forth the specific rights addressed by \u00a7102.004. Under this section, ADC client s have the right to be free from physical or chemical restraints that ar e administered for the purpose of discipline or convenience and are not required to treat the indi vidual's medical symptoms. A person providing services may use physical or chemical restraints only if the use is authorized in writing by a physician or the use is necessary in an emergency to protect the client or others from injury. A physician's written authorization for the use of rest raint must specify the circumst ances under which the restraint may be used and the duration for which the rest raint may be used. Except in an emergency, restraint may only be administered by qualified medical personnel. B. Seclusion The state does not permit the use of seclusion as it relates to se rvices delivered through managed long term services and supports. All allegations of improper seclusion of individuals receiving managed long term services and supports by pr oviders licensed by DADS are referred to DADS for investigation.

Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 1: UC Claiming Protocol fo r Hospitals and Physician Groups Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 174 of 454 OVERVIEW The intent of the Texas Medicaid Waiver Application (\"UC Application\") is to provide a simplified way to subsidize the costs incurred by hospitals, physicians and mid- level professionals for patient care services (as further defined below) provided to Medi caid and Uninsured patients that are not reimbursed through the claims adjudication process or by othe r supplemental payments. All UC payments to providers and all expenditures described as UC perm issible expenditures must not exceed the cost of services provided to Medicaid and Uninsured patient s as defined and discussed in this protocol. These unreimbursed Medicaid and Uninsured costs are determined based on one of two UC tools depending on the type of entity providing the service. These tools have been approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). To the extent that there ar e UC expenditures a hospital provider wants to make against the UC cost limit, and the methodology for capturing such expenditures is not stated in this protocol, the expenditures must be approved by CMS prior to the submission of the reconciliation for the applicable period for the expenditures. The Medicaid coverage limitations unde r Section 1905(a) of the Act, wh ich exclude coverage for patients in an institution for mental diseases (IMD) who ar e under age 65, except for coverage of inpatient psychiatric hospital services for individuals under age 21, are applicable. The Texas Hospital Uncompensated Care tool (\"TXHUC\") will be utilized by hospitals to determine their unreimbursed costs for Medicaid and Uninsured pati ents for physicians' and mid-level professionals' direct patient care services where the hospital incu rs these costs. In addition, if the hospital has unreimbursed hospital costs for services provided to Me dicaid and Uninsured patients that were not paid via the claims adjudication process or thru the Me dicaid Disproportionate Share (DSH) pool, these costs can be included in the TXHUC application. Also, fo r some hospitals meeting the criteria, unreimbursed pharmacy costs for take home drugs provided by the hospital to Medicaid and Uninsured patients will be included in the TXHUC application. The Texas Physicians Uncompensated Care tool (\" TXPUC\") will be utilized by physician and/or mid- level professional entities that provide direct patient care physician and/or mid-level professional services to Medicaid and Uninsured patients in a hospital setting and the professional entity is not reimbursed under a contractual or employment relationship by the hospital for these services. The professional entity may also include in its TXPUC application the costs related to direct patient care services provided to Medicaid and Uninsured patients in a non-hospital se tting. Only physician entities that had previously received payments under the Texas Medicaid Physicia n UPL (Upper Payment Limit) program and their successor organizations are eligible to submit a TXPUC application under the 1115 Waiver program. The costs and other data included in the initial UC application should be representative of the fiscal period from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010. The UC appli cation should be submitted to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHS C) by the deadline specified by HHSC on its website at http://www.hhsc.state.tx.us/rad/hospital-sv cs/1115-waiver.shtml. Applications for future fiscal periods which will cover the period from October 1 through September 30 of the applicable years will be due to HHSC by the deadline specified by HHSC. For hos pitals, due to the five (5) month time period for the completion of the Medicare cost report which serv es as the basis for the costs to be reported on the UC application, some entities will not have complete d their cost report prior to the deadline for the submission of their UC application. In these situations , the hospital should submit a full 12 months of data Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 1: UC Claiming Protocol fo r Hospitals and Physician Groups Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 175 of 454 on the UC application based on the most recently comp leted Medicare cost reporting period that includes a minimum of twelve (12) months. It should be noted that when HHSC comp letes the reconciliation process, HHSC will utilize the hospital's actual data reported on their respective UC applications, weighted accordingly, to determine the hospital's final UC Pool distribution. This should not be an issue for physician and mid-level professi onal organizations since their fina ncial data should be available immediately following the end of their respective fiscal years. All costs and other data reported in the UC Appli cation are subject to the Medicare regulations and Program instructions. The entity submitting the UC Application must mainta in adequate supporting documentation for all information included in th e UC Application in accordance with the Medicare program's data retention policies. The entity must submit the supporting documentation upon request from HHSC. For purposes of the UC Application, a mid-level professional is defined as: Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) Nurse Practitioner Physician Assistant Dentist Certified Nurse Midwife Clinical Social Worker Clinical Psychologist Optometrist For purposes of the UC Application, a visit is defined as: A face-to-face encounter between a patient and a physician and/or mid-le vel professional. Multiple encounters with the same physician and/or mid-level professional that take place on the same day and at a single location for the same diagnosis constitute a single visit. More than one visit may be counted on the same day (which may be at a different locati on) in either of the following situations: a) When the patient, after the first visit, su ffers illness or injury requiring another diagnosis or treatment, two visits may be counted. b) When the patient is seen by a dentist an d sees a physician and/or mid-level professional, two visits may be counted. Texas Hospital Uncompensated Care Tool (TXHUC) The TXHUC is comprised of a certification page, 4 primary schedules (a Summary Schedule and Schedules 1, 2 & 3) and various schedules. Schedul es 1, 2 and 3 determine the hospital's unreimbursed costs for services provided to Medicaid and Uninsured patients related to phys ician and/or mid-level professional direct patient care costs, pharmacy co sts, and DSH hospital costs, respectively. The supporting schedules are the schedules hospitals are re quired to submit to HHSC when applying for the Medicaid DSH program. Each of these schedules along with instructions for the completion of the schedule is detailed below.

An officer is defined as a member of the provider's senior mana gement such as the chie f executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, etc. The certifi cation must contain an original signature and not a copy or electronic signature. If the TXHUC is an in itial submission, it should be so indicated in the appropriate box on the certification page. Upon receipt of a final and/or amended final Medicar e cost report, the provider is required to submit a \"final\" TXHUC based on the costs and other data cont ained in the final cost report. This final TXHUC will be utilized by HHSC to perform a final reconcilia tion of the actual costs for the period and the cost utilized to determine the provider's distribution from the UC Pool for that period. If the TXHUC submission is a final submission, it should be so indicat ed in the appropriate box on the certification page. Upon the termination of the 1115 Waiver, providers w ill be required to submit actual cost data in the prescribed format of the TXHUC for a minimum of two years for purposes of reconciling the UC Pool payments for the last two years of the Waiver with the provider's actual costs incurred for those fiscal periods Summary Schedule Column 1 - Summarizes the Medicaid and Uninsured cost s determined on Schedules 1, 2 & 3. These amounts will flow automatically from the respec tive schedules and no input is required. Column 2 - The initial distribution of the Uncompensated Care Pool (\"UC Pool\") for the fiscal period 10/1/2011 - 9/30/2012 will be based on the costs fo r the period from 10/1/2009 - 9/30/2010 as computed on Schedules 1, 2 & 3. If the provider knows these costs are not representative of their actual costs for the period from 10/1/2011 - 9/30/2012, due to changes in their contractual arrangements or other operational or economic issues, the provider can make an adjust ment to these costs. The provider is required to maintain supporting documentation to support their adjustment amount and make this information available upon request from HHSC and/or CMS. Column 3 - Represents the net Medicaid and Uninsured cost s after any adjustments and is determined by summing the amounts in Columns 1 & 2. The net cost amount will be utilized to determine the provider's distribution from the UC Pool. Schedule 1 The schedule computes the costs related to direct pa tient care services provided by physicians and mid- level professionals to Medicaid and Un insured patients. To be included in the schedule, these costs must be recorded on the hospital's accounting records a nd reported on the hospital's Medicare cost report, Worksheet A, Columns 1 and/or 2. The source for these costs and other data will be the hospital's Medicare cost report(s) that span the period from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC payments are being determined.

Removed from hospital costs on Worksheet A-8 / A-8-2 If the professional physicians' costs on Worksheet A-8- 2, Column 4 include Medicare Part A costs (e.g. departmental administration, hospital committee ac tivities, etc.) that were reported as professional component due to lack of a physicians' time study (s) to allocate the costs between professional and provider component and/or application of the Reas onable Compensation Equivalents (RCE) , these costs must be excluded from the physicians' costs related to direct patient care professional services and cannot be included for UC reimbursement purposes unless the following conditions are met: (1) The costs must be allocated between direct patient care (Medicare Part B) and reimbursable Medicare Part A activities. The costs associated with Medicare Part A activities must be subjected to the Medicare RCEs. If the hospital does not have adequate time studies for the application of the RCEs, then the hospital must obtain a proxy, signed and dated by the physician that estimates the amount of time spent on allowable Medicare Part A activities, teaching of interns & residents and medical students, research and direct patient care for the period the costs were incurred. The proxy should account for 100% of the physicians' time related to the costs incurred by the hospital. If the costs are for a gr oup of physicians, each physician in the group must complete a proxy. (2) For a physician the hospital can elect to apply the RCE limit on an individual physician basis or in the aggregate. (3) The hospital must allocate the physicians' costs based on the physicians' proxy and apply the applicable RCE limits to the Medicare Part A non-teaching physicians'. The hospital must maintain auditable docu mentation of the determination of the allowable Part A non-teaching physician. (4) For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 10-1-2012, the hospital is expected to obtain adequate and auditable time studies from each physician and/or mid-level professional providing Medicare Part A services to the hospital for the proper application of the RCEs via the Medicare 2552 cost report.

Physician costs related to direct patient care and physician Part A co sts not in excess of the RCE limits should be reported on the respective line in Column 1 for cost reporting periods ending on or prior to 9-30-2012. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after 10-1-2012, Phys ician Part A costs cannot be included in Column 1.The physicians' costs should be reported in the cost center in which the expenses were reported on Worksheet A, Column 3 of the Medicare cost report. Hospital costs for mid-level professional practitioner ser vices that have been identified and removed from hospital costs on the Medicare cost report are to be included. Typically these costs are comprised of salaries and direct fringe benefits (payroll taxes, vacat ion and sick pay, health and life insurance, etc.), contract fees and professional liability insurance. The mid-level professional practitioner types to be included are: (1) Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (2) Nurse Practitioners (3) Physician Assistants (4) Dentists (5) Certified Nurse Midwives (6) Clinical Social Workers (7) Clinical Psychologists (8) Optometrists To the extent these mid-level practitioners' prof essional compensation costs are not included in Worksheet A-8-2, Column 4, but are removed from hospital costs through an A-8 adjustment on the Medicare cost report, these costs may be recognized if the mid-level professional practitioners are Medicaid-qualified practitioners for whom the service s are billable under Medicare separate from hospital services. If the physician and/or mid-level practitioner costs are reported in a non-reimbursable cost center on the hospital's Medicare cost report, Worksheet A, these cost s can be included in Column 1. The costs to be included would be the costs from Worksheet B Part I, the last column for the applicable line(s). Hospitals may include physician and/or mid-le vel professional support staff compensation, data processing, and patient accounting costs as physician a nd/or mid-level professional-related costs to the extent that: Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 1: UC Claiming Protocol fo r Hospitals and Physician Groups Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 179 of 454 1. These costs are removed from hospital inpatient and outpatient costs because they have been specifically identified as costs related to physician and/or mid- level professional services; 2. They are directly identified on W/S A-8 as adjustments to hospital costs; 3. They are otherwise allowable and auditable provider costs; and 4. They are further adjusted for any n on-patient-care activities such as research based on the physician and/or mid-level professional time studies. If these costs are removed as A-8 adjustments to the hospital's general service cost centers, these costs should be reported on the General Services line (line 1) in Column 1. If the hospital has costs for physicians and one or mo re types of mid-level professional for a given cost center, the costs can be combined and the total reporte d in Column 1 provided the same allocation statistic will be utilized to apportion the costs to Medicaid and Uninsured. If the hospital elects to utilize different allocation statistics to apportion the physician and/or any type of mid-level professional costs for a given cost center the cost center can be subscripted. Column 1a - The recommended apportionment statistic for physician and/or mid-level professional costs is total billed professional charges by cost center. If a hospital does not maintain professional charges by payer type separately in its patient accounting syst em, then the professional costs can be apportioned based on total billed hospital departmental charges. Total billed hospital departmental charges by cost center are identified from the hospital's applicable Medicare cost report(s). If professional charges related to the physician a nd/or mid-level professional services whose costs are reported in Column 1are utilized as the apportionment statistic, the professional charges must be from the same corresponding time period as the costs. The hos pital must maintain adequate and auditable documentation to support the sta tistics reported in Column 1a. If the hospital reports costs on the General Services line (Line 1) in Column 1, the recommended allocation statistic reported in Colu mn 1a would be the aggregate total departmental charges (professional or hospital department, based on the apportionment statistic for th e specific cost centers) for all cost centers. Column 1b - The allocation basis the hospital elects to utilize to apportion the costs from Column 1 should be identified for each cost center. The approved allocation bases are total departmental professional charges if available. Otherwise de partmental hospital charges may be utilized. Column 2 - A cost to charge ratio (CCR) for each cost cen ter is calculated by dividing the total costs for each cost center reported in Column 1 by the total allocation statistic for each cost center reported in Column 1a.

Column 1b - The allocation basis is hospital departmental charges. If the hospital wants to utilize an alternative allocation basis, they must submit a written request to Texas HHSC that identifies the alternative allocation basis and an explanation as to wh y the alternative allocation basis results in a more equitable apportionment of the pharmacy costs. HHS C will provide a written response to the hospital's request within 60 days of receiving the request and their decision is final. Column 2 - The Cost-to-Charge ratio is computed by dividing the costs reported in Column 1 by the allocation statistic reported in Column 2. The CCR is carried out to six (6) decimal places. Column 3b - The charges related to the prescription drugs provided to Medicaid FFS patients under the Texas Vendor Drug program are reported in Column 3b, Line 1.

Schedule 3 The schedule determines the hospital's Medicaid DSH co sts (Medicaid shortfall and uninsured costs) in excess of the payments received by the hospita l from the Texas Medicaid DSH Program. HHSC will complete the schedule based on the hospital's DSH hospital specific limit (HSL) and the DSH Program payments received by the hospital for the applicable fiscal year (10/ 1/20XX - 9/30/20YY) as described in the steps below. Line 1 - For hospitals that submitted a DSH Application to HHSC for the applicable year consisting of the applicable federal fiscal year (FFY) DSH and Co st Report Collection Form worksheets, HHSC will determine the DSH HSL to be reported on Line 1 based on the data per their DSH Application. The hospital may not submit revised data. If the hospital submitted a complete DSH Application and did not receive a payment from the DSH Pool, HHSC will determine the HSL to be reported on Line 1based on the hospital's DSH Application submission utilizing the same methodology employed by HHSC in the determination of these costs for DSH Pool payment purposes. The hospital may not submit revised data.

HHSC will utilize the data from the hospital's DSH worksheet along with the data per th e Cost Report Collection Form to calculate the hospital's DSH HSL to be reported on Line 1. HHSC will employ the same methodology used to compute the hospital-specific DSH costs (cap) for the determin ation of the DSH Pool payments to compute the DSH costs (cap) for inclusion in Line 1. If the hospital did not submit a DSH Application to HHSC, they must complete the DSH and Cost Report Collection Form worksheets in the TXHUC Tool to allow HHSC to compute their DSH HSL for inclusion in Line 1. HHSC will employ the same methodology used to determine a hospital's DSH HSL utilized in the distribution of DSH Pool payments to determine a hospital's DSH HSL to be included in Line 1. Line 2 - HHSC will determine the Texas Medicaid DSH Pr ogram payments received by the hospital for the applicable fiscal year and report the payments on Line 2. Line 3 - The excess hospital DSH costs are computed by subtracting the DSH payments received on Line 2 from the DSH HSL on Line 1. The excess costs will be included in the hospital's costs to determine their distribution from the UC Pool. If the hospita l's DSH payments on Line 2 exceeds its DSH HSL on Line 1, the negative amount is not offset against th e hospital's other UC Pool costs as computed in the TXHUC. DSH Application This schedule is one of the two schedules included in the Texas Medicaid DSH Application. If the hospital submitted this schedule to HHSC as part of its Medicaid DSH Application for the period from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010, the hospital should not complete this schedule in conjunction with the submission of the TXHUC T ool. HHSC will utilize the data per the hospital's Medicaid DSH Application to compute the amounts to be reported on Schedule 3, Line 1. If the hospital did not submit a DSH Application to HHSC for the period from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC payments are being determined, the hospital should complete this schedule in accordance w ith the instructions contained in the Instructions- DSH Data Collection schedule. If the hospital elects to not have its excess hospital DSH costs included in its UC Pool application, the hospital is not required to complete the schedule.

Interim Reconciliation of Physician and Mid-Leve l Professional Services Payments to Hospitals For the physician and/or mid-level professional, self-pay pharmacy and unreimbursed Medicaid DSH costs, UC payments for FFY 2012 are determined utilizing the TXHUC, which is based on data for services furnished during the period 10/1/2009 - 9/ 30/2010. The FFY 2012 UC payments are reconciled to the costs per the as-filed Medicare cost reports for the fiscal period 10/1/2011 - 9/30/2012 once the cost report(s) have been filed with the State. If, at the end of the interim reconciliation process, it is determined that a provider received an overpayment , the federal share of the overpayment will be properly credited to the federal government through an adjustment shown on the CMS-64; if a provider was underpaid, the provider will receive an adjusted payment amount. Similar interim reconciliations will be conducted for each year of the waiver.

The same method as describ ed for the interim reconciliation will be used except that the finalized Medicare UC physician a nd/or mid-level professional cost amounts and updated uninsured data will be substituted as appropriate. If, at the end of th e final reconciliation process, it is determined that a hospital received an overpayment, th e federal share of the overpayment will be properly credited to the federal government through an ad justment shown on the CMS-64. Similar final reconciliations will be conducted for each year of the Waiver. The timelines for the submission of interim and fi nal reconciliations are de tailed in the \"section 1115 Waiver UCC Program Interim and Final Reconciliati on Schedule (attached). Scheduling of the Final Reconciliations will take place three years after the close of each Demonstration Year. The number of TXHUCs that will be subject to the final reconciliati on will be dependent on the availability of finalized cost reports for each Demonstration Year. Texas Physician Uncompensated Care Tool (TXPUC) The purpose of the TXPUC is to determine the physic ian professional costs related to services provided to Medicaid (FFS & HMO) and Uninsured patients by phy sician organizations in a non-hospital setting. Only professional organizations who previously par ticipated in the Texas Medicaid Physician UPL (\"Physician UPL\") program are eligible to submit a TXPUC and receive a distribution from the UC Pool. Under the Physician UPL, supplemental payments we re made only for physician services performed by doctors of medicine and osteopathy licensed in Texas. With effect from Demonstration Year (DY 2), all costs (direct and indirect) incurred by the physician organization related to services provided by mid-level professionals may be reported on the physic ian organization's UC application. For purposes of the TXPUC Application, a mid-level professional is defined as: Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) Nurse Practitioner Physician Assistant Dentist Certified Nurse Midwife Clinical Social Worker Clinical Psychologist Optometrist The TXPUC is based on established ph ysician and/or mid-level cost finding methodologies developed by the Medicare program over the past 40 years. The schedules that follow use the same or similar methodology and worksheet identification process us ed by the Medicare hospital cost report.

All line numbers and descriptions are linked to Worksheet A. If lines ar e inserted, they must be inserted on all worksheets and in the same location. The costs to be reported in the TXPUC are limited to identifiable and auditable compensation costs that have been incurred by the physician organization for services furnished by physicians and/or mid-level professionals in all applicable sites of service, including services provided in a hospital setting and non- hospital physician office sites for which the professi onal organization bills for and collects payment for the direct patient care services. The basis for the total physicians' and/or mid-le vel professionals' compensation costs incurred by the professional organization will be the organization's ge neral ledger. The costs should be representative of the services provided during the period from Octobe r 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC payments are be ing determined. If the organization's fiscal year straddles October 1 it will be necessary to pro-rate th e costs for the two fiscal periods that comprise the period from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC payments are being determined. Total costs, reported by cost centers/departments, ar e then allocated between clinical and non-clinical activities using a CMS-approved time-study. The phys ician and/or mid-level professional time study forms to be used are located on the Texas Health and Human Service Commission website. Time studies should be completed for a two (2) week period once per quarter during the fiscal year. Ideally, the time study period will not be the same two weeks in an y 2 given quarters. Prior to October 1, 2012, the physician professional organization may use a CMS- approved benchmark RVU methodology in lieu of the CMS-approved time study to allocate physician co mpensation costs between clinical and non-clinical activities only. Effective October 1, 2012, the phys ician organization must utilize the CMS-approved time study to allocate physician and/or mid-level prof essional compensation costs between clinical and non- clinical activities. The allocation of physician and/ or mid-level professional compensations costs based on the benchmark RVU methodology will not be accepted after September 30, 2012. The result of the CMS-approved time study (or the benchmark RVU methodology before October 1, 2012) is the physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation costs pertaini ng only to clinical, patient care activities. The physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation co sts are reduced by National Institute of Health (NIH) grants to the extent the research activities com ponent is not removed via physician time studies. The physician clinical and/or mid-level professional co sts are subject to further adjustments and offsets, including any necessary adjustment to bring the costs in line with Medi care cost principles. There will be an offset of revenues received for services furnishe d to non-patients and other applicable non-patient care revenues that were not previously offset or accounted for by the application of the CMS-approved time study. The above physicians' and/or mid- level professionals' compensation costs must not be duplicative of any costs claimed on a hospital's TXHUC. Additional costs that can be recognized as professional direct costs are, costs for non-capitalized medical supplies and equipment (as defined in the instructions for Worksheet A, Column 3 below) used in the furnishing of direct patient care.

The determination of the facility-speci fic indirect rate is defined in the instructions for Worksheet A, Column 8 below. Other than the dir ect costs defined above and the application of an approved indirect rate, no other costs are allowed. Total billed professional charges by cost center relate d to physician and/or mid-level professional services are identified from provider records. The total professional charges for each cost center related to Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS), Medicaid managed care (HMO), and uninsured physician and/or mid-level professional services, billed directly by the professional organization, are identified using aud itable financial records. Professional charges related to services provided to out-of-State Medicaid FFS an d HMO patients should be included in the Medicaid charges reported on the TXPUC. The professional organiza tion must map the claims to the respective cost centers using information from their billing systems. E ach charge must be mapped to only one cost center to prevent duplicate mapping and claiming. These char ges must be associated with services furnished during the period covered by the TXPUC (the peri od from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC payments are being determined). The professional organization must prepare a worksheet that identifi es professional charges related to physician and/or mid-level professional services provided to patie nts covered by Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO, uninsured and all other payers for each cost center to be used to report the total charges on Worksheet B and the Program charges on Worksheet D. The worksheet total charges must be reconciled to the total charges per the professional organization's general ledge r and/or financial statements for the applicable fiscal period(s). Certification The certification page must be signed and dated by an officer or administrator of the provider. An officer is defined as a member of the entity's senior mana gement such as the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief operating officer, etc. The certifi cation must contain an original signature and not a copy or electronic signature. Upon the termination of the 1115 Waiver, entities will be required to submit actual cost data in the prescribed format of the TXPUC for a minimum of two years for purposes of reconciling the UC Pool payments for the last two years of the Waiver with the provider's actual costs incurred for those fiscal periods Summary Schedule Column 1 - Summarizes the Medicaid and Uninsured costs determined on the applicable columns from Worksheet D. These amounts will flow automatica lly from the respective columns and no input is required.

If the professional organization's fiscal period does not coin cide with the reporting period covered by the UC application, the indirect cost ratio for the two peri ods should be weighted based on the number of months each period is within the UC application reporting pe riod to determine the organization's actual indirect cost ratio. The professional organization's costs per its general ledger for the applicable fiscal period(s) should be used to identify the allowable direct and indi rect costs to be used to compute the indirect cost rate. The indirect cost rate should be rounded to two (2) decimal places (e.g. 22.58%). The professional organization must submit its calculation of its indi rect cost rate with its UC application. Allowable indirect costs are defined as costs incurre d by the professional organization in support of the physicians' and mid-level professionals' direct patie nt care services, regardless of the location where these services are performed. Medicare cost finding pr inciples should be used to determine allowable indirect costs. Allowable indirect costs would include , but are not limited to, nurse staff and other support personnel salaries and fringe benefits involved in direct patient care, billing and administrative personnel salaries and fringe benefits related to direct patient care, space costs (building and equipment depreciation or lease, interest, utilities, maintenance, etc.) relate d to the space utilized to provide care to patients. Nonallowable indirect costs would include but are no t limited to; advertising for the purpose of increasing patient utilization, bad debts related to accounts recei vable, gain or loss on the sale of depreciable assets, fines or penalties imposed by local, state or federal go vernment or their agencies. Any fringe benefits cost related to the physicians' and mid- level professionals' compensation costs should be included in Columns 1 and/or 2 of Worksheet A should not be included in the allowable indirect costs. The non-capital equipment and supply costs reported in Column 3 of Worksheet A above should also be excluded from allowable indirect costs. Total costs would be determined based on the prof essional organization's total expenses per its general ledger. The following is an illustrative example of the calculation of an indirect cost rate for a professional organization.

It is the sum of Columns 6, 7 and 8. If line(s) have been added to the worksheet, it will be necessary to copy the formula in th is column from an existing line to the line(s) that were added. Worksheet A-1 This worksheet determines the phys icians' and/or mid-level professiona ls' compensation costs for direct patient care services. These costs are determined sep arately for services provided in a hospital-based and non-hospital based setting. If there are services provided in a unique setting, these costs are determined in Section 3. If a physician provides services in more than one setting, it will be necessary to report his/her data for each applicable setting separately. Data on this worksheet should be reported based on the physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' speci alty/cost center identified on the worksheet. Physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' compensat ion costs are comprised of the direct payments made by the professional organization to the phys ician and/or mid-level professional for all services provided by the physician and/or mid-level professi onal on behalf of the professional organization. These costs would be salaries and related fringe benefits, payments under a contractual arrangement between the physician and/or mid-level professional and the prof essional organizations, funding of a retirement and/or deferred compensation plan by the professional organiza tion on behalf of the physician, and costs related to a health and/or long-term disability program for the physician and his/her dependents. If the professional organization has a physician and/or mid-level professional time study to allocate the physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' compensati on costs to direct patient care services and the physicians' and/or mid-level professi onals' other activities, it is not necess ary to complete this worksheet. The professional organization can complete a supporting schedule in which the time study can be applied to the physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' compensation costs and the result should be input directly in Column 1 of Worksheet A. In the ab sence of a physician and/or mid-level professional time study to allocate the physicians' and/or mid-leve l professionals' compensation costs between direct patient care services and the physicians' and/or mi d-level professionals' other activities prior to 10-1- 2012, the costs for direct patient care services will be determined based on each physician's work Relative Value Units (RVUs) for direct patient car e. Effective 10-1-2012, professional organizations are expected to obtain a time study from each physician and/or mid-level professional to be used in the allocation of the physicians' and/ or mid-level professionals' compensation costs to direct patient care Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 1: UC Claiming Protocol fo r Hospitals and Physician Groups Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 191 of 454 services and other activities. The physician and/or mid- level professional time study forms to be used are located on the Texas Health and Human Services website. Time studies should be completed for a two (2) week period once per quarter during the fiscal year. Id eally, the time study period will not be the same two weeks in any two given quarters. If a professional organization incurs costs for services provided by another entity under a contractual arrangement, those costs can be included. The professi onal organization would be required to offset the revenue received on its UC Application to eliminate any duplicate payment for the costs related to these services. Column 1 - The physicians' and/or mid-level professionals ' work RVUs are reported in this column for periods prior to 10-1-2012. The s ource for the work RVUs are the professional organization's internal records. The source for the work RVUs should be ma intained by the professional organization and made available upon request by HHSC and/or CMS. An in dividual physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' work RVUs cannot exceed the benchmark RVU for one FTE. For periods after 10-1-2012, the physician's and/or mid-level professionals' time related to direct patient care activities based on their time study is reported in this column. Column 2 - The benchmark RVU for an FTE for each physic ian and/or mid-level professional specialty is reported in this column for periods prior to 10-1-2012. Th e benchmark RVUs for each physician specialty FTE are contained in the Benchmark RVU worksheet of the TXPUC. If the professional organization has a physician specialty that is not listed on the Benchmark RVU worksheet, the benchmark RVU for the physician specialty most closely related to the actual physician specialty should be utilized. The benchmark RVU must be multiplied by the number of ph ysicians and mid-level professionals included in each cost center to determine the benchmark RVU to be reported in this column. For periods after 10-1- 2012, the physician's total time related to the phys ician's compensation reported in Column 4 based on their time study is reported in this column. Column 3 - The RVU percentage is computed based on the actual physicians' and mid-level professionals' RVUs reported in Column 1divided by the benchmark RVUs reported in Column 2 for each line. The RVU percentage should not exceed 1.00000. If line(s) have been added to the worksheet, it will be necessary to copy the formula in this column from an existing line to the line(s) that were added. Column 4 - The physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation costs for each physician and/or mid-level professional/specialty/cost center are reporte d in this column. The source for the compensation costs are the professional organization's internal reco rds. The source for the physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation costs should be mainta ined by the professional organization and made available upon request by HHSC and/or CMS. Column 5 - The physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation costs for direct patient care services are computed based on the RVU percentage in Column 3 multiplied by the total physicians' and mid-level professionals' compensation costs reported in Column 4. If line(s) have been added to the worksheet, it will be necessary to copy the formula in this column from an existing line to the line(s) that were added. The costs in this column flow to Worksheet A, Column 1.

It allows for the reclassification of costs be tween cost centers reported on Worksheet A. Any reclassifications reported on this worksheet will n eed to be input on Worksh eet A, Column 5 in the applicable line. Worksheet A-8 This adjustments worksheet is sim ilar to the Worksheet A-8 in the Hospital 2552 Medicare cost report. It allows for any required adjustment(s) to the costs reported on Worksheet A (e.g. NIH grant revenue if research costs are not identified via the time st udies). All payments received for services provided to another entity's patients should be offset against the a pplicable costs. All payments received from another entity to subsidize the care provided to a patient who was referred by the entity should be offset against the applicable costs. Any adjustments reported on th is worksheet will need to be input on Worksheet A, Column 7 in the applicable line. Worksheet B The worksheet calculates the cost-to- charge ratio (CCR) to be utilized in apportioning the physicians' and/or mid-level professionals' compensation cost s for services provided to Medicaid and Uninsured patients that is the basis for the determination of the professional organization's distribution from the UC Physician Pool. Column 1 - The net physicians' and mid-level professiona ls' costs from Worksheet A, Column 8 will flow to this column. Column 2 - The physicians' and/or mid-level professionals ' total billed charges are reported in this column. As an alternative, the professional organiza tion can use the number of visits as the allocation basis to apportion the costs. If the professional organiza tion does elect to utilize patient visits to apportion the costs, the allocation basis reported at the top of this column should be changed from Total Billed Charges to Patient Visits. For either allocation basi s, the source for this data will be the professional organization's internal records. If the professional or ganization's fiscal period straddles October 1, it will be necessary to pro-rate the data from the two fi scal periods that encompass the period from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demons tration year for which UC payments are being determined. Column 3 - The CCR is computed by dividing the costs re ported in Column 1 of this worksheet by the total allocation basis reported in Column 2 of this worksheet. Worksheet D This worksheet computes the physicians' and/or mi d-level professionals' costs for services provided to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO and Uninsured patients. It utilizes the CCR determined on Worksheet B, Column 3 and the charges for physician and/or mid-level professional services. The source for the Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO and Uninsured data are th e professional organization's internal records. If the professional organization's fiscal period straddles Oct ober 1, it will be necessary to pro-rate the data Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 1: UC Claiming Protocol fo r Hospitals and Physician Groups Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 193 of 454 from the two fiscal periods that encompass the pe riod from October 1 through September 30 two years prior to the demonstration year for which UC paym ents are being determined. The allocation basis reported on Worksheet B Column 2 must be the sa me as the apportionment basis reported on Worksheet D, Columns 2 - 7. If the professional organization elect s to utilize patient visits to apportion the costs rather than billed charges, the apportionment basis at the top of Columns 2 - 7 should be changed from Billed Charges to Patient Visits. Column 1 - The CCR from Worksheet B, Colu mn 3 flows to this column. Columns 2 through 7 - The apportionment statistics for inpatient and outpatient services provided to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO and Uninsured patients are reported in the respective columns. Columns 8 - 13 - The physicians' and mid-level professionals ' costs for inpatient and outpatient services provided to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO and Uninsure d patients are computed by multiplying the CCR reported in Column 1 multiplied by the apportionmen t statistics reported in Columns 2 - 7 for the respective columns. The total costs for each column ar e determined at the bottom of th e worksheet. All revenues received from any source related to the physician and/or mid-level professional services provided to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid HMO and Uninsured should be reported on the Less Payments line at the bottom of the worksheet in the respective column. This would incl ude any payments received from third-party payers, patient copays, etc. The Net Unreimbursed Cost for Columns 8 through 13 flows to the Cost Summary worksheet of the TXPUC tool. This cost will be utilized to determin e the professional organization's distribution from the UC Physician Pool. Interim/Final Reconciliation of Physician Payments to Professional Organizations The physician UC payments for DY 1 (FFY 2012) are determined utilizing the TXPUC that utilizes data for the fiscal period 10/1/2009 - 9/30/2010. These DY 1 (FFY 2012) UC payments are reconciled to the data per the professional organization's DY 3 (FFY 2014) TXPUC, which contains contemporaneous data for the fiscal period 10/1/2011 - 9/30/2012 once the DY 3 TXPUC has been filed with the State. Once the TXPUC for the expenditure year has been finalized by the State, a sole reconciliation of the finalized costs per the TXPUC to all UC payments made for the same period will be carried out, including adjustments for overpayments and underpayments if neces sary. If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that a professional organiza tion received an overpayment, the federal portion of the overpayment will be properly credited to the fede ral government through an adjustment shown on the CMS-64. Similar sole interim/final reconciliations will be conducted for each year of the Waiver. The timelines for the submission of interim and fi nal reconciliations are de tailed in the \"section 1115 Waiver UCC Program Interim a nd Final Reconciliation Schedule.

Page 3: Dental Cost Settlement DIRECTIONS TO COMPLETE PAGE 3 Page 3 identifies and summarizes all dental serv ices costs. Much of the information contained within this page is automatically pulled from other pages; however, there are unique items of cost that must be entered in this page. Only allocable expenditures related to Medicai d Fee-for-Service, Medica id Managed Care and Uncompensated Care as define d and approved in the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement 1115 Waiver Program will be included for supplemental payment. Direct cost methods must be used whenever reasonably possible. Direct costing means that allowable costs, direct or indirect , incurred for the benefit of, or di rectly attributable to, a specific business component must be direct ly charged to that particular business component. Direct cost accounting may include: 1. Dedicated Cost Centers: Cost may be includ ed for those cost centers that are solely dedicated to Medicaid and Uncompensated Care. 2. Multiple Cost Centers: Cost may be included for those cost centers that are not solely dedicated to Medicaid and Uncompensated Ca re. However, the provider must submit a detailed approved Cost Allocation Plan (CAP). If cost allocation is necessary for cost- reporting purposes, governmental providers mu st use reasonable methods of allocation and must be consistent in their use of a llocation methods for cost-reporting purposes across all program areas and business entitie s. The allocation method should be a reasonable reflection of the actual business operations. Allocation methods that do not reasonably reflect the actual business opera tions and resources expended toward each unique business entity are not acceptable. Allo cated costs are adjusted if HHSC considers the allocation method to be unreasonable. The provider must submit a detailed summary of their cost allocation methodology includi ng a description of the components, the formula for calculating the percentage and any additional supporting documentation as required by HHSC. Supplemental schedules must also be attached to the cost report listing each employee, job title, total salary and benefits, the applicable allocation percentage and the allocation amount that wi ll be included in the cost report. The amounts from the supplemental schedule allo cated to the Medicaid and Uncompensated Care programs should match the amounts ente red on Page 6 Worksheet B with additional detail entered on Page 7 Worksheet C. If Indirect Cost (IDC) is incl uded, that amount should be listed in line 2.30 (Other) with the detail described in either the E xplanation Box or as a separate attachment.

IDCR detail should include the methodology for determining the IDCR, the percentage and amount of the IDCR and if the dental provider is already using the IDCR to claim cost on another report. If IDCR costs are claimed in line 2.30, indirect or admi nistrative costs cannot also be claimed as non-clinical cost in lines 2.26 a., 2.27 a. or in administrative salaries and compensation in Page 6 (Worksheet B). IDCR cost s may be disallowed if it is determined that the provider has already claimed those same IDCR costs on this or another report. Additional detail regarding an agency's IDCR must be provided on Page 7 Worksheet C. This page sums the payroll expenses and adds ot her costs to calculate the total cost of dental services. Identified redu ctions, either from Page 6 or entere d manually with descriptions in the Explanation Box, are subtracted to calculate the adjusted amount of dental costs allowable as part of the cost report. The cost report identifies the portion of a llowable costs that are related to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid MCOs, and Uncompensate d Care and applies the cost-to-charge-ratio applicable for the cost report period. This ratio is applied to billed charges associated with Medicaid FFS and MCO paid claims and Uncomp ensated Care billed charges resulting in the total computable amount for dental services. Th is amount is then reduced by f Medicaid FFS, Medicaid MCO paid claims and any reimburse ment received for Uncompensated Care. The resulting amount is then multiplied by the appl icable federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to calculate the Federa l and state amounts.

Definitions: Cognizant agency - agency responsible for reviewing, negotia ting, and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals developed in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A- 87. Cost Allocation Plans - are the means by which costs are identified in a logical and systematic manner for reimbursement under federa l grants and agreements. Cost-to-charge ratio -- A provider's reported costs are allocated to the Medicaid program based on a cost-to-billed-charge ratio. Cost-to- billed charge ra tio is calculated as the Total Allowable Cost reported for the service period to represent the numerator of th e ratio to the billed charges of the total Medicaid paid claims for the service period that represents the de nominator of the ratio. This ratio is applied to Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 3: UC Claiming Protoc ol for Ambulance Providers Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 212 of 454 calculate total billed charges associat ed with Medicaid paid claims or total computable amount for the cost report. Direct Cost - means any cost which is identified specifically with a particular final cost objective. Direct costs are not limited to items which are incorporat ed in the end product as material or labor. Costs identified specifically with a contract are direct costs of that contract. All costs identified specifically with other final cost objectives of the contractor are direct costs of those cost objectives. Federal Medical Assistance Part icipation (FMAP) Rate -- is the share of state Medicaid benefit costs paid for by the federal government. Indirect Costs - costs incurred and identified with having two or more cost objectives but not specifically identified with any final cost objective. Indirect Cost Rate - is a device for determining in a reasonable manner the proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It is the ratio, ex pressed as a percentage, of the indirect costs to the direct costs. Medicaid Fee-For-Service (FFS) Paid Claims -- Medicaid payments made by the Health and Human Services Commission through the Texas Me dicaid Healthcare Part nership to enrolled providers for services provided to Medicaid recipients. Medicaid Managed Care --provides for the deliv ery of Medicaid health benefits and additional services through an arrangeme nt between a state Medicaid agency and managed care organizations (MCOs) that accept a set payment for these services. Medicaid payments are made by the MCO's to providers for servic es provided to Medicaid recipients. Un-insured -- an individual who has no he alth insurance or other sour ce of third-party coverage for medical/health services. Uninsured cost -- the cost to provide ambulance services to uninsured patients as defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. An individual whose third-pa rty coverage does not include the service provided is considered by HHSC to be uninsured for that service. Medicare -- A federal system of health insurance for people over 65 years of age and for certain younger people with disabilities. Other third-party coverage - Commercial Pay Insurance -- health insurance that covers me dical expenses and disability income for the insured. Commercial health in surance can be categorized according to its renewal provisions and type of medical benefits provided. Comm ercial policies can be sold individually or as part of a group plan.

Much of the information contained with in this exhibit is pulle d from either Exhibit 5 or Exhibit 6; however, there are unique items of cost that are identified in this exhibit. Only allocable expenditures related to Medicaid, Medicaid Managed Care and Uncompensated Care as defined and approved in the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement 1115 Waiver Program will be included for supplemental payment. This Exhibit sums the personnel expenses a nd adds additional costs to calculate the total cost of Medical and Un compensated Care Services. Direct cost methods must be used whenever reasonably possible. Direct costing means that allowable costs, direct or indirect , incurred for the benefit of, or di rectly attributable to, a specific business component must be directly charge d to that particular business component. For example, the payroll costs of a direct serv ice employee who works across cost areas within one contracted program would be directly charge d to each cost area of that program based upon that employee's continuous daily time sheets a nd the costs of a direct care employee who works across more than one service delivery area woul d also be directly charged to each service delivery area based upon that employee's con tinuous daily time sheet s. Health insurance premiums, life insurance premiums, and other empl oyee benefits are applie d as direct costs. Direct Cost Accounting may include: a. Dedicated Cost Centers which are comprised of a distinctly identifiable department or unit whose costs are associated with a specific activity; or b. Multiple Cost Centers which included cost for those cost centers that are not solely dedicated to one activity but may be allocated to multiple activities. Governmental providers must use reasonable met hods of allocation and must be consistent in their use of allocation methods for cost-reporti ng purposes across all program areas and business entities. The allocat ion method should be a reasonable reflection of the actual business operations. Allocation methods th at do not reasonably reflect th e actual business operations and resources expended toward each unique business entity are not acceptable. Allocated costs are adjusted if HHSC considers the allocation method to be unreasona ble. The provider must submit a detailed summary of their cost allocati on methodology including a description of the components, the formula for calculating th e percentage and any additional supporting documentation as required by HHSC. Supplemental sc hedules must also be attached to the cost report listing each employee, job title, total sa lary and benefits, the applicable allocation percentage and the allocation amount that will be included in the cost report. The amounts from the supplemental schedule allocated to the Medicaid and Uncompensated Care programs should match the amounts entered on Exhibit 6 Schedule B with additional detail entered on Page 7 Attachment H UC Claiming Protocol and Application Part 3: UC Claiming Protoc ol for Ambulance Providers Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 218 of 454 Worksheet C. Any change in cost -reporting allocation methods from one year to the next must be fully disclosed by the contracted provider on its cost report Indirect Costs Rate If an Indirect Cost Rate IDCR) is utilized, that rate must be applied to all appropriate cost objectives specifically identified in the cost report . Indirect cost is calculated by multiplying the Total Allowable costs by the provider's approved indir ect cost rate. These indirect rates are developed by the state cognizant agency and are updated annually. The methodology used by the respective cognizant agen cy to develop the Indirect Cost Rate (IDCR) has been approved by the cognizant federal agency, as required by the CMS guide. Indirect costs are included in the claim as reallocated costs. The provider is responsible to ensure that costs included in the cost report not included in the indirect cost rate, and no costs will be accounted for more than once. All indirect cost calculations de veloped to arrive at the total a llowable costs must be included in Worksheet 7 of the cost report. All scenarios utili zed to calculate the indirect cost must be fully explained as well. The provider must verify that no duplicative costs are included in line 2.33 \"Other Cost\". IDCR costs will be disallowed if it is determined that the provider has already claimed those same IDCR costs. All documents that support the indirect cost rate calculation must be maintained by the approved government al entity and must be made immediately available upon request by HHSC. Identified reductions, from Exhibit 6, are subtract ed to calculate the adjusted amount of Direct Medical Costs allowable as part of the cost report. The cost report identifies the portion of allowable costs that are related to Medicaid FFS, Medicaid MCOs, and Uncompensated Care and applies the cost to charge ratio a pplicable for the cost report period. The ratio is applied to billed charges associated with Medicaid FFS, Medicai d MCOs, and Uncompensated Care paid claims resulting in the total computable amount for ambulance services. This amount is then reduced by the amount of Medicaid FFS, Medicaid MCOs paid claims and any reimbursement received for Uncompensated Care. The resulting amount is then multiplied by the applicable federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to calculat e the amount of settlement due to, or owed by (if negative) the provider. The exhibit is separated into the sections identifying: Personnel / Payroll Expenses. This section of the Exhibit includes, in part, expenditures from Exhibit 6. Other Operating Costs. This section of the Exhibit in cludes, in part, expenditures from Exhibit 5. Reductions to Allowable Costs. This section of the Exhi bit includes reductions to expenditures identified in Exhibit 6.

Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program Special Terms and Conditions (STC) 45 of the De monstration authorizes Texas to establish a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (D SRIP) program. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide incentive paym ents to hospitals and other providers for investments in delivery system reforms that incr ease access to health care , improve the quality of care, and enhance the health of pa tients and families they serve. The program of activity funded by the DSRI P shall be based on Regional Healthcare Partnerships (RHPs). Each RHP shall have ge ographic boundaries and will be coordinated by a public hospital or local governmental entity w ith the authority to make intergovernmental transfers. The public hospital or local government al entity shall collabora te with hospitals and other potential providers to deve lop an RHP Plan that will accele rate meaningful delivery system reforms that improve patient care for low- income populations. The RHP Plans must be consistent with regional shared mission and quality goals of the RHP and CMS's triple aims to improve care for individuals (including access to car e, quality of care, and health outcomes); improve health for the population; and lowe r costs through improvements (without any harm whatsoever to individuals, families, or communities). B. RHP Planning Protocol and Progr am Funding and Mechanics Protocol In accordance with STC 45(a) and 45(d)(ii)(A) & (B), the RHP Pl anning Protocol (Attachment I) defines the specific initiatives that will ali gn with the following four categories: (1) Infrastructure Development; (2) Program Innova tion and Redesign; (3) Quality Improvements; and (4) Population-focused Improvements. The Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment J) describes the State and CMS revi ew process for RHP Plans, incentive payment methodologies, RHP and State repor ting requirements, and penaltie s for missed milestones. Each RHP must submit an RHP Plan that identi fies the projects, outcomes, population-focused objectives, and specific milestones and metrics in accordance with these attachments and STCs. C. Organization of \"Attachmen t I: RHP Planning Protocol\" Attachment I has been organized into the following sections: I. Preface II. Key Principles III. Required RHP Plan Elements IV.

Category 4 Population Focused Improvements Appendix: CMS-Provided Key El ements for Learning Collaboratives and Continuous Quality Improvement Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 233 of 454 This document is supplemented by a metric specification guide developed by the state in consultation with CMS that provides more de tail on the Category 1, 2, 3, and 4 metrics, including the data source for each measure, th e measure steward, and the high performance level or other target setting methodology th at will be used to determine targets for Category 3 metrics. The metric specification guide will be made available on the state's website. II. Key Principles A. Responding to the Needs and Challenges of the Texas Health Care Delivery System Texas faces many unique health chal lenges. For example, rates of obesity and chronic diseases are some of the highest in the nation, and many Texans do not have a regular source of care to help manage and prevent these diseases. Ma ny Texans do not receive regular treatment for mental health issues, and as a result, mental health problems account for a large percentage of admissions to hospitals that could have b een avoided. These challenges and many more disproportionately affect safety net provide rs who serve Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured. DSRIP provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient care for low-income populations by incentivizing delivery system reform s that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care, and enhance the health of pa tients and families they serve. These investments not only contribute to the triple aim, but they ca n also help position safety net providers for the emerging healthcare market, in which data-based quality performance and cost-efficiency drive competition. This protocol presents a \"menu\" of evidence-b ased projects that can be incentivized through DSRIP. These projects were selected by HHSC and CMS to have the maximum impact on the health system challenges facing Texas. Since health system reform requires regional colla boration, providers must select projects that relate to the community needs id entified by the RHP, and RHPs mu st engage stakeholders in the development of RHP plans. The requiremen ts for the community needs assessment and stakeholder engagement are described in sec tion 10 of the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment J). B. Interconnection and Shared Orientation of Projects DSRIP activities are divided into four categorie s, which are interrelated and complementary: Category 1 Infrastructure Development la ys the foundation for delivery system transformation through investments in technol ogy, tools, and human resources that will Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 234 of 454 strengthen the ability of providers to serve populations and continuously improve services. Category 2 Program Innovation and Redesi gn includes the pilo ting, testing, and replicating of innovative care models. Category 3 Quality Improvements includes outcome reporting and improvements in care that can be achieved within four years. Category 4 Population-focused Improvements is the reporting of measures that demonstrate the impact of delivery syst em reform investments under the waiver. Multiple, complementary initiatives will be occurring in the same RHP simultaneously, reinforcing each other in the tran sformation of care delivery. The selected projects for the RHP plan should possess the following qualities: While they are highly related projects, each improvement project is distinct; All of the proposed projects are oriented to creating more ef fective and coordinated care provision; and There is a coordinated appr oach to supporting improved pa tient experience, population health, quality improvement, and cost control. In order to achieve meaningful change by th e end of the demonstr ation, every performing provider must link each of its Category 1 and 2 projects to a related Ca tegory 3 outcome. The outcomes shall assess the results of care experi enced by patients, includi ng patients' and h ealth status, patients' experien ces in the health system, and efficiency/cost. Additional information about category 3 outcomes and the setting of outcome targets is provided in section 11.d of the Progr am Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment J). C. Fostering Continuous Quality Improvement In order to achieve and sustain success at re sponding to community needs, providers and communities will need to apply be st practices in continuous quali ty improvement. Most notably, learning collaboratives are essential to the succ ess of high quality health systems that have achieved the highest level of performance. Pe rforming providers are strongly encouraged to form learning collaboratives to promote shari ng of challenges and testing of new ideas and solutions by providers implementing similar proj ects in each RHP. These regionally-focused learning collaboratives also can inform the learning collaborative c onducted annually during DYs 3-5 to share learning, experiences, and be st practices acquired fr om the DSRIP program across the State. For the Key Elements for Learning Collaboratives provided by CMS, please see Attachment 1. RHPs can be a natural hub for this type of shared learning by conn ecting providers who are working together on common challenges in the community, but providers and RHPs are also encouraged to connect with others across Texas to form a \"community of communities\" that can Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 235 of 454 connect on an ongoing basis to share best pr actices, breakthrough ideas, challenges and solutions. This will allow regions to learn fr om each other's challenges and develop shared solutions that can accelerate the spread of breakthrough ideas across Texas. III. Required Plan Elements Based on the projects and measures listed in this Protocol and the requirements for plan development defined in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment J) , RHPs will submit five-year RHP plans that describe: (1 ) the reasons for the selection of the projects, based on local data, gaps, community needs, and ke y challenges; (2) how th e projects included in the plan are related to each ot her and how, taken together, the projects support broad delivery system reform relevant to the patient population; and (3) the progression of each project year- over-year, including the specifics and exact data source needed per project per milestone per metric per year. Each RHP must submit an RHP Plan using a State- approved template that identifies the projects, objectives, and specific milestones, metrics, meas ures, and associated DSRIP values. The plan must meet all requirements pursuant to Sta ndard Terms and Conditions (STCs) 45 and 46 and follow the format outlined in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Section III, Key Elements of Proposed RHP Plans). Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 236 of 454 Organization of Projects and Measures The RHP five-year plan will include sections on each of the four categories included in this Protocol. Categories 1-2 Requirements: For each project selected fr om Category 1 and 2, RHP Plans must include a narrative that has the following subsections: Identifying Information: Id entification of the DSRIP Category, name of the project, project element, and RHP Performing Provider name and Texas Provider Identifier (TPI) involved with the project. Each project sha ll be implemented by one Performing Provider only. Project Goal: The goal(s) for the project, whic h describes the challenges or issues of the Performing Provider and brief description of the major delivery system solution identified to address those challenges by impl ementing the particular project; the starting point of the Performing Provide r related to the project a nd based on that, the 5-year expected outcome for the Perfor ming Provider and the patients. Rationale: As part of this subsection, each Performing Provider will provide the reasons for selecting the project, milestones, and metrics based on relevancy to the RHP's population and circumstances, community need, and RHP priority and starting point with available baseline data, as well as a descri ption of how the proj ect represents a new initiative for the Performing Provider or signi ficantly enhances an existing initiative, including any initiatives that may have rela ted activities that are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These projects shoul d be data-driven and based on community needs and local data that demonstrate the project is addressing an area of poor performance and/or disparity th at is important to the population (i.e. a provider selecting a project to implement a chronic care model for diabetes should discuss local data such as prevalence of diabetes in the community and rates of preventable admissions for diabetes and descri be why diabetes is an important health challenge for the community). Related Category 3 Outcome Measure(s): The Performing Provide r will indicate the Category 3 Outcome Measure(s) and reasons /rationale for selecting the outcome measure(s). The rationale shoul d be data-driven, including: o Data supporting why these outcomes are a priority for the RHP; o Validated, evidence-based rationale desc ribing how the related Category 1 or 2 project will help achieve the Category 3 outcome measure selected; and/or o Explanation of how focusing on the outco mes will help improve the health of low-income populations. Relationship to Other Projects and Measures: A description of how th is project supports, reinforces, enables, and is related to othe r Category 1 and 2 projects and Category 4 population-focused improvement me asures within the RHP Plan Milestones and Metrics Table: For each proj ect, RHP Plans shall include milestones and metrics adopted in accordance with this Prot ocol. In a table format, the RHP Plan will indicate by demonstration year when project milestones will be achieved and indicate the data source that will be used to document and verify achievement.

For each year, the estimated available non-federal sh are must be included and the source of non-federal share identified. IV. Explanation of the Fo rmat of this Document Each RHP will follow the guidelines in this document and provide specificity in its plan. The Categories 1 and 2 projects that follow include the following components, which guide the RHPs in what to include in the plan: Project Area: The overarching subject matte r the project addresses. Project Goal: This component describes the purpos e of performing a project in the project area. Project Option: This component describes a compre hensive intervention a Performing Provider may undertake to accomplish the project goal. \"Other\" Project Options: Each Category 1 and 2 proj ect area includes an \"other\" project option. Providers that wish to implement an innovati ve, evidence-based project that is not included on the list of project options for a project area may choose the \"other\" project option. Providers implementing an i nnovative, evidence-based project using the \"Other\" project option may design their pr oject using the process and improvement milestones specified in the project area or ma y include one or more customizable process milstones P-X and/or improvement milestones I-X, as appropriate for their project. \"Other\" project options will be subject to ad ditional scrutiny during the plan review and approval process. Project Component: Activities that may occur in conj unction with one another to carry out a project option. Project components may be required core components or optional components. Required core components are list ed with the project options with which Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 239 of 454 they must be completed. Providers either mu st incorporate all required core components in their plan narrative or they must provide justification for why they are not including a core component (e.g., the provider was at a more advanced stage with the project and had already completed one or more core components). The metric specification guide, which is a co mpendium to this protocol, provides the following additional information: Milestone: An objective for DSRIP performance comp rised of one or more metrics. o Process Milestones: Objectives for completing a process that is intended to assist in achieving an outcome. These in clude objectives for continuous quality improvement, rapid-cycle testing, and colla borative learning that are intended to help providers share best practices, sp read breakthrough ideas, and test new solutions with the goal of performing at a higher level and achieving outcomes within the 5 years. o Improvement Milestones: Objectives, such as output s, to assist in achieving an outcome. Metric: Quantitative or qualitative indicator of progress towa rd achieving a milestone from a baseline. There are one or more metr ics associated with each milestone. The RHP participants may tailor the targets in the metric, as appropriate. Data Source: The data source often lists multiple options that could be used for the data being measured by the metric. Please note th at these options identif y appropriate sources of information, but as allowed, Performing Providers may identify alternative sources that are more appropriate to their individua l systems and that provide comparable or better information. The RHP plans will specif y the exact data source being used for the metric each year. Rationale: This component describes why the metr ic is appropriate, including academic citations, descriptions of how widely used th e metric is in the i ndustry, and other reasons why the metric is seen as the appropriate da ta to meaningfully measure progress toward achieving the milestone. Additional Process Milestones In an effort to avoid repetition, it is permi ssable for each project to include any one of the following as process milestones, in addition to or in lieu of the other process milestones listed. Each is in the spirit of co ntinuous improvement and applyi ng and sharing learning. If a Performing Provider elects to use one or more of these process milestones, the RHP plan would describe the related specifics for the milestone , such as the metric and data source, using customizable process milestone P-X, wh ich is included in each project area: Participate in a learning collaborative (e .g., in DY 2, join the Hospital Engagement Network, as documented by the appropriate participation document)Conduct a needs/gap analysis, in order to inform the establishmen t or expansion of services/programs (e.g., in DY2, conduct a gap analysis of high-impact sp ecialty services to id entify those in most demand by the local community in order to ex pand specialty care capacity targeted to those specialties most needed by patients) Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 240 of 454 Pilot a new process and/or program Assess efficacy of processes in place and recommend process improvements to implement, if any (e.g., in DY 4, evalua te whether the primary care redesign methodology was as effective as it could be, by: (1) performing at least two team-based Plan-Do-Study-Act workshops in the primar y care clinics; (2) documenting whether the anticipated metric improvements were met; (3) identifying opportunities, if any, to improve on the redesign methodology, as documented by the assessment document capturing each of these items) Redesign the process in order to be more effective, incorp orating learnings (e.g., in DY 4, incorporate at least one new element into th e process based on the assessment, using the process modification process to include the specificity needed as new learnings are discovered in DY 3) Implement a new, improved practice piloted in one or more Performing Providers within an RHP (e.g., in DY 5, implement improved pr actices across the Performing Provider's ambulatory care setting) Establish a baseline, in order to measure improvement over self Complete a planning process/submit a plan, in order to do appropria te planning for the implementation of major infrastructure devel opment or program/process redesign (e.g., in DY 2, complete a planning process for a care navigation program to provide support to patient populations who are most at risk of receiving disconnected and fragmented care) Designate/hire personnel or teams to suppor t and/or manage the project/intervention Implement, adopt, upgrade, or improve technology to support the project Develop a new methodology, or refine an existing one, based on learnings Incorporate patient experience surveying Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12, 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment 2 Approved June 14, 2013 Page 241 of 454 Category 1 Infrastructure Development Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12, 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment 2 Approved June 14, 2013 Page 242 of 454 Category 1 Table of Contents 1.1 Expand Primary Care Capacity .................................................................................. 243268 1.2 Increase Training of Primary Care Workforce .......................................................... 244269 1.3 Implement a Chronic Diseas e Management Registry ............................................... 246271 1.4 Enhance Interpretation Services and Culturally Competent Care ............................. 248273 1.5 Collect Valid and Reliable Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REAL) Data to Reduce Disparities ................................................................................................................... .......... 251276 1.6 Enhance Urgent Medical Advice ............................................................................... 254279 1.7 Introduce, Expand, or Enhance Telemedicine/Telehealth ......................................... 256281 1.8 Increase, Expand, and Enhance Dental Services ....................................................... 262287 1.9 Expand Specialty Care Capacity ................................................................................ 265290 1.10 Enhance Performance Improvement and Reporting Capacity ................................... 267292 1.11 Implement technology-assisted services (teleheal th, telemonitoring, telementoring, or telemedicine) to support, coordinate, or deliver behavioral health services ......................... 271296 1.12 Enhance service availability (i.e., hours, lo cations, transportation, mobile clinics) to appropriate levels of be havioral health care ......................................................................... 275300 1.13 Development of behavioral health crisis stabilization services as alternatives to hospitalization. .............................................................................................................. ........ 277302 1.14 Develop Workforce enhancement initiative s to support access to behavioral health providers in underserved market s and areas (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, LMSWs, LPCs and LMFTs.) ................................................................................................................... ...... 280305 Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 243 of 454 1.1 Expand Primary Care Capacity Project Goal: Expand the capacity of primary care to better accommodate the needs of the regional patient population and community, as identified by the RH P needs assessment, so that patients have enhanced access to services, allowing them to r eceive the right care at the right time in the right setting. Projects plans related to access to primary care services should address current challenges to the primary care system and patie nts seeking primary care services, including: expanded and/or enhanced system access points, barriers to transportation, and expanded or enhanced primary care services to include urgent care. Project Options: a) Establish more primary care clinics b) Expand existing primary care capacity Required core proj ect components: a) Expand primary care clinic space b) Expand primary care clinic hours c) Expand primary care clinic staffing c) Expand mobile clinics d) \"Other\" project option: Implement othe r evidence-based project to expand primary care capacity in an innovative manner not described in the project options above. Providers implementing an innovative, evidence-based project using the \"Other\" project option ma y select among the process and improvement milestones specified in this project area or may include one or more customizable process milestone(s) P-X and/or improvement milestone(s) I-X, as appropriate for their project. Milestone I-15 incl udes suggestions for improvement metrics to use with this innovative project option. Rationale: In our current system, more often than not, patients receive services in ur gent and emergent care settings for conditions that could be managed in a more coordinated manner if provided in the primary care setting. This often results in more costly, less coordinated care and a lack of appropriate follow-up care. Patients may experien ce barriers in accessing pr imary care services secondary to transportation, cost, lack of assi gned provider, physical disability, inability to receive appointments in a timely manner and a l ack of knowledge about what types of services can be provided in the primary care setting. By enhancing access points, available appointment times, patient awareness of ava ilable services and overall prim ary care capacity, patients and their families will align themselves with the pr imary care system resulting in better health outcomes, patient satisfaction, appropriate ut ilization and reduced co st of services. Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 244 of 454 1.2 Increase Training of Primary Care Workforce Project Goal: Texas has a growing shortage of primary care docto rs and nurses due to the needs of an aging population, a decline in the number of medical students choosing pr imary care, and thousands of aging baby boomers who are doctors and nurses l ooking towards retirement. The shortage of primary care workforce personnel in Texas is a cr itical problem that we have the opportunity to begin addressing under this waiver. It is difficult to recruit an d hire primary care physicians. The shortage of primary care providers has cont ributed to increased wait times in hospitals, community clinics, and other care settings. Ex panding the primary care workforce will increase access and capacity and help creat e an organized structure of pr imary care providers, clinicians, and staff. Moreover, this expansion will strengthen an integrated health care system and play a key role in implementing disease management programs. The extended primary care workforce will also be trained to operate in patient-cent ered medical homes. A greater focus on primary care will be crucial to the success of an integrated health care system . Furthermore, in order to effectively operate in a medical home model, ther e is a need for residency and training programs to expand the capabilities of primary care providers and other staff to effectively provide team- based care and manage population he alth. Therefore, the need to expand the res ponsibilities of primary care workforce members will be even more important. In summary, the goal for this project is to train more workforce members to serve as primary care providers, clinicians, and staff to help address the substantial primary care workforce shortage and to update training programs to include more organized care delivery models. This project may apply to primary care physicians (including resident s in training), nurse practiti oners, physician assistants, and other clinicians/staff (e.g., health coaches, co mmunity health workers/promotoras) in the following service areas: family medicine, in ternal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, geriatrics, and pediatrics. In 2010, Texas had 176 patient care physicia ns per 100,000 population and 70 primary care physicians per 100,000 population with a state rank ing of 46 and 47, respectively. (Comparable ratios for US Total are 219.5 and 90.5, respecti vely.) From 2001 to 2011, the Texas physician workforce grew 32.3%, exceeding the population gr owth of 25.1%. Primary care physician workforce grew only 25% in the same peri od. From 2002 to 2011, Texas increased medical school enrollment 31% from 1,342 to 1,762 in line w ith the national call by the Association of American Medical Colleges to increase medical school enrollments by 30%. In 2011, there were 1,445 medical school graduates. Coincident ally, there were 1,445 a llopathic entry-level GME positions offered in the annual National Re sident Matching program . (There were 31 osteopathic slots.) The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Bo ard recommends a ratio of 1.1 entry-level GME positions for each Texas medical school graduate. The number of Texas medical school graduates is expected to peak at over 1,700 in 2015. This implies a need for 400 additional GME positions by 2015. The shortage of GME positions or residency slots may be Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 245 of 454 the single most problematic bott leneck in Texas' efforts to alleviate the state's physician shortage.16 The rate of Primary Care Physicians per 100,000 Population varies by region from 43 (South Texas) to 78 (Central Texas). Resident physicia ns provide low-cost ca re to needy populations and tend to remain in the state in whic h they complete their residency training. Project Options: a) Update primary care training programs to include training on the medical home and chronic care models, diseas e registry use for population health management, patient panel management , oral health, and other identified training needs and/or qualit y/performance improvement b) Increase the number of primary care providers (i.e., physicians, residents, nurse practitioners, physician assistants ) and other clinicians/staff (such as health coaches and community health workers/promotoras). c) Increase the number of residency/trai ning program for faculty/staff to support an expanded, more updated program d) Establish/expand primary care traini ng programs, with emphasis in communities designated as health care provider shortage areas (HPSAs) e) \"Other\" project option: Implement othe r evidence-based project to increase training of the primary care workforce in an innovative manner not described in the project options above. Provi ders implementing an innovative, evidence-based project using the \"Other \" project option may select among the process and improvement milestones speci fied in this project area or may include one or more customizable process milestone(s) P-X and/or improvement milestone(s) I-X, as ap propriate for their project. 16 2010 physician supply extracted from \"Physici an Characteristics and Distribution in the U.S., \" 20122012 Edition, published by American Medical Association.

By tracking key patient information, a disease registry can help p hysicians and other members of a patient's care team identify and reach out to patients who may have gaps in their care in order to prevent complications, which often lead to more costly car e interventions. A disease registry can assist physicians in one or more key processes for managi ng patients with a chroni c disease, including: Prompt physicians and their teams to c onduct appropriate assessments and deliver condition-specific recommended care; Identify patients who have missed appoint ments, are overdue for care, or are not meeting care management goals; Provide reports about how well individua l care teams and overall provider organizations are doing in delivering recommended care to specific patient populations; Stratify patients into risk categories in or der to target interventions toward patients with highest needs. Project Options: a) Implement/enhance and use chronic diseas e management registry functionalities Required core proj ect components: a) Enter patient data into uni que chronic disease registry b) Use registry data to proactively c ontact, educate, and track patients by disease status, risk status, self-management status, community and family need. c) Use registry reports to develop and implement targeted QI plan d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities ma y include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. b) \"Other\" project option: Implement other evidence-based project to implement a chronic disease management registry in an innovative manner not described in the project options above.

Th is Project Area applies to both written and oral interpretation services. Cultural competence in health care describes the ability of systems to provide care to patients' with diverse values, beliefs and behaviors, including tailoring care delivery to meet patients' social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Cultural co mpetence can be described both as a vehicle to increase access to quality care for all patient popul ations and as a business strategy to attract new patients and market share. To achieve organizational cultural competence within the health care leadership and workforce, it is important to maximize diversity. To achieve systemic cultural competence (e.g., in the structures of the health care system) it is essential to address such in itiatives as conducting community assessments, developing mechanisms for community and patient feedback, implementing systems for patient racial/ethnic and language preference data collection, devel oping quality measures for diverse patient populations, and ensuring culturall y and linguistically appropriate health education materials and health promotion and diseas e prevention in terventions. To attain clinical cultural competence , health care providers mus t: (1) be made aware of the impact of social and cultural factors on health beliefs and behaviors; (2) be equipped with the tools and skills to manage these factors appr opriately through training and education; and (3) empower their patients to be more of an active partner in the medical management. Project Options: a) Expand access to written and or al interpretation services Required core proj ect components: a) Identify and address language access need s and/or gaps in language access b) Implement language access policies and procedures (in coordination with statewide and federal policies to en sure consistency across the state) c) Increase training to patients and provid ers at all levels of the organization (and organization-wide) related to language access and/or cultural competency/sensitivity d) Increase interpretation staff b) Enhance Organizational Cultural Competence Required core proj ect components: Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 249 of 454 a) Hire, promote, and retain minorities at all levels of the organization to increase diversity in the health care workforce. b) Develop a program that actively invo lves community representatives in the health care organization's planni ng and quality improvement meetings, whether as part of the board or as part of focus groups. c) Enhance Systemic Cultural Competence Required core proj ect components: a) Develop policies and procedures to m easure systemic culture competence, or use existing evidence-based culturally competency assessment tool (e.g., CAHPS Cultural Competency Supplement). b) Adopt and implement all 14 CLAS sta ndards, including those that are not federal mandates.17Conduct CLAS Sta ndards trainings at facilities c) Identify federal and state reimbursement strategies for interpreter services and identify community resources and partnerships to de velop the needed workforce. d) Provide staff training around Title VI requirements mandating the provision of interpreter services in health care settings. e) Identify and use tools to detect medical errors that result from lack of systemic cultural competence, in cluding those stemming from language barriers (e.g., taking a prescrib ed medication incorrectly); misunderstanding health edu cation materials, instruc or signage (e.g., inappropriately preparing for a diag nostic or therapeutic procedure, resulting in postponement or delay) ; and misunderstanding the benefits and risks of procedures requiring informed consent. f) Implement projects to address medi cal errors resulting from systemic cultural competency. d) Clinical Cultural Competence: Develop cr oss-cultural training program that is a required, integrated component of the tr aining and profession al development of health care providers at all le vels. The curricula should: increase awareness of racial and et hnic disparities in health and the importance of socio-cultural factors on health beliefs and behaviors; address the impact of race, ethnicity, cu lture, and class on c linical decision making; develop tools to assess the community members' health beliefs and behaviors Develop human resource skills for cross-cultural assessment, communication, and negotiation. 17 http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/assets/pdf/checked/finalreport.pdf Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 250 of 454 e) Implement Quality improvement efforts that include culturally and linguistically appropriate patient survey methods as we ll as process and outcome measures that reflect the needs of multicultu ral and minority populations. f) Clinical Cultural Competence: Develop programs to help patients navigate the health care system and become a more ac tive partner in the clinical encounter. g) \"Other\" project option: Implement othe r evidence-based project to enhance interpretation services and culturally competent care in an innovative manner not described in the project op tions above.

Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. Rationale: The 2010 United States Census confirmed that ou r nation's population has become more diverse than ever before, and this trend is expected to continue over this century. As we become a more ethnically and racially diverse na tion, health care systems and pr oviders need to reflect on and respond to patients' varied perspectives, values , beliefs, and behaviors about health and well- being. Failure to understand and manage socio-cult ural differences may have significant health consequences for minority groups in particular. Various systemic issues have b een identified in the literature and by the health care experts. While this was more obvious in poorly constr ucted and complicated systems that are not responsive to the needs of diverse patient popula tions, the issue of language discordance between provider and patient was of foremost importance. Systems lacking interpreter services or culturally and linguistically appropriate health ed ucation materials lead to patient dissatisfaction, poor comprehension and adherence, and lower-quali ty care. According to various studies, care experts in government, managed care, academia , and community health care make a clear connection between cultural competence, qual ity improvement, and the elimination of racial/ethnic disparities. Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 251 of 454 1.5 Collect Valid and Reliable Race, Ethnicit y, and Language (REAL) Data to Reduce Disparities In 2002, the Institute of Medicine report Unequal Treatment: Confr onting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care18, signified a new era of national attention to racial and ethnic disparities in the American health care system. Corroborating that report, many research studies have established that Americans do not all have equal access to health care, or experience similar health care quality and outcomes. Low-income , racial and ethnic minority, limited-English proficient, and other underserved populations often have higher ra tes of disease, fewer treatment options, reduced access to care, and lower sati sfaction with care. A key prerequisite for measuring equity of care and addressing disparit ies is to collect vali d and reliable patient demographic data on race, ethnic ity, and preferred language (REAL data). These data elements must be effectively linked to data systems used in health care service de livery (to tailor care to patient needs), as well as data systems used in quality improvement (t o identify disparities). Creating organizational systems for capturing REAL data is a long and resource-intensive process. Currently, the processes for analyzing eq uity of care are mostly piecemeal and limited in scope, taxing organizational resources. However, in the state of Texa s there are significant barriers to effective co llection and utilization of these pa tient demographic data for public hospitals. To address these ba rriers, key next steps for pub lic hospitals systems include developing tools, HIT protocols a nd training curricula to improve th e collection and utilization of REAL data elements, which is the foundation fo r achieving significantly gr eater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in measuring equity of care, thus enabling the designs of more successful efforts to eliminate health care disparities. Project Goal: To improve the collection of valid and reliable self-reported data on the demographics of patients receiving care, the quality of care delivered, and implementing stratification capabilities to stratify clinical/quality data, and analyzing data by relevant demographic categories: race, ethnicity, sex, primary language and disability status.19 Recently finalized data collection standards for surveys of demographic categories were released by HHS and will be used in the process of developing standards for administrative data collecti on for the same 5 categories. RHPs will work to implement initiatives, pr omote training, and accelerate capacity building, community engagement and empowerment. The pr oject focuses on efforts to reduce health and mental health disparities, disp arities among racial/ethnic groups, women, seniors, children, rural populations, and those with disa bilities and their families. Project Options: a) Train patients and staff on the importa nce of collecting REAL data (For project option 1.5.1, the provider must do bot h subpart (i) and subpart (ii), If 18 http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2002/Unequal Treatment Confronting RacialandEthnicDisparities inHealthCare.aspx 19 http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templ ates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=208 Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 252 of 454 the provider is not using existing curricu lum.

Rationale: Several RHPs within Texas implemented an urgent medical advice line to serve patients within selected populations. To facilitate the diffusi on of practices among RHPs, RHPs will have the opportunity to implement an urgent medical a dvice line to underserved and under privileged areas. Implementation across Texas for an urgent medical advice line is not consistent between RHPs. As such, Texas will promote the implementation of an urgent medical advice line for underserved and underprivileged popul ations (i.e. rural areas with limited access to healthcare, or areas where cultural differences may disincentivize th e use of automated telephone services).

Telemedicine is the use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications to improve patients' health status . Closely associated with telemedicine is the term \"telehealth,\" which is often used to enco mpass a broader definition of remote healthcare that does not always involve cl inical services. Videoconferencing, transmission of still images, remote monitoring of vital signs with a focus on the specialty care access challenges in rural communities, and continuing medical education are all considered part of telemedicine and telehealth. 20 Telehealth is the use of elec tronic information and telecommuni cations technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and pr ofessional health-related e ducation, public health and health administration. Technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-and- forward imaging, streaming media, and te rrestrial and wireless communications. 21 Telemedicine is viewed as a cost-effective altern ative to the more traditional face-to-face way of providing medical care (e.g., face-to-face consultati ons or examinations between provider and patient) that states can choose to cover under Medicaid. This definition is modeled on Medicare's definition of teleh ealth services (42 CFR 410.78). No te that the federal Medicaid statute does not recognize teleme dicine as a distinct service. 22 Telemedicine is not a separate medical specialty . Products and services related to telemedicine are often part of a larger investment by health care institutions in ei ther information technology or the delivery of clinical care. Even in the reimbursement fee structure, there is usually no distinction made between servi ces provided on site and those pr ovided through telemedicine and often no separate coding required for billing of remote services. Telemedicine encompasses different types of programs and services provided for the patient. Each component involves different providers and consumers. 23 Telemedicine Services: Specialist referral services typically involves of a specialist assisting a general practitioner in rendering a diagnosis. This may involve a patient \"s eeing\" a specialis t over a live, remote consult or the transmission of diagnostic images and/or video along with pa tient data to a specialist for viewing later. Recent surveys have shown a ra pid increase in the number of specialty and subspecialty areas that have successfully used telemedicine. Radiology continues to make the I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 257 of 454 greatest use of telemedicine w ith thousands of images \"read\" by remote providers each year. Other major specialty areas include: dermat ology, ophthalmology, mental health, cardiology and pathology. According to reports an d studies, almost 50 different medical subspecialties have successfully used telemedicine. Patient consultations using telecommunications to provide medical data, which may include audio, still or live images, between a patient a nd a health professional for use in rendering a diagnosis and treatment plan. This might originat e from a remote clinic to a physician's office using a direct transmission link or ma y include communica ting over the Web. Remote patient monitoring uses devices to remotely collect and send data to a monitoring station for interpretation. Such \" home telehealth\" applications might include a specific vital sign, such as blood glucose or heart ECG or a vari ety of indicators for ho mebound patients. Such services can be used to supplement the use of visiting nurses. Medical education provides continuing medical education credits for health professionals and special medical education seminars for targeted groups in remote locations. Consumer medical and health information includes the use of the In ternet for consumers to obtain specialized health information and on-line discussi on groups to provide peer-to-peer support. Delivery Mechanisms: Networked programs link tertiary care hospita ls and clinics with outlying clinics and community health centers in rural or s uburban areas. The links may use de dicated high-speed lines or the Internet for telecommunication links between sites. Studies by th e several agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , private vendors and assessments by ATA of its membership place the number of existing telemedi cine networks in the United States at roughly 200. These programs involve close to 2,000 medical institutions throughout the country. Of these programs, it is estimated that about half (100) are actively providing patient care services on a daily basis. The others are onl y occasionally used for patient care and are primarily for administrative or educational use. Point-to-point connections using private networks are used by hospitals a nd clinics that deliver services directly or contract out specialty services to independ ent medical service providers at ambulatory care sites. Radiology, mental health and even intensive care services are being provided under contract using teleme dicine to deliver the services. Primary or specialty care to the home connections involves connecting pr imary care providers, specialists and home health nurses with pati ents over single line phone-video systems for interactive clinical consultations.

Often normal phone lines are used to communicate directly between the patient and the center although some systems use the Internet. Web-based e-health patient service sites provide direct consumer out reach and services over the Internet. Under telemedicine, th ese include those sites that pr ovide direct patient care.

Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. Rationale 24: One of the greatest challenges facing the U.S. hea lthcare system is to pr ovide quality care to the large segment of the population, which does not have access to specialty physicians because of factors such as geographic limitations or soci oeconomic conditions. The use of technology to deliver health care from a distance, or telemedici ne, has been demonstrated as an effective way of overcoming certain barriers to care, particularly for communities located in rural and remote areas. In addition, telemedicine can ease the gaps in providing crucial care for those who are underserved, principally because of a shortage of sub-specialty providers. The use of telecommunications technologies and c onnectivity has impacted real-world patients, particularly for those in remote communities. Th is work has translated into observable outcomes such as: improved access to specialists increased patient satisfaction with care improved clinical outcomes reduction in emergency room utilization cost savings Nowhere are these benefits more evident than in Texas. With a land mass area of 268,820 square miles and a growing population of 25.1 million, Texas is the second largest US state by area and population.1 Its population growth rose more th an 18.8 percent between 2000 to 2009, reflecting an increase that is more than double the national growth in this period.2 This rapid growth is attributed to a diversity of sour ces such as natural increases from the total of all births minus all deaths and to a high rate of net in-migration from other states and countries. Along with the increase in population, an ever-growing aging population (the state's older population, 65+, is expected to double that of the previous 8 year s) has significantly affected the demand on the healthcare workforce as demands for quality care increased. In its Statewide Health Plan 2011-2016 report 25, the Texas Statewide Heal th Council concluded: 24 http://telehealth.utmb.edu/presenta tions/Benefits_Of_Telemedicine.pdf Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 260 of 454 \"Texas faces particular challenge s with respect to physician and ot her healthcare workforces not primarily because of an overall shortage, but be cause of sharp disparitie s in the allocation of healthcare resources to different parts of the state. In the metropolitan areas outside the border, there is one physician in direct patient care for each 573 count y residents. In the 32-county border region and in non-metropolitan Texas, the ratios are 2 to 3 times as high.\" Although the overall supply of physicians has incr eased in Texas since 2000 from in-migration, the vast majority of these health care professionals resides and pract ices within four primary areas of Texas: Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San An tonio. Moreover, Texas has consistently lagged behind the US average in the ratio of physic ian supply per 100,000 of population, and the gap between the two appears to be increasing. In 2009, there were 25 counties with no physicians, and the counties with lowest ratios of providers to populations were by and large in West Texas, South Texas and the Panhandle. Theoretically, resources such as healthcare woul d be distributed across the state in accordance with population density and needs. Realisticall y, however, geographical and economic barriers create significant disparities across the state, with rural and underserved communities enduring significantly greater barr iers to accessing the care continuum. The supply ratios for a number of health professionals, including primary care physi cians and mental health professionals, are lowest in rural, border and othe r health professional shortage areas. Data for 2009 indicated that out of the 254 counties in Texa s, 118 counties are designated as whole county primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) due to primary care doctor to patient ratios of 1:3500 or less, and 173 counties (68 percent of the state) are desi gnated as whole county mental health HPSAs\u00b2 In Texas, communities are struggling to care for an increasing numb er of underserved, disadvantaged, and at-risk populations. In most comm unities, especially in rural areas, care is not organized to promote prevention and early interv ention, coordinate services, or monitor access to and quality of care. Moreover, public and privat e funding to subsidize care remains inadequate, despite growing community needs associated with increases in th e uninsured and aging populations. Consequently, many people are left to seek care in emer gency rooms, often as a last resort, in an unmanaged and episodic manner. The costs of such care are borne by care-giving institutions, local governments, and, ultimately, taxpayers, many of whom are already burdened with the costs of meeting hea lth-related costs of their own. Given the various benefits observed through the pr ovision of health care via telemedicine, there is a tremendous amount of moment um toward increasing access to care through the use of health information technologies, thereby creating an exciting and central role for innovation and 25 Texas Statewide Health Coordinating Council. 20112016 Texas State Health Plan Update.

This real /near-time monitoring and interac ting could enable a healthcare team to address patient problems before they re quire major interventions, creating a potentially patient-centered approach that could undoubtedly change our expectations of our healthcare system. In conclusion, the overall goal of the proposed te lehealth projects is to reduce disparities in access, outcome, cost and satisfaction that are created by geographic barriers. Specifically, we hope to achieve the following goals fo r the state's Medicaid population: 1.) increase the knowledge and capaci ty of rural primary care phy sicians to manage complex chronic conditions 2.) increase patients' timely access to specia lty care and reduce geographic barriers; 3.) create the ability for specialists to provide dir ect patient consults to patients based at rural clinics 4.) improve efficiency in the referral process by letting specialists divert unnecessary referrals and decreasing the wait time for urgent referrals 5.) provide services in HPSAs 6.) enhance access to other health care serv ices (case manageme nt, education, etc.) Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 262 of 454 1.8 Increase, Expand, and Enhance Oral Health Services Project Goal: Dental health is a key component of overall he alth. Oral disease can lead to poor nutrition; serious systemic illnesses and conditions su ch as poor birth outcomes, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease; and a diminished quality of life and life expectancy.26 Inadequate access to oral health services compounds other health i ssues. It can result in untreated dental disease that not only affects the mouth, but can also have physical, mental, economic, and social consequences.27 Fortunately, many of the adve rse effects associated with poor oral health can be prevented with quality regular dental care, bo th at home and professionally. Increasing, expanding, and enhancing oral health serv ices will improve health outcomes. Barriers to Oral Health Care: Distribution of dental prov iders/lack of dental prov iders in underserved areas Inconvenient hours and location of dental clinic/services Transportation issues Low oral health literacy within the community Cultural and language competency of dental providers Cost of services/health insurance coverage Providers' limited experience treating speci al groups (medically compromised, elderly, special needs, pregnant women, young children) Specific Project Goals: Close gaps/disparities in acce ss to dental care services Enhance the quality of dental care Increase and enhance the dental workforce Redistribute and retain the dental workforce to/in underserved areas Project Options: Increase dental provider training, education, recruitment and/or retention, as well as expand workforce capacity through one of the following project options: a) The development of academic linkages with the three Texas dental schools, to establish a multi-week externship program for fourth year dental students to provide exposure and experience in provi ding dental services within a rural setting during their professi onal academic preparation. b) The establishment of a c linical rotation, continuing education within various community settings for dental reside nts to increase their exposure and 26 http://www.perio.org/consumer/media/releases.htm#pregnancy 27 Building Better Oral Health: A Dental Home for All Texans.

With regard to specialty areas of greatest need, the recent report of the Committee on Phys ician Distribution and Health Care Access cites psychiatry, general/preventive medicine, and ch ild/adolescent psychiatry where the ratios per 100,000 population are 56.7%, 60.2%, and 67% of the US ratios, respectively. Federal funding (Medicare Direct Graduate Medical Education or DGME) for residency training is capped at 1996 levels for the direct support of graduate medical education. The cap only supports a third of the costs of 4,056 of the 4,598 act ual positions in Texas, leavi ng the residency programs to cover the cost of two-thirds of the 4,056 position s and the full cost of 542 positions. Texas is currently over its Medicare cap by 13%. Residency programs require 3 to 8 years of training, depending on the specialty. Medicare funding only covers years 1 through 3. In 2011, Te xas had more than 550 residency programs, offering a total of 6,788 positions. Only 22% (1, 494) of theses were first-year residency positions. According to the Coordinating Board, cons ervative estimates indicate that the cost to educate a resident physicia n for one year is $150,000. Hence, a great need for extended residency progr ams in Texas and increa se in the number of specialists. Project Options: a) Expand high impact specialty care ca pacity in most impacted medical specialties Required core proj ect components: a) Identify high impact/most impacted specialty services and gaps in care and coordination b) Increase the number of resi dents/trainees choosing targ eted shortage specialties c) Design workforce enhancement initiatives to support access to specialty providers in underserved markets and areas (recruitment and retention) d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities may include, but are not limite d to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" oppor tunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, a nd identifying key challenges associated with expansion of the proj ect, including special considerations for safety-net populations. b) Improve access to specialty care Required core proj ect components: a) Increase service availability with extended hours Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 266 of 454 b) Increase number of specialty clinic locations c) Implement transparent, standardi zed referrals across the system. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement.

The goal of this project is to implement proc ess improvement methodologies to improve safety, quality, and efficiency. Provide rs may design customized initia tives based on various process improvement methodologies such as Lean, Six Si gma, Care Logistics, and Nurses Improving Care for Health system Elders (NICHE) among others. The Lean methodology as applied to medicine evaluates the use of resources, measures the value to the patient, considers the use of resources in terms of their value to the patient, and eliminates those that are wasteful. Focus on Lean is especia lly valuable to safety net providers because of its emphasis on waste reduction. Denver Health a safety net hospital in Denver, Colorado has identified more than $124 million in cost savings that the health system has achieved due to Lean Rapid Improvement Events since implementing Lean in 2005 28. Using methodologies such as Lean that are proven to eliminate waste and re dundancies and optimize patient flow, providers may customize a project that will develop and implement a program of continuous improvement that will increase communicati on, integrate system workflows, provide actionable data to providers and patients, and identify and improve models of patient-cen tered care that address issues of safety, quality, and efficiency. Implementation freque ntly requires a new \"operational mindset\" using tools such as Lean to identify a nd progressively eliminate inefficiencies while at the same time linking human performance, proce ss performance and system performance into transformational performance in the delivery system.29 The process improvement, as a further example, may include elements such as identif ying the value to the patient, managing the patient's journey, facilitating the smooth flow of patients and in formation, introducing \"pull\" in the patient's journey (e.g. advanced access), and/or continuously reduc ing waste by developing and amending processes awhile at the same time smoothing flow and enhancing quality and driving down cost.30 Rationale: Performance improvement and reporting is a ve ry large component of success of all of the project areas across the categories. The necessity for quality and safety improvement initiatives permeates health care.2,3 Quality health care is defined as \"the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge\"3 (p. 1161). According to the In stitute of Medicine (IOM) 28 http://denverhealth.org/LEANAcademy.aspx 29 Oujiri J, Ferrara C. \"The Phoenix Project - Integrating Effective Disease Management Into Primary Care Using Lean SixSigma Tools.\" Duluth Clinic Presentation . 2010. 30 Bibby J. \"Lean in Primary Care: The Basics - Sustaining Transformation.\" Asian Hospital and Healthcare Management (2011) 18.

Processes that are inefficient and variable, ch anging case mix of patients, health insurance, differences in provider education and experience , and numerous other factors contribute to the complexity of health care. With this in mind, the IOM also asserted that today's health care industry functions at a lower leve l than it can and should, and it put forth the following six aims of health care: effective, safe, patient- centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. 3 The aims of effectiveness and safety are targeted thr ough process-of-care measures, assessing whether providers of health care perform processes that have been demonstrated to achieve the desired aims and avoid those processes that are predispo sed toward harm. The goals of measuring health care quality are to determine th e effects of health care on desi red outcomes and to assess the degree to which health care adheres to processe s based on scientific evidence or agreed to by professional consensus and is cons istent with patient preferences. Because errors are caused by system or process fa ilures, it is important to adopt various process- improvement techniques to identify inefficiencies , ineffective care, and preventable errors to then influence changes associated with system s. Each of these techniques involves assessing performance and using findings to inform change. This chapter will discuss strategies and tools for quality improvement\u2014including failure modes a nd effects analysis, Plan-Do-Study-Act, Six Sigma, Lean, and root-cause anal ysis\u2014that have been used to im prove the quality and safety of health care. 32 Whatever the acronym of the method (e.g., TQM, CQI) or tool used (e.g., FMEA or Six Sigma), the important component of quality improvement is a dynamic process that often employs more than one quality improvement tool. Quality impr ovement requires five essential elements for success: fostering and sustaining a culture of ch ange and safety, developing and clarifying an understanding of the problem, involving key stak eholders, testing cha nge strategies, and continuous monitoring of performance and repo rting of findings to sustain the change.

The goals of infrastructure-related mental health and substance use disord er (behavioral health) projects are to improve the access to appropriate behavioral health interventions and specialists throughout Texas. This is an especially cr itical need in Texas for several reasons: State funding for behavioral health i ndigent care is limited. Texas ranks 50 th in per capita funding for state mental health authority (D SHS) services and supports for people with serious and persistent mental illness and substance use di sorders. Medically indigent individuals who are not eligib le for Medicaid have no gua rantee of access to needed services and may face extended waiting periods. Texas ranks highest among stat es in the number of uninsured individuals per capita. One in four Texans lack health insurance. Pe ople with behavioral health disorders are disproportionately affected. For example, 60 percent of seriously mentally ill adults served in the public mental health system are uninsured.33 The supply of behavioral health care providers is inadequate in most of the State. In Apr il of 2011, 195 (77%) of Texas' 254 counties held federal designations as whole county Health Provider Shortage Areas (HPSAs). This is an increase from the 183 counties designated in 2002.34 Projects / project elements unde r this heading are designed to increase the supply of behavioral health professionals practicing in the State, extend the capacity of beha vioral health providers to offer expertise to other health care providers, such as primary care physicians and enhance the capacity of behavioral health and other providers to effectively serve patients with be havioral health conditions. Examples of such projects could include training a nd residency programs for behavior al health providers, programs which expand access to certified peer support serv ices, telehealth consultation programs in which behavioral health providers offer timely expertis e to primary care providers and extended clinic hours / mobile clinics. 33 DSHS Decision Support, 2012 34 \"Highlights: The Supply of Mental Heal th Professionals in Texas -2010\", Texas Department of State Health Services Center for Health Statistics, E-Pub lication No. E25-12347.

Specifically, Texas is com posed of 254 counties, the majority of which can be classified as either \"rural\" or \"frontier\". The availability of health ca re providers is severely limited in many of these sparsely populated areas. While these s hortages make access to physical healthcare difficult for those who reside in thes e rural areas, the impact on individuals with behavioral health needs is even more severe . For example, in 2009, 171 Texas counties did not have a psychiatrist, 102 counties did not have a psychologist, 40 c ounties did not have a social worker and 48 counties did not have a licensed professional counselor. There are 195 Texas counties (77% of all Texas counties) that have been designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (H RSA) as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) in relation to behavior al health. Furthermore, certain specialties (such as Child Psychiatrists) are virtually non-exis tent in the vast majority of th e rural and frontier areas of the state. Additionally, the size of the state makes travel from these underserved areas to larger urban settings difficult. For individuals who lack reliable transportation or have disabilities that restrict driving, the challenge of accessing health care may be virtually insurmountable. Furthermore, there are many non-rural areas of th e state where the availa bility of health care professionals is greatly limited. For example, in Bexar country, which has one of the largest urban populations in Texas, ther e are 123 areas within the county that have been designated as HPSAs by HRSA. Similar s hortages can be found in mo st Texas urban counties. Modern communications technology holds the greatest promise of bridging the gap between medical need in underserved areas and the provisi on of needed services. The developments in internet-based communications that began with voice messaging have been extended to video in the form of widely available video compression technologies that allow for high quality, real time, face-to-face communications and cons ultations over relatively inexpensive telecommunications equipment. With this new technology, in a ny area of the state where high speed broadband internet access is available, acce ss to many forms of health care can become a reality. To leverage the promise of this ne w technology, Texas would lik e to expand the use of telemedicine, telehealth, and telemonitoring to thereby increase access to, and coordination of, physical and behavioral healthcare. Televideo technology can be used to provide a variety of what have been referred to as \"Telemental Health\" services. These services ma y include mental health assessments, treatment, education, monitoring, mentoring a nd collaboration. These services may be used in a variety of Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 1 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 272 of 454 locations (schools, nursing facili ties, and even in homes) in any geographical location where traditional service providers are in short supply. Providers can include psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants , social workers, pharmacists, psychologists, counselors, PCPs, and nurses. For example, telemental health could be used to provi de follow-up outpatient consults with a psychiatrist or other mental health professional within 7 or 30 days of discharge from the inpatient hospital. These virtual follow-up visits could focus on monitoring for remission of symptoms, adjusting psychotropic me dications, and developing a treatment plan to prevent readmissions in partnershi p with the primary care provider. Telemental services could also be used to provide medication management services to community mental health patients with severe mental illness to ensure appr opriate medication treatment and compliance, preventing psychiatric crises which woul d require psychiatri c hospitalization. The use of telemedicine could provide direct video access to a psychiatrist while the use of telementoring would provide a General Practitioner with access to consultation with psychiatrists with expertise in managing complex medication regimens. Additionally, telehealth could provide direct access to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and other evidence-based counseling protocols that have proven to be effective in addressing major depression, trauma, and even schizophrenia in some populations. Telecommunications technology can also be used to foster peer support and mentoring efforts among providers and among consumers (e .g., support groups, peer mentors). For example, The University of New Mexico ha s successfully utilized a telementoring program (Project ECHO) to successfully train and pr ovide ongoing support to Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) who provide care to persons with addict ion. This initiative provides weekly didactic sessions as well as case presenta tions to address challenging clini cal cases and get feedback from specialists based at the University and from colleagues around the state. 35 Project Options: a) Procure and build the infrastructure n eeded to pilot or bring to scale a successful pilot of the selected forms of servi ce in underserved areas of the state (this must be combined with one of the two interventions below).

However, many Texans are unable to access either routine services or needed care in a timely manner either because they lack transporta tion or because they are unable to schedule an appointment due to work scheduling conflicts (o r school scheduling confli cts in the case of children) or because they have obligations to pr ovide care for children or elderly relatives during normal work hours. While such barriers to access can compromise anyone's ability to make or keep scheduled appointments, individuals with behavioral health need s may be especially negatively affected. Many individual with behavioral health needs are reticent to seek treatment in the first place and such barriers may be suffici ent to prevent access entirely. Others may be easily discouraged by such barriers and may drop out of treatment. Any such delay in accessing services or any break or disrupti on in services may result in fu nctional loss and the worsening of symptoms. These negative health outcomes come at great personal cost to the individual and also result in increased costs to pa yers when care is finally obtained. In order to mitigate the effects of these barriers to accessing care, Texas proposes to take specific steps to broaden access to care that will include an expansion of operating hours in a select number of clinics, an expansion of community-b ased service options (i ncluding the development of mobile clinics), and an expanded transporta tion program that will support appointments that are scheduled outside of normal business hours.

Project Goal When a consumer lacks appropriate behavioral health crisis resolution mechanisms, first responders are often limited in their options to resolve the situation. Sometimes the choice comes down to the ER, jail or an inpatient hosp ital bed. Crisis stabilization services can be developed that create alternatives to these less de sirable settings. Building on existing systems, communities can develop crisis alternatives such as sobering units, crisis residential settings and crisis respite programs with varying degrees of c linical services based on the needs of clients. While hospitalization provides a high degree of safety for the person in crisis, it is very expensive and is often more than what is needed to address the crisis. Community-base crisis alternatives can effec tively reduce expensive and undesirabl e outcomes, such as preventable inpatient stays. For example, state psychiatric hospital recidivism trended downward coincident with implementation of crisis outpatient services in some Te xas communities. The percent of persons readmitted to a Texas state psychiatric hospital within 30 days decreased from 8.0% in SFY2008 (before implementation of alternatives) to 6.9% in SFY2011.36 Project Options a) Develop and implement crisis stabilization services to address the identified gaps in the current community crisis system Required core proj ect components: 36 Behavioral Health NEWS BRIEF Vol. 7 Issue 3 - May 25, 2012 , http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/sa/_BHNB/ Figure 2.

Determine the types and volume of services needed to resolve crises in community- based settings. Then conduct a gap an alysis that will result in a data- driven plan to develop specific community-based crisis stabilization alternatives that will meet the beha vioral health needs of the patients (e.g. a minor emergency stabilization site for first responders to utilize as an alternative to costly and time consuming Emergency Department settings) d) Explore potential crisis alternative service models and determine acceptable and feasible models for implementation. e) Review the intervention(s) impact on access to and quality of behavioral health crisis stabiliza tion services and identify \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the intervention(s) to a broader patient population, and identif y key challenges associated with expansion of the intervention(s), in cluding special considerations for safety-net populations b) \"Other\" project option: Implement othe r evidence-based project to develop behavioral health crisis stabilizati on services in an innovative manner not described in the project op tions above.

Project Goal: The goal of this project is to enhance access and reduce shortages in specia lty behavioral health care to improve local integration of behavioral health care in to the overall health delivery system; improve consumer choice and increase avai lability of effective, lower-cost alternatives to inpatient care, prevent inpatient admissi ons when possible and promote recovery from behavioral health disorders. The supply of behavi oral health care providers is inadequate in most of the State. In 2011, 195 (77%) of Texas' 254 c ounties held federal designations as whole county Health Provider Shortage Areas (HPSA s) in relation to behavioral health.37 Indeed, Texas ranks far below the national average in th e number of mental h ealth professionals per 100,000 residents. These shortages are even greate r in rural, poor and Texas - Mexico border communities. Project Options: a) Implement strategies defined in the pl an to encourage behavioral health practitioners to serve medically indige nt public health consumers in HPSA areas or in localities within non-H PSA counties which do not have access equal to the rest of the county. Examples of strategi es could include marketing campaigns to attract providers, enhan ced residency programs or structured financial and non-financial incentive progr ams to attract and retain providers, identifying and engaging individual health care workers early in their studies/careers and provid ing training in identification and management of behavioral health conditions to other non-behavioral health disciplines (e.g., ANPs, PAs). Required core proj ect components: a) Conduct a qualitative and quantitative gap analysis to identify needed behavioral health special ty vocations lacking in the health care region and the issues contributing to the gaps. b) Develop plan to remediate gaps identified and data reporting mechanism to assess progress toward goal. This plan will specifically identify: The severity of shortages of be havioral health specialists in a region by type (psychiatrists, licensed psychologists, nurse practitioners, physicians assistants, nurses, social workers, licensed professional counselors, licensed marriage and family therapists, 37 \"Highlights: The Supply of Mental Heal th Professionals in Texas -2010\", Texas Department of State Health Services Center for Health Statistics, E-Pub lication No. E25-12347.

The PCMH provides a primary care \"home base\" for patients. Under this model, patients are assigned a health care team who tailors services to a patient's unique health care needs, effectively coordinates the patient's care across inpatient and outpatient settings, and proa ctively provides preventive, primary, routine and chronic care. Project Options: a) Develop, implement, and evaluate action plans to enhance/eliminate gaps in the development of various as pects of PCMH standards. Required core proj ect components: a) Utilize a gap analysis to assess and/or measure hospital-affiliated and/or PCPs' NCQA PCMH readiness. b) Conduct feasibility studies to determine necessary steps to achieve NCQA PCMH status c) Conduct educational sessions fo r primary care physician practice offices, hospital boards of direct ors, medical staff and senior leadership on the elements of PCMH, its rationale and vision. d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities ma y include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. b) Collaborate with an affiliated Patient-Centered Medical Home to integrate care management and coordination for shared, high-risk patients. Required core proj ect components: a) Improve data exchange between hospitals and affiliated medical home sites. b) Develop best practices plan to eliminate gaps in the readiness assessment. c) Hire and train team members to create multidisciplinary teams including social workers, health coaches, care managers, and nurses with a diverse skill set that can meet the needs of the shared, high-risk patients 38 http://www.aafp.org/online/etc/medialib/aafp_org/ documents/about/pcmh.Par.0001.File.dat/PCMH.pdf Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 285 of 454 d) Implement a comprehensive, multidis ciplinary intervention to address the needs of the shared, high-risk patients e) Evaluate the success of the interven tion at decreasing ED and inpatient hospitalization by shared, high-risk pa tients and use this data in rapid- cycle improvement to improve the intervention. f) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities ma y include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. c) Implement medical homes in HPSA a nd other rural and impoverished areas using evidence-approached change concepts for practice transformation developed by the Commonwealth Fund's Safety Net Medical Home Initiative: Required core proj ect components: a) Empanelment: Assign all patients to a primary care provider within the medical home. Understand practi ce supply and demand, and balance patient load accordingly. b) Restructure staffing into multidisciplinary care teams that manage a panel of patients where providers an d staff operate at the top of their license. Define roles and distribut e tasks among care team members to reflect the skills, abilities, a nd credentials of team members. c) Link patients to a provider and care team so both patients and provider/care team recognizes each other as partners in care. d) Assure that patients are able to see their provider or care team whenever possible. e) Promote and expand access to th e medical home by ensuring that established patients have 24/7 continuous access to their care teams via phone, e-mail, or in-person visits. f) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities ma y include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and identifying key challe nges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. d) \"Other\" project option: Implement other evidence-based project to enhance/expand medical home in an innovative manner not described in the project options above.

Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. Note: PCMH models include investments in proj ects that are the foundation of delivery system change and a complete package of change. Therefor e, it is preferable to pursue a full continuum of projects (PCMH readiness preparations, the establishment or expansion of medical homes which may include gap analyses and eventual application for PCMH recognition 39 to a nationally recognized organization such as NCQA, as well as educating various constituent groups within hospitals and primary care practices about the essential elements of the NCQA medical home standards). 40,41,42,43,44,45,46 Rationale: Federal, state, and health care providers share goals to promote more patient-centered care focused on wellness and coordinated care. In addition, the PCMH mo del is viewed as a foundation for the ability to accept alternative payment models under payment reform. PCMH development is a multi-year transformational ef fort and is viewed as a foundational way to deliver care aligned with paym ent reform models and the Trip le Aim goals of better health, better patient experience of care, and ultimately be tter cost-effectiveness. By providing the right care at the right time and in the right setting, over time, patients may see their health improve, rely less on costly ED visits, in cur fewer avoidable hospital stay s, and report greater patient satisfaction. These projects all are focused on the concepts of the PCMH model; yet, they take different shapes for different providers.47 This initiative aims to eliminate fragment ed and uncoordinated care, which can lead to emergency department and hospital over-utiliza tion.

Chronic disease management initiatives use population- based approaches to create pr actical, supportive, evidence-based interactions between patients and providers to improve the management of chro nic conditions and identi fy symptoms earlier, with the goal of preventing complications and ma naging utilization of acute and emergency care. Program elements may include the ability to iden tify one or more chronic health conditions or co-occurring chronic health conditions that me rit intervention across a patient population, based on a an assessment of patients' risk of developi ng complications, co-morbidities or utilizing acute or emergency services. These chronic he alth conditions may incl ude diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others, all of which are prone to co- occurring health cond itions and risks. Project Options: a) Redesign the outpatient delivery system to coordinate care for patients with chronic diseases Required core proj ect components: a) Design and implement care teams that are tailored to the patient's health care needs, including non-physic ian health professionals, such as pharmacists doing medication management; case managers providing care outside of the clinic setting via phone, email, and home visits; nutritionists offering cultura lly and linguistically appropriate education; and health coaches helpin g patients to navigate the health care system b) Ensure that patients can access thei r care teams in person or by phone or email c) Increase patient engagement, such as through patien t education, group visits, self-management support, improved patient-provider communication techniques, and coordination with community resources d) Implement projects to empower patien ts to make lifestyle changes to stay healthy and self-manag e their chronic conditions e) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement. Activities ma y include, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, identifying \"lessons learned,\" 48 Some chronic diseases addressed by chronic care management models in RHP plans may include diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, asthma, postsecondary stroke, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), HIV/AIDS, and chronic pain.

Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. Rationale: Promoting effective change in provider groups to support evidence-based clinical and quality improvement across a wide variety of health care settings. There are many definitions of \"chronic condition\", some more expansive than ot hers. We characterize it as any condition that requires ongoing adjustments by the affected person and interactions with the health care system. The most recent data show that more than 145 m illion people, or almost half of all Americans, live with a chronic condition. That number is pr ojected to increase by more than one percent per year by 2030, resulting in an estimated chronical ly ill population of 171 million. Almost half of all people with chronic illness have multiple conditions. As a result, many managed care and integrated delivery systems have taken a great in terest in correcting the many deficiencies in current management of diseases such as diabetes , heart disease, depression, asthma and others. Those deficiencies include: Rushed practitioners not followi ng established practice guidelines Lack of care coordination Lack of active follow-up to ensure the best outcomes Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 290 of 454 Patients inadequately trained to manage their illnesses Overcoming these deficiencies will require noth ing less than a transformation of health care, from a system that is essentially reactive - respon ding mainly when a person is sick - to one that is proactive and focused on keeping a person as healthy as possible. To speed the transition, Improving Chronic Illness Care created the Chr onic Care Model, which summarizes the basic elements for improving care in health system s at the community, organization, practice and patient levels. Evidence on the effectiveness of the Chronic Care Model has recently been summarized. 49 49 http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/75.full Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 291 of 454 2.3 Redesign Primary Care Project Goal: Increase efficiency and redesign primary care clinics programs to be oriented around the patient so that primary care access and the patient experience can be improved.

Rationale: Primary care in the United States faces serious challenges. Many physician practices struggle to ensure that their patients have prompt access to care, consistently high-quality chronic and preventative services, and adequate coordination of care. This struggle impacts patients who may experience barriers in accessing primary care se rvices secondary to tr ansportation, the lack of an assigned provider, inab ility to receive appointments in a timely manner and a lack of Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 292 of 454 knowledge about what types of services can be provided in the primary care setting. By enhancing access points, available appointment ti mes, patient awareness of available services and overall primary care capacity, patients and th eir families will align themselves with the primary care system resulting in improved health access, improved health outcome and reduced costs of services.

The state healthcare transformation is counting on a robust pr imary care sector to improve quality, reduce costs, and improve patien t experience. This will require a redesign of primary care to meet the needs of patients for timely, patient-centered, continuous, and coordinated care to enhance access to care regardless of type of insurance. The overall approach to redesigning patient experience will be centered on cultural change at the organizational level. This will involve the practitioners in a clinic as well as the patients and their families or caregivers. An organizational strategy will be de veloped so that entities will manage patient experience and create avenues to implement the strategic plan/v ision. Providers' performance will be measured, among other factors, by the extent to which patient experience improves systematically. Patient experience with care will be assessed through focused surveys. The architecture for patient focused surveys should be modeled af ter the Consumer Asse ssment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) t ool, which includes the followi ng domains: patients are getting timely care, appointments, and information; how well providers commun icate with patients; patients' rating of provider; and assessment office staff. 50 The Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Health Care Provide rs and Systems (CG CAHPS) survey51 can be used to assess patient and caregiver experience of care in outpatient settings while HCAHPS can be employed to measure patient experience in the hospital setting. Certain suppl emental modules for the adult survey CG-CAHPS may be used to establish ad ditional outcomes: Health Literacy, Cultural Competence, Health Information Technology, and Patient Centered Medical Home. These surveys will be mandatory, and will be administered at the end of the medical episode, six weeks after the visit (to avoid recall bias) and si x months if no other epis ode of care intervened. Project Options: a) Implement processes to measure and improve patient experience Required core proj ect components: a) Organizational integration and prio ritization of patient experience b) Data and performance measurement will be collected by utilizing patient experience of care measures from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provide rs and Systems (HCAHPS) in addition to CAHPS a nd/or other systems and methodologies to measure patient experience; 50 https://cahps.ahrq.gov/clinician_group/cgsurv ey/patientexperiencemeasurescgsurveys.pdf 51 https://cahps.ahrq.gov/clinician_group/ Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 294 of 454 c) Implementing processes to improve patient's experience in getting through to the clinical practice; d) Develop a process to certify indepe ndent survey vendors that will be capable of administering the patient experience of care survey in accordance with the standardized sa mpling and survey administration procedures. b) Implement other evidence based project to improve patient experience in an innovative manner not described above.

Measures th at provide insights both into improved opportunities for health care deliver y and health care cost-effectiven ess are an area of particular focus in the TX-DSRIP. Many of the projects include a specific focus on improving population health inside and outside of the walls of the hospital therefore, it will be important to examine measures that develop the capability to test methodologies for measuring cost containment. These methodologies may be subsequently applied to other projects or effort s so that the ability to measure the efficacy of these initiatives is in place, so integrated car e models that use data- based cost and quality m easures can be developed. Project Options: a) Develop an integrated care model with outcome-based payments Required core proj ect components: a) Implement cost-accounting systems to measure intervention impacts b) Establish a method to m easure cost containment c) Establish a baseline for cost d) Measure cost containment b) Implement other evidence based project to redesign for cost containment in an innovative manner not described above. Note, providers opting to implement an innovative project under this option must propose relevant process metrics and report on the improvement metr ics listed under milestone I-11. c) Project Option: Cost Savings Implement an innovative and evidence based intervention that will lead to cost savings for providers that have demons trated need or unsatisfactory performance in this area. This projec t requires reporting of specific metric(s) as associated with corresponding outcome(s) listed in Category 3, Outcome Domain - 5 Cost of Care 52. Providers selecting this project option should use process milestone(s) X, improveme nt milestone(s) Y and the milestone development template at the conclusion of this project ar ea to describe how the proposed milestones relate to the specific intervention goals. d) \"Other\" project option: Implement othe r evidence-based project to will impact cost efficiency in an innovative manne r not described in the project options above.

Information sharing, program support, program evaluation, and continuing ed ucation are needed to expand the use of community health workers and better integrate them into the health care delivery system. Self-Management education complements traditi onal patient education in supporting patients to live the best possible quality of life with their chronic condi tion. Whereas traditional patient education offers information a nd technical skills, self-managem ent education teaches problem- solving skills. A central concept in self-manag ement is self-efficacy\u2014confidence to carry out a behavior necessary to reach a desired goal. Sel f-efficacy is enhanced when patients succeed in solving patient-identified problems. Evidence from controlled clinical trials suggests that 54 (1) programs teaching self-management skills are mo re effective than information-only patient education in improving clinical outcomes; (2 ) in some circumstances, self-management education improves outcomes and can reduce costs for arthritis and probably for adult asthma patients55; and (3) in initial studies, a self-manag ement education program bringing together patients with a variety of chronic conditi ons may improve outcomes and reduce costs.56 54 1Thorpe, K, The Affordable Care Act lays the groundwork for a national diabetes prevention and treatment strategy.

Rationale: Disease management emphasizes prevention of di sease-related exacerbati ons and complications using evidence-based guidelines and patient em powerment tools. It can help manage and improve the health status of a defined patient population over the entire course of a disease. 1 By concentrating on the causes of chronic di sease, the community moves from a focus on sickness and disease to one based on wellness an d prevention. The Natio nal Prevention Council strategy for Disease Prevention focuses on four areas: building healt hy and safe community Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 301 of 454 environments, expanding quality pr eventive services in clinical and community settings, helping people make healthy choices, and eliminating hea lth disparities. To achieve these aims, the strategy identifies seven evidence-based recommendations that are likely to reduce the leading causes of preventable death and major illness, including tobacco-free livi ng, drug- and excessive alcohol-use prevention, healthy eating, active living, injury and violence-free living, reproductive and sexual health, and mental and emotional well-being. 2 Delivery Mechanisms: (note this list is not inclusive of all delivery mechanisms) Establish and use patient registry system s to enhance the provision of patient follow-up, screenings for related risk f actors and to track patient improvement. Establish and implement clinical practice guidelines. Adopt the Chronic Care Model Develop a mapping process linking patients treated in the emergency rooms with RFPs to improve the continuum of care and standardized procedures and outcome measures. Promote RHP health system supports such as reminders of care, development of clinical performance measures, and the use of case management services to increase patient's adherence to health care guidelines. Establish evidence-based disease and disa bility prevention programs for targeted populations to reduce their risk of disease, injury, and disability.

Provi ders may design customized initiatives based on various process improvement meth odologies such as Lean, Six Sigma, Continuous Improvement, Rapid Cycle, Care Logistics, Nurses Improvi ng Care for Healthsystem Elders (NICHE) among others. For example, the Lean methodology as applied to medicine evaluates the use of resources, measures the value to the patient, considers the use of resources in terms of their value to the patient, and eliminates those that are wasteful . Using methodologies such as Lean that are proven to eliminate waste and redundancies and optimize patient flow, hospitals may customize a project that will develop and implement a program of continuous improvement that will increase communication, integrate system workflow s, provide actionable data to providers and patients, and identify and improve models of pati ent-centered care that address issues of safety, quality, and efficiency. Implementation frequently requires a new \"opera tional mindset\" using tools such as Lean to identify and progressively eliminate ineffici encies while at the same time linking human performance, process performance and system perf ormance into transformational performance in the delivery system. 57 The process improvement, as a further example, may include elements such as identifying the value to the patient, managing the patient's journe y, facilitating the smooth flow of patients and information, introducing \"pull\" in the patient 's journey (e.g. advanced access), and/or continuously reducing waste by developing and am ending processes awhile at the same time smoothing flow and enhancing qua lity and driving down cost. 58 Furthermore, projects designed and implemented using the Care Logistics patient-centered, care coordination model involves managing the simultaneous logistics of a patient moving through the hospital. It may be used to help hospitals transform their operations to improve patient flow into cross departmental hubs a nd provide actionable data in real-time on key performance indicators, such as, but not limited to , length of stay, patient flow times, discharge process times, re-admission rates, and pa tient, provider and staff satisfaction. 59 57 Oujiri J, Ferrara C. \"The Phoenix Project - Integrating Effective Disease Management Into Primary Care Using Lean SixSigma Tools.\" Duluth Clinic Presentation. 2010. 58 Bibby J. \"Lean in Primary Care: The Basics - Sustaining Transformation.\" Asian Hospital and Healthcare Management (2011) 18. 59 http://www.carelogistics.com/ Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 303 of 454 In addition, hospitals may design a process improve ment initiative utilizing the NICHE program framework, which aims to facilitate the infusi on of evidence-based geriatric best practices throughout institutions to improve nursing care for older adult patients. NICHE is based on the use of principles and tools to s upport a systemic change in nursing practice and in the culture of healthcare facilities to achieve patient-centered care.60 Project Options: a) Design, develop, and implement a program of continuous, rapid process improvement that will address issues of safety, quality, and efficiency.

Rationale: Every day, millions of Americans receive high-quali ty health care that helps to maintain or restore their health and ability to function. Ho wever, far too many do not. Quality problems are reflected in a wide variation in the use of health care servic es, underuse of some services, overuse of other services, and misuse of serv ices, including an unacceptable level of errors. 64 Category 3 Outcome Measures document Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 307 of 454 A central goal of health care qua lity improvement is to maintain what is good about the existing health care system while focusing on the areas that need improvement. Several types of quality problems in health care have been documented through peer-reviewed research. 65 Variation in services . There continues to be a pattern of wi de variation in health care practice, including regional variations and sm all-area variations. This is a clear indicator that health care practice has not kept pace with the evolving science of health care to ensure evidence-based practice in the United States. Underuse of services . Millions of people do not receiv e necessary care and suffer needless complications that add to costs and reduce pr oductivity. Each year, an estimated 18,000 people die because they do not receive effective interventions. Overuse of services . Each year, millions of Americans re ceive health care services that are unnecessary, increase costs, and may even endanger their health. Research has shown that this occurs across all populations. Misuse of services . Too many Americans are injured during the course of their treatment, and some die prematurely as a result. Disparities in quality . Although quality problems affect al l populations, there may be specific groups identified that have marked differences in quality of care and health outcome. These group may be defined by racial/ethnic differences, income states, geographic area or other social determinants of health. 65 http://www.ahrq.gov/news/qualfact.htm Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 308 of 454 2.9 Establish/Expand a Patient Care Navigation Program Project Goal: The goal of this project is to utilize community health workers, case managers, or other types of health care professionals as pati ent navigators to provide enhan ced social support and culturally competent care to vulnerable and/or high-risk pa tients. Patient navigato rs will help and support these patients to navigate through the continuum of health care services. Patient Navigators will ensure that patients receive coordinated, timel y, and site-appropriate health care services. Navigators may assist in connecting patients to primary care physicians and/or medical home sites, as well as diverting non-ur gent care from the Emergency De partment to site-appropriate locations. RHPs implementing this project will identify health care workers, case managers/workers or other types of health profes sionals needed to engage with patients in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner th at will be essential to guiding the patients through integrated health care delivery systems. A study on Patient Navigation funded by the Nationa l Cancer Institute was done in TX and a manual for patient navigation programs direct ed towards Latino audiences was released following its completion. 66 Project Options: a) Provide navigation services to targeted patients who are at high risk of disconnect from institutionalized health care (for example, patients with multiple chronic conditions, cognitive im pairments and disabilities, Limited English Proficient patients, recent im migrants, the uninsured, those with low health literacy, frequent vis itors to the ED, and others) Required core proj ect components: a) Identify frequent ED users and use na vigators as part of a preventable ED reduction program. Train health care navigators in cultural competency. b) Deploy innovative health care personnel, such as case managers/workers, community health workers and other types of health professionals as patient navigators. c) Connect patients to primary and preventive care. d) Increase access to care management and/or chronic care management, including education in chronic disease self-management. e) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement.

Activities may in clude, but are not limited to, identifying project impacts, \"lessons learned,\" opportunities to scale all or part of the project to a broader patient population, and key challenges associated with expansion of the project, including special considerations for safety-net populations. Rationale: Patient navigators help patients and their fam ilies navigate the fragmented maze of doctors' offices, clinics, hospitals, out-patient centers, payment systems, support organizations and other components of the healthcare system. Services pr ovided by patient navigators vary by program and the needs of the pati ent, but often include: 67 Facilitating communication among patients, family members, survivors and healthcare providers. Coordinating care among providers. Arranging financial support a nd assisting with paperwork. Arranging transportation and child care. Ensuring that appropriate me dical records are availabl e at medical appointments. Facilitating follow-up appointments. Community outreach and building partners hip with local agencies and groups. Ensuring access to clinical trials. There is no one common definition of patient navigators and the profile of a patient navigator vary widely by program. Many use trained comm unity health workers who may be full-time employees or volunteers. Community health worker s have close ties to the local community and serve as important links between underserved co mmunities and the healthcare system. They also posses the linguistic and cultura l skills needed to connect with patients from underserved communities. Community health workers are al so known as community health advisors, lay 67 http://www.altfutures.com/draproject/pdfs/Report _07_02_Patient_Navigator_Program_Overview.pdf Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 310 of 454 health advocates and promotoras de salud. Healthcare navigators in clude trained social workers, nurses and nurse practitioners as well as tr ained lay persons/volunteers. Some navigation programs also use a team based approach that co mbines community health workers with one or more professionals with experien ce in healthcare or social work. While there is no set education required for a patient navigator to be su ccessful, a successful navigator should be: Compassionate, sensitive, culturally att uned to the people and community being served and able to communicate effectively. Knowledgeable about the envir onment and healthcare system. Connected with critical deci sion makers inside the system, especially financial decision makers. 2.10 Use of Palliative Care Programs Project Goal:68 Provide palliative care services to imp rove patient outcomes and quality of life. Palliative medicine represents a different model of care, focu sing not on cure at any cost but on relief and prevention of suffering. Here the priority is s upporting the best possible quality of life for the patient and family, regardless of prognosis. Idea lly, the principles of palliative care can be applied as far upstream as diagnosis, in tandem with cure-directed trea tment, although it's still associated in most people's minds with end-of -life care. There is an economic incentive for hospitals to support palliative care -- research shows significant reductions in pharmacy, laboratory, and intensive care co sts -- though there's understandable reluctance to tout such benefits. After all, accusations of \"death pane ls\" effectively shut out government funding for palliative care as national debates ab out health care reform took shape. Palliative care has emerged in the past decade. It takes an interdisciplinary approach - doctors, nurses, social workers and often chaplains - and bl ends it with curative care for seriously ill people. While palliative care is fo r people who are very sick, they don't have to have a six-month life expectancy. Some palliative care programs opera te in hospitals; others treat people living at home. Growing numbers of community-based hospi ces also have palliative care services now. Pediatric palliative care is not available everywhere, although it' s becoming more common at the major children's hospitals, In addition, hospices nationwide, which traditionally were often unwilling to treat dying children, have also become more open to pediatric care. The new health reform law allows dying children on Medicaid or the state Children's Health Insurance Program to get hospice or palliative car e without halting other treatment 69. 68 The Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC)www.capc.org/reportcard 69 http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/ Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 311 of 454 Health care reform has the potential to im prove palliative care by implementing care coordination (in hospitals and community) eviden ce-based programs that are already proven to be working.

Rationale: While end-of-life care was once associated almost exclusively with terminal cancer, today people receive end-of-life care for a number of other conditions, su ch as congestive heart failure, other circulatory conditi ons, COPD, and dementia71. Further, some expert s have suggested that palliative and hospice care could be more wide ly embraced for many dying patients. However, these experts say that overly rigid quality stan dards and poorly aligned reimbursement incentives discourage appropriate end- of-life care and foster incentives to provide inappropriate restorative care and technologically in tensive treatments. These experts note that hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies need stronger incentives to provide better access to palliative care and care coordination either directly, themselves, or by contract with outside suppliers of hospice services72. It seems clear that improving care coordinati on near the end of life can improve care for patients with chronic conditions, however, in addition to the elderly with multiple chronic conditions and terminal illnesses, palliative ca re should also allow child ren who are enrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP to receive hospice serv ices without foregoing cura tive treatment related to a terminal illness. 71 MedPAC, 2008 72 Zerzan, Stearns, & Hanson, 2000; Hanley, 2004 Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 313 of 454 2.11 Conduct Medication Management Project Goal: The goal of conducting Medication Management is to provi de information that facilitates the appropriate use of medications in orde r to control illness and promote health73. Medication management is the monitoring of medications a patient takes to confirm that the patient is complying with a medication regimen, while also ensuring the patient is avoiding potentially dangerous drug interactions and other complicati ons. This is especially important for patients taking large numbers of medications to addres s chronic illnesses and multiple diseases. Taking numerous medications is known as polypharmacy and it is particularly common among older adults, as they are more likely to need medica tions to manage an array of chronic conditions. There are a number of aspects to medication management, all of which are focused on making sure that medications are used a ppropriately. Keeping track of all of the medications currently in use by a patient is an important part of medication manageme nt. This can include creating printed lists describing medicati ons, their dosages, and how they are being used. These lists can be kept in patient charts and provided to patients to help th em track the drugs they use and understand why various medicatio ns are being prescribed. Monitoring medication administration is also ke y. Medications usually need to be taken in specific doses at set interval s. Missing doses or timing doses incorrectly can cause complications. Medication management can include everything from usi ng devices that issue reminders to patients to take their medications to filling pill cases for patients and marking the lid of each compartment to indicate when the contents need to be taken 74. The specific purpose of this pr oject area is to provide the platform to conduct Medication Management so that patients recei ve the right medications at th e right time across the Performing Provider in order to reduce me dication errors and adverse e ffects from medication use. Project Options: a) Implement interventions that put in place the teams, technology, and processes to avoid medication errors Required core proj ect components: a) Develop criteria and identify target ed patient populations; e.g. chronic disease patient populations that ar e at high risk for developing complications, co-morbidities, and/ or utilizing acute and emergency care services. 73 The PatientCentered Medical Home: Integrating Comprehensive Medication Management to Optimize Patient Outcomes. 2nd ed, 2012. 74 http://www.wisegeek.com/ Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 314 of 454 b) Develop tools to provide educati on and support to those patients at highest risk of an adverse drug event or medication error. c) Conduct root cause analysis of poten tial medication errors or adverse drug events and develop/implement processes to address those causes d) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement.

Medications are involved in 80 percent of all treat ments and impact every aspect of a patient's life. The two most commonly identified drug therapy problems in patients receiving comprehensive medication management services are: (1) the patient re quires additional drug therapy for prevention, synergistic, or palliative care; a nd (2)the drug dosages need to be titrated to achieve therapeutic levels that reach the intended therapy goals 77.According to the Worl d Health Organization, adherence to therapy for chronic diseases in de veloped countries averages 50 percent, and the major consequences of poor adherence to ther apies are poor health ou tcomes and increased health care costs78.Drug therapy problems occur every day a nd add substantial costs to the health care system. Drug-related morbidity and mortality costs exceed $200 billion annually in the U.S., exceeding the amount spent on the medications themselves79. The Institute of Medicine noted that while only 10 percent of total health care costs are spent on medicat ions, their ability to control disease and impact overall cost, morb idity, and productivity\u2014whe n appropriately used\u2014 is enormous80. 75 Sommers JP.

Care transitions refer to the movement of patients from one health care provider or setting to another. For people w ith serious and complex illnesses, transitions in setting of care\u2014for ex ample from hospital to home or nursing home, or from facility to home- and community-based serv ices\u2014have been shown to be prone to errors. 81 Safe, effective, and efficient care transitions and reduced risk of potentially preventable readmissions require cooperation among providers of medical services, social services, and support services in the community and in long-term care facilities. High-risk patients often have multiple chronic diseases. The implementation of effective care transitions requires practitioners to learn and develop effective ways to successful ly manage one disease in order to effectively manage the complexity of multiple diseases.82The discontinuity of care during transitions typically results in patients with serious conditi ons, such as heart fail ure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia, falling thro ugh the cracks, which may lead to otherwise preventable hospital readmission. 83The goal is to ensure that the hospital discharges are accomplished appropriately and that care tr ansitions occur effectively and safely. Project Options: a) Develop, implement, and evaluate st andardized clinical protocols and evidence-based care delivery model to improve care transitions Required core proj ect components: a) Review best practices from a range of models (e.g. RED, BOOST, STAAR, INTERACT, Coleman, Naylor, GRACE, BRIDGE, etc.). b) Conduct an analysis of the key driv ers of 30-day hospital readmissions using a chart review tool (e.g. the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) State Action on Avoidable Re-hospitalizations (STAAR) tool) and patient interviews. c) Integrate information systems so that continuity of care for patients is enabled d) Develop a system to identify patients being discharged potentially at risk of needing acute care services within 30-60 days e) Implement discharge planning pr ogram and post discharge support program 81Coleman EA. \"Falling Through the Cracks: Challenges and Opportunities for Improving Transitional Care for Persons with Continuous Complex Care Needs.\" Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003) 51:549555 82 Rittenhouse D, Shortell S, et al. \"Improving Chronic Illness Care: Findings from a National Study of Care Management Processes in Large Physician Practices.\" Medical Care Research and Review Journal (2010) 67(3): 301320 83 Coleman, E., Parry, C., et. al. \"The Care Transitions Intervention: a patient centered approach to ensuring effective transfers between sites of geriatric care.\" Home Health Care Serv Q (2003) 22 (3): 117 Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 317 of 454 f) Develop a cross-continuum team comprised of clinical and administrative representatives fr om acute care, skilled nursing, ambulatory care, health cente rs, and home care providers. g) Conduct quality improvement for project using methods such as rapid cycle improvement.

Without suffi cient information and an understanding of their diagnoses, medication, and self-care needs, patients cannot fully participate in their care during and after hospital stays. Additi onally, poorly designed discharge processes create unnecessary stre ss for medical staff causing faile d communications, rework, and frustrations. A comprehensive a nd reliable discharge plan, alo ng with post-discharge support, can reduce readmission rates, improve health outco mes, and ensure quality transitions. Patient transition is a multidimensional concept and may in clude transfer from the hospital to home, or nursing home, or from facility to hom e- and community-based services, etc. 84 http://www.ihi.org/offerings/Training/ReduceReadmi ssions/July2011ReducingReadmi ssions/Pages/default.aspx Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 319 of 454 CATEGORY 2 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS GOAL: Integrate behavioral health with physi cal health and other evidence-based services and supports. The goals of the projects under this heading are to create service delivery models, which engage / integrate behavioral, physical and other comm unity-based services and supports to provide services to individuals with a broad range of beha vioral health conditions in the most appropriate community-based settings and to empower the individual to better manage their health / wellness. According to a recent study released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, only 33% of patients with BH conditions (24% of the a dult population) receive adequate treatment. 85 Patients with BH issues experience higher risk of mortality and poor hea lth outcomes, largely due to a lack of preventive health serv ices and poorly controlled co-m orbid medical disease. Risk increases with the severity of the behavioral health diagnoses. In Texas for example, persons with severe mental illness live over 29 years less, on average, than the general population.86 Behavioral health conditions, also account for increased health care expenditures such as higher rates of potentially preventable inpatient admi ssions. Texas Medicaid data on potentially preventable inpatient readmissions demonstrates that behavioral he alth conditions are a significant driver of inpatient co sts. Mental health and substa nce abuse conditions comprise 8 percent of initial inpatient readmissions to gene ral acute and specialty inpatient hospitals but represent 24 percent of poten tially preventable admissions.87 Complex medical and social issues including mu ltiple chronic health conditions, low income, housing insecurity, social isolati on, and lack of natural supports sy stems severely impact health and social functioning for persons with more se vere behavioral health diagnoses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Substance us e disorders, alone or in combination with mental hea lth conditions, have significant phys ical consequences, leading to disability and increased acute and long term service expenditures. Gaps in the service delivery system have far reaching costs and consequences. For example, the Texas state psychiatric hospital system is in cris is -- nearing or already over capacity, in large part due to gaps in the conti nuum of services and supports for individuals with more complex 85 Druss BG, Reisinger Walker E., \"Mental Disorders and Medical CoMorbidity.\" Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, The Synthesis Project: Issue 21 (2011). 86 Parks, J, Svendsen, D, et. al. \"Morbidity and Mortality in People with Serious Mental Illness\", National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, 2006. 87 Potentially Preventable Readmissions in the Texas Medicaid Population, Fiscal Year 2010, Texas Health and Human Services Commission (2012) Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 320 of 454 chronic mental health conditi ons. These individuals requir e a stable, supportive housing, integrated with community-based clinical and ps ychosocial services to prevent continual cycling through the street, to emergency room, jail and inpatient hospital.88 Providing adequate health care to people with behavioral health conditions requires a comprehensive, person-centered approach with in an integrated, \"no wrong door\" access, and delivery system. The system should include early a nd accurate assessment. It should facilitate access to acute and long term services as well as short term, community-based alternatives for stabilizing individuals in a be havioral health crisis; discha rge planning to transition the individual back to the community from the inpa tient setting; and post-disc harge support services. Evidence-based and evidence-informed strategies ex ist which can facilitate person-centered care for people with behavioral health conditions. These approaches include: organizational realignment and process improve ments to better integrate behavioral and physical health care and ensure that th ere is \"no wrong door\" to accessing needed treatment; self-management and wellness programs whic h empower individuals to better manage their chronic physical and behavioral health conditions; and specialized services and supports directed at high need / high cost populations which integrate clinical and other interventions to address the complex needs of persons with more severe illnesses and social challenges. Integration: Organizational Realig nment and Process Improvement Health care systems which successfully integrat e behavioral health a nd primary care services demonstrate improved care, cost savings, in creased provider and c onsumer satisfaction. 89 This is especially important for medically indigent populations, which ha ve co-occurring chronic health and mental health conditions. Treatments for indivi duals who present with mental health and/or substance abuse concerns are integrated with phy sical health via person -centered approaches. The Four Quadrant Clinical Integration Model provides a promising, pers on-centered conceptual framework for organizational realignment. Each quadrant considers the behavioral health an d physical health risk and complexity of the population and suggests the major system elements th at would be utilized to meet the needs of the individuals within that subs et of the population. The Four Quad rant model is not intended to 88 Continuity of Care Task Force Final Report, DSHS, (2010) 89 Integrating Publicly Funded Physical and Behavioral Health Services: A Description of Selected Initiatives, Health Management Associates (2007). Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 2 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 321 of 454 be prescriptive about what happens in each quadran t, but to serve as a co nceptual framework for collaborative planning in each local system. Ideally it would be used as a part of collaborative planning for each new HRSA BH site, with the CHC and the local provider(s) of public BH services using the framework to decide who w ill do what and how coordination for each person served will be assured. The use of the Four Quadrant Model to consid er subsets of the population, the major system elements and clinical roles would resu lt in the following broad approaches: Quadrant I: Low BH-low physi cal health complexity/risk, se rved in primary care with BH staff on site; very low/low individuals served by the PCP, with the BH staff serving those with slightly elevat ed health or BH risk. Quadrant II: High BH-low physical health co mplexity/risk, served in a specialty BH system that coordinates with the PCP. Quadrant III: Low BH-high physical health complexity/risk, served in the primary care/medical specialty system with BH staff on site in primary or medical specialty care, coordinating with all medical care provi ders including disease managers. Quadrant IV: High BH-high physical health comp lexity/risk, served in both the specialty BH and primary care/medical specialty system s; in addition to the BH case manager, there may be a disease manager, in which cas e the two managers work at a high level of coordination with one another a nd other members of the team. Other integration models include the IMPACT Model 90 and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Process improvements, such as adoption of ev idence-based clinical practice guidelines for detection and treatment of depre ssion and other conditions and for assessment of suicide risk can improve outcomes in both primary and specialty be havioral clinical settings. For example, one effective evidence-based strategy that has been shown to improve outcomes for depression, the most prevalent BH disorder, is the DIAMOND/IM PACT model of care. Key elements of such care models are screening for high prevalence mental health conditions , co-location of BH clinicians into primary care settings, collabora tive meetings held by primary care and BH team members to discuss cases, training of primar y care and BH staff on effective screening and collaborative care, the presence of tracking system s and registries to supp ort effective monitoring of patients, the \"Stepped Care\" approach for appr opriate level of treatment, care management for the highest risk patients with mental health and substance abuse di sorders, and relapse prevention, among others. 91 Other examples of evidence -base practices include Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for substance use disorders.

Independent evaluation of Texas SBIRT study determined that it resulted in significant inpatie nt / emergency department savings and increased appropriate use of services in the st ate's largest public hospital district. 92 Self-Management and Wellness Programs Successfully engaging the individual consumer in disease self-management and wellness activities related to chronic physical and behavi oral health conditions empowers person-centered recovery and improved health outcomes. Th e Chronic Disease Self-Management Program developed at Stanford University to help people manage physical conditions such as diabetes and chronic pain, and Wellness Recovery Action Pl anning (WRAP) which is directed toward managing severe mental illness 93, are two prominent examples of evidenced-based, self- management models. Giving the individual consum er control over health resources is another complementary promising practice. Health navigation and individual health planning are related pr actices. The Texas and Minnesota Demonstrations to Maintain Independence and Employment (DMIE) studies which focused on medically indigent adults with behavioral health disorders, used health care navigation to achieve positive results in health care u tilization and wellness measures. 94 In Texas DMIE, health navigation and support from case managers trained in Motivational Interviewing resulted in increased access to and use of a ppropriate health serv ices, including: more use of preventative care; more outpatient, more mental health and de ntal visits; greater adherence and persistence in taking prescribed medications for chronic c onditions such as hype rtension, respiratory conditions, diabetes, high cholesterol; more medi cal stability for chroni c conditions and greater satisfaction with healthcare.95 Self-directed resource use models empower the individual to purchase goods and services to promote wellness and recovery. There is an evid ence base for these models. For example, adults with severe mental illness and co-occurring physi cal disabilities in the Arkansas Cash and Counseling program were less likely to fall, have respiratory infections, develop bed sores, or spend a night in hospital or a nur sing home if they had access to i ndividual budgets than if they 92 Insight Project Research Group (2009).

Similarly, an evaluation of the New Jersey Cash and Counseling program found that it was equally successful for participants with SM I as those with other types of disabilities97. In the Texas Self-Directed Care study (SDC), individuals with severe mental illness are empowered to manage a flexible fund to purch ase goods and services with assistance from an advisor. Consumers have broad latitude for ma king substitutions of tr aditional services and supports within a typical maximum budget of $4,000 / year. Experience during the first year of the SDC indicates that individuals in the in tervention group are making significant gains in recovery, wellness and employment relative to th e control group. Specialized Services and Supports for High Need Sub-Populations The Texas Continuity of Care Task Force 98 analyzed needs and recommendations for improving services to severely mentally ill individuals w ho move repeatedly through multiple systems, such as criminal justice, general acute inpatient and mental health. Among the recommendations was the development of: supported housing, assisted living, smaller, community-based living options, and services, such as cognitive rehabilitative moda lities, to address the individual's limitations in organizing, planning a nd completing activities. Services could be provided in a variety of settings, including indi vidual homes, apartments, adult foster homes, assisted living facilities, a nd small group (three- to four-bed) community- supported residential settings. Examples of servic es could include cogniti ve and psychosocial rehabilitation; supported employment; transition a ssistance to establish peer support; specialized therapies; medical services, transp ortation medications and personal assistance. 96 Shen, C., Smyer, M.A., Mahoney, K.J., Loughlin, D.M. et al., (2008).

Project Goal: Provide specialized services to co mplex behavioral health populati ons such as people with severe mental illnesses and/or a combination of behavior al health and physical health issues. These populations often have multiple concomitant issues such as substance use, traumatic injuries, homelessness, cognitive challenges, and lack of daily living skill s and lack of natural supports. The State's mental health syst em provides rehabilitative servi ces and pharmacotherapy to people with certain severe psychiatric diagnoses and f unctional limitations, but can serve only a fraction of the medically indigent popul ation. It does not serve other high risk behavioral health populations and does not provide the range of services needed to deal with complex psychiatric and physical needs. These complex populations b ecome frequent users of local public health systems. The goal of this project is to avert outcomes such as potentially avoi dable inpatient admission and readmissions in settings incl uding general acute and specialty (psychiatric) hospitals; to avert disruptive and deleterious events such as crim inal justice system involvement; to promote wellness and adherence to medica tion and other treatments; and to promote recovery in the community. This can be done by providing commun ity based interventions for individuals to prevent them from cycling through multiple system s, such as the criminal justice system; the general acute and specialty psychiatric inpatient system; and the mental health system. Examples of interventions could include integr ated medical and non-medical supports such as transition services to help indi viduals establish a stable livin g environment, peer support, specialized therapies, medical services, personal assistance, and short or long term residential options. Residential options linked to a range of support services can eff ectively improve health outcomes for vulnerable individuals, such as the long-term homeless with severe mental illness. One such model in Colorado demonstrated a drastic 80 perc ent decrease in overnight hospital stays and a 76 percent decrease in nights in jail (Wortzel, 2007). Research indicates that among residents of permanent supportive housing: Rates of arrest and days in carcerated are reduced by 50%; Emergency room visits decrease by 57%; Emergency detoxification serv ices decrease by 85%; and Nursing home utilization decreased by 50%. 99 99 Lewis, D., Corporation for Supportive Housing, Permanent Supportive Housing Program & Financial Model for Austin/Travis County, TX, 2010.

Project Goal: Create wellness, self-management programs that employ research supported interventions singly or in combination to help indi viduals manage their chronic ph ysical and behavioral health conditions. Examples of resear ch-supported individual wellness self management strategies include Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRA P), the Chronic Disease Self Management Program; Motivational Interviewing; client-manag ed wellness accounts; and health navigation / individual health planning models to empower the individual to ach ieve their health goals. These interventions should be closely coordina ted with the patient's medical home. Successfully engaging the individual consumer in disease self management and wellness activities related to chronic physical and behavi oral health conditions empowers person-centered recovery and improved health outcomes. The Chronic Disease Self Management Program, developed at Stanford University to help people manage physical conditions such as diabetes and chronic pain, and Wellness Recovery Action Pl anning (WRAP) which is directed toward managing severe mental illness 100, are two prominent examples of evidenced-based, self- management models. Giving the individual consum er control over health resources is another complementary promising practice. Health navigation and individual health planning are related pr actices. The Texas and Minnesota Demonstrations to Maintain Independence and Employment (DMIE), which focused on medically indigent adults with behavioral health disorders, used health care navigation to achieve positive results in health care u tilization and wellness measures. 101 In Texas DMIE, health navigation and support from case managers trained in Motivational Interviewing resulted in increased access to and use of a ppropriate health serv ices, including: more use of preventative care; more outpatient, more mental health and de ntal visits; greater adherence and persistence in taking prescribed medications for chronic c onditions such as hype rtension, respiratory conditions, diabetes, high cholesterol; more medi cal stability for chroni c conditions and greater satisfaction with healthcare.102 Self directed resource use models empower the individual to purchase goods and services to promote wellness and recovery. There is an evid ence base for these models.

Similarly, an evaluation of the New Jersey Cash and Counseling program found that it was equally successful for participants with SM I as those with other types of disabilities104. In the Texas Self-Directed Care study (SDC), individuals with severe mental illness are empowered to manage a flexible fund to purch ase goods and services with assistance from an advisor. Consumers have broad latitude for ma king substitutions of tr aditional services and supports within a typical maximum budget of $4,000 / year. Experience during the first year of the SDC indicates that individuals in the in tervention group are making significant gains in recovery, wellness and employment relative to th e control group.

The concept of a medical home that can address the needs of the whole person is increasingly recognized as a key in improving both access to ca re, continuity of care, improved outcomes. The importance of simultaneously addressing the physical health n eeds and the behavioral health needs of individuals has become r ecognized over the past three decades. A recent study of adults discharged from ps ychiatric hospitals found 20% with chronic and serious conditions such as HIV infection, brain trauma, cerebral palsy and heart disease. As many as 75% of individuals with schizophrenia have been found to have high rates of serious physical illnesses, such as di abetes, respiratory, heart and/or bowel problems and high blood pressure. High rates were also seen for vision (9 3%), hearing (78%), a nd dental (60%) problems ... the of atypical antipsychotic medi cations, which exacerbate this predisposition, individuals with schizophrenia have especially high rates of diabet es. Cardiovascular diseases are also very prevalent among people with mental illnesses. Again, psychiatric medications exacerbate the problem because they are associated with obesity and high triglyceride levels, known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Ad ults with serious mental illnesses are known to have poor nutrition, high rates of smoking and a se dentary lifestyle\u2014all f actors that place them at greater risk for serious physical disorders, in cluding diabetes, cardiovas cular disease, stroke, arthritis and certain types of cancers. Despite such extensive medical needs, adults with serious mental illnesses often do not receive treatmen t... Among people with schizophrenia, fewer than 70% of those with co-occurring physical problems were currently receiving treatment for 10 of 12 physical health conditions studied. 105 Medical Homes and similar collabor ative care approaches have been determined to be beneficial in the treatment of mental illness in a variety of controlled studies. 106 Behavioral health problems are ofte n cyclical in nature meaning that over a course of months or years a person may experience periods of tim e when symptoms are well controlled (or in remission) while at other times sy mptoms can range from moderate to severe. The concept of a Medical home where physical and behavioral health care is inte grated and provides supports for individuals who are in any quadr ant of the National Council for Community Behavioral Health (NCCBH) Four Quadrant Clinical In tegration Model at a given time. 105 Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law (2004), GET IT TOGETHER How to Integrate Physical and Mental Health Care for People with Serious Mental Disorders 106 Thielke, S., Vannoy, S. & Un\u00fctzer, J.

Quadrant II: High BH-low physical health complexity/risk, served in a specialty BH system that coordinates with the PCP. Quadrant III: Low BH-high physical health complexity/risk, served in the primary care/medical specialty system with BH staff on site in primary or medical specialty care, coordinating with all medical care providers including disease managers. Quadrant IV: High BH-high physical health complexity/risk, served in both the specialty BH and primary care/medical spec ialty systems; in addition to the BH case manager, there may be a disease ma nager, in which case the two managers work at a high level of c oordination with one another and other members of the team. Other integration models include the IMPACT Model 107 and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Through the integration of behavior al health and physical health care services, opportunities to address both conditions during a single visit are vastly increa sed. Co-location, when coupled with protocols, training, technology and team building has the potential to improve communications between providers and enhance coordination of care. Additionally, access to care is enhanced because individuals do not have to incur the cost or inconvenience of arranging transportation or making multiple trips to different locations to address physical and behavioral health needs. Finally, given the ever-increasing cost of tran sportation, a \"one stop shopping\" approach for health care improves the chances that individuals with multiple health needs will be able to access the needed care in a singl e visit and thereby overcome the negative synergy that exists between physical and behavioral health conditions. Co-location alone is not synonymous with integration. Levels of interaction between physical and behavioral health providers may range from traditional minimally collaborative models to fully integrated collaborative models. 107 Excerpted from the IMPACT website at the University of Washington at http://impact uw.org/about/key.html.

Minimal Collaboration: mental health providers and pr imary care providers work in separate facilities, have separate systems, and communicate sporadically. 2. Basic Collaboration at a Distance: separate systems at separate sites; periodic communication about shared patients, typically by tele phone or letter. 3. Basic Collaboration On-site: separate systems, but shared facility; more communication, but each provider remains in his/her own professional culture. 4. Close Collaboration in a Partly Integrated System: providers share the same facility and have some systems in common (scheduling appo intments, medical records); regular face-to- face communication; sense of being part of a team. 5. Close Collaboration in a Fully Integrated System: providers are part of the same team and system; the patient experiences mental health treatment as part of their regular primary care or vice versa. Delivery system reform projects proposed under this category s hould be structured to achieve level 4 or, preferably level 5 levels of interaction. Project Options: a) Design, implement, and evaluate projects that provide integrated primary and behavioral health care services. Required core components: a) Identify sites for integrated car e projects, which would have the potential to benefit a significant number of patients in the community. Examples of selection criteria coul d include proximity/accessibility to target population, physical plant con ducive to provider interaction; ability / willingness to integrate and share data electronically; receptivity to integrated team approach. b) Develop provider agreements wher eby co-scheduling and information sharing between physical health and behavioral health providers could be facilitated. c) Establish protocols and processe s for communication, data-sharing, and referral between behavioral and physical health providers d) Recruit a number of specialty pr oviders (physical health, mental health, substance abuse, etc. to provide services in the specified locations. e) Train physical and behavioral health providers in protocols, effective communication and team approach.

Project Goal Provide ready access to psychiatric consultati on in primary care to enhance and improve treatment for individuals with be havioral health conditions. Virt ual psychiatric consultation may include (but is not limited to ) the following modalit ies of communication: telephone, instant message, video conference, facsimile, and e-mail. Primary Care Providers (PCPs) tend to be the first (and often last) stop for services for indi viduals with mental illness and substance use disorders. Indeed, more than 1/3 of all patients rely solely on PCPs to treat psychiatric disorders. These individuals may have medical conditions th at are created or exacerbated by untreated or under-treated mental illness and s ubstance abuse. This trend m eans PCPs should have adequate resources and expertise to trea t behavioral health conditions. Treating behavioral health conditions during a PCP visit reduces the chance s of losing the patient during the referral process. The goal of this project is to provide PCPs de livering services regionally with the necessary resources and guidance to adequa tely treat patients who pres ent with behavioral health conditions. Clinical guidance will be provided remotely vi a the following communication methods: telephone, instant message, video conferen ce, facsimile, and e-mail. Access to these services will allow the medical treatment team to utilize behavioral heal th expertise in areas including, but not limited to: diagnostic impr essions, psychiatric medication administration, trajectory and outcomes of mental health dia gnoses, cultural consider ations relevant to behavioral health treatment, and referral r ecommendations for ongoing treatment, and behavioral health self-management resources. PCPs will increase their knowledge base about behavioral health conditions while also having quick access to cutting edge and research based behavioral health interventions over seve ral communication methods. This effort will bridge the often disparate disciplines of behavi oral and physical health, providi ng better outcomes for patients who increasingly rely on primary car e settings for treatment of thei r behavioral health conditions.

Project Goals: The goal of this project is to implement impr ovements in care transiti ons and coordination of care from inpatient to outpatient , post-acute care, and home care settings in order to prevent increased health care costs and hospital readmi ssions of individuals with mental health and substance use (behavioral health) disorders. Fo r people with mental health and substance use disorders, these transitions are especially critical in reduci ng the risk of readmission. Texas Medicaid data on potentially preventable inpati ent readmissions demonstrates that behavioral health conditions are a significant driver of inpatient costs. Ment al health and substance abuse conditions comprise 8 percent of initial inpatient readmissions to general acute and specialty inpatient hospitals but represent 24 per cent of potentially preventable admissions.108 The implementation of effective care transitions requires that providers learn and develop effective ways to successfully manage one disease in or der to effectively mana ge the complexity of multiple diseases. 109 Preventable admissions in Texas are commonly indicative of \"the absence of excellent care, especially duri ng the transition from inpatient care to care at home or in a post- acute facility.\"110 Relatively simple steps can make a real diffe rence. These include scheduling the follow-up appointment before discharge, voice-to-voice transfer of care between the attending physician and the primary care physician / provider community-based se rvices, reconciling medication instructions, and follow-up phone calls or visits after discharge. More complex populations with severe behavioral health disorders and other issues, such as homelessness may require more intensive follow-through post discharge. Strategies , such as Critical Time Intervention (CTI), are designed to prevent recurrent adverse outcome s, such as readmissions among persons with severe mental illness. Such interventions may include pre-transition planning, intensive transition support, assessment and adjustment of support and transfer to community sources of care. Peer support can be an important strategy for individu als transitioning from inpatient to community settings. In Texas, the Department of State He alth Services, has developed a peer certification program which could be leveraged by partne rships to develop pe er support capacity.

These services are supportive and not ne cessarily clinical in nature. Building on a project originally es tablished under the State's Mental Health Transformation grant, consumers are being traine d to serve as peer s upport specialists. In addition to the basic peer specialis t training and certification, an a dditional training is provided to certified peers specialists in \"whole health\". With the whole health traini ng peer specialists learn to work with other consumers to set achievable goals to prevent or self-manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and COPD. While such training currently exists, very limited numbers of peers are trained due to resource limitations. Evidence ex ists that such an approach can work with particularly vulnerable populati ons with serious mental illness111. The need for strategies to improve the health outcomes for people with beha vioral health disorders is evidenced by their disparate life expectancy (dying 29 y ears younger than the general population112 ), increased risk of mortality and poor health outcomes as seve rity of behavioral health disorders increase113 Project Options a) Design, implement, and evaluate whole health peer support for individuals with mental health and /or substance use disorders.

The prevalence of co-occurring mental health, substance use and chronic physical diso rders is high in the indigent population. This is due to the lack of access to a nd the complexity of navigating primary care and specialty care services. These individuals end up consuming a great deal of community resources due to ER visits, involve ment of crisis response systems and often unnecessary incarcerations when routine treatment would be a better alternative. Early engagement in appropriate services to address the multiple conditions for these individuals, as well as their needs for housing and social support, re quires both behavioral health case managers and chronic disease care managers working closely to make service settings accessible and to track progress. Project Options: a) Design, implement, and evaluate care management programs and that integrate primary and behavioral he alth needs of individual patients Required core proj ect components: a) Conduct data matching to identify individuals with co-occurring disorders who are: not receiving routine primary care, not receiving specialty care acco rding to professionally accepted practice guidelines, over-utilizing ER services based on analysis of comparative data on other populations, over-utilizing crisis response services. Becoming involved with the criminal justice system due to uncontrolled/unmanaged symptoms. b) Review chronic care management be st practices such as Wagner's Chronic Care Model and select practices compatible with organizational readiness for adoption and implementation. c) Identification of BH case managers and disease care managers to receive assignment of these individuals. d) Develop protocols for coordinating ca re; identify community resources and services available for suppor ting people with co-occurring disorders.

Category 3 Overview a. Introduction The overall objective of Category 3 is to a ssess the effectiveness of Category 1 and 2 interventions in improving outcomes in the Texas healthcare delivery system . As described in the Program Funding and Mechanics (PFM) Protocol, each project selected in Categories 1 and 2 will have one or more associated outcome measures from Category 3. For the purposes of the RHP Planning and PFM Pr otocols, outcome measures are defined as \"measures that assess the results of care experie nced by patients, including patients' clinical events, patients' recovery and health status, patie nts' experiences in the health system, and efficiency/cost.\" All Category 3 outcome measures mu st be reported to specifica tions, except that a Performing Provider may customize the population measured by an outcome as allowed by CMS and HHSC to more closely reflect the patient population targeted in the related Category 1 or 2 project. b. c. Pay for Performance Measures The Category 3 menu of measures contains a la rge proportion of Pay for Performance (P4P) measures that providers may select from to receive incentive payments for demonstrating incremental improvements in the selected outcome. These measures are considered the stronger, more validated measures. If there is a P4P m easure appropriate to the Category 1 or 2 project that the provider can report to the specifications in the attached Compe ndium (Appendix C), then the provider must select a P4P measure. There will be standard achievement levels fo r P4P measures to earn Category 3 funds in demonstration year (DY) 4 and DY 5. In Octo ber 2014, providers may request to deviate from the standard achievement levels based on exte nuating circumstances to be determined by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ( HHSC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), such as if the intervention pop ulation is much smaller, significantly different than the denominator required in the measure sp ecifications or if the benchmarks provided are not an appropriate fit for the denominator popula tion (e.g., with the use of denominator subsets for age). Providers may request a deviation from the standard achievement levels established during the October 2014 baseline re porting period within parameters as agreed to by HHSC and CMS. d. Pay for Reporting Measures The Category 3 menu also contai ns some measures that are designated as Pay for Reporting (P4R). To accommodate the wide variety of Texas DSRIP providers and projects, these P4R measures were approved for inclusion in the me nu as \"exploratory\" measures even though they do not have the strongest rigor of validation or evidence. Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 3 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 348 of 454 All P4R measures require prior authorizati on by HHSC and CMS. The prior authorization process will determine a) if the measure was a previously selected by the provider and was approved for use for a Category 1 or 2 project (if so, this serves as the authorization) and b) if not previously approved, whether there is a P4P meas ure that would be an appropriate fit for the project that the provider can re port to specifications. Providers that need to use a P4R measure will not receive payment for improving its rate, but instead will receive payment for reporting the meas ure to the associated specifications. Providers may still demonstrate improvement in these meas ures; however, that improvement will not be the basis for incentive payment. For these repo rting only or \"explorator y\" measures providers must engage in an alternate improvement activit y - either a Population-Fo cused Priority Measure or a Stretch Activity. These alte rnate improvement activities are de tailed in Appendix (A). For Hospital, Community Mental Health Center , and Physician Group provi der types, providers with a P4R measure should select an outcome from the Population-Focused Priority Measure list. These outcomes do not have to be tied to the associated Category 1 or 2 project and instead represent a larger health prio rity for the health system. For Local Health Department providers and fo r those providers above who cannot identify a measure to report from the Population-Focused Pr iority Measure list, pr oviders may select a Stretch Activity. These activities are intended to improve data infrastr ucture and capacity. e. Minimum Category 3 Requirements fo r Each Category 1 or 2 Project Each outcome measure (IT-X.X) is labe led as a standalone measure or non standalone measure. Providers can select among the following met hods to meet Category 3 requirements for each Category 1 or 2 project: At least one standalone measure: Providers can select a stan dalone measure from any outcome domain listed in the table be low for Category 1 and 2 projects. Cost related outcomes may be used as the standalone outcome only for project area 2.5 (Cost Containment). Cost outcomes can be selected as non standalone measures for other project areas. At least one standalone measure and additional non standalone measure(s): One or more non standalone measures from any outcome domain can be combined with at least one standalone measure. A combination of at least 3 non standalone measures: A provider can select a combination of 3 non standalone measures for a Cate gory 1 or 2 project and these measures may be from different outcome domains if needed. The measures selected for each Category 1 or 2 project may be a combination of P4P and P4R measures. Each measure is treated sepa rately for reporting and payment purposes.

Types of Category 3 Milestones The terms \"process milestone\" and \"achievement milestone\" are used to classify Category 3 milestones in each demonstration year. Process milestones will be those milestones in which a provider is not earning DSRIP funds based on r eaching a goal achievement level over baseline, i.e., it will be used for DY2 and DY3 planning ac tivities to prepare for Category 3 reporting, in DY4 and DY5 for reporting to specifications (f or P4R measures), and in DY5 for stretch activities. Achievement milestones will be used for milestones in which the provider will earn funds based on progress towards a goal achievement level for the measure, i.e., for P4P measures in DY4 and DY5 and Population-Focuse d Priority Measures in DY5. The table below describes the milestones each year for both P4P and P4R outcomes. Pay for Performance (P4P) outcome measures Pay for Reporting (P4R) outcome measures DY2 Each provider selected process milestones from the original menu (P-1 through P-7) and designated the valuation per milestone; a stat us update was allowed in lieu of specific milestone documentation for DY2 DY3 2 process milestones (P-8 & P-9) - DY 3 Category 3 status update (50% of DY3 allocation) and establishing base line (50% of DY3 allocation) DY4 Process Milestone 10 - 50% of DY4 allocation for reporting P4P measure to specifications Achievement Milestone 1 - 50% of DY4 allocation for demonstrating improvement in P4P measure over baseline Process Milestone 10 - 100% of DY4 allocation for reporting P4R measure to specifications DY5 Achievement Mile stone 1 - 100% of DY5 allocation for demonstrating improvement in P4P measure over baseline Process Milestone 10 - 50% of DY5 allocation for reporting P4R measure to specifications Alternate Improvement Activity EITHER Achievement Milestone 2 - 50% of DY5 allocation for demonstrating improvement in a Population Focused Priority Measure OR Process Milestone 11 - 50% of DY5 allocation for reporting as required on a stretch activity Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 3 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 350 of 454 *Per the PFM Protocol, all Category 3 milestone s are eligible for carry forward into the subsequent year and achievement milestones only are eligible for payment for partial achievement. 75. Category 3 Outcome Measures All of the measures included in the Category 3 menu have been approved by CMS. Often the source of these measures is an authoritativ e agency around outcome measurement (e.g., AHRQ, NCQA, CDC, NQF). Most of these measures have been validated and tested to ensure that the outcomes are measuring what they purport to measure. In some instances, these evidence based measures are modified in order to be used by DS RIP providers to change the specifications to describe a provider focus as opposed to a health plan focus. These modifications are described in detail within the compendium document (Appendix C). In some cases, where validated measures did not previously exist, measures were created based on evidence based guidelines and practices. These measures were included in the menu to reflect outcomes pertinent to approved Category 1 and 2 projects . The outcomes are salient to aspects of patient care that reflect better health and satisfaction with servic es, improved efficiencies in health care delivery and cost savings. 76. Outcome Domains All of the Category 3 outcome measures are organized into 15 Outcome Domains (ODs) to facilitate measure selection. OD-1: Primary Care and Ch ronic Disease Management Admissions Readmission Rates OD-4: Potentially Preventable Complicati ons, Healthcare Acquired Conditions, and Patient Safety OD-5: Cost of Care OD-6: Patient Satisfaction OD-7: Oral Health OD-8: Perinatal Outcomes and Maternal Child Health OD-9: Right Care, Right Setting OD-10: Quality of Life/Functional Status OD-11: Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse Care Primary Prevention OD-13: Palliative Care OD-14: Healthcare Workforce OD-15: Infectious Disease Management Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 3 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 351 of 454 77.

Approved June 14, 2013 Page 373 of 454 Grouping Patients for Outcomes For the purpose of Category 3 outcomes, there ar e three main groups of patients to consider. Intervention population - This is the group of individuals that receives the in tervention outlined in the Category 1 or 2 project. In almost al l cases (and based on measure specifications), a provider will not report on the intervention-le vel population for the pur poses of Category 3 reporting. Target population - This is the group of i ndividuals that is eligible to receive the intervention (the broader group of individuals the intervention is designed to serve). While Category 3 must be reported to measure specifi cations, providers may narrow th e measure denominator based on certain criteria to more closely represent the Category 1 or 2 proj ect's target population. Outcome population - This is the group of patients th at meet the criteria for outcome measurement based on the specifications for each m easure. This often is a broader population than the project target population. 78. Allowable Denominator Subsets All Category 3 outcome measures are required to be reported to the specifications required for the measure as outlined in the menu and the co mpendium. However, as appropriate to the Category 1 or 2 project, the pr ovider can propose a more narrow denominator (a subset of the outcome population) based on one or more of the following criteria: Payer source (Medicaid or Indigent or both), Target condition (including co-morbid condition/diagnosis) Demographic factors - age, race /ethnicity, and/or gender, or Clinic or other location where the Cate gory 1 or 2 project is taking place. Using allowable denominator subsets is a way to more closely reflect the target population for each project (which will still be broader than the intervention population in almost all cases). 79. Establishing a Baseline for Each Category 3 Measure Each DSRIP provider will need to establish a baseline for all Ca tegory 3 outcome measures, both P4P and P4R. Baselines also must be establis hed for any selected Population-Focused Priority measures used as an alternative performance ac tivity. The baseline will be specific to the patients served by that provider. Baselines will be formally reported in October 2014 or later if needed. The provider's baseline for each measure will determine both the achievement goals for the measure in DY4 and DY5. The baseline period should be as recent as possible, DY3 is preferred, and will generally be a 12-month or 6-month period. The DY4 measurement period will be set as the 12 months immediately foll owing the end of baseline period and the DY5 Attachment I Regional Healthcare Partners hip (RHP) Planning Protocol Category 3 Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 374 of 454 measurement period will be the 12 months imme diately following the end of DY4 measurement period. Providers should review the measure sp ecifications to help determine the appropriate baseline period. If providers need to request an earlier baseli ne measurement period than DY2, provider will need to submit justification as to why DY2 or DY3 ba seline is not appropriate or available. HHSC will review these on a case by case basis and make a determination on appropriate DY4 and DY5 measurement periods. 80. Standard Achievement Target Metho dology for Achievement Milestones For achievement milestones for P4P measures in DY4-5 and Population-Focused Priority Measures in DY5, providers will receive incentiv e payments for demonstrating improvements in rate performance towards an achievement target. Achievement targets are determined based on a provider's baseline performance in the measure and are calculated by one of the two methodologies described below. Achievement milest ones are eligible for partial achievement in increments of 25% as outlined in the PFM Protocol. Quality Improvement System for Managed Care (QISMC) : For those P4P measures where the improvement methodology is designated as QISM C, providers will receive incentive payments for closing the gap between their baseline perf ormance and the benchmark rates listed. For DSRIP, Texas is using a hybrid of this system used for managed care, and the benchmarks are a proxy for performance based on national or state data and may not be an exact match to the population or delivery system for a DSRIP project. If a provider, at baseline, is performing above the high performance benchmark it is required to select another measure unless the provider can make a compelling justification for how impr ovement can be demonstrated beyond the high performance benchmark. The achievement level goal for DY4 will be determined as follows: IF a provider's reported baseline rate fa lls below the low performance benchmark (also called minimum performance level or MPL) the DY4 Achievement Target is equal to the rate listed for the MPL. IF a provider's reported baseline rate falls above the MPL but below the high performance level (HPL) benchmark, the provider must close the gap between baseline performance and the HPL rate by 10%. The achievement level goal for DY5 will be determined as follows. IF a provider's reported baseline rate fa lls below the low performance benchmark (also called minimum performance level or MPL) the DY5 Achievement Target is equal to a 10% gap reduction be tween the MPL and HPL. IF a provider's reported baseline rate falls above the MPL but below the high performance level (HPL) benchmark providers must close the gap between baseline performance and the HPL rate by 20%.

For these P4P measures, the improvement methodology is designated as \"IOS\", or Im provement over self, providers earn incentive payments for demonstrating improvement over baseline performance. The achievement level goals will be determined as follows: DY4 achievement level goal is equal to a 5% improvement over the provider's baseline and is calculated as a 5% ga p reduction between baseline performance and highest possible performance in the m easure (e.g., 0% or 100% depending on the directionality of a rate based measure). DY5 achievement level goal is equal to 10% improvement over the provider's baseline and is calculated as a 10% ga p reduction between base line performance and highest possible performance in the measure. The IOS methodology is further described and speci fied in Appendix B for measures that are categorized as rates, frequencie s or counts and survey scores Example of IOS achievement metho dology for a rate based measure: IT-1.9 Depression Management: Depression Remission at 12 months No high and low performing benchmark information available, therefore assume highest possible performance (100%) as performance gap upper limit.

Category 4 Structure: Required Reporting Domains: Category 4 c ontains five domains on which hospital performing providers must re port, as specified in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . The required reporting domains include: o Potentially Preventable Admissions (PPAs) o Potentially Preventable R eadmissions (PPRs) - 30-day o Potentially preventable Complications (PPCs) o Patient-centered healthcare, including patient satisfaction and medication management o Emergency department Optional Reporting Domain: At their opti on, hospital performing providers may report on Reporting Domain (RD) 6, which is the CMS Initial Core Set of Measures for Adults and Children in Medicaid/CHIP. While reporting on this domain is optional, participation in Domain 6 reporting is required to value Category 4 at the 15 percent maximum (see Category 4 Valuation below.) Hospital performing providers, with the ex ception of those that are exempt from Category 4 reporting in accordance with paragraph 11.f of the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol , must report on Category 4 meas ures in the required reporting domains. Each hospital performing provide r subject to required Category 4 reporting must report on all measures in the requi red reporting domains, unless for certain measures the provider does not have statistica lly valid data, as defined in paragraph 11.e of the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . Hospitals designated as Institutes of Mental Disease (IMDs) report on an alternate set of measures listed at the end of this section. HHSC will collect all Category 4 data for each hospital, but based on Texas statutory requirements pertaining to the c onfidentiality of i ndividual hospital data for some of the Category 4 measures, HHSC will summarize certain data related to Category 4 for CMS at the RHP level rather than at th e individual provider level. Each performing provider subject to Categor y 4 required reporting will include Category 4 measures for PPCs (RD-3) during DY 4-5 a nd for all other required reporting domains during DY 3-5. The Category 4 emphasis is on the reporting of population health measures to gain information on and understanding of the health status of key populations and to build the capacity for reporting on a comprehensive set of population health metrics; therefore, hospital performing providers will not be requ ired to achieve improvement in Category 4.

It should review data and res pond to it - with tests of ne w solutions and ideas - every week. 2. It should bring all participating sites toge ther by phone or webinar on a weekly or bi- weekly basis to learn from one another. All sites should share resu lts of their testing, a breakthrough idea, and a challenge each week at the start of each call and they should leave with a public commitment to test a new idea the following week. 3. It should set one or two quantifiable, projec t-level goals, with a deadline, preferably defined in terms of outcomes, relate d to the project's area of work. Participants should actively manage toward this goal over the course of the work. 4. It should invest more in learning than in teaching. Huge proportional investments in web sites and conferences do not typically result in performance improvement or transformation of care delivery. It is more e ffective to get out into the field and support learning and exchange at the front lines where care is delivered. 5. It should support a small, lightweight web site to help site share ideas and simple data over time. The website should not be developed fr om scratch for the program. Rather, it should be possible to \"rent\" space on a por tal already designed to support this kind of improvement work. 6. It should set up simple, interim measuremen t systems, based on self-reported data and sampling, that can be shared at the local le vel and are sufficient for the purposes of improvement. 7. It should employ individuals (r egional \"innovator agents\") to travel from site to site in the network to (a) rapidly answer practic al questions about im plementation and (b) harvest good ideas and practices th at they systematically spre ad to others. The regional \"innovator agents\" should all attend the same initial training in improvement tools and skills organized by the State or RHP and should receive periodic continuing education on improvement. 8. It should set up face-to-face lear ning (meetings or seminars) at least a coupl e of times a year.

It should celebrate success every week. 10. It should mandate some improvements (simple th ings that everyone c an do to \"raise the floor\" on performance) and it should unleash vanguard sites to pursue previously unseen levels (\"raise the bar\" on performance). 11. It should use metrics to measure its success such as: Rate of testing Rate of spread Time from idea to full implementation Commitment rate (rate at which 50% of organizations take action for any specific request) Number of questions asked per day Network affinity/reported affection for the network Continuous Quality Improvement: In order to incentivize engagement in meaningf ul quality improvement (QI) activities that can lead to successful projects, th is protocol includes optional pro cess milestones and metrics for quality improvement activities. The process milestones and metrics for quality improvement activities listed below (which are also included as process milestone in the relevant project areas) further reflect CMS thinking on the type of QI ac tivities that should be part of the QI core component for projects and provide direct insight into how CMS will revi ew projects for this core element.

PREFACE On December 12, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the Texas request for a new Medicaid demonstr ation waiver entitled \"Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Progr am\" (Project # 11-W-00278/6) in accordance with section 1115 of the Social Security Act. The new waiver was approved through September 30, 2016. 1. Delivery System Reform In centive Payment Program Special Terms and Conditions (STC) 45 of the De monstration authorizes Texas to establish a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (D SRIP) program. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide incentive paym ents to hospitals and other providers for investments in delivery system reforms that incr ease access to health care , improve the quality of care, and enhance the health of pa tients and families they serve. The program of activity funded by the DSRI P shall be based on Regional Healthcare Partnerships (RHPs). Each RHP shall have ge ographic boundaries and will be coordinated by a public hospital or local governmental entity w ith the authority to make intergovernmental transfers. The public hospital or local government al entity shall collabora te with hospitals and other potential providers to deve lop an RHP Plan that will accele rate meaningful delivery system reforms that improve patient care for low- income populations. The RHP Plans must be consistent with regional shared mission and quality goals of the RHP and CMS's triple aims to improve care for individuals (including access to car e, quality of care, and health outcomes); improve health for the population; and lowe r costs through improvements (without any harm whatsoever to individuals, families, or communities). 2. RHP Planning Protocol and Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol In accordance with STC 45(a) and 45(d)(ii)(A) & (B), the RHP Pl anning Protocol (Attachment I) defines the specific initiatives that will ali gn with the following four categories: (1) Infrastructure Development; (2) Program Innova tion and Redesign; (3) Quality Improvements; and (4) Population-focused Improvements. The Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment J) describes the State and CMS revi ew process for RHP Plans, incentive payment methodologies, RHP and State repor ting requirements, and penaltie s for missed milestones. Following CMS approval of Attachment I and A ttachment J, each RHP must submit an RHP Plan that identifies the pr ojects, outcomes, population-fo cused objectives, and specific milestones and metrics in accordance with these attachments and STCs. This version of the Program Funding and Mechan ics Protocol is approve d as of May 22, 2014. 3.

RHP 20: Jim Hogg, Maverick, Webb, Zapata 6. RHP Anchoring Entity The Texas Health and Human Services Commissi on (HHSC) delegates to the Anchoring Entity the responsibility of coordinati on with the RHP participants in development of the RHP Plan for that region. Each RHP shall have one Anchoring Entity that coordinates the development of the RHP Plan for that region. In RHPs that have a public hospital, a public hospital shall serve as the Anchoring Entity. In regions without a publi c hospital, the following entities may serve as anchors: (1) a hospital district; (2 ) a hospital author ity; (3) a county; or (4) a State university with a health science center or medical school. RHP Anchoring Entities shall be responsible for coordinating RHP activities and assisting HHSC perform key oversight and reporting responsibilities. Anchoring Entities activities shall include: Coordinating the development of a comm unity needs assessment for the region; Engaging stakeholders in the region, including the public; Coordinating the development the 5-year RHP Plan that best meets community needs in collaboration with RHP participants; Ensuring that the RHP Plan is consistent with Attachment I, Attachment J, and all other State/waiver requirements; Facilitating RHP Plan complian ce with the RHP Plan Checklist; Transmitting the RHP Plan and any associated plan amendments to HHSC on behalf of the RHP; Ongoing monitoring and annual reporting (as requ ired in paragraphs 16 and 24) on status of projects and performance of Perf orming Providers in the region; and Ongoing communication with HHS C on behalf of the RHP. 7. IGT Entities Intergovernmental transfer (IGT) Entities are en tities that fund the non- federal share of DSRIP payments for an RHP. They include Anc horing Entities, government-owned Performing Providers, community mental health centers (C MHCs), local health departments, academic health science centers, and other gover nment entities such as counties. An IGT Entity may fund DSRIP, Uncompensated Ca re (UC), or both DSRIP and UC as long as regional requirements are met, as described in Section VI \"Disburseme nt of DSRIP Funds\" and the IGT funding source comports with federal requirements outlined in paragraph 55 of the waiver's special terms and conditions. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 396 of 454 IGT Entities may fund DSRIP projects outside of their RHP Region. Such a DSRIP project must be documented in the RHP Plan where the Perf orming Provider implementing the DSRIP project is physically located, with a few exceptions described in 7 below. 8. Performing Providers Providers that are responsible for performing a project in an RHP Plan are called \"Performing Providers.\" All Performing Providers must ha ve a current Medicaid provider identification number. Performing Providers that complete RHP project mileston es and measures as specified in Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\" are the only entities that are eligible to receive DSRIP incentive payments in DYs 2-5. Performing Prov iders will primarily be hospitals, but CMHCs, local health departments, physician practice plan s affiliated with an academic health science center, and other types of providers approved by the State and CMS may also receive DSRIP payments. Physician practices plans not affiliated with an academic health science center may also be eligible as Performing Providers under the \"Pass 2\" methodology as described in paragraph 29.d. A Performing Provider may only participate in the RHP Plan where it is physically located except that physician practice plans affiliated wi th an academic health science center, major cancer hospitals, or children's hospitals may perform projects outside of the region where the Performing Provider's institution is physically locat ed if it receives an allocation from that region in accordance with the process described in paragraph 29. In these cases, the project must be included in the RHP Plan where the DSRI P project is implemented. All related DSRIP payments for the project(s) are counted against th e allocation of that RHP Plan as specified in Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". 9. DSRIP and Uncompensated Care Pool a. UC Pool Description STC 44 establishes an Uncompensated Care Pool to help defray uncompensated care costs provided to Medicaid eligibles or to individuals who have no source of third party coverage, for services provided by hospitals or other selected providers. b. DSRIP Requirements for UC Pool Program Participants Hospitals that receive payments from the Unco mpensated Care Pool shall participate in the RHP and be required to report on a subset of Ca tegory 4 measures from Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\". The subset of Category 4 measures fall in to 3 domains: (1) Potentially Preventable Admissions (PPAs); (2) Potentially Preventable Readmissions (PPRs) and (3) Potentially Preventable Complications (PPCs). Category 4 reporting shall begin in DY 3 for the PPA and PPR domains, and in DY 4 for th e PPC domain and continue through DY 5. Hospitals that only participate in UC shall not be eligible to re ceive DSRIP funding for required Category 4 reporting. If a hospita l fails to report on all required Category 4 measures by the last quarter of the applicable Demonstration Year, the hospital shall forfeit Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 397 of 454 one fourth of its total UC payments for that DY. A hospital may request from HHSC a 6- month extension from the end of the DY to re port any outstanding Category 4 measures. The fourth-quarter UC payment will be made upon completion of the outstanding required Category 4 measure reports within the 6-mont h period. A hospital may receive only one 6- month extension to complete Category 4 reporting for each demonstration year. This requirement shall apply to all UC particip ating hospitals, includ ing hospital Performing Providers that are fully particip ating in DSRIP. Hospitals that meet the criteria described in paragraph 11.f below are exempt from this requirement. UC hospital participants shall also participate in learning co llaboratives conducted annually during DYs 3-5 to share learni ng, experiences, and best practices acquired from the DSRIP program across the State. VI. KEY ELEMENTS OF PR OPOSED RHP PLANS 10. RHP Plans Each RHP must submit an RHP Plan using a State- approved template that identifies the projects, objectives, and specific milestones, metrics, me asures, and associated DSRIP values adopted from Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\" an d meet all requirements pursuant to STCs 45 and 46. The project and DSRIP payments are docume nted in the RHP Plan where the Performing Provider of the DSRIP project is physically located. An excepti on applies to projects performed by physician practice plans affiliated with an acad emic health science center, major cancer hospitals, or children's hospitals in locations outside of the RHP region where these Performing Providers are physically located (as discussed in paragraph 7 above). In these cases, the project must be documented in the RHP Plan wh ere the DSRIP project is implemented.

General Requirements for Categories 1 -4 Pursuant to Attachment I, RHP Planning Prot ocol, an RHP Plan mu st meet the following requirements: i. RHPs must select a minimu m number of projects from Categories 1 and 2. The number of minimum projects will diffe r for RHPs depending on their Tier classification (defined below). An RHP's Tier classification is displayed in Table 1 of Section VI \"Disburse ment of DSRIP Funds\"; ii. Both hospital-based and non-hospital Perf orming Providers must establish outcomes in Category 3 that tie back to th eir Category 1 and 2 projects; and iii. Hospital-based Performing Providers must report on the population-focused improvement measures across five domains identified in Category 4. Certain hospital Performing Provide rs defined in 11.f below shall be exempt from selected requirements. b. RHP Tier Definition i. Tier 1 RHP An RHP that contains more than 15 per cent share of the st atewide population under 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL ) as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: 2006-2010 American Community Survey for Texas (ACS). ii. Tier 2 RHP An RHP that contains at least 7 percent and less than 15 percent share of the statewide population under 200 percent FPL as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: 2006-2010 American Community Survey for Texas (ACS). iii. Tier 3 RHP An RHP that contains at least 3 percent a nd less than 7 percent share of the statewide population under 200 percent FPL as defi ned by the U.S. Census Bureau: 2006-2010 American Community Survey for Texas (ACS). iv.

Categories 1 and 2 Projects i. Tier 1 RHP A Tier 1 RHP must select a minimum of 20 projects from Categories 1 and 2 combined, with at least 10 of the 20 projec ts selected from Category 2, in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protoc ol\", which lists the acceptable projects, milestones, metrics, and data sources. ii. Tier 2 RHP A Tier 2 RHP must select a minimum of 12 projects from Categories 1 and 2 combined, with at least 6 of the 12 projects selected from Category 2, in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protoc ol\", which lists the acceptable projects, milestones, metrics, and data sources. iii. Tier 3 RHP A Tier 3 RHP must select a minimum of 8 projects from Categories 1 and 2 combined, with at least 4 of the 8 projects selected from Category 2, in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Prot ocol, which lists the acceptable projects, milestones, metrics, and data sources. iv. Tier 4 RHP A Tier 4 RHP must select a minimum of 4 projects from Categories 1 and 2 combined, with at least 2 of the 4 projects selected from Category 2, in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protoc ol\", which lists the acceptable projects, milestones, metrics, and data sources. v. Performing Provider Participat ion in Categories 1 and 2 1. A Performing Provider in an RHP Plan mu st, at a minimum, participate in a project(s) from either Category 1 or Category 2, and if it chooses to, may participate in projects from both Categories; 2. The RHP Plan must explain how incentive payments to Performing Providers that perform a similar DSRIP project are not duplicative. For example, if two Performing Providers offer diabetes diseas e management, they must describe how the projects are serving di fferent patients; and 3. The RHP Plan must explain how incentive payments do not duplicate funding for activities of federa l initiatives funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. d. Category 3: Outcome Re porting and Improvements i. For each of its Category 1 and 2 projects, every Performing Provider must have one or more related Category 3 outcomes. Th e outcomes shall assess the results of care Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 401 of 454 experienced by patients, includ ing patients' clinical even ts, patients' recovery and health status, patients' experi ences in the health system, and efficiency/cost. A single Category 3 outcome may tie back to more than one project in Categories 1 or 2 implemented by the Performing Provider. Al l Category 3 outcomes must be reported to specifications as outlined in the RH P Planning Protocol (and the compendium, which contains specifications for each outcome). ii. Performing Providers shall report on outcome improvement over baseline in DY 4 and DY 5. In DYs 2 and 3, Performing Pr oviders may undertake actions/steps to establish baselines and prepare for outcome reporting in DYs 4 and 5. These preparatory activities will be reflected as process milestones in the RHP Plan. a. A hospital Performing Provider shall iden tify the outcome(s) it has selected for its Category 1 and 2 projects in the RHP Plan. Such baselines must be established for no later than DY 3. b. A non-hospital Performing Provider may defer identifying outcomes for its Category 1 and 2 projects until a date defined by HHSC, at which point new, approved outcomes shall be added to the RHP Planning Protocol and incorporated into the RHP Plan. A non-hospital Performing Provider must complete establishment of baselines for its selected outcomes for no later than DY 3. c. Each Performing Provider shall have the opportunity during DY 3, based on the revised RHP Planning Pr otocol and Category 3 framework, to modify the outcome(s) previously selected for its Category 1 and 2 projects, in a manner specified by HHSC. d. If the provider's baseline (DY 3) performance on a Category 3 measure exceeds their DY 5 target, the provider must either increase the DY 5 target to exceed their baseline performance or add an alternate improvement activity, as described in the RH P Planning Protocol. e. Category 4 \"Pay for Reporting\" Measures Pursuant to STC 45(d)(ii)(A), all hospital-based Performing Providers in all RHPs must report on all common Category 4 measures. A Performing Provider may also choose to report on additional optional measures. In acco rdance with this requirement, beginning in DY 3 (FFY 14) and DY 4 (FFY 15) hospital-base d Performing Providers in all RHPs must include reporting of all co mmon domains, pursuant to Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\". Hospitals defined under paragraph 11.f are exempt from reporting Category 4 measures. If an exempted hospital elects to re port Category 4, then it shall report on all common Category 4 measures and be held to th e same requirements as all other Performing Providers participating in Category 4. If a hospital-based Performi ng Provider's population for a given measure is not sufficiently large to produce statistically va lid data, the hospital shall not be required to report the data for th at particular Category 4 measure. HHSC will collect all Category 4 data for each hospital. Where limited by Texas statutory requirements Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 402 of 454 pertaining to the confidentiality of individual hospital data for some of the Category 4 measures, HHSC will summarize certain data related to Category 4 for CMS at the RHP level rather than at the indivi dual provider level. f. Hospital Exemption DSRIP hospitals that meet the criteria below and as approved by the State are exempt from implementing Category 4 reporting in paragraph 11.e of this section. Definition: A hospital is not a state -owned hospital or a hospital that is managed or directly or indirectly owned by an individual, associa tion, partnership, corpor ation, or other legal entity that owns or manages one or more other hospitals and: (1) is located in a county th at has a population estimated by the United States Bureau of the Census to be not more than 35,000 as of July 1 of the most recent year for which county population estimates ha ve been published; or (2) is located in a county that has a population of more than 35,000, but that does not have more than 100 licensed hospital beds a nd is not located in an area that is delineated as an urbanized area by the United States Bureau of the Census. 13. Organization of DSRIP Projects a. Categories 1 -4 Descriptions The RHP five-year plan will include sections on each of the 4 categories as specified in the RHP Planning Protocol. They include: i. Category 1 Infrastructure Development la ys the foundation for delivery system transformation through investments in tec hnology, tools, and human resources that will strengthen the ability of providers to serve populations and continuously improve services. ii. Category 2 Program Innovation and Redesi gn includes the pilo ting, testing, and replicating of innovative care models. iii. Category 3 Quality Improvements includes outcome reporting and improvements in care that can be achieved within four years. iv. Category 4 Population Focused Improvement s is the reporting of measures that demonstrate the impact of delivery syst em reform investments under the waiver. b. Categories 1-2 Requirements For each project selected from Category 1 and 2, RHP Plans must include a narrative that includes the following subsections: i. Identifying Information Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 403 of 454 Identification of the DSRIP Category, name of the project, project element, and RHP Performing Provider name and Texas Provi der Identifier (TPI) involved with the project. Each project shall be implem ented by one Performing Provider only. ii. Project Goal The goal(s) for the project, which describes the challenges or issues of the Performing Provider and brief description of the major delivery system solution identified to address those challenges by implementing the particular project; th e starting point of the Performing Provider related to the project and based on that, the 5-year expected outcome for the Performing Pr ovider and the patients. iii. Rationale As part of this subsection, each Performing Provider will provide the reasons for selecting the project, milestones, and metrics based on relevancy to the RHP's population and circumstances, community need , and RHP priority and starting point with available baseline data, as well as a description of how the project represents a new initiative for the Performing Provider or significantly enhances an existing initiative, including any initia tives that may have related activities that are funded by the U.S. Department of H ealth and Human Services. iii. Relationship to Other Projects and Measures A description of how this proj ect supports, reinforces, enable s, and is related to other Category 1 and 2 projects, Category 3 out comes, and Category 4 population-focused improvement measures within the RHP Plan iv. Milestones and Metrics Table For each project, RHP Plans shall include milestones and metrics adopted in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planni ng Protocol.\" In a table format, the RHP Plan will indicate by demonstration year when project milestones will be achieved and indicate the data source that will be used to document and verify achievement. 1. For each project from Category 1 and 2, th e Performing Provider must include at least 1 milestone based on a Process Mile stone and at least 1 milestone based on an Improvement Milestone over the 4-year period in accordance with Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol.\" 2. For each project from Category 1 and 2, th e Performing Provider must include at least 1 milestone that reflects the qua ntifiable patient impact (number of additional individuals served or encounters provided) of the project in DY 5. The 3-year projects, which are referenced in paragraph 18, also must contain a quantifiable patient impact milestone in DY 4. For certain projects, as specified by CMS and HHSC, these milestones also must include the quantifiable patient impact specific to the Medicaid a nd low-income uninsured populations. 3. For each milestone, the estimated DSRI P funding must be identified as the maximum amount that can be received for achieving the milestone. For each year, the estimated available non-federal share must be included and the source (IGT Entity) of non-federal share identified. c. Category 3 Requirements Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 404 of 454 This focus area involves outcomes associated with Categories 1 and 2 projects. All Performing Providers (both hospi tal and non-hospital providers) sh all select outcomes that tie back to their projects in Categorie s 1 and 2. RHP Plans must include: Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 405 of 454 i. Identifying Information Identification of the Category 3 outcome and RHP Performing Provider name and Texas Provider Identifier that is reporting the outcome. ii. Narrative Description In the associated Category 1 or 2 proj ect, a brief narrative description of each Category 3 outcome selected for the project. iii. Category 3 Selection Information A summary of Category 3 outcome selection information for all DSRIP providers in an RHP shall be included as an attachment to the plan. 1. For each outcome, in DY 2 the RHP Plan may include process milestones described in 11.d.ii above that suppor t the development of the outcome. For October 2013 DY 2 reporting, HHSC and CMS allowed a status upd ate to meet the requirements for DY 2 Category 3 process milestones given that CMS and HHSC had not finalized the revised Category 3 framework and outcome s options as of the end of DY 2. 2. For each outcome, the RHP Plan will in clude two process milestones for each outcome in DY 3 - one for providing a st atus update on a template specified by HHSC once Category 3 outcomes are re-selecte d in DY 3, and one for establishing or verifying the provider's baseline for th e outcome upon which improvement will be measured. 3. In DY 4 and DY 5 each outcome will have one or two milestones depending on whether the outcome is designated as a pa y for performance (P4P) outcome or pay for reporting (P4R) outcome in the RHP Planni ng Protocol. These milestones may be process or achievement milestones depending on the specific outcome measure. See paragraph 32 and the RHP Planni ng Protocol for further details. 4. For each milestone, the estimated DSRIP f unding must be identified as the maximum amount for achieving the milestone. For each year, the estimated non-federal share must be included and the source (IGT Entity) of non-federal share identified. d. Category 4 Requirements This focus area involves population-focused im provements associated with Categories 1 and 2 projects and Category 3 outcomes. Each hospital-based Performing Provider shall report on all common measures pursuant to Attachment I, \"RHP Pla nning Protocol\". RHP Plans must include: i. Identifying information Identification of the DSRIP Category 4 m easures and RHP Performing Provider name and Texas Provider Identifier (TPI) that is reporting the measure. ii. Narrative description A narrative description of the Category 4 measures. iii. Table Presentation In a table format, the RHP Plan will in clude, starting in dem onstration year 3: Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 406 of 454 1. List of Category 4 measures the Perfor ming Provider will report on by domain; 2. For each measure, the estimated DSRI P funding must be identified as the maximum amount that can be received for reporting on the measure. For each year, the estimated available non-federal sh are must be included and the source of non-federal share identified. e. Project Valuation The RHP Plan shall contain a narrative that describes the overall re gional and individual project approach for valuing each project a nd rationale, including an explanation why a similar project selected by two Performing Pr oviders might have diffe rent valuations (e.g., due to project size, provider size, project scope, populations se rved, community benefit, cost avoidance, and addressing priority community n eeds). Project valuations must comply with requirements prescribed in Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". In addition, the value of a f our-year Category 1 or Category 2 project may not exceed the greater of 10 percent of the Performing Provide r's Pass 1 allocation (described in paragraph 29.c) or $20 million in total over DYs 2-5. For pr ojects that represent collaboration across more than one Performing Provider as descri bed in paragraph 29.c.iii and iv, the total maximum value may not exceed the greater of the sum of 10 percent of each Performing Provider's Pass 1 allocation for each Performing Pr ovider that is collaborating in the project or $20 million in total over DYs 2-5. The valu e of a three-year project may not exceed $20 million in total for Categories 1-3 for DYs 3-5. VII. STATE AND FEDERA L REVIEW PROCESS OF RHP PLANS 14. Review Process HHSC will review all 5-year RHP Plan proposals prior to submission to CMS for final approval according to the schedule below. The HHSC and CMS review process for 5-year RHP Plan proposals shall include the following schedule: 15. HHSC Review and Approval Process a. Pre-Submission Review of RHP Plans To support HHSC's review process, the RHP Anchoring Entity shall perform an initial review of the RHP Plan to ensure compliance with elements described in b. below and with the RHP Plan Checklist, prior to submitting the plan to HHSC. b. HHSC Review of Plans Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 407 of 454 i. Between September 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012, each RHP identified in paragraph 4 will submit a 5-year RHP Plan to HHSC for review. HHSC shall review and assess each plan according to the following criteria using the RHP Plan Checklist: The plan is in the format and contains all required elements described herein and is consistent with special terms and conditions, including STCs 45(a), 45(b), 45(c), and 45(d)(iii). The plan conforms to the requirements for Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4, as described in Section III \"Key Elements of Propos ed RHP Plans\", Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\", and \"RHP Plan Checklist.\" Category 1 and 2 projects clearly identify goals, milestones, metrics, and expected results, including quantifiable patient im pact appropriate to the project option. Category 3 clearly identifies the outcome s to be reported. Category 4 clearly identifies the population-focused health improvement measures to be reported. The amount and distribution of funding is in accordance with th e stipulations of STC 46 and Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\" of this protocol. The plan and all of the projects within ar e consistent with the overall goals of the DSRIP program and the objectives of the Medicaid program. ii. Within 30 days of initial, complete RH P Plan submission, HHSC will complete its initial review of each ti mely submitted RHP Plan proposal using the RHP Plan Checklist and based on the Program Fundi ng and Mechanics Protocol and RHP Planning Protocol and will notify the RHP Anchoring Entity in writing of any questions or concerns identified. iii. The Anchoring Entity shall respond in writing to any notification by HHSC of questions or concerns. The RHP's responses must be received by the date specified in the aforementioned notification. The RH P Anchoring Entity's initial response may consist of a request for additional time to address HHSC's comments provided that the RHP's revised plan addresses HHSC' s comments and is submitted to HHSC within 15 days of the notification. c. HHSC Approval of Plans HHSC will take action on each timely submitted RHP Plan, will approve each plan that it deems meets the criteria outlined in Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\", Attachment J, \"Program and Funding Protocol\", and \"RHP Pl an Checklist\" and submit approved plans to CMS for final consideration. HHS C may approve a plan for subm ission to CMS that requires technical corrections when ther e is substantial compliance with the above criteria and HHSC notifies CMS of the priority technical corrections that ne ed to be made. 16. CMS Review Process for initial RHP plan submissions CMS will review an RHP's 5-year RHP Plan upon receipt of the plan as approved by HHSC. Plans reviewed and approved by HHSC will result in a decision by CMS within 45 days of receipt of an HHSC-approved plan. Plan(s) must meet all criteria outl ined in paragraph 14.b.i above. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 408 of 454 CMS will review RHP plans in a phased process th at will allow providers to begin working on their DSRIP projects in DY 2 and 3 (\"Initial Appr oval\") while the issues in subparagraph c. of this paragraph are resolved in order to allow providers to continue working on their DSRIP projects in DY 4 and 5 (\"Full Approval\"). a. CMS Initial Approval Within 45 days of receipt of the State-approve d RHP Plan and RHP Plan Checklist from HHSC, CMS will complete its overall review of the RHP Plan and will either: Approve the plan; or Notify HHSC and the Anchoring Entity if initial a pproval will not be granted for all of, or a component of, the RHP Plan. For example, CM S may approve a project in the plan but not approve the project valu ation if it does not comport with Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". Notice to the State will be in writing an d will include any questions, concerns, or issues identified in the application. Receipt of initial approval constitutes recognition that the requirements of paragraph 29.a-d were met at the time of the full RHP Plan submission as of December 31, 2012. An RHP may revise a plan for a ny components of the plan identif ied by CMS as not approvable. After the revisions are determined to be accep table by HHSC, HHSC shall submit the revisions to CMS and CMS shall initially approve or deny th e revisions (in whole or in part) in writing to HHSC by May 1, 2013 or within 15 days of receipt of the revisions, wh ichever is later. If a provider submits an alternative project fo r review during the plan revision process, HHSC and CMS shall review the project in accordance w ith the timeline for new RHP Plan submissions (e.g. CMS has 45 days for initial review and 15 days for review of revisions). With initial approval, if a project does not requir e priority technical corrections, the project is eligible to earn DY 2 and DY 3 payments. If a pr oject requires priority technical corrections, the project is eligible to earn DY 2 payments with initial approval but th e necessary priority technical corrections must be appr oved in order to be eligible to earn DY 3 payments. Initially approved projects must also meet the requirement s of paragraphs 30 and 31 in order to receive DSRIP payments. b. Priority Technical Corrections HHSC or CMS may require an RHP to submit priority technical corre ctions to an RHP Plan that receives initial approval. Possible prio rity technical corrections include: Hospital provider Category 3 outcome does not meet criteria for one standalone or three non-standalone measures. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 409 of 454 Provider did not include at least one process milestone and one improvement milestone. Category 3 outcome duplicates an improvement milestone. All project components, if required, we re not included in the narrative or milestones. Project lacks clearly defined milestones and metrics, including the lack of a quantifiable patient impact milestone fo r DYs 4 and 5, as required by paragraph 14.b.i. Any other priority technical correction CMS specifies for a project in the RHP Plan initial approval letter. Any other priority tec hnical correction identifi ed by HHSC, including any identified by HHSC subsequent to the RHP Plan initial approval letter, that is needed to clarify a Category 1 or 2 proj ect or Category 3 outcome in order to make payment, such as clearly defined milestones and metrics. These changes must be submitted to HHSC for review by no later than October 1, 2013 or such later date as specified by HHSC or CMS. HHSC, in collaboration with CMS, will work with the provider to refine the submitted priority technica l corrections as needed for approval no later than March 31, 2014. DSRIP payment for a project for DY 3 may be withheld until the necessary priority technical co rrections are approved (and a ll other requirements for DSRIP payment described in paragr aphs 30 and 31 are met). c. CMS Full Approval CMS may require an RHP to submit additional revisi ons to the plan to receive full approval, as specified in the RHP Plan initial approval letter. Full a pproval is necessary for a project to be eligible for DY 4 and 5 DSRIP funding, except that ii. of this subparagraph only applies to DY 4 and 5 DSRIP funding for Category 3. HHSC will re view all revisions submitted prior to CMS review and final consideration, consistent with the process for review of plan modifications, described in paragraph 32.d. Fully approved pr ojects must also meet the requirements of paragraph 30 and 31 in order to receive DSRIP payments. In addition to any project-specifi c revisions requested in the RHP Plan initial approval letter, all RHPs will be required to submit the following revi sions, as applicable, in order to receive full approval for the plan. i. Valuation that is consistent with project impact Using an objective methodology developed with HHSC, CMS will determine whether the information submitted on each project's impact suffi ciently justifies each project's value for DYs 4 and 5. Any outlier project values identified by HHSC or CMS will be reviewed by the state's independent assessor as part of the mid-point assessment. The assessor will make recommendations to HHSC, and if HHSC's d ecision differs from the recommendations, HHSC will consult CMS to establish the DY4-5 project value. Projects that receive valuation approval Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 410 of 454 for DYs 4 and 5 through this process may still be subject to a DY 4 and 5 modification during the mid-point assessment, including adjustments to metrics or valuation, if the performance of the project substantially deviat es from what was approved. ii. Category 3 framework for DY 4 and 5 Recognizing the complexity of setting Categor y 3 outcome targets, CMS and HHSC will jointly develop a standard target setting methodology fo r Category 3 outcomes no later than February 28, 2014 that will apply prospectively to Category 3 achievement milestones for DYs 4 and 5 for all projects. This methodology will rec ognize the demonstration's focus on the Medicaid/uninsured populations and the differing baselines for different providers and will use appropriate benchmarks (where applicable) to set targets for meaningful improvement. The methodology also will recognize th e innovative nature of certai n projects, as well as data limitations and data sharing issues for certain types of performing providers, including non- hospital providers. Providers will be required to us e this standard methodology to se t their Category 3 achievement targets in DYs 4 and 5 unless they provide a compel ling justification to use a different target that is approved by HHSC based on statis tically justifiable inconsistencies with the target setting benchmark used, including differences in the re lative size of the Category 1 or 2 project and reporting specifications of the measure. If providers have already submitted Category 3 improvement targets for DYs 4 and 5 to CMS in th e initial approval process, they should replace their previous targets with ne w targets based on the standard target setting methodology. Providers will have the opportunity by October 2014 to request to use an achievement target other than the standard methodology. The indepe ndent assessor will provide recommendations to HHSC in cases where providers request to use a different target. HHSC will need to approve the use of a different target that is not ba sed on the standard target setting methodology. Category 3 process or achievement milestone information for DYs 4 and 5 must be submitted to be eligible for payment of Category 3 outcome measures for DYs 4 and 5 (in addition to all requirements for DSRIP payment described in pa ragraphs 30 and 31). HHSC will work with RHPs to submit Category 3 outcomes once the sta ndard target setting methodology is developed and to refine outcomes as needed in October 2014. 17. Post-approval Public Engagement and Ongoing Monitoring After receiving initial CMS approval of an RHP Plan, the RHP shall conduct a post-award implementation forum with stakeholders, including those described in paragraph 10.d, in order to promote shared learning and continued alignmen t with community goals. The feedback from these post-award forums shall be summarized in HHSC's annual demonstration report and should help inform the development of more r obust quality improvement infrastructure for the region that can support the learning collaborative plan for each re gion, as described below and in the appendix to the RH P Planning Protocol. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 411 of 454 On each RHP's website, the RHP Anchoring En tity will publicly post a copy of the most recently approved RHP plan as well as any pendi ng plan modifications that have been submitted to HHSC for review. The RHP websites will also provide for an opportunity for public comment. In order to monitor the implementation of DS RIP activities and support shared learning, RHPs shall submit semi-annual progress reports to HHSC and CMS in a standardized format jointly agreed upon by HHSC and CMS. If semi-annua l reports are not submitted on time or do not meet the requirements of the reporting, future DSRIP payments may be withheld until the complete report is submitted (and all other requirements for DSRIP payment described in paragraphs 30 and 31 are met). HHSC shall provide overall programma tic reporting in the demonstration's quarterly and annual reports for all RHPs combined. 18. Learning Collaborative Plans Recognizing the importance of learning colla boratives in supporti ng continuous quality improvement, RHPs will submit learning collab orative plans by October 1, 2013, to reflect opportunities and requirements for shared lear ning among the approved DS RIP projects in the region. Specifically, there should be a coherent discussion of providers ' participation in a learning collaborative that is strongly associ ated with their projects and demonstrates a commitment to collaborative learning that is designed to accelerate progress and mid-course correction to achieve the goals of the projects and to make significant improvement in the Category 3 outcome measures and the Cate gory 4 population health reporting measures. Tier 4 RHPs may submit, for HHSC and CMS review, a request not to conduct their own regional learning collaborative if th ey have a compelling justification, such as if they do not have the administrative capacity to do so. They also mu st submit their plan to actively participate in the statewide learning collaborative referenced in paragraph 8.b a nd any plans to participate in other RHPs' learning collaboratives , which is strongly encouraged. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 412 of 454 19. Review and Approval Process for Three-Year DSRIP Projects By December 2013, using DY 3-5 DSRIP funds not yet allocated to DSRIP projects, each RHP may submit additional proposed three-year DS RIP projects for HHSC and CMS review and approval. Based on the criteria established in paragraph 14, HHSC will work with the RHPs and the Performing Provider of each proposed three-y ear project to get the projects ready for CMS submission. HHSC will take action on each project that it deems meets the criteria outlined in the \"RHP Plan Checklist\" and submit approved pl ans to CMS for initial consideration during a 45-day CMS review process. If a three-year project subm itted by HHSC is not initially ap proved by CMS prior to May 31, 2014 during CMS's 45-day review, then HHSC rather than CMS will notify RHPs of subsequent approvals as appropriate. Provider will have a one-time opportunity to revise projects that were not initially approved by CMS by a date spec ified by HHSC. HHSC, and the independent assessor will review thes e projects to ensure compliance with the \"RHP Plan Checklist.\" HHSC will notify CMS of the HHSC approved projects, and provide CMS an opportunity for secondary review within 30 days, if requestedby CMS.. 20. Mid-Point Assessment By the end of 2014, an independent assessor (a lso known as the compliance monitor) will work with HHSC to conduct a transpar ent mid-point assessment of all RHPs using CMS-approved criteria. This review will provide an opportunity to modify projects and/or metrics in consideration of learning and new evidence. The independent assessor will review certain projects identified by HHSC, CMS or the entity based on informa tion provided for all projects in semi-annual reports for the following elements: Compliance with the approved RHP plan, includi ng the elements described in the project narrative. Compliance with the required core component s described in the RH P Planning Protocol, including continuous quality improvement activities. Non-duplication of Federal funds. The clarity of the improvement milestones for DYs 4 and 5 and their connection with actual project activities and meani ngful, quantifiable patient im pact. A clear improvement milestone should be supported by a coherent and comprehensive project description that clearly describes the relationship between the go als, the interventions and the measures of progress and outcome. The benefit of the project to the Medicaid and uninsured pop ulation and to the health outcomes of all patients served by the projec t (examples include number of readmissions, potentially preventable admissions, or adverse even ts that will be prevented by the project in DY 4 and DY 5). Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 413 of 454 The opportunity to continue to improve the pr oject by applying any lesso ns learned or best practices that can increase the likelihood of the project advancing the triple aim. Based on the recommendations by the indepe ndent assessor, HHSC or CMS may require prospective plan modifications that would be e ffective for DYs 4 and 5, including adjustments to project metrics or valuation, if the performance of th e project has substantially deviated from what was approved Based on additional DS RIP compliance monitoring conducted by the independent assessor after the mid-point asse ssment is completed, HHSC or CMS also may require prospective plan modifica tions to be effective for DY 5. HHSC will submit to CMS, on or before Septem ber 1, 2013, draft review criteria, a description of its approach to review, and a draft DSRIP Plan Checklist that will reflect the approved criteria and will be used in the assessment. CMS w ill provide comments within 60 days of HHSC's submission. CMS and HHSC will work collabora tively to refine the criteria, approach, and DSRIP Plan Checklist. HHSC will apply these cr iteria to ensure that DSRIP projects are thoroughly and consistently reviewed. Where po ssible, HHSC will notify providers in advance of the mid-point assessment if providers need to make changes in order to comply with the approved review criteria. HHSC will review all modifications resulting from the mid-point, consistent with the process for review of plan modifications, described in pa ragraph 32.d. Future DSRIP payment for a provider may be withheld until the necessary changes as identified by the mid-point assessment are submitted (and all other requirements for DSRIP pa yment described in paragraphs 30 and 31 are met). 21. Revisions to the RHP Planning Protocol If the CMS review process of RHP Plans results in the modifi cation of any component of an RHP's plan, including but not limited to projects, milestones, measures, metrics, or data sources, that was not originally include in the RHP Planning Protocol, Texa s may revise the RHP Planning Protocol accordingly. CMS will review and approve these proposed revisions within 30 days of submission by HHSC, provided that the RHP Planning Protoc ol revisions are in accordance with the final approved RHP Plan(s) pr ompting the revision(s) and all applicable STC requirements. Such revisions to the RH P Planning Protocol do not require a waiver amendment. VIII. RHP AND STATE REPORT ING REQUIREMENTS 22. RHP Reporting for Payment in DY 1 a. RHP Plan Submission Submission of a State-approved RHP Plan to CM S shall serve as the basis for the full DY 1 presumptive payment to that RHP's Perf orming Providers and Anchoring Entity as prescribed by Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 414 of 454 b. RHP Plans Not Approved by CMS on or after May 1, 2013 All Performing Providers and Anchoring Enti ties in an RHP whose RHP Plan is not approved in full by CMS shall be at risk fo r recoupment of their entire DY 1 incentive payment related to plan submission. Within 10 business days of CMS written denial of an RHP Plan, the State shall recoup the DY 1 payment from all eligible enti ties in the affected RHP and promptly return the associated FFP to CMS. If an RHP deletes a project without a replacement to obtain CMS approval of the RHP Plan, the State shall recoup the DY 1 payment from the entities that received funding for that proj ect and promptly return the associated FFP to CMS. 23. RHP Reporting for Payment in DYs 2-5 Two times per year, Performing Providers seek ing payment under the DSRIP program shall submit reports to HHSC demonstrating progress on each of their projects as measured by category-specific milestones and metrics achieve d during the reporting period. The reports shall be submitted using the standardized reporti ng form approved by HHSC. IGT Entities will review the submission of the reported performance. Based on the reports, HHSC will calculate the incentive payments for the progress achieved in accordance with Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". The Performi ng Provider shall have available for review by Texas or CMS, upon request, all supporting data and back-up docu mentation. These reports will be due as indicated below after the e nd of each reporting period: Reporting period of October 1 through March 31: the reporting and request for payment is due April 30. Reporting period of April 1 through September 30: the reporting and request for payment is due October 31. These reports will serve as the basis for authoriz ing incentive payments to Performing Providers in an RHP for achievement of DSRIP milestone s. HHSC and CMS concurrently shall have 30 days to review and approve or request additiona l information regarding the data reported for each milestone/metric and measure. If additional information is requested, the Performing Provider shall respond to the request within 15 days a nd both HHSC and CMS shall have an additional 15 days to review, approve, or deny the request fo r payment, based on the data provided. HHSC shall schedule the payment transaction for each RHP Performing Provider within 30 days following CMS and HHSC approval of th e Performing Provider's RHP report. HHSC and CMS may determine that a subset of not less than half of the projects and metrics will be reviewed during the 30 days after the repo rting period. In such instances, HHSC and CMS will designate those projects and metrics that are not reviewed within 30 days as \"provisionally approved.\" Such \"provisionally ap proved\" projects and metrics will be reviewed in full by HHSC prior to the next reporting due date. HHSC will report back to CMS which projects were reviewed by the end of the initia l 30 day review period and which pr ojects will be reviewed prior to the next reporting cycle due date. When all reports have been reviewed, HHSC will submit to CMS a report with the results of completed revi ews and assurance that all reviews have been completed. CMS will review projects and metrics judiciously as it deems necessary. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 415 of 454 For metrics that are \"provisionally approved\" the Performing Provider will receive full DSRIP payment. After review of any \"provisionally a pproved\" item, additional information regarding the data reported for each milestone/metric w ill be requested if necessary. If the initial supporting documentation, and any additional info rmation, does not form a sufficient basis for actual metric achievement, HHSC will recoup the associated overpayments from the Performing Provider. If the Performing Provider does not co mply with the recoupment, the overpayment amount will be deducted from future Medicaid payments. HHSC will notify CMS of any cases where the initial supporting documentation and a dditional information does not form a sufficient basis for metric achievement and the outcome of recouping the payments or withholding future payments. 24. Intergovernmental Transfer Process HHSC will calculate the nonfederal share amount to be transferred by an IGT Entity in order to draw the federal funding for the incentive payments related to the milestone achievement that is reported by the Performing Provider in accordance with paragraph 22 and approved by the IGT Entity and the State. Within 14 days after notification by HHSC of the identified nonfederal share amount, the IGT Entity will make an intergove rnmental transfer of funds. The State will draw the federal funding and pay both the nonfederal and federal shares of the incentive payment to the Performing Provider. If the IGT is made within the appropriate 14-day timeframe, the incentive payment will be disbursed within 30 days. The total computable incentive payment must remain with the Performing Provider. At the time that HHSC requests IGT funding for DSRIP incentive payments, the state may also require the IGT Entity to transfer additional funds to provide a portion of the non-federal share of the state's administrative costs related to waiv er monitoring activities, as permitted under the state plan. 25. RHP Annual Year End Report Each RHP Anchoring Entity shall submit an annua l report by December 15 following the end of Demonstration Years 2-5. The annual report shall be prepared a nd submitted using the standardized reporting form approved by HHSC. The report will include information provided in the interim reports previously submitted fo r the Demonstration Year, including data on the progress made for all metrics. Additionally, the RHP will provide a narrative description of the progress made, lessons learned, challenges faced, and other pertinent findings. 26. Texas Reporting to CMS a. Quarterly and Annual Reporting Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 416 of 454 DSRIP will be a component of the State's qu arterly operational reports and annual reports related to the Demonstration. These reports will include: i. All DSRIP payments made to Performing Pr oviders that occurred in the quarter as required in the quarterly paymen t report pursuant to STC 43(b); ii. Expenditure projections reflecting the expect ed pace of future disbursements for each RHP and Performing Providers; iii. A summary assessment of each RHP's DS RIP activities during the given period including progress on milestones; and iv. Evaluation activities and interim findings for the evaluation design pursuant to STC 68. b. Claiming Federal Financial Participation Texas will claim federal financial participat ion (FFP) for DSRIP incentive payments on the CMS 64.9 waiver form. FFP will be available only for DSRIP payments made in accordance with all pertinent STCs and Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\" and Attachment J, \"Program Funding and Mechanics Pr otocol\". All RHP Plans are subject to potential audits, including review by the indepe ndent assessor during the mid- point assessment and ongoing compliance monitoring. The Performing Providers shall have availabl e for review by HHSC and CMS, upon request, all supporting data and back-up documentation evidencing performance as described under an RHP Plan fo r DSRIP incentive payments. Failure of the Performing Provider to maintain adequate docum entation or inaccurate reporting of data may result in recoupment of DSRIP payments, in cluding based on findings of the independent assessor. IX. DISBURSEMENT OF DSRIP FUNDS 27. DSRIP Allocation Methodology to RHPs in DYs 1-5 a. Initial DSRIP Allocation For Demonstration Years 1-5, DSRIP funding am ounts identified in Table 6 of Waiver STC 46 shall be allocated to RHPs according to a fo rmula that takes into account the RHP's role in the safety net system. RHPs that shoulde r a larger burden of Medicaid care and serve a larger share of low-income populations shall be allocated a higher shar e of DSRIP funds. The goal of this approach is to en sure that delivery system reforms under DSRIP have the greatest impact on Medicaid and low-income populations. The following variables were selected as proxies for measuring an RHP's participat ion in Medicaid and serving low-income populations: i. Percent of State population with income below 200% FPL residing in the RHP Region (Source: U.S. Census Bureau: 2006-2010 American Community Survey for Texas). An RHP's percentage was calculat ed by dividing the number of low-income individuals with income below 200% FPL in the RHP Region by the total number of low-income individuals in the Stat e with income below 200% FPL. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 417 of 454 ii. Percent of Texas Medicaid acute care payments in SFY 2011 made in the RHP Region (including fee for service, MCO, vendor drug, and PCCM payments). An RHP's percentage was calculated by dividing SFY 2011 Medicaid acute care payments in the RHP Region by total SFY 2011 State Medicaid acute care payments. iii. Percent of total SFY 2011 Medicaid supplem ental payments (former Upper Payment Limit [UPL] program) made to providers in the RHP. An RHP's percentage was calculated by dividing SFY 2011 Medicaid supplemental payments by total SFY 2011 State Medicaid supplemental payments. The RHP's percentages for the three variables are weighted equally, and then the individual RHP's percentages are averaged to come up with the RHP's DSRIP Funding Allocation Percentage for each demonstration years 1-5. An RHP's DSRIP Funding Allocation Percentage shall be multiplied by the statewide DSRIP funding amounts in DYs 1-5 identified in Tabl e 6 of STC 46. The pr oduct result of this calculation yields the DSRIP f unding allocation amount for an RHP, which is reflected in Table 1 below. This table also displays the Ti er Level of an RHP as defined in paragraph 11, Section III \"Key Elements of Proposed RHP Plans\".

One-time Re-Assessment of DS RIP Allocation to RHPs in DY 3 During DY 3, HHSC shall re-assess DSRIP allocati on amounts to RHPs. In the event that the total amount of DSRIP funds included in an RHP Plan for DYs 3-5 is less than the total amount available to the RHP in Table 1, HHSC shall redistribute uncommitted amounts that an RHP does not propose to use for new three year projects for DYs 3-5. The uncommitted amounts shall be redistributed to RHPs according to a DSRIP funding allocation methodology agreed to by HHSC and CMS. The redistributed f unds may be used by RHPs to fund new three year projects beginning in DY 3 that are approved acc ording to the process described in paragraph18. 28. Benchmark Payment Variat ion between UC and DSRIP UC payments will be based on each provider's reported UC costs on the UC application and reduced proportionately if the total statewide UC cap is exceeded for a given demonstration year. However, to ensure a robust and meaningful DS RIP program, RHPs are st rongly encouraged to submit RHP Plans that in total fund DSRIP project s at no less than the pe rcentages listed in Table 2 below. Table 2 shows the statewide waiver funding allocation schedule for DSRIP and UC described in Table 6 of STC 46. Table 2: Waiver Funding Allocation between UC Program and DSRIP Programs DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 Total % UC 63% 57% cation Formula a. Eligible Entities Anchoring Entities and Performing Providers that begin participation in DSRIP in DY 2 and that have a current Medicaid pr ovider identification number are eligible to receive a DY 1 DSRIP payment according to the requirements in this section. An entity that serves both roles in an RHP is eligible to receive a DY 1 payment under each of the categories described below. b. Anchoring Entities The Anchoring Entity of an RHP shall be allo cated 20 percent of the total DY 1 RHP DSRIP funding amount. c. Performing Providers Remaining DY 1 RHP DSRIP fund ing (less the Anchoring Entity DY 1 DSRIP) shall be allocated to Performing Provide rs based on an allocation formula. The allocation formula divides an RHP Plan's estimated dollar value of a Performing Provide r's DSRIP projects in Categories 1-4 over the DYs 2-5 period by the to tal value of the RHP's DSRIP projects over Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 420 of 454 the DYs 2-5 period. The resulting percentage is then multiplied by the RHP's remaining DY 1 DSRIP amount to determine the DY 1 DSRI P payment for the Performing Provider. Example: An RHP's DY1 DSRIP Allocation is $25 million. 20 percent or $5 million is allocated to the Anchoring Entity. The remaining amount, $20 million, shall be distributed to Performing Providers according to the following formula: 1. An RHP Plan reports a total DSRIP valuat ion of projects in DYs 2-5 equal to $500 million across 10 Performing Providers. 2. Performing Provider \"A's\" DSRIP valuat ion for projects over the 4-year period in the RHP is $100 million, or 20 pe rcent of the total DSRIP valuation. 3. Based on the formula, Performing Provide r \"A\" would be eligible to receive $4 million or 20 percent of the remaining $20 million DY 1 DSRIP payment amount. 30. DYs 2-5 RHP DSRIP Allocation Formula a. Eligibility for DSRIP Performing Providers described in Section II \"D SRIP Eligibility Criteria\" are eligible to receive RHP in Demonstrati on Years 2-5. Each Pe rforming Provider will be individually responsible for progress toward s and achievement of its milestone bundles in all categories as defined in the RHP's appr oved RHP Plan. As outlined in Section V \"RHP and State Reporting Requirements\", Performing Pr oviders will be eligible to receive DSRIP incentive payments related to achievement of their milestone bundles upon submission and approval of the required reports for payment. b. \"Two-Pass\" Process for Allocating DSRIP Funds DSRIP funding shall be allocate d to Performing Providers usi ng a two-stage process. The first stage or \"Pass 1\" sets an initial allocation to each potential provider who would be eligible to participate in DSRIP as described in paragraph 26.c.i.-ii. The purpose of this step is to encourage broad particip ation in DSRIP within an RHP. Under Pass 1, the RHP must identify and fund its minimum required number of projects. In additi on, in order to access Pass 2 funds, RHPs in each Tier must meet DSRIP participation requirements for major safety net hospitals (described below in pa ragraph 29.c.v.2) and meet a threshold for DSRIP participation by non-profit and other private hospitals (described below in paragraph 29.c.v.3). Recognizing that not all potentially eligible Performing Provi ders will participate in DSRIP, Pass 2 of the DSRIP allocation process permits RHPs to reallocate unused DSRIP funds for new projects in Categories 1, 2, and 3. DSRIP projects funded in the plan must support the RHP's overall goals and be consistent with its community needs assessment. HHSC shall Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 421 of 454 ensure in the RHP Plan submission requireme nts that the \"two-pass\" process has been followed. c. Initial DSRIP Allocation (\"Pass 1\" Allocation) i. Hospital Providers Potentially eligible hospital Performing Providers in an RHP that participated in either the Disproportionate Share Hosp ital (DSH) program during FFY 2012 or the former Upper Payment Limit (UPL) program during FFY 2011 shall be allocated 75 percent of the RHP's annual DSRIP funds. Of this amount, each hospital shall be assigned a potential DSRIP allocation based on a provider's size a nd role in serving Medicaid and uninsured patients, as measured by three variables: 1. The hospital's percent share of Medicaid acute care payments in SFY 201l made to all potentially eligible hospitals in the RHP (including fee for service, MCO, and PCCM payments); 2. The hospital's percent share of total SFY 2011 Medica id supplemental payments made to all potentially eligible hospi tal providers in the RHP (former UPL program); and 3. The hospital's percent share of uncompensated care in the RHP. A hospital's uncompensated care is measured by its FFY 2012 Hospital Specific Limit (HSL). For hospitals that do not have a FFY 2012 Hospital Specific Limit, uncom pensated care shall be measured by that hospital's charity care costs reported in the 2010 Annual Ho spital Survey trended to 2012 by an annual trend rate of approximately 2 per cent (4 percent total trend over the two-year period). The individual hospital's per cent share of Medicaid acute care payments shall be weighted 25 percent, percent share of Medicaid supplemental payments shall be weighted 25 percent, and pe rcent share of uncompensated care shall be weighted 50 percent to determine the Hospital DS RIP Funding Allocation Percentage. The Hospital DSRIP Funding Allocation shall be multiplied by the annual RHP DSRIP amount allocated to hospitals in the RHP to come up with the Pass 1 allocation amount for each hospital. ii. Non-Hospital Providers Potentially eligible non-hospita l Performing Providers in an RHP are allocated a total of 25 percent of the RHP's annual DSRIP f unds, to be distributed as follows: 1. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) initially shall be allocated a total of 10 percent of the RHP's annual DSRIP funds; 2. Physician Practices affiliated with an Academic Health Science Center initially shall be allocated a total of 10 percent of the RHP' s annual DSRIP funds. Such physician practices outside an RHP as re ferenced in paragraph 7 may access the 10 percent upon request of the RHP; and Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 422 of 454 3. Local Health Departments initially shall be allocated a total of 5 percent of the RHP's annual DSRIP funds. If an RHP does not include one or more of the non-hospital pr oviders listed above, the Pass 1 allocations will be redistributed in \"Pass 2\" as descri bed in paragraph 29.d. iii. Option for Smaller Hospitals in Tiers 1 and 2 to Collaborate in Pass 1 1. Hospitals in RHPs categorized in Tiers 1 or 2 whose DSRIP allocation in Pass 1 in DY 2 is less than $2 million are enc ouraged to work within their RHP to combine their individual DSRIP alloca tions to implement a robust DSRIP project(s) that will be valuable to th e RHP as determined by the RHP Plan and community needs assessment. A single Performing Provider must implement each DSRIP project. 2. Such hospitals can combine their individua l DSRIP allocations if there is a signed agreement between the affected parties s ubmitted with the RHP Plan stating that the transaction is entered into freely and that it benefits regional transformation. No hospital is required to combin e its individual DSRIP allocation. iv. Option for Performing Providers in Tier s 3 and 4 to Collaborate in Pass 1 1. Performing Providers in RHPs categori zed in Tiers 3 or 4 may combine their individual DSRIP allocations within their RHP to implement a robust DSRIP project(s) considered valuable to the RHP as determined by the RHP Plan and community needs assessment. A single Performing Provider must implement each DSRIP project. 2. Such Performing Providers can combine their individual DSRIP allocations if there is a signed agreement between the affected parties submitted with the RHP Plan stating that the transaction is entere d into freely and that it benefits regional transformation. No Performing Provider is required to combine its individual DSRIP allocation. v. Requirements in Pass 1 1. Minimum Projects RHP Plans must identify the minimum nu mber of Category 1 and 2 projects the RHP is required to implement according to its Tier Level as outlined in Section III \"Key Elements of Proposed RHP Plans\" and must show that Performing Providers will meet the funding alloca tion requirements in each Category as described in paragraph 29.e. If an RHP Plan does not meet these criteria in Pass 1, the RHP Plan will not be approved. 2. DSRIP Participation Target for Major Safety Net Hospitals Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 423 of 454 An RHP Plan must meet DSRIP participa tion requirements for major safety net hospitals in order to be eligible to pa rticipate in \"Pass 2\" and to receive any redistributed DSRIP funds in DY 3 (as desc ribed in paragraph 26.b). In order to ensure broad participation of safety net hospitals in DSRIP, each RHP will have a minimum number of safety net hospital s participate in DSRIP as Performing Providers. The participation target varies by RHP Tier Level and is presented in Table 3 below. For the purposes of this requirement, a hos pital is defined as a major safety net hospital if it meets either of these two criteria: a. Criteria 1 The hospital participated in the Di sproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program in FFY2012 and i. The hospital received at least 15 percent of th e region's total Medicaid revenue (fee-for-service, managed care, primary care case management [PCCM]) in FFY2011 for Pass 1 hospitals or; ii. has a trended 2012 hospital specific limit (HSL) that represents at least 15 percent of the region's total HSL, or b. Criteria 2 The hospital has a Pass 1 DSRIP allocati on for DY 2-5 of greater than $60 million as defined in paragraph 29.c.i above. Table 3: Major Safety Net Hospital DSRIP Participation Target by RHP Tier Level RHP Tier Number of Major Safety Net Hospitals in each RHP that must Participate in DSRIP* Estimated Number of Safety Net Hospitals Participating in DSRIP Tier 1 At least 5 5 Tier 2 At least 4 11 Tier 3 At least 2 12 Tier 4 At least 1 10 Total 38 *If there are fewer major safety net hospitals in an RHP than specified for its Tier level, then the RHP Plan must include all the major safety net hospitals as defined above in that RHP as Perf orming Providers for DSRIP. 3. Broad Hospital Participation Target An RHP Plan must meet the broad hospita l participation target in order to be eligible to participate in \"Pass 2\" and to receive any redistributed DSRIP funds in DY 3 (as described in paragraph 26.b). RHPs shall have minimum representation of non-profit and other private hospitals in their RHP plans. An RHP Plan must include projects with values equal to at least a minimum percentage of DSRIP Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 424 of 454 Annual Allocation Amounts assigned to non- profit and other private hospitals as defined in paragraph 29.c.i above. The minimum percentage varies by RHP Tier Level and is presented in Table 4 below. Table 4: Non -Profit and Other Private Hospit al DSRIP Target by RHP Tier Level RHP Tier Percent of Total Pass 1 Assigned DSRIP Annual Amounts Aggregated Across all Non-Profit and Other Private Hospitals included in RHP Plan Tier 1 At least 30% Tier 2 At least 30% Tier 3 At least 15% Tier 4 At least 5% d. Re-allocation of Unused DSRIP Am ounts for New Projects (\"Pass 2\") After requirements of Pass 1 are met, as spec ified in paragraph 29.c.iv, if there are DSRIP allocation amounts that remain unused by pot ential Performing Providers, the RHP may redirect the unused amounts to fund addi tional projects by hosp ital providers and non- hospital providers that support the overall goals and commun ity needs assessment of the RHP. HHSC also strongly encourages broad geographic representation across the region. In \"Pass 2\", the RHP shall identify the new pr ojects and outcomes from Categories 1-3, the Performing Providers who shall implement th e project, and the DSRIP funding amount assigned to the projects and measures. In addition to the eligible providers identifie d in paragraph 29, physic ian practices that are not affiliated with academic science health cente rs may participate in Categories 1, 2, and 3 DSRIP projects in Pass 2. Hospitals that did not participate in the DSH program in FFY 2012 or the UPL program in FFY 2011 may also participate in DSRIP in Pass 2. i. Pass 2 - Performing Providers that did not participate in Pass 1: Potentially eligible Performing Providers in an RHP that did not participate in Pass 1 shall be allocated a total of 25 percent of the RHP's unused Pass 1 DSRIP funds. The Anchor will calculate the following for Pa ss 2 using the total unused DSRIP from Pass 1 allocations: 1. Hospital Performing Providers that did not participate in the DSH program in FFY 2012 or the UPL program in FFY 2011 shall be allocated a total of 15 percent of the RHP's unused Pass 1 DSRIP funds. Each hospital shall be allocated a proportion of the 15 percent divided by the number of new hospital Performing Providers. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 425 of 454 2. Physician practices not affiliated with academic health science centers shall be allocated 10 per cent of the RHP's unused Pass 1 DSRIP funds. Each physician pr actice shall be allocated a proportion of the 10 percent divide d by the number of interested physician practices. ii. Pass 2 - Performing Providers th at participated in Pass 1: Performing Providers in an RH P that participated in Pass 1 shall be allocated a total of 75 percent of the RHP's unused Pass 1 DSRIP funds. The Anchor will calculate the following for Pass 2 using Pass 1 DSRIP project information: 1. Each individual Performing Provider's pe rcent of the total Pass 1 funding for DSRIP projects in Pass 1 in DYs 2-5. 2. The Performing Provider's percent as calcu lated in 1. above is multiplied by the 75 percent of the RHP's unused Pass 1 DS RIP funds to determine the allocation of DSRIP to each Performing Provider in the RHP for Pass 2. 3. Performing Providers may implement new DSRIP projects that complement the projects from Pass 1 and addre ss outstanding community needs. 4. One Performing Provider must implement each DSRIP project. iii. Collaboration among Performing Providers in Pass 2 Within each RHP, Performing Providers ma y combine their individual Pass 2 DSRIP allocations to fund a DSRIP project that is a priority for the RHP if there is a signed agreement between the affected parties subm itted with the RHP Plan stating that the transaction is entered into freely and that it benefits regional transformation. No Performing Provider is required to co mbine its individual DSRIP allocation. iv. If there are unused funds after Pass 2, th e Anchoring Entity may collaborate with RHP Performing Providers to determine whic h additional DSRIP projects to include in the RHP Plan. e. Project Valuation RHP Plans shall include a narra tive that describes the approach used for valuing projects and rationale to support the approac h. At a minimum, Performing Providers shall ensure that upon initial submission of the RHP Plan and indi vidual three-year projects, project values comport with the following funding distribution ac ross Categories 1-4 in DYs 2-5. Projects valued at the maximum levels described in paragraph 12.e are expected to support meaningful, large-scale delivery system tr ansformation and must provide sufficient justification of the projec t value in the RHP Plan. In addition, if an IGT entity do es not elect to transfer additional IGT funds to provide a portion of the nonfederal share of the administ rative costs related to waiver monitoring activities, as described in pa ragraph 23, the state may lower a provider's valuation. The state Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 426 of 454 may lower the valuation by an amount necessary to equal the associated IGT entity's share of the expected funds for waiver monitori ng activities described in paragraph 23.

Milestone Valuation With respect to Categories 1, 2, and 4, milestone s for a project within a demonstration year shall be valued equally. For Category 3, mileston es for a project within a demonstration year from DY 3-5 shall be valued equally (within the limits fo r pay for reporting and pay for performance and other parameters described in paragraph 32 below). 31. Payment Based on Achievement of Mile stone Bundles in Categories 1, 2, and 4 a. Definition With respect to Categories 1-2, a milestone bundle is the compilati on of milestones and related metrics associated with a project in a given year. A milestone may have more than one annual metric associated with it. Two or more metrics associated with a milestone shall be assigned equal weighted value for the purpos e of calculating incentive payments. With respect to Category 4, a milestone bundle is th e compilation of reporting measures within a Category 4 domain. A Category 4 reporting measure within a dom ain shall be considered a milestone for the purpose of this section and al l measures within a domain shall be weighted equally for the purpose of calculating incentive payments. b. Basis for Calculating Incentiv e Payment for Categories 1-2 Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 427 of 454 Incentive payments are calculated separately for each project in Categories 1 and 2.The amount of the incentive funding paid to a Pe rforming Provider will be based on the amount of progress made within each specific milestone bundle. Fo r each milestone within the bundle, the Performing Provider will include in the RHP semi-annual report the progress made in completing each metric associated wi th the milestone. A Performing Provider must fully achieve a Category 1 or 2 metric to incl ude it in the incentive payment calculation. Based on the progress reported, each milestone will be categorized as follows to determine the total achievement value for the milestone bundle: Full achievement (achievement value = 1) At least 75 percent achievement (achievement value = .75) At least 50 percent achievement (achievement value = .5) At least 25 percent achievement (achievement value = .25) Less than 25 percent achievement (achievement value = 0) The achievement values for each milestone in the bundle will be summed together to determine the total ach ievement value for the milestone bundle. The Performing Provider is then eligible to receive an amount of incentive funding for th at milestone bundle determined by multiplying the total amount of funding related to that bundle by the result of dividing the reported achievement value by the total possible achievement value. If a Performing Provider has previously reported progress in a bundle a nd received partial funding, only the additional amount it is eligible for will be disbursed. HHS C may determine milestones that qualify for partial achievement. (See example below of disbursement calculation). Example of disburse ment calculation: A Category 1 Project in DY 2 is valued at $30 million and has 5 milestones, which make up the Milestone Bundle. Under the paymen t formula, the 5 milestones represent a maximum achievement value of 5. The hospital Performing Provider report s the following progress at 6 months: Milestone 1: 100 percent achieveme nt (achievement value = 1) Metric 1: Fully achieved Metric 2: Fully achieved Milestone 2: 66.7% percent achieve ment (Achievement value = .5) Metric 1: Fully achieved Metric 2: Fully achieved Metric 3: Not Achieved Milestone 3: 0 percent achievem ent (Achievement value = 0) Metric 1: Not Achieved Milestone 4: 50 percent achieve ment (Achievement value = .5) Metric 1: Fully Achieved Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 428 of 454 Metric 2: Not Achieved Milestone 5: 40 percent achieveme nt (Achievement value = .25) Metric 1: Fully achieved Metric 2: Fully Achieved Metric 3: Not Achieved Metric 4: Not Achieved Metric 5: Not Achieved Total achievement value at 6 months = 2.25 Disbursement at 6 months = $30M x (2.25/5) = $13.5 million By the end of the Demonstration Year, the hospital Performing Provider successfully completes all of the remaining metrics for the project. The hospital is eligible to receive the balance of incentive payments related to the project: Disbursement at 12 months is $30 million - $13.5 million = $16.5 million. c. Basis for Calculating Incentive Payment for Category 4 i. DY 2 Incentive Payments In DY 2, a hospital Performing Provider partic ipating in Category 4 reporting shall be eligible to receive an incentive payment equal to 5 percent of its total allocation amount in DY 2 upon submission to HHSC of a status report that describes the system changes the hospital is putting in place to prepare to successfully report Category 4 measures in DYs 3-5. ii. DYs 3-5 Incentive Payments The amount of the incentive funding paid to a hospital Performing Provider will be based on the amount of progress made in successfully reporting all measures included in a domain. A hospital must complete reporting on all Category 4 measures included in a domain prior to requesting in centive payments. Hospitals shall report progress on completing measure repor ting in the semi-annual reports. Example of disburse ment calculation: A Category 4 Domain includes 5 reporting m easures. The hospital Performing Provider completes reports on two measures by March 31 (or by the 6th month of the DY). The hospital reports this achievement in the fi rst semi-annual report; however, an incentive payment is not made because 3 other measures in the domain remaining outstanding. By the 12 th month of the DY, the hospital has su ccessfully reported on the remaining 3 measures. At that point, the hospital may re quest and receive a full incentive payment for the entire domain of measures. If a hosp ital fails to report on a single measure in a domain, it will forfeit the entire payment for the domain in question. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 429 of 454 32. Basis for Payment in Category 3 d. Valuation of Category 3 Outcomes In February 2014, CMS and HHSC agreed to a revised Category 3 framework, including a revised list of Category 3 out come options and a standard target setting methodology to be used to measure outcome improvement in DY 4 and DY 5. The revised RHP Planning Protoc ol classifies Category 3 ou tcomes either as pay for performance (P4P) or pay for reporting (P4R). The number and type of milestones for each outcome in DY4 and DY 5 depends on whether the outcome is P4P or P4R, and in DY 5 Performing Providers with P4R measures also are required to report on a population-focused priority measure or stretch activity. See the RH P Planning Protocol for further details on the revisions to Category 3. In the initial RHP Plan submission, a Performi ng Provider had flexibility to assign different values to its Category 3 outcomes and related m ilestones, as long as total payments met the annual category allocation amounts defined in 29.e above and th e valuations were sufficiently justified. Based on the updated Category 3 outcomes and framework in the RHP Planning Protocol, in March 2014 providers will re-select or verify their Category 3 outcome(s) for each Category 1 or 2 project. Category 3 valuation for DY 3-5 will be determined as follows: i. HHSC will total all the funds the provider allocated to Category 3 each DY for DY 3, 4, and 5. ii. HHSC will total the provider's Category 1 and 2 DSRIP projects, including both approved four-year projects and pr oposed three-year projects. iii. Each provider will decide what percentage of its Category 3 funds will go toward a given Category 1 or 2 project. This pe rcentage must be the same for DY 3-5. When determining the percentage of Ca tegory 3 funds related to each Category 1 or 2 project, a Performing Provider must allocate a minimum percentage to each Category 1 or 2 project. The minimum pe rcentage is calculated as follows: 1. Divide the total number of Category 1 and 2 DSRIP projects into 100. This is the average percentage of total Category 3 funding that would relate to each Cate gory 1 or 2 project. 2. Multiply the average percentage from 1 above by 25%. 3. The product in 2 above is the mini mum percentage of Category 3 funds that can be allocated to a Category 3 outcome related to a Category 1 or 2 project. 4.HHSC may grant exceptions to a prov ider's minimum required percentage allocation per Category 1 or 2 project if needed for a provider to retain Category 3 valuation proportional to its Category 1 and 2 valuation. This would occur in cases where the valua tion of a provider's Category 1 and 2 Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 430 of 454 projects varies widely (e.g. one $7 million project and one $200,000 project). Example of Category 3 Valuation Allocation Me thodology with 5 Category 1 and 2 Projects DY 3 DY4 DY5 Project 1.1 30% iv. Once a provider decides the pe rcentage of its funds to al locate to a given Category 1 or 2 project for DY 3-5, based on the num ber of outcome measures the provider selects for that Category 1 or 2 project, HHSC will allocate an equal amount of Category 3 funds to each outcome, and also to each milestone for that outcome in a given demonstration year. v. If one or more of a Performing Provider' s proposed three-year DSRIP projects do not get approved, HHSC will adjust the Ca tegory 3 valuations of its projects based on the above methodology. vi. The Category 3 funding breakdown in DY 3-5 is as follows: P4P Category 3 Outcomes P4R Category 3 Outcomes (need prior authorization) DY3 50 percent status report / 50 percent establish baseline (both process milestones) 50 percent status report / 50 percent establish baseline (both process milestones) DY 4 50 percent P4R (process milestone) / 50 percent P4P (achievement milestone)100 percent P4R on outcome (process milestone) DY 5 100 percent P4P (achievement milestone) 50 percent P4R on outcome (process milestone) 50 percent P4P on population- focused priority measure (achievement milestone) or stretch activity (process milestone) Example 1 - P4P Outcomes A provider allocates to its 1.1 project 30% of its total Category 3 valuation, which equals $1 million in DY 3, $2 million in DY 4, and $4 m illion in DY5. The provider selects two pay for performance outcomes associated wi th its 1.1 project. Funding distribution: Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 431 of 454 DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 P4P Outcome 1 $500,000 (50% for status update and 50% for establishing baseline) $1 million (50% for reporting to specifications and 50% for improving on the outcome) $2 million (100% for improving on the outcome) P4P Outcome 2 $500,000 (50% for status update and 50% for establishing baseline) $1 million (50% for reporting to specifications and 50% for improving on the outcome) $2 million (100% for improving on the outcome) Example 2 - P4R Outcomes A provider allocates to its 1.1 project 30% of its total Category 3 valuation, which equals $1 million in DY 3, $2 million in DY 4, and $4 m illion in DY5. The provider selects two pay for reporting outcomes associated with its 1.1 project. Funding distribution: DY 3 DY 4 DY 5 P4R Outcome 1 $500,000 (50% for status update and 50% for establishing baseline) $1 million (100% for reporting to specifications) $2 million (50% for reporting to specifications and 50% for improvement on population health measure or stretch activity) P4R Outcome 2 $500,000 (50% for status update and 50% for establishing baseline) $1 million (100% for reporting to specifications) $2 million (50% for reporting to specifications and 50% for improvement on population health measure or stretch activity) e. Process Milestones/Metrics A Performing Provider must fully achieve metric s associated with the process milestones to qualify for a DSRIP payment related to these milestones. f. Achievement Milestones Performing Providers may receive partial paymen t for making progress towards, but not fully achieving, an achievement milestone. The part ial payment would equal 25 percent, 50 Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 432 of 454 percent, or 75 percent of th e achievement value of that milestone. Based on the progress reported, each achievement milestone will be categorized as follows to determine the total achievement value percentage: Full achievement (achievement value = 1) At least 75 percent achievement (achievement value = .75) At least 50 percent achievement (achievement value = .5) At least 25 percent achievement (achievement value = .25) Less than 25 percent achievement (achievement value = 0) Example of disbursement calculation : A hospital Performing Provider has set an ach ievement target that would decrease potentially preventable readmissions for a ta rget population with a chronic condition by 5 percent in DY 4 and by 10 percent in DY 5. In DY 4, the Performing Provider achieved a 2.5 percent reduction in PPR, short of its goal. Under the partial payment policy, the provider would be reimbursed 50 percent of the incentive payment associated with this achievement milestone because it achieved 50 percent of the target. The Performing provider may earn the remaining DY 4 incentive payment for the achievement milestone in the following year (DY 5) under the carry- forward policy outlined in Section VIII: \"Carry-forward and Penalties for Missed Milestones.\" X. PLAN MODIFICATIONS Consistent with the recognized ne ed to provide RHPs with flexib ility to modify their plans over time and take into account evidence and learning from their own experience over time, as well as for unforeseen circumstances or other good cause, an RHP may request prospective changes to its RHP Plan through a plan modification process. 33. Plan Modification Process An RHP may request modifications to an RHP Plan under the following circumstances: a. Adding New Projects for Demonstration Year 3 An RHP may amend its plan to include new projects financed by either new or existing IGT Entities that are implemented by either existing and/or new Performing Providers. These projects shall be 3 years in duration, beginning in Demonstrat ion Year 3. Projects added for DY 3 may be selected from Cate gories 1, 2, or 3 of Attachment I, \"RHP Planning Protocol\" and are subject to all requirements describe d herein and in the STCs. Newly added hospital Performing Providers shall be required to report Category 4 measures according to Section III \"Key El ements of Proposed RHP Plans\". HHSC and CMS will review three year projects according to the process described in paragraph 18. Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 433 of 454 b. Deleting or Terminating an Existing Project An RHP may request to delete or terminate a project fr om its RHP plan and forgo replacing it if the RHP continues to m eet the minimum project number requirements outlined in Section III \"Key Elements of Propos ed RHP Plans\" and the loss of the project does not jeopardize or dilute the remaining de livery system reforms pursued in the plan. An RHP may not redistribute incentive funding from the deleted project to other existing projects; unless the project is replaced in accordance with subparagraph a. above, the affected Performing Provider and RHP shall forfeit DSRIP allocation associated with the deleted project. The forfeited DSRIP allocati on may be available for redistribution to RHPs in accordance with Section VI \"Disbursement of DSRIP Funds\". If a project is terminated prior to the mid-point assessment, HHSC will recoup prior DSRIP payments for that project and return th e associated federal sh are of the payments to CMS. A Performing Provider will receive some period of time after the mid-point assessment to determine if a DSRIP project will continue for the remainder of the demonstration. Specifically, if the Performing Provider wit hdraws after the mid-point assessment but before DY 4 payments are made, no prior DSRIP payments will be recouped. If a DSRIP project is terminated after the post mid-point assessmen t consideration period, then HHSC will recoup all DSRIP payments made after the mid-point assessment and return the associated federal share of the payments to CMS. c. Modifying Existing Projects RHPs may submit requests to HHSC to modi fy elements of an existing project prospectively, including changes to milest ones and metrics with good cause. Such requests must be submitted to HHSC 90 days prior to when the changes go into effect according to the standardized timeline agr eed to by the state and CMS. Performing providers have opportunities to submit plan modification requests in December 2013 (for DY 3-5) and July 2014 (for DY 4-5). The fina l opportunity to submit plan modification requests for DY 4 will align with the timing of the mid-point assessment. There will be a final opportunity during DY 4 to submit plan modification requests for DY 5 only for Category 3 changes and for three-year projects. d. Plan Modification Review and Approval Process Plan modifications must be submitted in writ ing to HHSC; HHSC shall take action on the plan modification request using a CMS-appr oved approach, criteria, and checklist. HHSC will notify providers in writing of any questions or concerns identified. Once the projects are determined by HHSC to meet the CMS-approved criteria, the plan modifications will be approved and HHSC will notify CMS. Substantial reductions in project scope (such as reducti ons to quantifiable patient im pact, as well as significant changes in the hiring of staff and completion of core components) will be subject to a secondary review and ongoing compliance mon itoring by the independe nt assessor. If Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 434 of 454 the independent assessor disagrees with HHSC's assessment to approve a plan modification, CMS will have an opportunity to review the plan modification and request a re-review by HHSC. XI. CARRY -FORWARD AND PENALTIES FOR MISSED MILESTONES 34. Carry-forward Policy If a Performing Provider does not fully achieve a milestone bundle in Ca tegories 1 or 2, or a Category 3 process milestone or achievement mile stone that was specified in its RHP Plan for completion in a particular demonstration year, it will be able to carry forward the available incentive funding associated with the milestone until the end of the follo wing demonstration year during which the Performing Provider may complete the milestone and receive full payment. Incentive funding that is carried forward still remains associated with the original demonstration year for all accounting purposes (including calc ulation of the annual DSRIP payment limits). Carried forward DSRIP funding is subject to al l Medicaid claiming requirements and may be paid no later than two years afte r the end of a demonstration year in which it was to have been completed (e.g., for DY 2, which ends September 30, 2013, payments may be made no later than September 30, 2015). Although authority for DSRIP funding expires September 30, 2016, DSRIP payment may be claimed after this point, subject to the carry-forward provisions in this section. To effectuate carry-forward policy, a Performing Provider shall provide narrative description on the status of the missed milestones and outline th e provider's plan to achieve the missed milestones by the end of the of the following demonstration year. 35. Penalties for Missed Milestones If a Performing Provider does not complete th e missed milestone bundle or measure during the 12-month carry-forward period or the reporting year with respect to Category 4, funding for the incentive payment shall be forfeited and no l onger available for use in the DSRIP program. XII. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 36. Data validation and alignment with managed care Data and metrics that form the basis of incentiv e payments in DSRIP should have a high degree of accuracy and validity. The stat e must require that each Performing Provide r certify that data received to demonstrate DSRIP achievement is accurate and complete. Data accuracy and validity also will be subject to revi ew by the independent assessor. Consistent with the requirements of STC 27, th e state will update its comprehensive quality strategy and include in its annual report to CMS opportunities to better standardize quality Attachment J Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 435 of 454 measurement between DSRIP and the state's Me dicaid managed care programs in order to reduce administrative burden and ensure grea ter validity and reliability for performance measures. Attachment K Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol Part 1: RHP Anchor Administrative Costs Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 436 of 454 Preface The following guidance and protocols have been developed to inform and assist the TX Health and Human Services Commissi on (HHSC) and their partner Anchor and/or contractors in their efforts to comply with Federal statute, regula tions, protocols, and guidance regarding claiming for Federal Fina ncial Participation (FFP) for Medicaid administrative expenditures necessary to implement and operate this waiver. I. General Requirements/Assurances A. The HHSC/Anchor hospital under this waiver must fully describe the administrative expenditures to be claime d to Medicaid, including the methodology used to identify allowable expenditu res, and submit a detailed narrative description and a budget summary for al l costs for claiming administrative expenditures in writing to CMS. State Response: Texas has 20 Regional Healthcare Part nerships (RHPs), whose members may participate in the Delivery System Refo rm Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program. A map of the Texas RHPs is provided (reference Attachment C - RHP Map ). The RHPs share the following characteristics: The RHPs are based on distinct geogra phic boundaries that generally reflect patient flow patterns for the region; The RHPs have identified local fundi ng sources to help finance the non- federal share of DSRIP paym ent for Performing Providers; The RHPs have identified an Anchori ng Entity to help coordinate RHP activities. RHPs vary in geographic and population si ze. RHP 3 represents the largest region which includes Houston and surrounding area s. This RHP contains more than 15% share of the statewide populat ion under 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau: 2006 - 2010 American Community Survey for Texas (ACS). Approximately one half of th e RHPs contain less than 3 percent share of the statewide population under 200 percent of the population. Narrative descriptions from Anchors and the methodologies proposed will vary based on the size of the RHP they are serving, and the type of organization. Attachment K Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol Part 1: RHP Anchor Administrative Costs Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 437 of 454 Each RHP has one of its members designated as an \"Anchor\" entity . Anchors provide certain administrative servi ces with respect to the Texas Transfor mation an d Quality Improvement Program 1115 Waiver. The Anchor is a member of an RHP, and is one of the following types of public organizations: public hospital, hospital district, other hospital authority, county government, or State university with a health science center or medical school. Description of Admini strative Expenditures Costs for Anchor activities allowable under this protocol for ad ministrative claiming include the following: 1. The provision of appropriate acc ounting, human resources, and data management resources for the RHP; 2. The coordination of RHP annual repor ting, as specified in the Program Protocol, on the status of projects and the performance of Performing Providers (as defined in the Pr ogram Protocol) in the region; 3. The provision of RHP data manage ment for purposes of evaluation; 4. The development and facilitation of one or more regional learning collaboratives; 5. Communication with stake holders in the region, in cluding the public; and 6. Communication on behalf of the RHP with HHSC. Methodology used to identif y allowable expenditures Parameters of allowable costs for the six activities listed above are addressed in the \"Cost Principles for Expenses\" specific to the 1115 Waiver document (reference Attachment A - Cost Principles ). (Note that this documen t is also included as an attachment to the contract w ith each Anchor.) The Cost Pr inciples describe in detail that not all types of costs th at might be incurred by the An chor in connection with the performance of its administrative functions und er the Contract are a llowable. It is the function of these Cost Principles for Expe nses to clarify this issue. While this Attachment was derived from similar cost principles used by HHSC with respect to Attachment K Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol Part 1: RHP Anchor Administrative Costs Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 438 of 454 managed care and other contra cts, there are substantive differences. The specific terms of this Attachment are the definitive co st principles with respect to the Anchor function. The Cost Reporting Template (reference Attachment B - Cost Template ) provides additional framework and controls for reporting of costs for each Anchor. The protected Excel spreadsheet ha s rows set up for each of th e six activities listed above. Cost limits placed in the spreadsheet by HHSC that are specific to each Anchor prevent the Anchor from submitting costs per FFY to HHSC in excess of the limits established by CMS (i.e., the lesser of: $2,000,000 or 2.5% of the RHP DSRIP allocation per FFY). (Note that Anchors may submit a request for additional funding above the maximum to support additional tr ansformation activities for the RHP for approval by HHSC and CMS.) Narrative description and a budget summary Each Anchor has submitted a narrative description (reference Attachment D - RHP Narratives ) and a corresponding budget summary (reference Attachment E - RHP Budget (Projected Costs) ). Within each of the twenty RHP Narratives, there are three sections, as follows: The first section, \"Information about th e Anchor Organiza tion\" includes a general description of th e type of organization, any 1115 Waiver activities other than the role as an Anchor (i ncluding DSRIP activiti es), and, any other Administrative Costs or Claiming in which the organization participates. The next section, \"Administrative Activ ities,\" outlines a detailed narrative description and budget (projected costs) summary for each of the six allowable activities for this Protocol. Each Anchor has also submitted an Excel budget (projected costs) spreadsh eet (reference Attachment E, which contains RHP 1 through RHP 20 Budget (Projected Costs). The documents also include the indirect rate proposed. If the rate proposed is higher than 10 %, the Anchor provides a justification proposed for the higher amount that is specific to the Anchor functions for the 1115 Waiver. The last section, \"Cost Allocation Methodology,\" describes the specific method that the particular Anchor uses to account for its relevant staff and/or contract time, and to allocate the sta ff/contractor time according to multiple activities or cost objectiv es. The methodology described is required to provide sufficient detail to demonstrate that costs are not duplicated in other programs. Anchors are using a simila r methodology for cost allocation that results in a Percent Effort Spreadshee t (Attachment D.1) The approach is Attachment K Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol Part 1: RHP Anchor Administrative Costs Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 439 of 454 consistent with the \"2003 CMS Me dicaid School-Based Administrative Claiming Guide\" incorporating the following requirements: a. Reflect an after the fact distribut ion of the actual activity of each employee; b. Are prepared monthly and coincide with one or more pay period; c. Are signed by the employee as being a true statement of activities and the employee/office will retain th e documentation to support the report; d. Account for the total activity for which each employee is compensated. The Anchors will utilize a \"Time and Effort\" reporting process similar to the process utilized by the Texas A&M University System for federally sponsored projects. This pr ocess is required for all federally sponsored projects in order to valid ate that direct sa laries and wages charged are reasonable and accurately reflect the work performed. The Anchors will use a spreadsheet and de signate a percent effort for each activity by individual employee ba sed on time spent on each activity on a monthly basis. A narrative overview description of each Anchor is provided below; see the attachments for further details for each Anchor. Also see the Attachment E - which includes a Consolidated Budget Summary that adds all twenty Anchors into a single total cost projection. Anchors are using the Percent Effort Spreadsheet as a consistent methodology beginning DY 3 (October 2013) and will also use DY 4 and 5. Anchors have also described a methodology used for DY 2 (O ctober 2012 through August 2013) in their narratives attached. RHP 1: University of Texas Health Scien ce Center at Tyler (UTHSCT) participates in the 1115 Waiver as an Anchor, as a Performing Provider for DSRIP, and also in the Uncompensated Care (UC) Program. Expenses for Anchor activities are maintained separately from any other administrative functions of the institution. UTHSCT participates in Medicaid, Medicare, and federal funding for graduate medical educati on programs; none of these programs provide administrative match.

The organization's DSRIP projects are all related to patient ca re, with no costs that could also be considered Anchor administration. Ther e are no Anchor administrative costs that could be claimed under other state or federal programs. RHP 3 is Texas' largest region and has included significan t detail in attached narrative for the staff involved in Anchor ad ministrative activities. RHP 4: Nueces County Hospital District (NC HD) participates in the 1115 Waiver as an Anchor. NCHD is not a provider for Medicaid, Medicare, or any other federal program, nor does it operate any healthcare facilities. The organization does not partic ipate in any programs that have administrative cost claiming. It is an IGT entity for DSRIP and Uncompensated Care. RHP 5: Hidalgo County is a local governme ntal entity and participates in the 1115 Waiver as an Anchor. It is also an IGT entity for funding for Uncompensated Care. Hidalgo County currently participat es in the Medicaid Administrative Claiming (MAC) program. Hidalgo C ounty is not planning to submit administrative costs at this time. Na rrative information is not included. RHP 6: The Bexar County Hospital District , doing business as University Health System (UHS), participates in th e 1115 Waiver as an Anchor, as a Performing Provider for DSRIP projects, and in UC. University Health System prepares an annual Medicare/Medicaid cost report and submits administrative reports as required th rough grants and research programs. UHS has proposed an indirect cost rate of 34.8 %, which is the current federal negotiated cost rate with th e Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) used for grants and research. RHP 7: The Travis County Healthcare Dist rict, doing business as Central Health, participates in the 1115 Waiver as an Anchor and IGT entity for DSRIP and UC. Central Health does not provide direct services but rather contracts with providers such as the Seton Healthcare Family. Central Health is the 51% owner of the Community Care Collabora tive (Seton Healthcare Family is 49% owner). The Community Care Colla borative is a performing provider for DSRIP projects. Central Health is al so the sole owner of Sendero Health Plan Medicaid Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).

The state is at risk for loss of FFP should an audit of this waiver find non-compliance with Federal statute, regulati ons, protocols, and guidance. State Response: Understood. Language is incorporated in Cost Principles that hold the Anchors to this same standard and risks. C. The state may be required to develop an admi nistrative claiming plan (protocol) that is described in a later section of this agreem ent and to amend its cost allocation plan. In order for the costs of administrative activities to be claimed as Medicaid administrative expenditures at the 50% FFP ra te, the state assures that the following requirements are understood and met: The state complies with all Fe deral statute, regulations a nd guidance for all claims for FFP. Costs are \"necessary for the proper and effici ent administration of the Medicaid State Plan\" (Section 1903(a)(7) of th e Social Security Act). If applicable, costs are allocated in accord ance with the relative benefits received by all programs, not just Medicaid. Claims for costs are not duplicate costs that have been, or should have been, paid for through another federal funding source or paid as part of a rate for direct medical services. State or local governmental agency cost s are supported by an allocation methodology under the applicable approved public assistance Cost Allo cation Plan (42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 433.34) submitted to the Division of Cost Allocation. Costs do not include funding for a portion of general public health initiatives that are made available to all persons, such as public health education campaigns. Costs do not include the overhead costs of ope rating a provider faci lity or otherwise include costs of a direct medi cal services to beneficiaries (these should be claimed as medical service costs, and not plan administration). Costs do not duplicate activities that are al ready being offered or should be provided by other entities, or th rough other programs. Costs are supported by adequate source documentation. Costs are not federally-funded or used for any other federal matching purposes. State Response: Attachment K Administrative Cost Claiming Protocol Part 1: RHP Anchor Administrative Costs Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program Demonstration Approval Period: December 12 , 2011 through September 30, 2016 Amendment Approved October 1, 2015 Page 444 of 454 Understood. As a result of the specific gui dance, the state has now added language to the Cost Principles that holds the Anchors to the above requirements. See new section I.E. entitled \"Core CMS requirements for cost allowability\" in the revised version of 1115 Waiver Cost Principles (reference Attachment A). D. Under the waiver, the state must: 1. Provide a detailed summary budget a nd a narrative description of all administrative expenditures for review and approval. State Response: The total net impact to the Federal gove rnment of the administrative claiming hereunder, after incorporating offsetting IGT, shows the 50% Federal match at $4.0 Million for DY2, and $5.1M for DY3. In terms of what they will be claiming (in total dollars, before the impact/offset of IGTs), the twenty RHPs report that they have spent $8.0M during DY2, and plan to spend $10.1M in DY3. Actual expenditures are higher, in that five RHPs plan to not claim administrative expenses hereunder. Most RHPs are far under their individual maximum allowed amounts, and the aggregate amount of administrative claimi ng is about one-third of the maximum state-wide amount allowed.

Th e time study requirements are described in the next section. State Response: Understood. Note: the State is not proposing time studies. B. Cost Allocation Methodology a nd/or Time Study Description The state will describe the methodology used to account for 100% of staff time (i.e., time study and/or sampling system) to allocate the staff time accordingly to multiple activities or cost objectives. The time study allocates the share of costs to administrative activities (both Medicaid and non-Medicaid) and direct medical services as well as all other funding sources that are not reimbursable under this administrative claiming protocol. The time study must be described in sufficient detail to include a description of each Medicaid and non-Medicaid codes (to allocate to other federal and non-federal programs) to account for 100% of staff time. The state and its partners are responsible to devel op a time study methodology and instructions to capture costs and reflect all of the time and activities performed by staff. The time study must include careful documentati on of all of the work performed by staff over a set period of time and is used to iden tify, measure and allocate staff time devoted to Medicaid reimbursable administrative activities. A Medicaid allocation statistic is applied to the resulting recognized administrative cost pool to determine Medicaid's reimbursable admi nistrative cost. Note: Overhead costs incurred that are an integral part of, or an extension of, the provision of services by medical providers, are to be included in the rate paid by the state or its fiscal agent for the medical service. These costs are not clai mable as administrative expenditures and there is no additional FFP availabl e under this section. In accordance with the statute, regulations and the Medicaid state plan, the state is required to maintain and retain source docum entation to support Medicaid payments for administrative activities. The basis of th is requirement can be found in statute and regulations.
