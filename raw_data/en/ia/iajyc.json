The distillery is where the magic happened. The lavender was loaded into huge vats (at least they looked huge to us little kids), and big furnaces sent steam up through the lavender. The steam collected in the col de cygne (swan-necked lid) and passed down through the serpentin (condenser coil), and by the time it was all said and done, the big heap of lavender had been transformed into a flask of golden-green liquid with a characteristically sweet fragrance. But if anybody had asked me back then about \"aromatherapy,\" I most likely would have responded with an incredulous \"A roma-what?\"\u2014or rather, \"Aroma-quoi?\" Our family doctor at the time prescribed more tisanes (herbal teas) and vitamins than antibiotics and painkillers, but if you had asked him about \"alternative medicine,\" he most likely Born in 1950, I grew up in a small farm in the Quercy region of southern France, at a time when the French countryside was about to undergo a radical transformation. My father was still plowing the earth with oxen when I was born, but he had bought his first tractor by the time I was three years old. We practiced subsistence farming, with a real menagerie of domestic animals, producing most of the food we needed for our own consumption, growing a little bit of everything, from the cash crops of wheat, oats, barley, and corn to all types of fruits and vegetables. We even had a small vineyard and a tiny plot of lavender. Harvests, the highlights of the year, were a feast for the senses, starting with hay at the end of spring, followed by cherries, wheat, oats, and barley all the way to grapes, corn, apples, and walnuts in autumn, but the lavender harvest was always my favorite. The whole family would gather in the field and start cutting as soon as the morning dew had dried.

He coined the term aromatherapy and published his seminal book on the subject in 1937. Jean Valnet was a French military surgeon posted to Tonkin from 1950 to 1953, during the Indochina War (which segued into the Vietnam War when the United States joined in and tried to outdo the French, with the same lack of success). The French army in Indochina often lacked even basic supplies, such as medicines and weaponry, and Valnet began experimenting with local essential oils and other aromatic and herbal preparations to treat the most severe wounds in his patients, with well above average results. His founding work, Aromath\u00e9rapie: Traitement des maladies par les essences des plantes, first published in 1964, and later published in English as The Practice of Aromatherapy, is still one of the primary references on the subject. I became familiar with aromatherapy in the mid-1970s, when I moved to the Jabron Valley, near Sisteron in the Provence region of southeastern France. Farmers there, who had been collecting medicinal plants and distilling essential oils for hundreds of years, had deep knowledge of their virtues. Every mother and grandmother had her special recipes to cure all types of ailments, and they were eager to share their knowledge, as the new generations were leaving this beautiful but impoverished region for the lure of the big cities. Staffed by my horse and a mischievous donkey, I started a small entreprise harvesting wild medicinal herbs and distilling all kinds of plant material. I liked experimenting. One of my neighbors was Henri Viaud, an eccentric and fascinating gentleman-farmer, distiller, and publisher, among other occupations, with a past worthy of a cloak-and-dagger novel. Another neighbor was Pierre Lieutaghi, a living botanical encyclopedia. From Henri, Pierre, and many others, I learned a lot about herbs and their power. I should mention Madam Garcin, an outspoken healer with a witch's tendencies, who held the secret to heal burns and snakebites, as well as an encyclopedic knowledge of folk medicine. Together with her son Gilles, I crisscrossed the Luberon valley and the adjoining Montagne de Lure (Lure Mountain) in search of linden, wild lavender, hyssop, thyme, savory, oregano, mugwort, wormwood, and all the bountiful aromatic and medicinal plants abounding in that region. I moved to Boulder, Colorado, in 1981, with a suitcase full of essential oils of my own production and a few diffusers. I was intent on starting a new aromatherapy venture in the United States, but when I approached prospective customers, I was met with an incredulous \"Aroma-what?\" punctuated by blank stares. It took me three months to make my first sale to an adventurous chiropractor who bought a diffuser and few essential oils for his waiting room. I soon realized that education was the key For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 11 2/11/20 12:32 PM xii Preface to the 30th Anniversary Edition and started giving lectures and seminars, first in front of sparse audiences, then in classrooms that began to fill up with eager students. I gave lectures and seminars all over the United States and all over the world, especially in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, and Indonesia. In Latin America, I gave seminars in Mexico, Buenos Aires, and even Campinas, near S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. I moved to Los Angeles in 1987 and joined forces with fellow aromatherapists and aromatherapy entrepreneurs to create the American AromaTherapy Association (AATA). I was charged with organizing the third AATA convention on April 29 and 30, 1990, with my then marketing director and future partner in teaching, my good friend Michael Scholes. Featuring the who's who of aromatherapy at the time\u2014 with speakers like Dr. Jean-Claude Lapraz and Dr. Daniel P\u00e9no\u00ebl, both from France; Patricia Davis, Jan Kusmirek, Robert Tisserand, and Valerie Worwood, from Yugal Luthra and Prakash Purohit of India; and Victoria Edwards, Avery Gilbert, Mindy Green, Kurt Schnaubelt, Michael Scholes, and myself from the USA\u2014the convention was a resounding success. Attendees came from all over the world, from Norway to New Zealand, Japan, China, and South Africa. The convention intended to build bridges and marked a turning point in the evolution of aromatherapy in the United States. Times have changed since the \"Aromawhat?\" and the blank stares!

Amazon offers hundreds of aromatherapy books and thousands of aromatherapy products by dozens of companies. And, yes, you may have guessed it, there is an app for it\u2014dozens of them, actually, for both Android and Apple mobile devices. There are aromatherapy hash tags, Facebook groups, Pinterest pages, countless YouTube videos, and on and on. A TV series on the subject, titled Everybody Nose, was produced in 2007, with thirty-five episodes. Aromatherapy has been featured on everything from The Oprah Winfrey Show to The Simpsons. It is everywhere! Grand View Research, a U.S.-based market research and consulting company, estimated the global aromatherapy market at $1.07 billion in 2016. Meanwhile, two major (and controversial) multilevel aromatherapy companies each claim to have broken $1 billion in yearly sales. But aromatherapy is more than just another health fad or marketing trend. Aromatherapy is now used in hospitals in several European countries, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. In the U.K., hospitals have aromatherapists on staff, and aromatherapy is included in 90 percent of palliative care. In France, pharmacies offer an extensive selection of essential oils, andaromatherapy is used in cancer care and geriatrics as a complementary treatment to improve quality of life for patients and to reduce anxiety and sleep disturbances. In the United States, the prestigious Mayo Clinic and many other hospitals offer aromatherapy care. In Latin America, my good friend, the unflagging Conie Bastar, has been preaching the aromatherapy gospel in Mexico for the past thirty years with her Instituto Mexicano de Aromaterapia. In 2001 Conie launched the \"Congreso Internacional de Aromaterapia\" with attendees from all over Latin America. Michael Scholes and I were guest speakers at the 2012, 2014, and 2017 congresses. To my great surprise, Brazil appears to be the country where aromatherapy is most widely implemented in Latin America. It is, to my knowledge, the only country to celebrate a Dia da Aromaterapia (Aromatherapy Day), which happens to be on December 19, Gattefoss\u00e9's birthday. The ministry of health approved the inclusion of aromatherapy in the Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS), the Brazilian public health care system, in early 2019. All public health clinics and doctors are now allowed to recommend aromatherapy to their patients. The original Aromatherapy Workbook was launched at Aromatherapy 1990, the third aromatherapy congress of the American AromaTherapy Association, which featured all the major experts from the United States and Europe. I would never have dreamed that my humble workbook would still be in print thirty years later. I felt humbled and honored when I was approached by the Laszlo Group in early 2018 with an invitation to be guest speaker at CIAROMA 2018, the third International For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 13 2/11/20 12:32 PM xiv Preface to the 30th Anniversary Edition Aromatology Congress. I was thrilled when the Laszlo Group then offered to publish an updated edition of the Aromatherapy Workbook in Portuguese, just in time for that congress. The new Portuguese edition is greatly enhanced and augmented, with no less than three new chapters, including one on comparative study of the modes of administration of essential oils and an entire section on the art of blending. The Portuguese edition also includes lots of visual elements: pictures and graphics. Having written all the updates to the Portuguese edition in English, an update to the U.S. edition was the logical next step. With the thirtieth anniversary of the original 1990 edition just around the corner, the publisher agreed to a Thirtieth Anniversary Edition that includes all the changes and additions to the Portuguese edition as well as a substantial rewriting of chapter 9, \"The Essential Oils in Botanical Families.\" This chapter has been updated to reflect the enormous progress of botany over the past thirty years thanks to genetics and DNA mapping. It has been expanded and reordered. Each botanical family now includes photographs of its most characteristic elements. Additional visuals have been included throughout the entire book to make it more attractive and engaging.

Robert Tisserand, who first spread the word in the English-speaking world. Especially Henri Viaud, a French distiller from Provence, who was the first to stress the importance of long, low-pressure distillation and the use of pure and natural essential oils from specified botanical origin and chemotypes and who has not always been credited for his contribution to aromatherapy. Viaud tried to distill practically everything that could be distilled. He was the first to produce and market oils such as St. John's wort and meadowsweet. He also revived the therapeutic use of floral waters. I learned a great deal from this wonderful hon\u00eate homme, with his amazing and refreshing curiosity and eagerness for new experiments. All humble producers who provide me with their oils. Daniel P\u00e9no\u00ebl for his pioneering work in medical aromatherapy.

When people first hear about aromatherapy, they think about fragrance and perfumes, an alluring world of imagination, magic, and fantasy. But aromatherapy consists simply of using essential oils for healing. Essential oils are volatile oily substances; they are highly concentrated vegetal extracts that contain hormones, vitamins, antibiotics, and antiseptics. In a way, essential oils represent the spirit or soul of the plant. They are the most concentrated form of herbal energy. Many plants produce essential oils, which are contained in tiny droplets between cells and play an important role in the biochemistry of the plants. They are also responsible for the fragrance of the plants. Essential oils are used in cosmetics and pharmacy as well as in perfumery. Their field of activity is quite wide, from deep therapeutic action to the extreme subtlety of genuine Aromatherapy has known tremendous growth since this book was first published in 1990. It has now become a buzzword, used and abused by marketers and manufacturers of all types and credentials. The availability of essential oils and aromatherapy products has increased dramatically through all types of sources and distribution channels, from health food stores to spas and beauty salons and even department stores and pharmacies. Products with aromatherapy claims (but not much more) can be found in the mass market. With ever increasing media coverage and celebrities swearing by it, aromatherapy is more fashionable than ever. But aromatherapy is not just a new trend, a new thing to do, as those who are involved in it can testify. In Europe, where it began more than sixty years ago, aromatherapy is practiced by medical doctors, nurses, and other health professionals. It is taught to medical students in France and is used by some English nurses in their hospitals.

They are used externally Aromatherapy can be used on many differ- in frictions (localized massage), massage, and ent levels. Essential oils are extremely versatile inhalations. Finally, they are ingredients of materials: they are both medicine and fragrance; numerous cosmetics and perfumes. Essential oils can have strictly allopathic effects (meaning that they act like regular medicines); more subtle effects, like those of Bach flower remedies of homeopathic preparations; and psychological and spiritual effects, which constitute their most traditional use. They are also powerful antiseptics and antibiotics that are not dangerous for the body. Aromatherapy is thus, in many cases, an excellent alternative to more aggressive therapies. Essential oils are the \"quintessences\" of the alchemists. In this sense, they condense the spiritual and vital forces of the plants in a material form; this power acts on the biological level to strengthen the natural defenses they can cure the most severe physical condition and can reach to the depth of our souls. Before you start reading this book, though, I warn you: once you step into the world of essences, you will be exposed to one of the most delightful and harmless forms of addiction. Chances are that you will want to know more and more about this amazing healing art. If you allow yourself to be touched by the power of these wonderful substances, you will discover a new world that is actually very old\u2014the almost-forgotten world of nature's fragrances. This is a world without words, a world of images, that you explore from the tip of your nose to the center of your brain\u2014a world of subtle surprise and silent ecstasy. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 2 2/11/20 12:32 PM ONE Aromatics and Perfumes in History Since the earliest ages of humanity, aromatic fumigations have been used in daily rituals and during religious ceremonies as an expression and a reminder of an all-pervasive sacredness. Fragrance has been seen as a manifestation of divinity on the earth, a connection between human beings and the gods, medium and mediator, emanation of matter and manifestation of spirit. In a sense, the origins of aromatherapy can be traced back to the origins of humanity. Some anthropologists believe that the appearance of some form of rituals is the defining moment in the emergence of human culture. Since their origins, rituals have always involved fumigations and the burning of aromatic herbs and woods. Rituals were used mostly in healing ceremonies. What a great intuition! By burning aromatic substances, fumigations diffuse essential oils, which have an antiseptic effect, into the air, bringing about physical healing. At the same time, the fragrance acts on a subtle level for psychic and spiritual healing. AROMATIC MEDICINE IN EGYPT For Review Only The origin of aromatherapy is usually attributed to ancient Egypt and India. I would date it back to the fabulous and mysterious Kingdom of Sheba, located in the part of the world now called Ethiopia. Ethiopia is considered the cradle of humanity, where the most ancient remains of our distant ancestors have been found. The Kingdom of Sheba, the \"land of milk and honey,\" was a very prosperous country of the high antiquity. In particular, it controlled the production of the very precious frankincense and myrrh and the trade in spices coming by caravan from India and then by boat through the Red Sea. Sheba is the land from where the three magi came to greet the infant Christ with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, the three most precious substances of the time. There is also the fabulous story of the Queen of Sheba. While the Kingdom of Sheba 3 EsOiAr.indd 3 2/11/20 12:32 PM 4 Aromatics and Perfumes in History For Review Only Aromatic Medicine in Egypt EsOiAr.indd 4 2/11/20 12:32 PM Aromatics and Perfumes in History 5 For Review Only The Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon by Gustave Dor\u00e9, 1866 controlled the trade in frankincense and myrrh, the Queen of Sheba was doing a very hefty business with a tiny kingdom called Israel. Located at the outskirts of the known world, Israel was ruled by a king by the name of Solomon, whose fame had reached all the way to Sheba. The queen was known to be immensely rich and Solomon had promised EsOiAr.indd 5 his god, Yahweh, to build a temple the likes of which had never been seen on the face of the earth. But the tiny kingdom was broke. Solomon sent emissaries to the queen, trying to borrow some gold from her. The queen was intrigued. She decided to undertake the perilous journey across the unforgiving desert to meet her client and potential debtor. 2/11/20 12:32 PM 6 Aromatics and Perfumes in History The queen was young and courageous, and her beauty was stunning. Solomon fell desperately in love with her at first sight. Under the spell of the queen's magnificent beauty, he neglected his wives and concubines, and even the governing of his kingdom. The queen eventually decided to return to her kingdom, bearing Solomon's child. Solomon never recovered from his lost love and tried to lose himself in debauchery. He also composed the very famous \"Song of Songs,\" one of the most beautiful and erotic love poems in human literature. There is evidence that the Egyptians borrowed some of their religious and political system from the land of Sheba. In Egypt, medicine was inseparable from religion, and healing always took place in both body and mind. The use of perfumes and aromatics was originally a privilege of the pharaohs and the high priests. The priests developed a very sophisticated pharmacy, using large quantities of aromatics, which were also used for the preparation and preservation of mummies. The Egyptians made extensive use of substances such as myrrh and frankincense, as well as rose and jasmine. These products were so precious that they were traded as currency. The Egyptians are considered the inventors of Western medicine, pharmacy, and cosmetology. Parallel with the development of medicine and pharmacy, they also developed very refined techniques for skin care, creating beauty recipes that have endured to the present day. Aromatics were the major active ingredients in their skin care preparations. Cleopatra, of course, is leg- endary for her use of cosmetic preparations and perfumes to enhance her beauty and her powers of seduction. When she sailed to greet the Roman emperor Marc Anthony, the sails of her ship were soaked in jasmine, one of the most aphrodisiac fragrances. Marc Anthony fell so deeply in love with Cleopatra that he gave up his empire to follow her. Aromatic medicine emerged from the shade of smoky temples in Egypt\u2014the birthplace of medicine, perfumery, and pharmacy\u2014more than six thousand years ago. The precious substances came from all parts of the world, carried by caravan or by boat: cedar from Lebanon; roses from Syria; and spikenard, myrrh, frankin-cense, labdanum, and cinnamon from Babylon, Ethiopia, Somalia, and even Persia and India. The priest supervised the preparations in the temples, reading the formulas and chanting incantations, while the students mixed the ingredients. Pulverization, maceration, and other operations could continue for months until the right subtle fragrance was obtained for ceremonial use. But spiritual matters were not the only concern of the Egyptians. They attached the greatest importance to health and hygiene and were thoroughly familiar with the effect of perfumes and aromatic substances on the body and the psyche. Many preparations were used for both their fragrant quality and their healing power. Kephi, for example, a perfume of universal fame, was an antiseptic, a balsamic, and a tranquilizer that could be taken internally.

Their products were renowned all over the civilized world. The Phoenician merchants exported Egyptian unguents, scented oils, creams, and aromatic wines all over the Mediterranean world and the Arabic peninsula and thereby enhanced the fame and wealth of Egypt. Embalming was one of the main uses of aromatics. Bodies were filled with perfumes, resins, and fragrant preparations after removal of the internal organs. So strong is the antiseptic power of essential oils that the tissues are still well preserved thousands of years later. In the seventeenth century, mummies were sold in Europe, and doctors distilled them and used them as ingredients in numerous medicines. The use of aromatics spread from Egypt to Israel, Greece, Rome, and the whole Mediterranean world. Every culture and civilization, from the most primitive to the most sophisticated, developed its own practice of perfumery and cosmetics. India is probably the only place in the world where this tradition was never lost. With over ten thousand years of continuous practice, Ayurvedic medicine is the oldest continuous form of medical practice. The Vedas, the most sacred books of India and among the oldest known books, mention over seven hundred different products, such as cinnamon, spikenard, coriander, ginger, myrrh, and sandalwood. The Vedas codify the uses of perfumes and aromatics for liturgical and therapeutic purpose. DISTILLATION AND ALCHEMY In Europe, the advent of Christianity and the fall of the Roman Empire marked the beginning of a long period of barbarism and a general decline of all knowledge. Revival came from the Arabic countries with the birth of Islam. Intellectual and cultural activity flourished, as did the arts. Arabic civilization attained an unequaled degree of refinement. The philosophers devoted themselves to the old hermetic art of alchemy, whose origin was attributed to the Egyptian god Tehuti. They renewed the use of aromatics in medicine and perfumery and perfected the techniques. The great philosopher Avicenna invented the refrigerated coil, a real breakthrough in the art of distillation. Alchemy, which was probably introduced to Europe by the Crusaders on their way back from the Holy Land, was primarily a spiritual quest, and the different operations performed by the adept were symbolic of the processes taking place within the alchemist. Distillation was the symbol of purification and the concentration of spiritual forces. In the alchemist's vision, everything, from sand and stones to plants and people, was made up of a physical body, a soul, and a spirit. In accordance with the basic principle of solve and coagula (dissolve and coagulate), the art of spagyrie consisted of dissolving the physical body and condensing the soul and spirit, which had all the curative power, into the quintes- For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 8 2/11/20 12:32 PM Aromatics and Perfumes in History 9 sences. The material was distilled over and over to remove all impurities, and the final products were highly potent medicines. With the expansion of this mysterious art, more and more substances were treated for the extraction of essences. These quintessences were the basis of most medicines, and for centuries essential oils remained the only remedies for epidemic diseases. THE RENAISSANCE, DECLINE, AND REBIRTH During the Renaissance, the use of essential oils expanded into perfumery and cosmetics. With further progress in the arts of chemistry and distillation, the production of elixirs, balms, scented waters, fragrant oils, and unguents for medicine and skin care flourished. Nicholas Lemery, the personal physician of Louis XIV, described many such preparations in the Dictionnaire des drogues simples. Some have survived until now: melissa water, arquebuse water, and the famous Cologne water, for instance, are still produced. The arrival of modern science in the nineteenth century marked the decline of all forms of herbal therapy. The early scientists had a simplistic and somewhat naive vision of the world. When the first plant alkaloids were discovered, scientists thought it better to keep only the main active principals of the plants and then reproduce them in laboratories. Thus they discovered and reproduced penicillin (from a natural mold growing on bread), aspirin (naturally present in birch, wintergreen, and meadowsweet), antibiotics, and so on. Without denying the obvious value of many scientific discoveries, we must acknowledge that the narrow vision of the allopathic medical profession has led to some abuses. Microorganisms adapt to antibiotics much faster than does the human body, making antibiotics inefficient as well as dangerous to the body. Corticosteroids have dreadful side effects; hypnotics, antidepressants, and amphetamines are highly addictive; and so on. THE BIRTH OF MODERN AROMATHERAPY: AROMATHERAPY IN FRANCE Aromatherapy per se was formally developed in France in the late 1920s and grew into a mainstream movement in Europe. The term itself was coined by a French chemist by the name of Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9. As the story goes, Mr. Gattefoss\u00e9, who was a chemist working for the perfume industry, burned his hand in an explosion in his laboratory. A vat full of lavender oil was nearby, and he plunged his hand into it. The pain disappeared instantly, and he recovered so fast that he decided to investigate further the healing power of essential oils. Thus was born modern aromatherapy. I personally have experienced the quasimiraculous effect of lavender oil on burns on several occasions. A few years ago, while cooking asparagus in a pressure cooker, I spilled more than half a gallon of boiling water on my feet and legs. I removed my socks promptly For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 9 2/11/20 12:32 PM 10 Aromatics and Perfumes in History For Review Only Author's personal collection of perfume bottles and applied lavender neat on the whole area and continued applying it every ten to fifteen m inutes for a few hours. Not only did the pain disappear, but I never blistered or lost skin! Likewise, when my daughter was twelve EsOiAr.indd 10 years old, she fell asleep on the beach on a very hot summer day. She had forgotten to use any sunscreen, and the Southern California sun was implacable. She came home redder than a lobster. I instantly applied to her face and 2/11/20 12:32 PM Aromatics and Perfumes in History 11 For Review Only Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9, 1940s body an oil that contains lavender, marjoram, and neroli in an oil base of sweet almond, hazelnut, and vitamin E. I continued applying it every hour for the first evening and then twice a day for a few days. Again, my daughter didn't blister or peel. Back to the 1920s: the curative power of essential oils was well known at that time, and many essential oils belonged to the European pharmacopoeia (and still do), which means that they are classified as active medical ingredients. The French emphasized the medical uses of aromatherapy and conducted extensive research on the antiseptic and antibiotic use of essential oils. Aromatherapy is taught in med- schools and is practiced by medical doctors and naturopaths. Dr. Jean Valnet widely contributed to the popularity of aromatherapy in the 1960s and '70s. The major figures of the 1980s and '90s were the conservative Drs. Lapraz, Belaiche, and Duraffourd on the one hand, defenders of medical orthodoxy, and Pierre Franchomme, a creative but controversial pioneer, who struck gold in the '90s when he was hired by Est\u00e9e Lauder to create the \"Origins\" line. A former Franchomme associate, Dr. Daniel P\u00e9no\u00ebl, also started working on his own to develop his special techniques on Jean Valnet (1920-1995) 2/11/20 12:32 PM 12 Aromatics and Perfumes in History the basis of \"live embalming,\" a massage of the body with pure essential oils. The French have developed the skin care uses of aromatherapy since the 1980s and '90s. French aestheticians have grown increasingly attracted to aromatherapy, thanks mostly to lines like Decl\u00e9or. The French in general, even in the skin care area, tend to use much higher dosages and concentrations than do other European practitioners. Preparations with 10 percent essential oils are not unheard of for professional products, resulting in products that must be used with extreme caution by highly trained professionals. Essential oils and aromatherapy products can be found in all health food stores and many pharmacies and have a stable following. Still, aromatherapy in France has never made headlines the way it has in the United States or the United Kingdom. The European aromatherapy market evolved in various countries along quite different lines, with each country developing one specific area of application. Only now do we see some overlapping of the various approaches. British aromatherapy began in the 1950s with Marguerite Maury, a French cosmetologist who lived in London and emphasized uses in skin care and massage, with esoteric undertones. She gave British aromatherapy the spiritualist undertones that it still retains. The major figures in the United Kingdom are Robert Tisserand, Patricia Davis, Shirley Price, and Valerie Worwood. Aromatherapy has become extremely popular in the United Kingdom since the late 1980s, when it was known that its adepts included Ms. Thatcher and the royal family, from Princess Diana and Fergie to Prince Charles. The royals are still adepts of aromatherapy; Meghan Markle swears by tea tree oil. She had the walls of the nursery painted with rosemary-infused vegan paint to welcome baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Aromatherapy is now a well-developed movement in the United Kingdom, expanding in the health fields through nurses; a group of dedicated nurses gives aromatherapy massage to patients in British hospitals. If the French can be somewhat reckless, the British tend to be overly cautious. Dosages rarely exceed a few drops per ounce. Their list of contraindications seems to be growing by the day, with no scientific or anecdotal evidence to sustain it. As pointed out by a frustrated aromatherapist in a recent debate on the subject, there is still not one single reported accident involving essential oils in the United Kingdom. Curiously, the Europeans have yet to really discover the effect of essential oils as fragrances. Americans, on the other hand, tend to see aromatherapy as the use of fragrances for their mood-enhancing effects, which after all is the most obvious effect of essential oils. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 12 AROMATHERAPY IN THE UNITED STATES Aromatherapy did not exist in any significant way in the United States until the early 1980s. In fact, when I first moved here in 1981, aromatherapy was still virtually unknown. 2/11/20 12:32 PM Aromatics and Perfumes in History 13 The aromatherapy movement in the United States can be separated into two very different approaches: a genuine approach and a mass-market approach. Genuine aromatherapy is education driven and aims at achieving a synthesis of the various approaches of aromatherapy, which have flourished primarily in Europe. This approach is based on the study of essential oils as chemical substances as well as fragrances. It integrates the various effects of essential oils as healing and curative agents for the body with their properties on the energy and mental levels. Genuine aromatherapy aims to develop practical techniques that integrate the various effects of the oils in a synergistic way. It encompasses body care, skin care, and massage and touches every aspect of daily life. It is part of a natural way of life, an art de vivre, that integrates body, mind, and spirit and is geared more toward maintaining health more than curing diseases. Interest in genuine aromatherapy has been growing steadily over the years and is now booming exponentially. The spa, massage, and skin care markets, as well as the health food market, are the most receptive to the concept. Mass marketers are always looking for the next new trend, and with aromatherapy, they may have found a cash cow. This has given birth to a rather reduced and oversimplified version of aromatherapy, focusing on the uses of fragrances (and not necessarily natural essential oils) for their mood-enhancing properties. Americans are without a doubt massmarketing geniuses, but the contribution of CocaCola and McDonald's to the fine art of cuisine is questionable, to say the least. While aromatherapy is now under the spotlight of the mass media, receiving intense coverage, there is a danger that it might very well be emptied of its substance in the process. However, the media and the public in general are much more sophisticated today than they ever were. We can hope that genuine aromatherapy will take advantage of the momentum created by mass media to promote the real thing. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 13 2/11/20 12:32 PM TWO Aromatherapy A Multilevel Therapy SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND MODERN AROMATHERAPY The Antiseptic Power of Essential Oils After Pasteur, belief in external agents (microbes, spores, viruses) as the cause of diseases became the basic assumption of official medicine. It was natural, in this context, that the first studies of essential oils should concern their antiseptic properties. Koch himself studied the action of turpentine on Bacillus anthracis in 1881; in 1887 Chamberland studied the action of the essential oils of oregano, cinnamon, and clove buds. Other studies by Rideal and Walker and Kellner and Kober proposed different methods of measuring the antiseptic power of essential oils in direct contact or in their vaporized states. For Review Only Modern aromatherapy was born at the turn of the century with the works of the French chemist R. M. Gattefoss\u00e9 and has since attracted interest in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. Many studies have been conducted by laboratory scientists and by practicing therapists. Most of this research, somewhat constrained by the dominant scientific ideology, almost exclusively concerns the antiseptic and antibiotic powers of essentia l oi ls and their allopathic properties. Since the early 1980s, however, in part thanks to the work of Dr. Schwartz at Yale University, and of professors Dodd and Van Toller at Warwick University in England, a better understanding of the mechanisms of olfaction has opened new, exciting avenues for research and experimentation in aromatherapy. The Aromatogram With the aromatogram, Dr. Maurice Girault went one step further and provided a useful tool for prescription and diagnosis. Girault, a French gynecologist and obstetrician, studied 14 EsOiAr.indd 14 2/11/20 12:32 PM Aromatherapy 15 the effects of essential oils and tinctures (in association with other natural therapies\u2014homeopathy, minerals, etc.) in gynecology for years. The results of his work were published in Trait\u00e9 de Phytotherapie et d'Aromatherapie, Volume 3, Gynecologie (Belaiche and 1979). In the aromatogram, vaginal secretions on a swab are tested against several essential oils to determine which oil is the most efficient against the specific microorganism. This method was extended to all infectious disease by French aromatherapy doctors Pradal, Belaiche, Andou, and Durrafourd. It had the advantage of dealing with real germs coming from real sites in real patients, rather than from laboratories. VIRTUALLY NO RESISTANCE PHENOMENA results. According to Jean Valnet, microorganisms show no resistance to essential oils. Recent research on the subject suggests that resistance occurs, but to a far lesser degree than to synthetic antibiotics. This makes sense, as essential oils have a more complex structure and moreover are produced by the defense mechanisms of the plant. The Power of Living Substances The real interest of essential oils in medicine lies in their action on the site. Even if they could easily and advantageously be replaced by synthetic products for their antiseptic uses, these synthetics would always be awkward in their interaction with the body as a whole, even though synthetics are chemical reconstructions of components naturally occurring in essential oils. For Review Only For all their imperfections and limitations, the various methods of analyzing the germicidal power of essential oils have given scientific validation to aromatherapy. The action of essences on microorganisms is now better understood: essences inhibit certain metabolic functions of microorganisms, such as growth and multiplication, eventually destroying them if the inhibition continues. Even though there is general agreement on the antiseptic power of essential oils, different authors classify them differently by their antigenetic properties. Since essential oils are products of life, their chemical composition depends on so many factors that it is impossible to obtain exactly the same essence twice. Therefore, different analyses will give different EsOiAr.indd 15 2/11/20 12:33 PM 16 Aromatherapy Essential oils have hundreds of chemical components, most of them in very small amounts. We know that certain trace elements are fundamental for life. In the same way, the power of living products lies in the combination of their elements, and their trace components are at least as important as their main components. No synthetic reconstruction can fully replicate a natural product. It is thus very important to always use natural essential oils. A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE The human body is a whole, and the interactions taking place between the whole, its parts, and the environment are regulated according to a principle of equilibrium called homeostasis. Homeostasis is an autoregulation process that is ensured by substances such as hormones and the secretions of endocrine glands controlled by the corticohypothalamo-hypophyseal complex. Any external or internal aggression brings a compensatory regulation (hyper- or hypofunctioning) and an imbalance that provokes a defense reaction; the ingestion of chemicals often creates such an imbalance. In disease, chemotherapy consists of answering one aggression with another, creating a state of war highly prejudicial to the battleground\u2014the human body! We depend on plants in every domain\u2014 food, energy, and oxygen\u2014and there is between plants and humans a complementary relationship. We are part of the same whole, which is life itself. This is why plants are not aggressive to the body. (Only abuse of plants can be aggressive.) Hippocrates, the father of occidental medicine, founded his practice on two basic principles: the principles of similarities (treat the same with the same, the poison with the poison) and the principle of oppositions (find antidotes). The latter, quite straightforward in its application, is the basis of modern medicine (allopathy). The former requires intuition and subtlety; it inspired the theory of similarities as formulated by the great alchemist and philosopher Paracelsus in the Middle Ages. It is also the basic principle of homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine. From observing the morphology of plants and their different characteristics (their taste, their scent, the environment and soil in which they grow, and their overall vibration), Paracelsus could predict their therapeutic indications. Rudolph Steiner and the anthroposophists adopted the same methods. Their findings have been amazingly accurate and have been largely confirmed by scientific research. Theories of information and genetics, dealing with the issues of order and chaos, give further justification to such an approach. According to these theories, adaptability and mobility in the use of information are among the chief characteristics of life. A living system (a cell, an organism, a colony of insects, a social group) starts with a certain range of potentials that become actual in a feedback process with the environment. Thus, the embryo and the human being develop from a single primordial cell by differentiation. Life, on the other hand, apparently uses universal structures (such as For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 16 2/11/20 12:33 PM Aromatherapy 17 chromosomic or enzymatic structures). Living systems seem able to \"borrow\" information from other living systems; to some extent, they are able to incorporate alien information. If the clue to recovery lies within oneself, it should be very beneficial to give the right kind of information to the body. Therefore, close investigation of the role of essential oils in plants will help us understand their curative power, while the observation of specific plants will tell us about the healing properties of each individual oil. Essential oils evidently play a key role in the biochemistry of the plants; they are like the hormones contained in small \"bags\" located between the cells, and they act as regulators and messengers. They catalyze biochemical reactions, protect the plant from parasites and diseases, and play an important role in fertilization. (Orchids, the most fascinating family of plants, have developed this process to a high degree, attracting the most suitable insects to carry precious pollen to their remote sexual partners.) Essential oils carry information between the cells and are related to the hormonal response of the plant to stressful situations. They are agents of the plant's adaptation to its environment. It is not surprising, then, that they contain hormones. Sage, traditionally known to regulate and promote menstruation, contains estrogen. Ginseng, a well-known tonic and aphrodisiac, contains substances similar to estrone. Estrogens can also be found in parsley, hops, and licorice. Rosemary increases the secretion of bile and facilitates its excretion. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 17 2/11/20 12:33 PM 18 Aromatherapy Essential oils control the multiplication and renewal of cells. They have cytophilactic and healing effects on the human body (especially lavender, geranium, garlic, hyssop, and sage). According to Jean Valnet, they have anticarcinogenic properties. They are often present in the outer part of leaves, in the skin of citrus fruits, and in the bark of certain trees. Cosmetic applications are among their oldest uses. Most aromatic plants grow in dry areas, and the essential oils in them are produced by solar activity. In the anthroposophic vision, essential oils are the manifestation of the cosmic fire forces. They are produced by the plant's cosmic self. In them, matter dissolves into warmth. Therefore, they are indicated for diseases originating in the astral body. and more acute, and there is a feeling of having, to a certain extent, outstripped events . . . It might even be said that the emotional trouble which in general obscures our perception is practically suppressed. Anatomy of Olfaction Research conducted in Europe, the United States, and the former Soviet Union reveals that the effects of odors on the psyche may be more important than scientists have suspected. The University of Warwick, England, has conducted fascinating research on this subject (see Theimer, Fragrance Chemistry: The Science of the Sense of Smell). Figure 2.1 illustrates the anatomy of olfaction. The sense of smell acts mostly on a subconscious level; the olfactory nerves are directly connected to the most primitive part of the brain, the limbic system\u2014our connection with our remote saurian ancestors, our distant reptile cousins. In a sense, the olfactory nerve is an extension of the brain itself, which can then be reached directly through the nose. This is the only such open gate to the brain. The limbic system, originally known as the rhinecephalon (\"smell brain\"), is the part of the brain that regulates the sensorimotor activity and deals with the primitive drives of sex, hunger, and thirst. Stimulation of the olfactory bulb sends electrical signals to the area of the limbic system concerned with visceral and behavioral mechanisms; they directly affect the digestive and sexual systems and emotional behavior. In fact, the brain's electrical response For Review Only AROMATICS AND THE SOUL Aromatherapy acts at different levels. There is first an allopathic action due to the chemical composition of the essential oils and their antiseptic, stimulant, calming, antineuralgic, or other properties. There is a more subtle action at the level of information, similar to the action of homeopathic or anthropsophic remedies. Last but not least, essential oils act on the mind. In fact, they are most traditionally used as basic ingredients of perfumes. Generally speaking, pleasant odors have obvious uplifting effects. According to Marguerite Maury in The Secret of Life and Youth: Of the greatest interest is the effect of fragrances on the psychic and mental state of the individual. Power of perception becomes clearer EsOiAr.indd 18 2/11/20 12:33 PM Aromatherapy 19 2. Transmission 3. Hypothalamus 1. Reception Pituitary Olfactory Cortex Thalamus Neocortex For Review Only Fig. 2.1. The Anatomy of Olfaction to odors is about the same as the one correlated with emotions. (In the French language the same verb, sentir, is used for \"to smell\" and \"to feel.\") The processes of olfactory reception are largely unconscious; we are mostly unaware of our scent environment. For some yet-unexplained reason, whenever we are in contact with a new odor, we lose our consciousness of it after a while. The electrical signals correlated to this odor still continue to reach the brain, but the contacts with our conscious centers have been shut off. This shows how little control our conscious centers have on the olfactory stimulations. The sense of smell is very sensitive: we can detect up to one part of fragrant material in EsOiAr.indd 19 10,000 billion parts or more. A trained nose can differentiate several hundred different odors. However, we have no proper vocabulary to talk about odors. We say that something smells like a rose, strawberry, skunk, or whatever. The olfactory nerves terminate in a part of the brain that does not use the same kind of logic as our intellectual centers. Although odors form a kind of communication system, they cannot be developed as a language; they work through associations and images and are not analytical. In Perfumery: The Psychology and Biology of Fragrance (Van Toller and Dodd, eds.), E. Douek describes various olfactory abnormalities. According to the author, anosmia, the total 2/11/20 12:33 PM 20 Aromatherapy inability to smell, is always accompanied by some elements of depression, which can often become severe. With loss of the sense of smell, people also lose the sense of taste. The world becomes dull and colorless. Even more interesting is parosmia, or olfactory illusion (usually related to a perception of bad odors). In such cases, shy and withdrawn people tend to feel that the unpleasant odors they perceive emanate from themselves, while people with paranoid tendencies perceive them as coming from others. The latter suspect imaginary plots in their associates and generally show tyrannical tendencies. According to Douek, the French king Louis XI suffered from this affliction. He was very good at filling up his prisons and inventing sophisticated tortures to obtain confessions from his victims. It might be instructive to investigate the olfactory sanity of the most prominent tyrants throughout history! also substances like sandalwood (remarkably similar, according to the author, to androsterol, a male human pheromone). According to G. H. Dodd, humans secrete musk-like molecules, and therefore we experience this type of odor in utero, which could explain the universal liking for it. The main function of perfumes would then be to heighten and fortify natural odors, rather than to cover them. The connection between olfaction and the sexual system takes place through the hypothalamic region. According to Stoddart: The hypothalamic region is a major receiver of olfactory neurons, and releases a variety of . . . hormones which pass to the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system, and induces the pituitary to secrete the suite of hormones which governs and controls the mammalian sexual cycles. For Review Only Olfactory System and Sexual Mechanisms Mammals release sexual olfactory signals called pheromones through specialized scent-producing apocrine glands. In humans, most of these glands are located in the circumanal and anogenital region, the chest and the abdomen, and around the nipples, with some variations between the different races. D. M. Stoddart notes in Perfumery: The Psychology and Biology of Fragrance (Van Toller and Dodd, eds.) that most perfumes contain ingredients that mimic these sexual olfactory signals, such as civet, musk, or castoreum, and EsOiAr.indd 20 The synchronization of menstrual periods in girls' boarding schools is a well-known phenomenon. Several studies have shown that such synchronicity could be caused by axillary secretions (i.e., by pheromones). In another now-famous experiment, set up in a kindergarten, children playing near a pile of T-shirts worn by their mothers could accurately find their own mother's T-shirt within a very short time. Most of them would then retire to a corner with the T-shirt and quiet down. Although this experiment is not directly concerned with sexual matters, it shows the strong olfactory component of the mother-infant bond. It is also worth noting that breastfed babies develop 2/11/20 12:33 PM Aromatherapy 21 a much stronger olfactory bond to their mother than do bottle-fed ones. The Gate to the Soul When Sigmund Freud opened the Pandora's box of the unconscious at the beginning of this century, he suspected sexual drives to be the central feature of the show being played on our private stage. He considered the repression of smell to be a major cause of mental illness and suspected that the nose was related to the sexual organs. (Allergy to odors is a psychosomatic disease.) If psychoanalysis and its avatars are to explore the unconscious from the mental side, the nose and the sense of smell give access to Pandora's box from the other side: the unknown side, the saurian side, from the origin of ages. The subtle emanations create a diffuse network that connects us to the unconscious of species, and to life itself. The strongest and deepest experiences are often accompanied by olfactory sensations. All traditions, even the most puritan, have known the power of fragrances; every religion knew their ceremonial use (usually in connection with sounds and colors) to generate elation among the faithful. Mystics or visionaries experience heavenly fragrances in their deepest ecstasy. Such people may eventually die in the \"odor of sanctity.\" Fragrances can bring about the deepest but most fugitive sensations. Like happiness, or love, or laughter, they catch you, almost by surprise, and fade away as soon as you try to grasp them. As you walk along the street, pull out the weeds in your backyard, hike on a trail, or sip your coffee, a mysterious emanation suddenly strikes your nose and the magic unfolds. In an instant of rapture, waves of delight run through your entire body, bringing about images and new sensations. But if you try to analyze what is going on, the experience disappears like a soap bubble; if you try to talk about it, you will soon fall short of words. According to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the sense of smell is imagination itself. Some authors needed olfactory sensations to stimulate their creativity. Guy de Maupassant, for instance, used to soak strawberries in a bowl of ether. Schillar filled the top drawer of his desk with ripe apples. The sense of smell is closely related to memory; olfactory memories are very accurate and almost indelible. A French psychoanalyst, Andr\u00e9 Virel, used fragrance to bring forth hidden memories. The odor and taste of a madeleine dipped in a cup of tea inspired Marcel Proust to write one of the most remarkably precise and vivid works of introspection, and a masterpiece of literature. We probably all have our own private madeleines. Syringa, to me, is one of the most heavenly fragrances. It transports me to a space of undisturbed peacefulness where I can vividly recall the vegetable garden of my early childhood, with its fallen trellis, its dry wall above the dirt road leading to the spring, and its basin of fresh running water. There is a huge fig tree in the corner just above the road and stone shed, falling in ruins on the other side with a bush of syringa in the middle. I am leaning against the For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 21 2/11/20 12:33 PM 22 Aromatherapy bush now in full bloom; I have been here for hours. Out there, behind the stone arch, is the farm, and then the world. But here, the warm and gentle sun of May envelops my frail body; the divine fragrance of syringa bathes my soul. I am totally at home. Why should I ever move? PSYCHOTHERAPY AND AROMATHERAPY: A WIDE OPEN FIELD Since the olfactory system is such an open gate to the subconscious, one would expect that psychotherapy could benefit from the use of olfactory stimuli for the cure of psychological disorders. Very little research has been done in this area, however, possibly because it is hard to systematize any kind of therapeutic procedure. The sense of smell is very private. Each individual's associations are different. Dr. A. D. Armond, for instance, reported the case of an anxious patient who worked on motor bikes and kept an oily washer in his pocket for comfort in times of stress. Still, aromatherapy can offer some valuable tools to the practitioner. Oils such as neroli, lavender, marjoram, rose, and ylang-ylang have been traditionally used for their calming effects in stress reduction. Jasmine is a wonderful uplifting oil for the treatment of depression or anxiety, and there are many more (see chapter 8 and appendices I and II). Diffusion is probably one of the best methods of using essential oils in this way. One procedure often used by therapists is to prepare an appropriate blend of oils to use during the therapeutic session. The patient can then use the same blend at home to further the treatment. This method is particularly efficient when used in conjunction with any technique conducive to deep relaxation (such as hypnosis, meditation, yoga, or certain types of massage), as the olfactory stimuli are then more likely to have a deep impact on the patient. Obviously, psychoaromatherapy (a term coined by Robert Tisserand) is still a wideopen field, where experimentation should be encouraged. With minimal caution, no adverse side effects can be expected from the use of aroma in psychotherapy, while the potential benefits appear to be unlimited. I am personally very curious about any finding in this fascinating domain and invite my therapist readers to share their experience in this area with me. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 22 UN JE NE SAIS QUOI, UN PRESQUE RIEN Essential oils and fragrances have been extensively used for well-being\u2014one of the main keys to health\u2014since the beginning of civilization. Vladimir Jankelevitch, a French philosopher who gave cooking classes to his delighted students in the venerable Sorbonne, talked about un je ne sais quoi, un presque rien (\"an I-don'tknow-what, an almost-nothing\") to characterize the subtle quality of an art de vivre, which can be extended to the basic jubilation of just being alive. This je ne sais quoi, this presque rien that is the mark of genuine art, of elegance, of humor, which differentiates a real meal from a mere quantity of proteins, calories, vitamins, 2/11/20 12:33 PM Aromatherapy 23 and minerals, describes perfectly the contribution of fragrances to the quality of life. It is unpredictable, it cannot be analyzed by any scientific method, and yet it can be experienced. According to Goethe, the most evolved plants go through a transformation from the primitive germ to the exuberance of the flower in a natural movement toward spirituality where the flower, in its impermanence and openness, represents an instant of rapture and jubilation. Fragrance is a manifestation of this jubilation. Fragrances have their own language. Better than any word, they can express the most subtle feelings. Much is revealed about a person by his or her choice of fragrance and how that fragrance reacts with the skin. Everyone has his or her specific odor, which changes depending on the physical and mental state of the individual; thus, dogs can find lost people and criminals. Smell may, in fact, be a determinant in the establishment of relationships. It has also been a traditional tool for diagnosis (each disease is said to have its specific odor). Aromas, even if they cannot change an individual, may help to create a positive groundwork if properly chosen. Fragrances stimulate the dynamic and positive aspect of the being by an effect of resonance. During the Renaissance, the grande dames had their own secret perfumes; numerous systems associate perfumes with astrological signs, dominant planets, or morphological characteristics. In conclusion, even though it can relieve symptoms, aromatherapy primarily aims at curing the causes of diseases. The main therapeutic action of essential oils consists in strengthening the organs and their functions and acting on the defense mechanism of the body. They do not do the job for the body; they help the body do its own job and thus do not weaken the organism. Their action is enhanced by all natural therapies that aim to restore the vitality of the individual. Maurice Girault recommended using them in connection with minerals, homeopathy, and psychotherapy. To this list I add nutrition, as food is the basis of animal life; depending on its quality, food can be the best medicine or the main cause of disease. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 23 2/11/20 12:33 PM THREE Essential Oils Extraction and Adulteration In the spiritualistic approach to aromatherapy, essential oils are considered the life force, the energy of the plant. Alchemists regard them as the quintessence, the soul, the spirit of the plant. Anthroposophists see them as ESSENTIAL OILS IN THE PLANT Essential oils are the fragrant principle of the plant. They are the chemical components that give a plant its characteristic fragrance. For Review Only Dictamnus, burning bush 24 EsOiAr.indd 24 2/11/20 12:33 PM Essential Oils 25 produced through the action of astral forces in the plant. Essential oils are a type of vegetal hormone that helps the plant in its adaptation to the environment. From a biochemical point of view, they can be considered part of the plant's immune system. In extreme climates, such as the Arabian desert, certain plants use essential oils as a protection against the sun. Myrrh and frankincense bushes are surrounded by a very thin cloud of essential oils, which filters the sun's rays and freshens the air around the bushes. Dictamnus fraxinella, a plant of the same family that grows in the Sinai, is so literally endowed with resinous oil glands that the resinous vapor perpetually surrounding the shrub burns with a brilliant glow when lit. (According to Roy Genders, the burning bush that Moses saw in the Sinai could have been caused by such a phenomenon.) Essential oils also protect the plant from diseases and parasites. The plant uses essential oils from its flowers for its reproductive process. It attracts specific insects by releasing fragrances that mimic the insect's pheromones to facilitate pollination. In a way, essential oils from flowers are part of the plant's sexual system. We describe many essential oils that have aphrodisiac properties and other properties that relate to reproduction and sexuality (emmenagogues, hormone balancers, PMS or menopause relief, etc.). Certain essential oils have the power to repel insects that could be harmful to the plant. For example, citronella and geranium are mosquito repellent and lavender and spike repel For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 25 Moses and the Burning Bush by S\u00e9bastien Bourdon (1616-1671) fleas and mites. They sometimes even act as natural selective weedkillers, creating a territory around their roots where certain other plants cannot grow. Organic and biodynamic farmers know how to take advantage of this phenomenon in their work: certain plants have dynamic effects on the growth of specific plants while inhibiting others. The plant stores its essential oils in small pouches. It is important to note that plants do not use essential oils in their pure form. Plants store essential oils in specific areas and retrieve them in a diluted form when they are needed for the plant's biochemical processes. Humans, like 2/11/20 12:33 PM 26 Essential Oils plants, should not use essential oils in their pure form. Do not try to be smarter than plants! Essential oils are usually located on the outer part of the plant. They can be seen on the skin of citrus fruits, for instance, or on the surface of the leaves, which act as the skin of the plant. This indicates the strong affinity of essential oils for the skin. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS Essential oils are chemically very different from vegetable oils or other types of fats. Aromatic molecules are much smaller than fatty acids. They are carbonic chains that generally have ten carbons. A few have fifteen carbons, and some rare components go up to twenty carbons. What characterizes essential oils is the fact that they are volatile, which means that they evaporate completely when exposed to the air. If you put one drop of vegetable oil, such as canola oil, on a piece of paper, it will stain and the stain will remain. If you put a drop of essential oil on the same piece of paper, it will eventually evaporate completely. This volatile quality is what allows us to smell essential oils in the first place. It is also the property that allows us to extract essential oils through distillation. Essential oils are lipophilic, which means that they are readily absorbed by vegetable oils, waxes, and fats. This property allows us to make flower oils and allows the extraction process called enfleurage. The lipophilic property of essential oils is very useful for the preparation of massage oils and facial oils. It also means that essential oils applied externally absorb rapidly into the skin and the underlying tissues thanks to their high fatty content. Essential oils are hydrophobic; that is, they do not mix with water. This property is necessary for the final stage of steam distillation, in which the essential oils are separated from the water. Hydrophobia makes essential oils difficult to use in water-based products. In general, it is not a good idea to put essential oils into water, as they will float on the surface. Essential oils are partially soluble in alcohol. The amount of an essential oil that can be mixed with alcohol depends on the individual essential oil and on the proof of the alcohol. Essential oils are organic solvents. Pine oil and lemon oil, for example, are used in cleaners and polishes, orange oils in mechanical cleaners (Fast Orange), and limonene in things like Goo Gone. Turpentine, extracted from various conifers, is a paint thinner. Essential oils can dissolve styrofoam and certain plastics. The chemistry of essential oils is rather complex. It varies during the day and throughout the year; it depends on the part of the plant being distilled (root, wood, bark, leaf, stem, flower, seed), the variety, the soil, even the climate. The oils are mainly constituted of terpenes, sesquiterpenes, esters, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, and organic acids. They contain vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, and/or antiseptics. The yield of essential oils varies between 0.005 and 10 percent of the plant. Thus, 1 pound of essential oil requires 50 pounds of eucalyptus or lavandin, 150 pounds of lavender, 500 pounds of sage, thyme, or rosemary, and 2,000 to 3,000 pounds of rose! For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 26 2/11/20 12:33 PM Essential Oils 27 TRADITIONAL METHODS OF EXTRACTION Oil Infusion and Enfleurage Extraction by fats is probably the oldest method of extracting essential oils. Oil infusion is an easy, do-it-yourself type of extraction. It consists of soaking any plant material\u2014herb, flower, or seed\u2014in vegetable oil in a glass jar and exposing it to the sun for a few days. The plants are then strained out and more herbs may be added to the scented oil. Shepherds and farmers in Provence will prepare the \"red oil\" by soaking St. John's wort flowers in olive oil for two weeks. This oil has amazing healing properties and is very efficient against burns. Oil infusions are very versatile. They can be used for culinary purposes but are also particularly well-suited for making creams, ointments, liniments, massage oils, and bath oils. In enfleurage, fresh flowers are placed on top of a blend of fat (traditionally a mixture of pork fat, beef fat, and vegetable oils). The fat absorbs the aromatic oils released by the flow- ers. Every day, the old flowers are removed and fresh flowers are placed on the fat, until the right concentration of oils in the fat is reached. The oil-infused fat is called a pomade. The pomade is washed with alcohol to remove the fat, and the alcohol is removed through vacuum distillation. This process yields a form of oil called an absolute from enfleurage. Cold Expression Some essential oils can be extracted by cold pressure; this process is commonly used for citrus fruits. The outer layer of the fruit peel contains the oil and is removed by scrubbing. Through centrifigation, the oil then separates from the pulp. (If you pinch the peel of a lemon or an orange in front of a candle flame, you can see the oil come out when it burns in the flame.) For Review Only Enfleurage EsOiAr.indd 27 The Origin of Distillation Distillation is still the most common process of extracting essential oils. Historians do not agree on its origin, but most attribute it to Avicenna, the famous Arab philosopher, physician, and alchemist, who lived at the turn of the last millennium. However, Zozime, a renowned Egyptian chemist living in the third century A.D., wrote about numerous designs of stills adorning the wall of a temple in Memphis. It is quite likely, in fact, that the Egyptians were aware of a primitive process of distillation. In the first century A.D., Dioscorides already wondered about the origin of distillation. He reported that, according to oral 2/11/20 12:33 PM 28 Essential Oils tradition, a physician baked pears between two dishes. When he took off the upper dish, he noticed that the steam covering it smelled and tasted like a pear. It inspired him to build elaborate instrument for the extraction of the \"quintessences\" of medicinal plants. A still consists of a vat: a large cylindrical tank, which contains the plants. Steam is sent through the plants from the bottom of the vat and evaporates the oils. The vat is covered by a special lid (col de cygne or swan neck), which collects the steam and sends it to the coil, usually refrigerated with running water, where the steam is condensed. The mixture of condensed water and oil separates naturally by decantation in vase florentin (florentine vase). This is illustrated in figure 3.1. Many farms in southeastern France had such For Review Only Avicenna (980-1037) hot water vaporized water & essential oils Plants cold water water & essential oils essential oils floral waters Water steam Fire Fig. 3.1. The Steam Distillation Process EsOiAr.indd 28 2/11/20 12:33 PM Essential Oils 29 Antique copper bowl used for distillation to produce lavender essential oil For Review Only equipment until the turn of the last century. Since the vats were relatively small (the main vat contained less than 100 gallons), they were often used for extracting essential oils (mostly wild lavender) in the summer and distilling brandy in the winter. Today, wild lavender has almost disappeared and nobody picks it anymore (I bought one of the last batches a few years ago), but there are still many distilleries in Provence. In some areas, every village has at least one. The vats are much larger (some have up to six vats containing over 1,500 gallons), and the water is now heated in a separate boiler. The people there distill mostly lavandin, a hybrid of lavender that gives a better yield of lower-quality essential oil. They also distill true lavender, hyssop, clary sage, and occasionally tarragon or cypress. EsOiAr.indd 29 Extraction by Solvents This relatively modern technique is used worldwide for higher yield or to obtain products that cannot be obtained by any other process. The plants are immersed in a suitable solvent (acetone or any petroleum byproduct), and the separation is performed chemically by distillation under special temperatures that condense the oil but not the solvents. Unfortunately, such oils always contain some traces of solvent and are therefore not suitable for aromatherapy. For the fabrication of \"concretes,\" the material is usually soaked in hexane. The mixture is then concentrated by double distillation, and the final product has a creamy consistency due to the presence of residual solvents and waxes from the plants. The \"absolutes\" are obtained 2/11/20 12:33 PM 30 Essential Oils Soxhlet extractor used for extraction by solvents For Review Only from concretes by dilution in alcohol, double filtration, and double concentration, which eliminates most waxes and residual solvents. This method is used widely for roses, neroli (orange blossoms), cassia, and tuberoses. It is the only way to extract oils from jasmine, honeysuckle, carnation, and others. Concretes and absolutes are extensively used in cosmetics and perfumery; they should not be used for aromatherapy. Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Extraction Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction is a relatively new process that has raised great hopes among perfumers and aromatherapists. How is it supercritical? Any substance can exist in three different states: gas, liquid, and solid. Every substance EsOiAr.indd 30 may be in any of these three states depending on its temperature and pressure. In addition, certain substances can be found in the supercritical state\u2014that is, they are neither liquid nor gas, but rather they are both; they disperse as readily as a gas (i.e., almost instantaneously) and have solvent properties. Under any given temperature, most substances go from gaseous at low pressure (close to vacuum for heavy substances like metal) and to liquid when the pressure increases. Some substances, though, never become liquid if their temperature is maintained over their supercritical temperature. They will instead be in the supercritical state when pressure increases over supercritical pressure. Carbon dioxide (a fairly inert gas naturally occurring in the air that we breathe) has the power to become supercritical. Even better, its 2/11/20 12:33 PM Essential Oils 31 supercritical temperature is 33\u00b0C (a little over room temperature). Supercritical carbon dioxide then becomes an excellent solvent of fragrances and aromatic substances. The advantages are that the whole operation takes place at fairly low temperature, and therefore the fragrance is not affected by heat; the extraction is almost instantaneous (a few minutes) and complete. Because the solvent is virtually inert, there are no chemical reactions between the solvent and the aromatic substances. In comparison, steam distillation requires one to forty-eight hours, it always leaves some residues of essential oils, and many substances are hydrolyzed or oxidized in the process. Unlike the products of regular solvent extraction (concretes, absolutes, oleoresins), the solvent can be easily and totally removed, just by releasing the pressure. The whole process takes place in a closed chamber, which means that even the most volatile and most fragile fractions of the fragrance can be collected. Consequently, the end product is as close as anyone can get to the plant's aromatic substance. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction then appears to be an aromatherapist's dream come true. Unfortunately, the supercritical pressure for carbon dioxide is over 200 atmospheres (200 times the regular atmospheric pressure!), requiring very heavy and expensive stainless-steel still equipment. Supercritical carbon dioxide extracts are now commercially available for a wide range of products such as rose, myrrh, frankincense, vanilla, cinnamon, and many spices as well as ED: This illustration needs to be redrawn Fig. 3.2. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction process vegetable oils such as rosehip and pomegranate. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction is also the most efficient method of decaffeination and is the most common method to produce CBD oil. The equipment can be ordered online from Alibaba.com. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 31 Yield of the Most Common Essential Oils The yield of essential oils varies greatly from one plant to another. To make one kilogram (kg) of essential oil, it takes about: 20 kg of clove buds 30 kg of eucalyptus leaves 35 kg of lavandin 150 kg of lavender 300 kg of peppermint 300 kg of Moroccan rosemary 500 kg of red thyme 600 kg of French rosemary 2/11/20 12:33 PM 32 Essential Oils 800 kg of clary sage 1,000 kg of chamomile 3,000 kg of rose 10,000 kg of melissa The difference in yields leads to wide variations in price from one essential oil to another. Obviously, eucalyptus oil will be rather inexpensive, while rose oil is going to be very costly. Floral Waters, Distillates, and Hydrolates Floral water, distillates, and hydrolates are obtained by sending steam through the plants and condensing this steam; they are often a by-product of distillation, in which case they are recovered from the florentine vase after separation of the essential oils. The best floral waters are obtained by cohobation, a process that continuously recycles the distillate. The amount of water used for distillation is proportional to the quantity of plant; the overflow from the florentine vase is sent back into the boiler, and steam is sent through the plant material until it is saturated. Hydrolates contain the water-soluble active principles of the plants. They retain a small amount of essential oils (about 0.2 gram per liter) that disperses in an ionized form, so that the product is less likely to cause skin irritation. They were traditionally used for skin care, for the disinfection of wounds, and for healing. Because hydrolates are milder and easier to use than essential oils, their utility in skin care and cosmetics is considerable. Rose flower water, orange blossom water, chamomile water, and bluet water are among the most renowned. Do It Yourself All an amateur distiller needs is a pressure cooker. Place the plants on a screen above the water. Replace the valve with a plastic hose (2 to 5 feet long), boil the water, run cold water on the hose, and collect the floral water and oils in any suitable container. You can separate the oils by decantation in glass bottles. You will not, of course, produce large amounts of oils, but their quality will be excellent and you will also obtain plenty of floral water with which to prepare your own cosmetics, creams, and shampoos. I should warn you, however, that distillation is an incurable addiction! HOW TO KEEP YOUR ESSENTIAL OILS For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 32 Essential oils are precious products that can be very expensive. (You will understand why when you start making your own.) Store them in tightly closed dark glass bottles to prevent their deterioration by light or by air. They should also be protected from temperature variations; prolonged heat is not good for them. Under normal conditions, essential oils can be considered fresh for three years after their extraction. THE QUALITY ISSUE The quality of the essential oils available on the market has improved substantially since this book's first publication, thanks mostly to better consumer education. Good-quality essential oils are now easily available through spas and skin care salons, health food stores, and specialty stores as well as direct from producers via their websites. Although some offer products with 2/11/20 12:33 PM Essential Oils 33 aromatherapy claims, the mass market has yet to discover real essential oils. Quality is still an issue and consumers should be watchful of possible adulterations, which can be natural or synthetic. There are two main reasons for adulterations. The chemical composition of essential oils of a given plant can vary to a large extent, depending on the variety, the time, the soil, and the methods of cultivation and distillation. The oil of thyme, for instance, varies from 100 percent thymol to 90 percent carvacrol, with some varieties containing citral or geraniol. In addition, many of the basic components, such as linalool, cineol, borneol, citral, and nerolidol, are present in different essences. Knowing the main components of a given essential oil, it is then possible to reconstitute it using cheaper essential oils or their components. Rose, for instance, is often falsified with geranium, lemongrass, palmarosa, terpenic alcohol, stearine, etc. Recent advances in chemistry have flooded the market with synthetic essential oils. These synthetic reconstitutions are mostly used in the food or cosmetic industry, but also in perfumery and pharmacy. The chemical substances present in the oils are in perpetual interaction, and the kind of interaction taking place basically depends on the way these substances have been put together. The action of essential oils depends also on the processes taking place in them. Therefore, natural or synthetic reconstitutions will never replace the natural oils. For aromatherapy as well as for perfumery or cosmetics, one should For Review Only Stills used to produce ylang-ylang essential oil in Nosy Be, Madagascar EsOiAr.indd 33 2/11/20 12:33 PM 34 Essential Oils use only the best quality of essential oils. The oils extracted by cold pressure are of course the closest to the products present in the plant, but only a few oils can be extracted by this method. Steam distillation yields the second best quality. Wild plants growing in unpolluted areas or organic plants, of course, yield the best quality of oil. Nonorganic products are not recommended, as many synthetic pesticides are soluble in the plants' aromatic substances and might be concentrated in the oil. Various analytical processes are available for evaluating the quality of an essential oil, the most common being gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Such methods allow an experienced specialist to detect most adulterations but will not provide any information on more subtle criteria of quality, such as country of origin or method of growth. Such methods are impractical for the average consumer who must rely on a trusted supplier. Finding a reliable supplier is challenging because of the nature of the market: the essential oil market is rather complex and one needs to be very familiar with it to be able to obtain optimum quality. Most of the trade in essential oils is done through brokers, and the major market for essential oils is still the fragrance and the food industries. The aromatherapy market is a growing but still marginal market. The food industry trade concerns a few selected oils, such as citrus, mint, and spices. The widest variety is being used by the fragrance industry. For that industry, consistency in smell and in price is more important than purity. Most fragrance formulations include hundreds of ingredients, some natural, some synthetic. It is very important for the compounder that all ingredients maintain consistency. But nature is not consistent. From one crop to the next, from one origin to the next, the fragrance of an essential oil may vary substantially. Such variations may be buffered by addition of synthetic or natural components. Price may also fluctuate wildly. A given oil may double in price after a natural disaster in an important area of production. For instance, floods in China almost tripled the price of geranium in 1995. Price variations are buffered the same way. This explains why it can be challanging to obtain reliable quality essential oils on the open market. Here are some guidelines for selecting a supplier of essential oils: For Review Only d EsOiAr.indd 34 Make sure that your supplier can provide as detailed information as possible about the essential oils they offer: botanical name, country of origin, and, if possible, method of growth. d Price is an indication, but make sure that your supplier does not take advantage of your concern about quality to charge excessive prices: oils such as eucalyptus, especially Eucalyptus globulus, and orange, lemon, cedarwood, and pine are plentiful and inexpensive. Rose, jasmine, neroli, and tuberose are extremely expensive and are always sold in small amounts. Be very suspicious of such oils offered at a relatively low price. d Established companies with a solid reputation are more likely to have reliable sources and better buying power and therefore offer quality at competitive prices. 2/11/20 12:33 PM FOUR The Chemistry of Essential Oils Oxygen has eight neutrons, eight protons, and eight electrons\u2014two in its first layer, six in its second layer\u2014and two empty spaces. Atoms are impelled to fill up all their electronic layers. In fact, they compusively need to fill up this outermost layer. If they are left alone, they usually combine with themselves. The hydrogen atoms share their electrons two by two; two oxygen atoms get together and each contribute two electrons. Carbons are a little bit different. Carbon atoms arrange themselves in three-dimensional patterns, each carbon being attached to four other carbons and contributing one electron to each liaison. Billions of billions of carbon atoms can thus be connected in huge patterns. But most atoms seem to prefer diversity. They combine with other atoms to form molecules in a kind of atomic mating process, called bonding. Atomic bonding consists of sharing the electrons in the outermost layer so as to fill up this layer. When two atoms share one THE ATOMIC SAGA Atoms consist of electrons, which have a negative electrical charge, orbiting around a nucleus. The nucleus contains the protons, which have a positive electrical charge, and the neutrons, with no electric charge. Each atom has the same number of electrons and protons, to bring the total electrical charge to zero. The electrons are disposed in layers around the nucleus. Each layer can hold a set maximum number of electrons. Thus, the first layer cannot contain more than two electrons, the second layer holds a maximum of eight electrons, and so on. Hydrogen is the most common atom in the universe and has the simplest possible structure: a single electron orbiting around one proton; it has one empty space in its single layer. Carbon, another very common atom, consists of six protons and six neutrons in the nucleus, with six orbiting electrons\u2014two in its first layer, four in its second layer\u2014and four empty spaces. For Review Only 35 EsOiAr.indd 35 2/11/20 12:33 PM 36 The Chemistry of Essential Oils e lectron in a molecular liaison, it is called a single bond. Atoms may also share two electrons in a double bond or even three electrons in a triple bond. Hydrogen can form only a single bond; oxygen can form single bonds (as in water, where it is attached to two hydrogens) or double bonds (as in carbon dioxide, where two oxygens share two electrons each with a carbon). Carbon can form triple bonds, usually with itself. By human standards, atomic behavior can be rather objectionable and creepy: to fill up their outmost layer, atoms will use any possible means. They tear molecules apart to steal others' atoms, which is called an atomic reaction. And some atomic reactions can be pretty wild. Thus when you send, for instance, some oxygen atoms into a crowd of methane molecules (each made of four hydrogens attached to one carbon), the oxygen atoms are so anxious to combine that any spark causes an explosion. The oxygens split the methane; some oxygens join with hydrogens to create plain water, while others take care of the carbons in carbon dioxide. The whole exchange is brief but rather intense. This is exactly what happens when a gas leak blows up a ten-story building. When the universe was still young and reckless, the type of atomic massacre that I just described was really nothing compared to what was going on every day. As time went by, atoms settled down in more stable molecules (burned out, probably). The interchanges became more sophisticated, especially on our planet. Molecules got bigger and bigger, until life became possible. From general warfare, atomic behavior evolved into a harmonious dance. Under the tight control of life forces, molecules go around, gently swapping atoms or atomic groups. Carbon is the major performer in life's molecular dance. Its blatant promiscuity and its ability to link with itself allow it to generate chains of carbon atoms. In such chains, each carbon atom is linked to one (at each end of the chain) or two (inside the chain) carbon atoms. Carbons usually attach themselves to each other through a single bond. This leaves space for two or three extra bonds where hydrogen and oxygen (carbon's two major partners in life's waltz) or other radicals can be attached. Molecules as complex as DNA, life's inner memory chip, can thus be created. The smaller molecules tend to be v olatile\u2014 that is, they evaporate easily. The larger the molecule, the lower its ability to evaporate (i.e., the higher its boiling point). Essential oils are volatile; their molecules are rather small. Most of them have ten or fifteen carbon atoms (see discussion in next section of terpenoid molecules). For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 36 THE CHEMISTRY OF COMMON ESSENTIAL OIL CONSTITUENTS* Almost all of the molecules found in essential oils are composed of carbon and hydrogen or of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The chemistry of the constituents of essential oils is determined by two factors, one artificial (the steam distillation process) and the other intrinsic to the plant (the * In collaboration with Kurt Schnaubelt, Ph.D. 2/11/20 12:33 PM The Chemistry of Essential Oils 37 biosynthesis of the constituent molecules). By steam distillation, a process that is mainly physical, only volatile and waterinsoluble constituents are isolated from the plant. The main types of chemical compounds isolated are terpenes, terpenoid compounds, and phenylpropane-derived compounds. There are many other constituents in plants (often valuable) that do not find their way into the essential oils. Among them are all the molecules that are soluble in water, like acids or sugars, or that are too large or too high in polarity to evaporate with steam, such as tannins, flavonoids, carotenoids, and polysaccharides. Three main categories of chemical compounds can therefore be distinguished in essential oils: (1) terpenes and terpenoid compounds; (2) sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoid compounds; and (3) phenylpropane derivatives. The first two share the same biosynthetic pathway. ture can be looked at as if they were made up of multiples of the isoprene molecule. The isoprene structure consists of a chain of five carbon atoms. (Rationalizing the makeup of terpenoid molecules as multiples of isoprene units is a useful model, but the actual biosynthesis takes a different course.) The smallest molecules formed in this way are the monoterpenes, with ten carbon atoms. They are the main constituents of many essential oils. Isoprene (C5) - the primary component Monoterpene (C10) Sesquiterpene Review Only Terpenes and Sesquiterpenes Terpenes and sesquiterpenes are molecules made up of carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons). They provide the basic chemical structures through the ability of the carbon atom to form chemical bonds with other carbon atoms. Carbon atoms bonding to each other determine much of the overall shape and size of the molecule\u2014they form the \"carbon backbone\" of the molecule. If the only other element present is hydrogen, the molecules are called unsubstituted and are referred to as terpenes or sesquiterpenes. The terpenoid molecules share a common 37 Fig. 4.1. of terpenes Molecules with fifteen carbon atoms, sesquiterpenes, are also commonly encountered in essential oils, since they are still volatile enough to distill with steam. Molecules with twenty carbons (diterpenes) are found in essential oils to a much lesser degree. Terpenoid molecules with thirty and forty carbon atoms also occur in plants but are not found in the essential oils. Their molecular weight is too high to allow evaporation with steam. Important molecules of life like steroids and certain hormones are members of this last group. Monoterpenes have 2/11/20 12:33 PM 38 The Chemistry of Essential Oils a ten-carbon structure, sesquiterpenes have fifteen carbons, and diterpenes have twenty carbons. Functional Groups in Essential Oil Constituents Unsubstituted hydrocarbons can be modified by a functional group; that is, one or two hydrogen atoms are replaced by the functional group in the molecule. Within the realm of essential oils, the functional groups we have to deal with are all formed through the different ways oxygen can be attached to carbon. Generally, molecules made up of a terpene structure and a functional group are called terpenoid (or sesquiterpenoid, from sesquiterpenes). Strictly speaking, the term terpenes (or sesquiterpenes) would refer to hydrocarbons and terpenoid to substituted terpenes. In the professional literature, the term terpene (or sesquiterpene) is often used to denote the whole group of molecules with the same basic structure, including hydrocarbons and substituted molecules. The properties of essential oil constituents are determined by their basic structure (mono-, sesqui-, and diterpene) and their functional group (figure Thujone, pulegone, pinocamphone, and carvone are important ketones. Oxygen can be attached to a carbon through a double bond. The resulting group is called a carboxyl group; if the oxygen is attached to a carbon located within carbonic chain, the resulting molecule is called a ketone. Monoterpenoid ketones determine the main characteristics of a fair number of essential oils, such as hyssop and sage. Other oils with a For Review Only Fig. 4.2. Functional Groups in Essential Oil Constituents (C, Carbon; H, Hydrogen; O, Oxygen) EsOiAr.indd 38 2/11/20 12:33 PM The Chemistry of Essential Oils 39 substantial ketone content are thuja and pennyroyal (neither should ever be taken internally). The applications of these oils most relevant to aromatherapy are easing or increasing the flow of mucus and their cytophylactic effect. Both properties are utilized extensively in aromatherapy in remedies for upper respiratory complaints (mucolytic) and skin care preparations (cytophylactic). Many ketones are neurotoxic when taken internally. Some of them can be dangerous (including pulegone in pennyroyal have a carboxyl group, but unlike ketones, their oxygen is attached to a carbon that is also linked to a hydrogen, which means that they are not located with a carbonic chain. Monoterpenoid aldehydes are the main chemical feature of the oils of melissa (Melissa officinalis), lemongrass, citronella, lemon verbena (Lippia citriodora), and Eucalyptus citriodora. that aldehydes found in these oils are sedative. Citral has also been found to possess strong antiseptic properties. rendering it an ester group. Esters are produced through the reaction of an alcohol and an acid. Esters are characteristically antifungal and sedative. They have a direct calming effect on the central nervous system and can be powerful spasmolytic agents. Roman chamomile contains a number of esters that are not found commonly in other essential oils. The spasmolytic power apparently reaches a maximum in this oil. Esters are generally fragrant and often have very fruity aromas. They are commonly used in compositions of fruit aromas and flavorings. Linalyl acetate, for instance, is found in large amounts in lavender and bergamot. It is the reaction product of linalool and acetic acid. Clary sage is another oil whose ester characteristics are obvious, especially if it is used in massage. Esters are found in essential oils in probably larger numbers than the representatives of any of the other groups. Few essential oils have esters as the main constituent, but often even small amounts of characteristic esters are crucial to the finer notes in the fragrance of an essential oil. For Review Only Esters Linalyl acetate, geranyl acetate, bornyl acetate, and methyl salicylate are important esters. Ester groups contain a double bond between carbon and oxygen (a carboxyl group). A second oxygen molecule is bonded to the Oxygen is most often attached to a terpene molecule through a single bond in the hydroxyl group, in which a hydrogen takes up the second oxygen bond. The hydroxyl group (-O-H) consists of a water molecule (H-O-H) separated from one 2/11/20 12:33 PM 40 The Chemistry of Essential Oils of its hydrogen carbons, hence its name. The hydroxyl group has very strong reactive power. Molecules with a hydroxyl group are called alcohols. They are typically very fluid. If an alcohol group is introduced into a terpene molecule, the resulting compound is called an alcohol or terpene alcohol. Terpene alcohols are among the most useful molecules in aromatherapy. The terpene alcohols found in common essential oils show a fair degree of diversity with respect to their properties as well as their fragrance, but they also have several properties in common. Terpene alcohols are generally antiseptic, and a positive energizing effect is attributed to them. Linalool is a prominent terpene alcohol in lavender, rosewood, petitgrain, neroli, and coriander. Citronellol, which has been shown to possess antiviral qualities, is a main constituent in rose and geranium oils, and geraniol is found in palmarosa. Alpha-terpineol in Eucalyptus radiata and niaouli (Melaleuca viridiflora). Terpineol-4 is a main constituent in tea tree and garden marjoram. Other oils also in this group are present in Ravensara aromatica and cajeput. All these oils have as common qualities an antiseptic nature; a pleasant, uplifting fragrance; desirable properties; and very low toxicity. The usefulness of the terpene alcohols has been pointed out again through research that suggests that those juniper oils with a high terpineol-4 content and a corresponding low content of pinenes (terpene hydrocarbons) are the safest diuretic agents among the different types of juniper oil. Oxides If oxygen links two carbons and at the same time is a member of a ring structure, the compound is called an oxide. Cineol, also called eucalyptole, is almost in a class of its own. As a chemical compound it is an oxide. It imparts a strong expectorant effect to the different varieties of eucalyptus oils. It is practically ubiquitous, being a more or less desired constituent of almost every other essential oil. Linalool oxide is an important constituent of the oil of the decumbent variety of Hyssopus officinalis. This oil has a low ketone content and a reduced toxicity compared with the oil of Hyssopus officinalis. Phenols For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 40 Thymol and carvacrol are shown in figure 4.3. When an alcohol hydroxyl group is attached to a benzene ring, the resulting compound is called a phenol. The phenol structure is strongly electropositive and therefore very active chemically. Phenols like thymol or carvacrol are the strongest antibacterial agents among the monoterpenoid compounds of aromatherapy. Their strongly stimulant character is widely utilized in aromatherapy; however, these oils can be very irritating, and they should be used only in appropriately low concentrations. Phenylpropane are shown in figure 4.3 (also see table 1 on page 40).

The elements that make up this structure are an \"aromatic\" phenyl ring system with a propane (three-carbon) side chain. This basic structure of nine carbon atoms is then modified by various groups attached to it. A double bond in the side chain often allows the attached groups to interact with the pi- electron system of the aromatic ring, rendering some molecules in this group pharmacologically highly active. Their biosynthetic pathway, originating through shikimic acid, is different from those of the terpenoids. Cinnamon and clove, like the phenolic essence, are strong antiseptic agents. They can cause severe skin reactions and must be used with caution. Eugenol, the main constituent of clove oil, in addition to being antiseptic and fungicidal, shows local anesthetic properties. It has also been reported to inhibit certain carcinogenic processes. The same effect was found for caryophyllene, another constituent of clove oil (see the discus- sion of sesquiterpenes on page [x-ref]). Aniseed, basil, and tarragon are not as aggressive as cinnamon or clove can be, yet they all share a distinctly sweet character in their fragrance. The main constituents of basil and aniseed oils, methylchavicol and anethol, can cause negative effects if used in unreasonably high concentrations. Others in this group include safrol (sassafras, camphor), myristicin (nutmeg), and apiol (parsley). While most of these oils can be used beneficially in aromatherapy, they share a potential for toxicity in high concentrations or with prolonged use. The potential of nutmeg to act as a hallucinogen (dosages required to induce these effect are unsafe and can cause lasting damage or death) and the effects of anethol, well known through its abuses in anise liqueurs, demonstrate the ability of phenylpropane constituents to interact with the central nervous system in a way that depends strongly on dosage and/or concentration.

Terpene Hydrocarbons Limonene (90 percent or more of most citrus oils), pinene, camphene, and myrcene are shown in figure 4.3. With regard to their properties, terpene hydrocarbons are often thought to be rather insignificant constituents of essential oils. There has been discussion of whether terpenes are skin or mucous membrane irritants. Studies of various pine oils show that antiseptic principles are formed when these oils are subjected to natural or induced aging or oxidation. A study of the effects of terpenes against herpes simplex and other viruses should renew the respect for terpenes in aromatherapy. Limonene (the main constituent of many citrus oils), alpha-sabinene, and gamma-terpinene have all been found to possess antiviral properties. Essential oils with high proportions of monoterpene hydrocarbons include: Lemon, orange, bergamot (limonene) activities of monoterpenes, as well as sesquiterpenes and diterpenes.

An overview of the most important biological properties of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes is given here. EsOiAr.indd 44 2/11/20 12:33 PM The santalol, important sesquiterpenes. Table 4 lists some sources of sesquiterpenes. As we look at sesquiterpene constituents of essential oils, the influence of a functional group becomes less dominating. The increased size of the overall structure brings about increased complexity. The interaction between carbon backbone and functional group becomes more subtle and intricate. The individuality of the molecule becomes a greater factor in the makeup of the pharmacological effect of the molecule. More than two thousand sesquiterpenes have been isolated from plants to date, and their structures vary widely. Most of these sesquiterpenes can be attributed to thirty main structural types. A summary of their biological activity is shown in table 5. Essential oils with a high proportion of sesquiterpene constituents are mostly distilled from roots and woods or from plants of the Asteraceae family. Sesquiterpenes have been the object of much interest and research into their properties. The bulk of that research has been performed on sesquiterpenes isolated from plants of the Asteraceae family that are not common essential oil plants. The situation for the aromatherapist is somewhat unsatisfactory, since there are good reasons to speculate on the potential properties of sesquiterpenes in essential oils, but only limited availability of substantiating research data. There are some notable exceptions. In the effort to provide a scientific basis for the many uses of German chamomile (Chamomilla matricaria), the antiphlogistic properties of chamazulene and alpha-bisabolol were firmly established.

Because of its ability to inhibit, rather than kill, the growth of bacteria, it is an ideal deodorizing agent, since it inhibits the development of odor-causing microorganisms without eliminating the bacteria that are present on healthy skin. Finally, caryophyllene, which is found in many essential oils, most notably in clove oil, has received renewed attention. It combines sedative and antiviral effects with an ability to inhibit some carcinogenic processes. Sandalwood illustrates the lack of solid research data on sesquiterpenes that are found in essential oils. On one hand, there is ample anecdotal evidence for its usefulness in urinary tract infections, and even pharmacological textbooks list it as a potential urine disinfectant. On the other hand, an antibacterial effect of sandalwood oil constituents has not been confirmed. It is of course tempting to speculate that searching for an outright bactericidal effect of santalol may be the wrong experiment in light of the fact that sesquiterpenes can be effective immune stimulants. The effect of the oil could be caused not through direct bactericidal action but rather through stimulation of the body's defense mechanisms.

Such variations are called chemotypes and are probably related to minor genetic and epigenetic variations or may be caused by climatic and other environmental conditions. Chemotypes are widespread within the botanical family of Lamiaceae in plants such as basil, lavender, melissa, oregano, peppermint, rosemary, sage, and thyme. Geranium is another plant with many chemotypes. 2/11/20 12:33 PM The Chemistry of Essential Oils 47 Table 6 Essential Oils and Their Major Chemical Components Plant Number of carbons Angelica Aniseed Basil Bay Bergamot Birch Cajeput Caraway Cardamom Carrot seed Cedarwood Chamomile, blue Chamomile, German Chamomile, mixta Chamomile, Roman Champaca, Michelia alba Cinnamon bark Cinnamon leaf Cistus Citronella Clary sage Clove buds Coriander seeds Elemi Eucalyptus australiana Eucalyptus citriodora Eucalyptus globulus Everlasting Fennel Fir Frankincense 10 9 9 10 10 8 10 10 10 15 15 14 15 10 9 10 9 9 15 10 15 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 15 10 10 10 Components 2/11/20 12:33 PM 48 The Chemistry of Essential Oils Table 6 (continued) Essential Oils and Their Major Chemical Components Plant Geranium Ginger root Grapefruit Hyssop Jasmine Rose Number of carbons Components 10 15 10 10 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 10 10 10 15 10 10 10 10 10 48 2/11/20 12:33 PM The Chemistry of Essential Oils 49 Table 6 (continued) Essential Oils and Their Major Chemical Components Plant Number of carbons Rosemary lemon Vetiver Ylang-ylang 10 10 10 15 10 10 10 15 10 10 9 10 10 10 10 10 10 15 10 2/11/20 12:33 PM FIVE Principles of Aromatherapy How Essential Oils Work Europe, Asia, and the United States today. In France, cough preparations, digestive aids, muscle liniments, and wound preparations found in virtually every pharmacy contain essential oils as active ingredients. In the United States, Vicks VapoRub includes peppermint, eucalyptus, and several other essential oils as active ingredients. Originated from Asia, the world-famous Tiger Balm is made primarily of essential oils. Aromatherapy is rather different from other healing modalities in that it acts on various levels, each in synergy with the other levels. Aromatherapy treats symptoms by addressing the specific physical, energetic, and psychological background of the individual client. For Review Only BIOPHYSICAL ACTION OF ESSENTIAL OILS Essential oils have measurable biophysical actions when inhaled, ingested, or applied to the body. There are some general properties that we find to a greater or a lesser degree in all essential oils, due to the fact that essential oils are made primarily of terpenoid compounds. However, each individual essential oil has specific properties due to its specific chemical composition. Healers and pharmacists have long made use of essential oils' biophysical actions. Essential oils have been used in pharmaceutical preparations since the beginning of pharmacy in Egypt more than six thousand years ago and are still used in Medicinal Properties Found in Most Essential Oils Antiseptic Property A property universally found in essential oils is the antiseptic property. All essential oils are antiseptic to some degree. The most antiseptic are the oils with a high phenolic content. Phenolic compounds found in essential oils are thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol. These compounds are found in especially large quantities in red thyme, savory, oregano, clove, and cinnamon. Such oils are extremely powerful antiseptics, but they 50 EsOiAr.indd 50 2/11/20 12:33 PM Principles of Aromatherapy 51 should be used with caution because they can be irritating, especially when applied to the skin. Phenol-rich essential oils should be used only under medical supervision. In addition to the very aggressive phenolic oils, aromatherapy provides us with a wide choice of milder but very effective essential oils for antiseptic use. These include all the oils rich in alcohols, such as geranium, all the various lavenders, palmarosa, tea tree, marjoram, and ylang-ylang. These oils are much milder than the phenol-rich oils and are very safe to use. They are useful for home remedies and first-aid kits, and they work well on minor wounds, as prevention from infectious diseases, or for skin care. Oils rich in terpenes include pine and most members of the Coniferae family (fir, spruce, cedarwood, juniper) and the citruses (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, tangerine). These oils are slightly more aggressive than the alcoholic oils but are still very safe to use. They are especially efficient when used in a diffuser. and include most members of the Myrtaceae (eucalyptus, myrtle, niaouli, cajeput) and the Coniferae (pine, spruce, fir, cedarwood) families. Eucalyptus globulus is one of the most powerful expectorants. Expectorant Each essential oil also has specific properties, depending on its chemical composition. The major medicinal properties found in some essential oils are listed in table 7 on page 50. Cytophilactic Most essential oils are cytophilactic, which means that they stimulate cellular activity and cellular regeneration. The most cytophilactic oils are geranium, lavender, rosemary, sandalwood, and, generally, all the oils rich in alcohol. Rubefacient Essential oils are rubefacient, which means that they activate capillary circulation. This is especially true of oils rich in phenols (thyme, oregano, savory, clove) and, to a lesser degree, rich in oxides (eucalyptus, niaouli, cajeput, rosemary) and terpenes (pine, fir, juniper). For Review Only In addition to their overall antiseptic properties, most essential oils are expectorants to some degree, which means that they stimulate the fluidification and expulsion of mucus from the lungs. As we know, the lungs produce mucus to filter the air that we breathe. Mucus traps the dust and pollutants that we breathe all day long. It is very important that we expel mucus properly, especially when we live in polluted cities. Essential oils are helpful for this purpose. The most effective expectorant oils are those that are rich in a chemical called cineol EsOiAr.indd 51 MAJOR MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIAL OILS ACTION OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON THE SKIN Essential oils are extremely beneficial for the skin. In fact, the use of essential oils in skin care can be traced back to the Egyptians, the inventors of cosmetology. The Egyptians had extremely elaborate skin care regimens, which could take hours to complete.

The skin is a barrier between our bodies and the outside world. Thus, the skin absorbs and filters elements from the air and absorbs a small amount of air (the skin breathes). It also absorbs moisture and other elements applied to the skin. The skin must filter germs and unwanted substances such as pollutants. This double function of the skin is extremely important. At the same time, our bodies expel moisture to help control body temperature. The skin expels sebum, a waxy substance that our bodies use as a protectant; it also expels various waste materials through the sebaceous glands. Essential oils help the skin perform its role as a barrier. This is a very important property for skin care. In addition, some of the basic EsOiAr.indd 52 properties of essential oils make them extremely useful for skin care. ACTION OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON THE ENERGETIC LEVEL Essential oils are considered the life force, the energy, of the plant. They are used with great efficiency in energy work such as acupressure, Shiatsu, and chakra work. Specific essential oils can be associated with each meridian and chakra. See tables 8, 9, and 10. ACTION OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON THE EMOTIONAL LEVEL Essential oils are first and foremost fragrances, and as such they have deep effects on the emotional plane.

It was, in fact, one of their first uses. Traditional cultures viewed fragrances as a link between the human realm and the gods. Fragrances in most ancient cultures were considered a gift from the gods. The shamans or priests used them to carry their offerings to the kingdom of the gods. Even to this day, all major religions, whether Shintoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, or Christianity, use incenses and scented oils in their rituals and ceremonies. EsOiAr.indd 56 Essential oils, especially the oils from woods and gums, have a very centering and opening effect on the psyche. They help create a sense of connectedness, community, and elevation, and they inspire the sacred in each of us. The major oils for ritualistic purposes are sandalwood, cistus, myrrh, frankincense, benzoin, vetiver, spikenard, and rose. When Mary Magdalene wanted to express her devotion to the Christ, she washed his feet with the famous nard oil (now known as spikenard), one of the most expensive oils of antiquity, brought by caravans from the Himalayas to Palestine. She incidentally spent a fortune on 2/11/20 12:33 PM Principles of Aromatherapy 57 Frankincense burning on a hot coal For Review Only Christ's feet, provoking the anger of Judas, the bookkeeper of the group. This episode from the Bible inspired a blend that I created more than ten years ago, when a French religious group asked me to create a Good Friday blend to reenact the foot washing. I later added this blend to my Aroma V\u00e9ra line under the name Sacred Synergy; now discontinued. It combines the major ritualistic oils of all major spiritual traditions. CONCLUSION The various levels of action of essential oils are not exclusive from one another. On the contrary, whatever the application, we always encounter the various effects to one degree or another. When doing skin care or body care treatments in particular, there will be not only physical effects and effects on the skin, but also effects EsOiAr.indd 57 on the energetic level and on the emotional level. Each level of action works in synergy with the others to enhance the overall effect. The capacity to affect people on so many different levels\u2014physical/medicinal, skin, energy, emotional/psychological\u2014is really what makes aromatherapy so special. No other healing art has such versatility and broadness of action. This capacity is also what makes aromatherapy such a creative art. The possibilities are endless; one can go as far as he or she wishes. Aromatherapy offers unique opportunities to fine-tune and personalize treatments to an extreme degree. The trained technician can design treatments that take into account the client's biophysical background, skin type, energy level, and emotional and psychological state. Mastering aromatherapy is a challenging but uniquely rewarding venture. 2/11/20 12:33 PM SIX Comparative Study of Modes of Administration Benefits, Risks, Applications, and Contraindications Aromatherapy is an art and a science, but it is not a cult or a religion. It cannot solve all the problems of the planet and it does not work miracles, but it can play a role in dedicating ourselves to living closer to nature, and it can help relieve many common (and some not-so-common) conditions. This chapter will review the various routes of administration of essential oils (olfactory, pulmonary, transdermal, and internal), including their benefits, risks, applications, and contraindications. We also will discuss the most common misunderstanding regarding the internal use of essential oils. Essential oils have many different levels of action: biophysical, energetic, emotional, mental, and spiritual. We will review how each route of administration is best suited to each level of action, and we will see how aromatherapists can best design their treatment to optimize the For Review Only Fig. 6.1. Essential oils' levels of action effects of essential oils by using the best mode of administration for the intended effect. 58 EsOiAr.indd 58 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 59 Brief Reminders It is very important to understand what essential oils are so that they can be used efficiently and safely. Before we start going over the various modes of administration and their risks and benefits, let's quickly review some basics. Essential oils are: Chemically very different from vegetable oils and other types of fats. The aromatic molecules are much smaller than the fatty acids and are readily absorbed through the skin. Volatile, they evaporate completely when exposed to air. Lipophilic, they mix very easily with vegetable oils and fats. Hydrophobic, they do not mix with water. BODY BARRIERS AND ADMINISTRATION Our body is protected from noninvasive exposure to unwanted substances and pathogens by three physical barriers: the skin, the digestive tract, and the respiratory system. The brain is further protected by an internal barrier, the blood-brain barrier. Contrary to common belief, the skin is not our largest protective barrier. The surface area of the digestive tract, if all its folds, nooks, and crannies were unfolded, is more than 350 square meters. For the lungs, with three hundred million or so alveoli, the total surface area is around 70 square meters. The skin, in comparison, is only about 2 square meters. These barriers also provide the routes of entry for the substances that our body depends on for its survival\u2014the air we breathe, the liquids we drink, the food we eat\u2014as well as other substances, such as drugs, be they pharmaceutical or recreational, and pollutants. We rely on these same routes for the noninvasive administration of substances via inhalation, ingestion, and transdermal application. Injection is the major invasive route of administration. Our body's natural barriers are our interface with our environment. They work in symbiosis with the microbiota, the aggregate of microorganisms that resides on or within a number of human tissues and biofluids, to process any substances we come in contact with. After administration by one of these routes, substances go through the following stages: For Review Only Partially soluble in alcohol. Organic solvents.

Lead is stored in the bones for decades, and asbestos stays in the lungs forever. Essential oils may stay in the body for a few hours to a few days, depending on the oil. Absorption Metabolism Absorption is the process by which the administered substance crosses the barriers to enter the body and reach the bloodstream through lymphatic circulation and the capillaries. The amount absorbed and the rate of absorption depend on the substance and the route of administration. Distribution For Review Only Distribution is the movement of substances throughout the body through the circulatory system. Certain substances may be attracted to specific organs or systems, either by design for therapeutic purpose or with adverse toxic effects in the case of pollutants. Storage Certain substances may be stored in various parts of the body, such as fat or bone, to remain there for anywhere from a few days to years or decades. For example, marijuana stays in the body for one to three months, depending on body fat content; opiates stay for three to seven days, cocaine and methamphetamines stay for three to five days, alcohol stays for twelve to twenty-four hours, and nicotine stays for one to ten days. Pesticides like DDT (which is currently banned in most of the world) can stay in EsOiAr.indd 60 Most substances absorbed into the body interact with various endogenous chemicals secreted by organs such as the stomach, intestines, pancreas, and liver and are thus transformed, in a process called metabolism, into new substances called metabolites. For example, when macronutrients\u2014carbohydrates, proteins, fats\u2014 are metabolized, their breakdown provides the body with the energy to run cellular processes and forms the building blocks for proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Metabolism tends to produce substances that are easier for the body to excrete, but in some cases, the metabolites may be more toxic than the original substance that was absorbed. Ingested tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is metabolized into 11-hydroxy-THC, which is much more psychoactive than THC and takes much longer to cross the blood-brain barrier. The liver turns alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is far more toxic and damaging than alcohol itself. Acetaldehyde is usually turned rapidly into acetic acid (our harmless, good old vinegar), but this second conversion lags with heavy drinking, causing headaches, nausea, palpitations, and flushing. Carriers of a genetic mutation prevalent among some populations of Asian origin\u2014Han Chinese, Taiwanese, 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 61 Japanese, and Korean\u2014have no acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity and are almost completely alcohol intolerant. constant for long periods of time, usually with adverse consequences. Excretion The brain is further protected by the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), a highly selective semipermeable border that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system and prevents the free flow of substances from systemic circulation to the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. Water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and lipid-soluble molecules are able to move freely across the BBB by passive diffusion. Molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function are selectively transported across it. However, the BBB blocks bacteria and large or hydrophilic molecules. Essential oils, being made of small lipophilic molecules, can cross the BBB. In some cases, that can be risky; essential oils containing thujone, for example, are neurotoxic and can be dangerous especially to people subject to seizure. When the absorbed substances and their metabolites have accomplished their function, the leftovers and by-products are excreted as body waste. The kidney eliminates water-soluble waste as urine. The large intestine eliminates solid waste as feces. The lungs eliminate carbon dioxide. Volatile substances such as alcohol are also partially released through the lungs. The lungs also trap dust and pollutants with their cilia and mucus, which are then excreted in the mucus. BIOAVAILABILITY THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER For Review Only Whether we are talking about administering nutrients, nutraceuticals, or pharmaceuticals or being exposed to toxins, pathogens, or pollutants, an important factor to consider is bioavailability, broadly defined as the proportion of substance that is absorbed and distributed in the body. Bioavailability varies a lot depending on the route of administration, the physicochemical properties of the substance, and the physiology of the user. Bioavailability is 100 percent for injected substances, but it varies from 0 to 100 percent for inhaled substances and topical applications, and it varies substantially for ingested substances, too, as we will see in the next section. Bioavailability decreases with time unless the substance or its metabolites are stored, in which case bioavailability may remain relatively EsOiAr.indd 61 ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION OF SUBSTANCES The main routes of administration of substances \u2014whether drugs, food, or others\u2014are: d Respiratory system (nasal cavity and lungs) d Mucous membranes (nasal, sublingual, vaginal, and anal) d Skin (transdermal d Digestive system (oral administration) d Injection 2/11/20 12:33 PM 62 Comparative Study of Modes of Administration The Respiratory System Administration of substances via the respiratory system targets the nasal cavity and the lungs, both of which allow fast absorption into the bloodstream. It also targets the olfactory system within the nasal cavity, which transmits olfactory stimuli but is not normally considered an absorption channel. The Olfactory Pathway: Scent Stimulation The olfactory pathway is a sensory system. It transmits stimuli, not substances, and therefore is not a mode of administration per se. However, as we shall see below, some substances, such as psychoactive substances, may be directly absorbed into the brain through a process known as olfactory transfer. The olfactory mucosa is a specialized part of the respiratory mucosa that lines the upper region of the nasal cavity. It consists of the olfactory epithelium covered by a thin layer of connective tissue, the lamina propria. The olfactory epithelium contains the bipolar olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells, which are stem cells that continuously regenerate olfactory receptor neurons and supporting cells. The olfactory system and the hippocampus are the only parts of the brain that have been observed to undergo continuing neurogenesis (the production of neurons by stem cells) in adult mammals. In the olfactory system, this neurogenesis takes place in the olfactory bulbs as well as outside the brain, in the olfactory epithelium, which is replaced every six to eight weeks. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 62 Fig. 6.2. The respiratory system Glial cells called olfactory ensheathing cells are found in the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory nerve, and the olfactory bulbs. They ensheath the nonmyelinated axons of olfactory receptor neurons and growth and regeneration of olfactory axons. Olfactory ensheathing cells have gotten excited thanks to their axonal regeneration 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 63 property. These cells have been successfully harvested and used in clinical trials to study their potential in spinal cord repair and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. When we smell something, what's happening is that odorant molecules, such as aromatic molecules, stimulate the olfactory receptor neurons. Even very small amounts of odorant substances can cause an olfactory stimulation. The receptor neurons transmit information about the olfactory stimulus to the olfactory bulbs and, from there, to the thalamus and the amygdala, which is part of the limbic system. The limbic system is involved in the perception of emotions, which may explain why scents can generate strong emotions. The effects of olfactory stimulation are mostly subconscious and become conscious only when we are exposed to new olfactory stimuli. The olfactory pathway is the ideal channel for emotional and spiritual effects. The olfactory bulbs are like an extension of the brain, and they are directly connected to the olfactory epithelium and the mucosa. The olfactory mucosa is the only part of the body where neurons are directly exposed to the external environment. fer of substance is the small surface area of the olfactory epithelium, at just 10 square centimeters, which limits the amount of substance that could be absorbed. Also limiting is the location of the olfactory epithelium at the very top of the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity has a total surface area of 150 square centimeters, consisting mostly of respiratory epithelium. Several experiments suggest that olfactory transfer is achievable but may not be sufficient to reach therapeutic level. Olfactory transfer is probably a factor in the effects of snorted psychoactive substances such as cocaine or heroin; the olfactory transfer may provide an instant effect while the effect of nasal absorption is delayed by five minutes or more. Experiments on rodents demonstrate the transfer of morphine along the olfactory pathway to the central nervous system after nasal administration. Currently, olfactory transfer is being investigated as a route to deliver stem cells to the central nervous system in cases of neurodegenerative For Review Only Olfactory (Transcribrial) Transfer The fact that the olfactory system provides direct access to the brain raises an intriguing question: Can certain substances be absorbed through the olfactory mucosa and into the olfactory bulb, bypassing the One limiting factor for trans- EsOiAr.indd 63 Fig. 6.3. Olfactory transfer 2/11/20 12:33 PM 64 Comparative Study of Modes of Administration diseases. But the process is still poorly understood, and it is not clear whether hydrophobic substances, such as essential oils, can use this delivery pathway to the brain. Nasal Cavity: Nasal Absorption Nasal absorption has long been used as a method of administration in medicine as well as for recreational drug use and is ideal for substances that are active in low doses, such as essential oils. The nasal cavity is covered by a thin, well-vascularized mucosa, allowing the transfer of substances across the epithelial cell layer and directly into the systemic blood circulation. Nasal administration is convenient and noninvasive, and an easy method for self-administration. When a substance is sniffed or sprayed into the nose, absorption may take as little as five minutes for smaller molecules, with a bioavailability of close to 100 percent, nearly duplicating the effects of injection without its inconvenience. Nasal administration is limited by the volume that can be administered into the nasal cavity and subject to a high variability in the amount of drug absorbed. Upper airway infections and irritation of the nasal mucosa may increase the variability. Repeated use raises the risk of harmful long-term effects on the nasal epithelium. Intranasal delivery is commonly used for anesthetics and analgesics, steroids, and antiasthma medication. A lot of research has recently gone into its potential use for a wide range of applications ranging from vaccines to hormones, peptides, and insulin. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 64 Fig. 6.4. The nasal mucosa Upon inhalation, either with a diffuser or an inhaler, some essential oils can be absorbed via the nasal cavity. The Lungs The lungs have a fractal structure with a total surface area of around 70 square meters, allowing rapid and efficient oxygenation of the blood. Upon inhalation, air flows through numerous passageways, called bronchi and bronchioles, to approximately three hundred million alveoli. 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 65 Alveoli are the tiny airspaces where gaseous exchange with the capillaries takes place; carbon dioxide is removed from the blood and oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream. Exhalation expels the carbon dioxide-laden air. The respiratory system is the most efficient and fastest route of administration for many substances, including macromolecules, with rapid absorption and high bioavailability, both for local and systemic effects. Substances that can be absorbed through the lung tissue quickly reach the bloodstream. Pulmonary administration, as it's known, is the fastest and most potent delivery route for psychoactive substances, which, by definition, can cross the blood-brain barrier. This explains why psychoactive substances such as crack cocaine, crystal meth, heroin, and other opioids are far more addictive when smoked than even when injected. Small lipophilic molecules, such as essential oils, are absorbed within seconds after inhalation, while small hydrophilic molecules need a little more time, being absorbed within up to about ten minutes. Most of the substances that cannot be absorbed by the lungs are subsequently expelled through the mucus, but some substances, such as coal powder, tar from smoke (from tobacco or other sources), asbestos, and other pollutants tend to accumulate in the lung tissues and cause long-term damage, such as cancer and degenerative diseases. Essential oils, being volatile aromatic compounds, have a natural affinity for the respira- For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 65 Fig. 6.5. The respiratory pathway tory system. Nebulization is the most efficient method of pulmonary administration. One drop is approximately 0.05 milliter, with a diameter of approximately 5 millimeters and a total contact surface area of 0.65 square centimeter. The same drop broken by nebulization into droplets of 5 microns in diameter has a total contact surface area of 650 square centimeters\u2014a thousand times more. Administration by respiratory routes is thus the most efficient method to use essential oils 2/11/20 12:33 PM 66 Comparative Study of Modes of Administration and provokes effects at all levels: physical, energetic, emotional, and spiritual. Mucous Membranes Mucosal absorption includes the route of nasal absorption, discussed earlier, as well as sublingual (under the tongue) absorption, vaginal absorption, and anal absorption. It is a relatively fast absorption method yielding high bioavailability, but its uses are limited by the high sensitivity of mucous membranes. Many substances may cause irritation, as is the case with phenolic essential oils such as thyme, oregano, and clove. The Skin: Transdermal Administration The skin is our tightest barrier. Substances applied to the skin must penetrate the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, which is primarily composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids. Substances that pass through the stratum corneum must then penetrate the dermis, the hypodermis, and adjacent tissues before they can enter the bloodstream through lymphatic circulation and the capillaries. Repeated exposure of the skin to irritating substances may cause dermatitis. That damage For Review Only Fig. 6.6. Transdermal administration EsOiAr.indd 66 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 67 reduces the skin's ability to serve as a barrier. Pathogens may be absorbed through skin irritations such as lesions, wounds, or even mosquito bites. Transdermal application is made through a wide range of products, including oils, creams, foams, gels, lotions, ointments, and transdermal patches. The transdermal route is ideal for local effects and, of course, for skin care. Because essential oils are small molecules and highly liposoluble, they can quickly penetrate the dermis and epidermis. Substances that can be absorbed through the transdermal route offer a very high level of bioavailability. Transdermal administration allows to design very fine and precise treatments, targeting specific organs and functions, with effects on all levels: physical, energetic, emotional, and spiritual. The Digestive System: Oral Administration The digestive system consists of the digestive tract and accessory organs (the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas). The digestive tract (gastrointestinal tract) is a continuous tube with two openings: the mouth For Review Only Fig. 6.7. Oral administration EsOiAr.indd 67 2/11/20 12:33 PM 68 Comparative Study of Modes of Administration and the rectum. Substances that pass through the digestive tract do not technically enter the body until they are metabolized and absorbed through the walls of the digestive tract. From the digestive tract, they can go to the liver or the lymphatic system and then on to the bloodstream. Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into small molecules that are then absorbed into the body. While the other routes of administering substances are rather selective and do not transform those substances in any meaningful way, the digestive system can absorb a wide range of substances\u2014liquids, solids, and everything in between\u2014and transform them into chemicals that barely resemble what was ingested. In a sense, the digestive system is the body's chemical factory. The chemical breakdown is done by the enzymes and the intestinal flora\u2014that is, the complex community of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and yeasts), sometimes called probiotics, that live in the digestive tract. The intestinal flora not only help the body break down and digest food but also are responsible for the synthesis of some vitamins and nutrients. For example, normal intestinal flora help the body create vitamin K. They also aid mineral absorption and help transform certain types of starches and sugars into energy sources for the body. The balance of our intestinal flora system is relatively fragile and can be affected by various drugs, especially antibiotics and antiseptics. Essential oils, being antiseptic and bactericidal, can also affect the intestinal flora. Drugs administered orally are first broken down and may be chemically destroyed or altered in the stomach, and from there, they are further metabolized in the intestines. Any metabolites and remaining drug residues that are absorbed through the intestinal walls are transported through the portal vein to the liver, where they undergo a process called first-pass metabolism. The phenomenon (also known as the first-pass effect or presystemic metabolism) is is the process by which the concentration of a drug is considerably reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Among its other functions, the liever detoxifies the body of potentially harmful chemicals, breaking them down and processing them for excretion. When the liver receives drugs or their metabolites from the bloodstream, it works in this manner to deactivate them. Consequently, their first pass through the liver greatly reduces their bioavailability. The greater the efficiency of the first step, the lesser the volume of the drug and its metabolites that reaches systemic circulation in the body. Substances absorbed through the digestive system take a relatively long time to reach the blood because they are subject to metabolism within both the digestive system and the liver before they can reach the bloodstream. While the bioavailability of macronutrients\u2014 carbohydrates, fats, protein\u2014is usually quite high, at over 90 percent, the bioavailability of micronutrients\u2014vitamins and minerals, as well as bioactives phytochemicals\u2014can vary widely. The bioavailability of lipophilic substances, such as essential oils, can be greatly For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 68 2/11/20 12:33 PM Comparative Study of Modes of Administration 69 improved by using lipids\u2014oils or other fats\u2014 as carriers. Internal use is generally the slowest, most wasteful, most inefficient, and most potentially harmful way to use essential oils. It loses all the subtle effects linked to olfaction. It is, however, the best way to treat any condition related to the digestive system and can be powerful in treating certain conditions such as infectious diseases. But the internal use of essential oils is controversial, in large part due to regulatory reasons. Many aromatherapists fear that internal use and related therapeutic claims may prompt regulators to classify essential oils as pharmaceutical drugs, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the aromatherapy industry. While many, myself included, warn against the potential dangers of the internal use of essential oils, the fatalities that can be attributed to essential oils over the past fifty years can probably still be counted on two hands. Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins University researchers estimate that medical errors cause about 251,000 deaths per year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of death in the country. For Review Only Injection Injection, whether intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal, is the most common invasive route of substance administration. The bioavailability of injected substances is 100 percent, and the onset of action ranges from fifteen to thirty seconds for intravenous, EsOiAr.indd 69 Fig. 6.8. Intravenous administration ten to twenty minutes for intramuscular and intradermal, and fifteen to thirty minutes for subcutaneous. Injection is particularly well suited for drugs that are poorly absorbed or ineffective when taken orally, or whenever fast effect is desirable, such as in the event of an emergency. Intravenous infusions can be used to deliver continuous medication or fluids. Among the disadvantages of injection are need for trained staff and a sterile environment, potential pain or discomfort for 2/11/20 12:33 PM 70 Comparative Study of Modes of Administration the patient, an increased risk of side effects and even overdose if the dose has been calculated incorrectly, and a risk of infection from contaminated needles. It should be noted that mosquito bites are by far the most common invasive mode of administration, delivering unwanted viruses and bacteria to unsuspecting victims. Mosquitoes claim over three million lives worldwide every year, making the pesky little buggers the living beings most lethal to humans, being even more lethal than human themselves. Meanwhile, human-tohuman violence causes over 1.6 million deaths worldwide, the vast majority by firearms, making them the second most lethal invasive substance delivery method. Injection is not a method of administration used with essential oils. For Review Only Fig. 6.9.

They can be used in many different ways; however, particular methods are more suited to particular applications. For instance, the diffuser is the best way to treat lung conditions, while massage is the best application for muscle pain or rheumatism. The various methods of application of essential oils can be used in conjunction. Massage, bath, and diffuser, for instance, work wonders when used in combination. The major methods of using essential oils are: Whether taken internally or externally, essential oils diffuse through the skin and membranes and penetrate deeply into the tissues and the circulatory system. Therefore, external application is a very efficient way to treat specific organs. As a rule, ingestion is indicated only for infectious diseases and to act on the digestive system (throat, stomach, liver, etc.). A massage of the corresponding zone is very helpful in such cases. In any case, essential oils should be taken internally only under supervision of a trained specialist. For Review Only INTERNAL USE d Internally (by ingestion, though essential oils Some adepts of aromatherapy tend to glamorize internal use. They wrongly feel that they have been initiated or have graduated to some higher level of aromatherapy when they start using essential oils internally. They are reinforced in that attitude by unscrupulous marketers who market their oils as \"pharmaceutical grade\" or \"therapeutic grade\" fit for internal use, intended should be taken internally only under direct supervision of a physician) d Through inhalation d Through the skin (massage, bath, friction, application) d Skin care and cosmetic use (facial, compresses, masks, lotions, creams) d Hair care 72 EsOiAr.indd 72 2/11/20 12:33 PM The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being 73 for the rarefied few who have been initiated to the internal art. These marketers usually charge a stiff premium for their products. In fact, there are no recognized standards for pharmaceutical- grade or therapeutic-grade essential oils. To be suitable for internal use, or for aromatherapeutic use in general, essential oils should be pure, natural, and preferably derived from wild or organic plant material. Internal use of essential oils is not safe and is not even very efficient unless they are taken in capsules or time-release form. When taken through the mouth in drops, the essential oils are mostly absorbed by the tissues in the mouth. Whatever reaches the stomach can provoke heartburn and is very hard on the liver. In fact, regular internal use of essential oils can severely damage the liver. Most of the essential oil will be destroyed in the digestive tract and will never make it to the bloodstream. In the end, internal use is usually a harmful and inefficient method of application. The few reported accidents and all of the handful of fatalities from use of essential oils involved internal use. It is true that in some cases internal use can be very efficient: two drops of peppermint oil on the tongue will quickly clear upset stomach, nausea, or motion sickness; two or three drops of rosemary on a piece of brown sugar will get rid of a hangover after a wild party. Roman chamomile clears sluggish digestion or minor food poisoning. Fennel will promote lactation in nursing mothers. Likewise, cinnamon or savory in capsules are great for intestinal infections. But in most cases, internal use of essential oils concerns medical practice and is generally not advised self-medication. Essential oils can be taken undiluted on a small piece of sugar or mixed with honey. In this case, it is very important to carefully respect the doses. Any oil can be dangerous at high doses; the most toxic are, in decreasing fennel. These oils should never be taken internally under any circumstances. As a rule, when other essential oils are taken internally, the maximum dose should be five drops three times a day. For internal use, do not dilute pure essential oils in a cup of hot or cold water. Hot water will evaporate most of the essential oil; with cold water, most of the essential oil will stick to the walls of the cup. Do not use disposable plastic or styrofoam cups because essential oils, being solvents, will dissolve them and you will end up ingesting dissolved plastic. For a more flexible and convenient option for internal use, you can dilute essential oils in ethyl alcohol (such as rum or vodka). Mix \u00bc ounce of essential oils (either a single oil or a blend) in 4 ounces of 90 percent ethyl alcohol (do not use rubbing alcohol). This will give you a 6 percent preparation (for preparations in metric, use 6 milliliters of essential oil in 100 milliliters of alcohol). Take fifteen drops up to three times a day. The maximum dose is sixty drops a day. The most efficient and safer way to use essential oils internally is to blend them in a For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 73 2/11/20 12:33 PM 74 The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being carrier oil, such as sweet almond, coconut, borage, or similar, at a 20 percent concentration, or fifty drops in 8 milliliters of carrier oil.

For Review Only APPLICATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THROUGH THE OLFACTORY AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS Aromatic honey Absorption, Distribution, and Bioavailability Ingested essential oils are absorbed and distributed within thirty to ninety minutes, with a EsOiAr.indd 74 The use of aromatic fumigations is probably as old as humanity. Priests, sorcerers, and healers of all traditions used them extensively in their ceremonies and various rituals. Ancient Egyptians burned perfumes in the streets and inside the temples. More than two thousand years ago, Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, successfully struggled against the epidemic of plague in Athens, using aromatic fumigations throughout the city. In the Middle Ages, people burned pine or other fragrant woods in the streets in times of epidemic to cast out 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being 75 devils. Perfumers were known to resist disease. The application of essential oils through the olfactory and respiratory systems is the easiest, most pleasant, and, in most cases, most effective way to apply them. This method requires minimal patient action: all the patient has to do is turn on a proper diffusing device, which disperses essential oils into the air, and breathe! This application method is the best and easiest way to introduce a newcomer to the world of aromatherapy. Various devices have been designed to disperse essential oils into the air. Essential oils can be diffused in a mist with an atomizing diffuser, vaporized through heat in a candle diffuser or scented candle, or dispersed using a room spray. For Review Only Inhalation Devices Nasal inhalers generally consist of a small plastic or metal container with a cotton wick that can be soaked in essential oils. Steam inhalers vaporize essential oils for respiratory distribution and provide the added benefit of steam, which loosens mucus. Inhalation provides almost instantaneous absorption with very high bioavailability. Cold Diffusion The Atomizing Diffuser The atomizing diffuser is the most effective way to disperse essential oils into the air. It is recommended for all diseases related to the lungs, the heart, the brain, and the blood. The atomizing diffuser projects drops of essential oils into a nebulizer, using air as a propellant. EsOiAr.indd 75 Atomizing diffuser The nebulizer acts as an expansion chamber, where the drops of oil are broken into a very thin mist. This mist, consisting of tiny, ionized droplets of essential oils, remains suspended for several hours, revitalizing the air with the antiseptic and deodorant properties of the essential oils. The oxidation of the essential oils provokes the formation of low doses of natural ozone that decomposes in ionic nascent oxygen. This process, occurring naturally in forests, has an invigorating and purifying effect. The atomizing diffuser is particularly effective since it diffuses the oils without altering or heating them. Since air is the propellant, there is no chemical pollution. Through the atomizing diffuser, we experience all the various levels of action of essential 2/11/20 12:34 PM 76 The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being oils at their maximum efficiency. It can be used for almost all prescriptions of aromatherapy. It is the subtlest, easiest, and most pleasant way to apply essential oils. It can be installed in any public or private place where air treatment is needed: saunas, hot tubs, hospitals, consulting rooms, waiting rooms, gymnastic centers, schools, and, of course, at home, in the living room, bedroom, kitchen, or bath. A lot of clinical research on the use of this apparatus demonstrates the biophysical action of essential oils applied through diffusion. In addition to the antiseptic action, already widely documented, there is a very strong action on the lungs and the respiratory system in general (asthma, bronchitis, cold, sinusitis, sore throats, etc.). The effect on the circulatory system, the heart, and the nervous system is also very pronounced. The lungs are one of the main energy centers. Proper breathing allows for a better energy level. The absorption of essential oils through the respiratory system is one of the best ways to activate them on the energy level. There is an obvious connection between the psychic centers and the lungs. Most spiritual practices emphasize the importance of breathing. Breathing essential oils diffused through an atomizing diffuser can thus be seen as the best way to experience the subtle effects of essential oils on the emotional level, the spirit, and the soul. It can be used in many places where a diffuser is not practical (bathroom, car, garbage can, etc.). However, it creates fairly large droplets, which limit its efficiency, and, of course, it only diffuses for a fraction of a second. Heat Diffusion Essential oils can also be dispersed into the air through a heat source, in which case they are vaporized. This method is not as efficient as cold diffusion, which creates a mist, especially for therapeutic purposes. For Review Only Sprays Essential oils can be dispersed into the air through a room spray. This method has the advantage of being extremely easy and portable. EsOiAr.indd 76 Heat diffusion Candle Diffusers In the candle diffuser, a small candle (votive or tea light) is placed underneath a well that holds the oils. The heat vaporizes and disperses the oils. 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being 77 that it is impossible to tell which one will be your favorite. In addition, your appreciation will depend on your mood, the time of the day, the season, etc. Candle diffuser Aromatic Candles Aromatic candles contain 5 to 8 percent essential oils in their wax. When the wax melts, the essential oil is released. This is the most inefficient way to diffuse essential oils because a large percentage of the oils are burned by the flame. Calming (evening): Lavender, marjoram, chamomile, tangerine Stimulant (morning): Sage, rosemary, pine, mints Aphrodisiac: Ylang-ylang, jasmine, champaca flowers, sandalwood, patchouli, ginger, juniper, rosemary Insomnia: Neroli, spikenard, marjoram, chamomile For Review Only Dosage The use of essential oil in a diffuser is generally very safe provided you use your common sense. For an average size room, the recommended use is fifteen to thirty minutes, two or three times a day. Permanent use can be appropriate in an open space, such as a store, or in large spaces, such as a large office, a spa, or a large house with open floor plan. Some Oils to Use in Diffusion The sense of smell is very subjective; you might particularly like some fragrances and dislike some others, depending on so many factors EsOiAr.indd 77 See appendices I and II for more specific indications. Absorption, Distribution, and Bioavailability Respiratory administration offers the fastest absorption and highest bioavailability of all the 2/11/20 12:34 PM 78 The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being administration methods, but much depends on the specific method of administration. With candles and heat diffusers, for example, the quantities of essential oils actually administered can be extremely small or almost negligible for all except olfactory effects. Nasal or steam inhalation provide the highest levels of actual administration, as most of the essential oil that is released is absorbed in the respiratory tract. Inhaled essential oils act on all levels: biophysical, energetic, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Caution and Contraindication Use the diffuser with extreme caution around people subject to allergies, emphysema, or asthma, and around newborn babies. In such cases, use the diffuser for only a few minutes at a time. If any adverse reaction occurs, discontinue immediately. Do not use oils rich tissue manipulation. It is a direct and simple form of communication between the massage therapist and patient, where the hands are extremely sensitive receptors. During the course of the massage, the hands will discover the internal geography of the body, unraveling tensions, sores, hidden pains, sensitive points, congested areas, and swollen parts, and they will tell a lot about the patient. This is why, to give the full benefit of a massage, the massage therapist must be in an open, understanding, and compassionate state of mind. In massage, the hands are channels of healing energy; they heal at the physical, emotional, and psychic level. Therefore, aromatherapy massage is an excellent therapeutic combination as essential oils and massage have mutually enhancing effects. The massage itself will help the oils penetrate into the tissues and direct them to where they are most needed, while the essential oils will treat locally or via the energy channels (nerves and meridians). You can use massage oils after the bath to moisturize and soften the skin. You can, of course, use different oils for different parts of the body, especially if you want to act on different organs. For Review Only BODY CARE USES OF ESSENTIAL OILS Massage Essential oils are particularly beneficial in massage, a slow, diffuse, gentle, and pleasant way to apply them. They are completely absorbed by the skin in 60 to 120 minutes and penetrate deeply into the tissues. Their prolonged action amplifies the effects of the massage itself. Hand healing and massage are probably the most ancient healing arts, and oils, usually scented, have been part of the treatment since its beginning. Massage goes much further than a mere EsOiAr.indd 78 How to Prepare a Massage Oil Always use ultrafiltered cold-pressed or expeller oils as a base for your massage oil. If you use cold-pressed oils, it is important that the oils that you use have been ultrafiltered.

Such 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being 79 Massage For Review Only residues add to the richness and flavor of the oil for cooking but are undesirable for massage as they may cause pore clogging. Sweet almond oil is most commonly used, but it becomes rancid very easily. Grapeseed and canola oils are fine oils with a good shelf life; they easily absorb while providing a good slip and are widely used by massage therapists and beauticians. Hazelnut oil is very rich and nourishing, although rather expensive. Peanut oil and coconut or palm oil are too heavy and may cause skin break-out. A small amount of vitamin E oil will bring some vitamins to your skin and act as a natural antioxidant. I recommend the following oils as a blend for a m assage oil base (4-ounce preparation): Canola oil: 2 ounces Grapeseed oil: 1.5 ounces Wheat germ oil: 0.5 ounce EsOiAr.indd 79 The essential oil concentration for a massage oil depends on the type of massage and the application; see tables 13 and 14 (pages 80-81). Note that partial massage is massage of only one part of the body (such as shoulder massage or massage of the hips) or massage of a particular organ (stomach, liver, lungs, etc.). Topical uses are applications on a very small area such as pressure points, chakras, energy points, or meridians. Acute conditions requiring this type of application will be conditions such as rheumatism, arthritis, or tense, painful muscles.

Aromatic Baths From Egypt to India, the ancients had elaborate ritual ablutions that were combinations of hot and cold baths, ointments, and aromatic massages. Essential oils and baths have synergistic effects. Essential oils enhance the pleasure of the bath, and to quote Robert Tisserand, \"If they please the nose, they also please the spirit. Then there is the physiological action of the essences on the nervous system and the rest of the body\" (Aromatherapy to Heal and Tend the Body, 1989).

A body gommage exfoliates dead cells from the outer skin layer, deep-cleanses the pores, activates capillary and lymphatic circulation, and stimulates the elimination of toxins. It is excellent for cellulitis or weight problems and can be done at home before the morning shower or before a bath. I recommend doing this two or three times a week. Absorption, Distribution, and Bioavailability Topical administration of essential oils, whether through massage, compress, bath, or body wrap, offers a relatively fast absorption time of fifteen For Review Only Salt scrub EsOiAr.indd 83 2/11/20 12:34 PM 84 The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being to twenty minutes, with high availability of up to 90 percent. The quantities of essential oils actually administered can reach therapeutic levels. Topically applied essential oils act primarily at the biophysical and energetic level. Topical use also produces olfactory stimulation and in this way can provoke emotional, mental, and spiritual action. SKIN CARE USES OF ESSENTIAL OILS Applied to the skin, essential oils regulate the activity of the capillaries and restore vitality to the tissues. According to Marguerite Maury (The Secret of Life and Youth), they are natural rejuvenating agents. They facilitate the elimination of waste matter and dead cells and promote the regeneration of new, healthy cells (cytophylactic power). The most pleasant scents (especially flower oils) are the most useful for skin care. They can be used in facial steam baths, compresses, masks, and body wraps. They can be added to any kind of lotion, skin cream, gel, toilet water, or perfume. As a rule, never apply essential oils undiluted on the skin. Floral waters are particularly well suited to skin care. Milder and easier to use than essential oils, they are recommended for sensitive and inflamed skins. Essential oils and floral water have more or less the same indications. You can use plain floral water for compresses. You should use floral water instead of water in any skin care preparation. Finally, you will get Facial sauna an excellent facial tonic and astringent using floral water with a spray bottle (rose, sage, rosemary, lavender, cypress, etc.)\u2014very refreshing.

Caution for Use of Essential Oils in Skin Care For Review Only Facial Oils Facial oils can be used for facial massage, or they can be used as moisturizer, nourisher, and protectant at the end of a skin care session. For a facial massage, we recommend using a base of sweet almond oil or hazelnut oil. For facial nourishment, to use at the end of the skin care session, we recommend hazelnut oil (90 percent) with vitamin E oil (2 percent), evening primrose oil (4 percent), and borage oil (4 percent) blended together. For a facial oil, we recommend the following blend as a base (for a 1-ounce or 30-milliliter preparation): EsOiAr.indd 86 General Cautions d As a general rule, never apply pure essential oils directly to the face. d Never use essential oils around the eyes. d Avoid using phenolic oils (clove, oregano, savory, red thyme) on the face. d In sunny climates, do not use bergamot oil, and use only low concentrations of citrus oils (lemon, lime, orange, tangerine). All citrus oils, especially bergamot, increase photosensitivity and may cause sunspots. d On dry skin, do not use phenolic or drying oils, such as eucalyptus or the oils rich in terpenes (pine and fir). d On inflamed and sensitive skin, lower the essential oil concentration, and do not use phenolic oils. 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Use of Essential Oils for Health, Beauty, and Well-Being 87 Table 15 Essential Oils for Skin Care Skin type/problem Essential oils Normal skin Clary sage, geranium, lavender, ylang-ylang, rosewood Dry skin Spanish sage, clary sage, cedarwood, sandalwood, rose, palmarosa, carrot Oily skin Lavender, lemon, geranium, basil, camphor, frankincense, rosemary, ylangylang Inflamed skin German chamomile, helichrysum, clary sage, lavender, myrrh, patchouli, carrot, floral waters Sensitive skin Roman chamomile, neroli, rosewood, floral waters Acne Cajeput, tea tree, eucalyptus, juniper, palmarosa, niaouli Eczema chamomile, Rejuvenation Benzoin, frankincense, sandalwood, cedarwood, geranium, lavender, myrrh, rosemary, carrot Seborrhea Bergamot, lavender, Spanish sage, cypress, patchouli Broken capillaries Wrinkles For Review Only Rose, ylang-ylang Fennel, lemon, palmarosa, myrrh, frankincense, patchouli, clary sage, carrot Lotions, Potions, Body Oils, Bath Oils, Ointments Numerous stories of scented ointments or potions, from the remotest antiquity to the Renaissance, from the Holy Bible to the most lascivious mythological tales, are recounted.

Essential oils are very powerful substances that should be treated with respect; they are highly concentrated plant extracts and should not be abused. Each drop is equivalent to at least 1 ounce of plant material. Therefore, it is always important to carefully respect the doses (see table 16). In most cases, essential oils are more potent in infinitesimal doses. Increasing the dosage will not usually increase efficacy. Some oils, such as the phenolic oils, can be irritating, while others, like the ketones, can be toxic. Proper dosage is critical. The recommended dosage for each type of application and the maximum dosage for safe use are listed in table 16.

Your olfactory system will have to be reeducated, or rather detoxified. After years of neglect and abuse with junk perfumes, your nose might not be able to fully appreciate the richness of natural fragrances. Just like when you change your eating habits from junk food to a more healthy diet, you cannot really appreciate the full flavor of a lettuce leaf, a plain radish, or a bowl of brown rice. But when you start to detoxify, your taste greatly improves and refines, and soon you do not want to come back to junk again. Then the power of fragrances moves you every day; you play with them, dance with them, create with them. They connect you to the quintessence of the realm of plants. As William Langham writes in The Garden of Health (1579), they will \"make thee glad, merry, gracious and well-beloved of all men.\" For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 89 2/11/20 12:34 PM EIGHT Essential Oil Classifications Plants are classified in botanical families according to the structure of their flowers. But this classification goes beyond the flower itself. Each plant of the same family appears like a variation of the basic model of the type: same leaf and seed structure, similar rhythm (in space and time), and similar chemical composition. With Goethe, the anthroposophists believe in an archetypal plant that exhibits the structural potentialities of the vegetable kingdom and manifests itself through different degrees of differentiation in families, species, and chemotypes. In this system, each type expressed by the botanical families represents a certain degree of evolution of the archetypal model\u2014a certain level of actualization of its potentialities, from the primitive of the Equisetaceae (horsetail) to the most evolved of the Rosaceae (rose, apple, etc.). Differentiation of the type generates the species (or genus), which is then further differentiated in subspecies and chemotypes. In the anthroposophic vision, inspired by the works of Paracelsus and the study of homeopathy, the physical aspect of the plants and the nature of their interactions with the environment are correlated with their medicinal properties. A type of therapeutic activity is attributed to each botanical family, variations being related to each plant of the family. This approach is quite rich and accurate. It is fairly consistent with the more classical systems of herbal therapy and aromatherapy: there are some obvious similarities between the recommended uses of plants in the same family. While a wildcrafter in southern France, I experienced the accuracy of such a vision. In some powerful experiences of intimate communication with plants, I felt that the plants introduced themselves to me and I could tell the medicinal properties or even the names of plants that I had never seen before. More generally, I found that careful observation of the plant and its environment told me much about its activity. For Review Only 90 EsOiAr.indd 90 2/11/20 12:34 PM Essential Oil Classifications 91 At any rate, classification of essential oils by botanical families tells more about their therapeutic activity than a mere alphabetical classification, and that will be my approach to this chapter. I hope that this gives my readers a better understanding of aromatherapy. SYNTHETICS VERSUS NATURAL: DOES IT MAKE SCENTS? Many people think that molecules produced through the processes of life are more active in a living context (such as medicine) than their synthetic counterparts are, although they cannot really be chemically differentiated from their natural cousins. There is even growing evidence that this belief is well founded. Along the same line of thought, a natural extract is often found to be more efficient than its main active ingredient. Is it possible that molecules have some kind of memory? That they store the information pertaining to their history? That life shares a common pool of memories? That natural molecules are more accurate in dealing with living organisms because they have stored living memory? If so, a natural molecule could \"know\" how to deal with other living molecules. Each molecule belonging to a given extract would have a memory of its companions and could predictably be more efficient when not separated from these companions. it take your kids to learn how to ride their bikes? A few hours? Two days? When the first cars were invented, most people were too scared to even think about driving them. Now the average teenager learns how to drive in very little time. When Einstein introduced the theory of relativity, years passed before a handful of people could figure it out. Currently, relativity is taught in college. How long did it take you to learn how to use a computer? How long did it take your kids? When you look at up-to-date college textbooks, how often do you feel that you haven't any clue to what they are all about? According to Rupert Sheldrake, all these phenomena can be accounted for by the concept of morphogenetic fields, a theory that we can manifest what we create in our thoughts just by envisioning. To put it simply, a morphogenetic field can be viewed as a landscape, with mountains, valleys, plains, riverbeds, and so on. Each valley and each riverbed corresponds to flows of information, all interconnected. A totally new input of information can be viewed as a small furrow being traced somewhere in the landscape. The more this information is used, the deeper its furrow becomes, and the more likely it will be to attract new information, until it resembles a valley or a main stream. Learning a new technique, for instance, deepens the corresponding furrow. The greater the number of people who learn this technique, the deeper the furrow, and the easier it becomes for other people to learn the technique. Of course, a new furrow is generated only when the landscape is ready for it. This would For Review Only THE CONCEPT OF MORPHOGENETIC FIELDS When bicycles were first invented, it took people months to learn how to ride them. How long did EsOiAr.indd 91 2/11/20 12:34 PM 92 Essential Oil Classifications account for the fact that very often, whenever the ground is ready for a new discovery, several people will make this discovery at the same time.* Conversely, whenever an area of the morphogenetic field does not flow, it becomes locally stagnant, and sediment accumulates. Thus, valleys are filled up, riverbeds disappear, and information is buried because of disuse. The concept of the morphogenetic field is an excellent tool for describing all the processes of evolution, whether evolution of the universe, evolution of species, cultural evolution, or personal evolution. It helps us understand how patterns are created. For example, positive thinking is a personal application of the morphogenetic field; it can act as the path to achieving one's goals by attracting positive experience. The more we imagine ourselves achieving success, the more successful we become. This is why I am an incurable optimist and why I think that pessimists are always wrong especially when they are right. Botanical families can be viewed as deep valleys in the vegetal morphogenetic field, dividing into the rivers of species and the streams of subspecies of chemotypes. Each of these valleys, rivers, and streams has been generated throughout the ages in close interaction with the local and global environment (other fami- lies and species and the ecosystems supporting them, including microorganisms, animals, and humans). We can see how the concept of the morphogenetic field is in total agreement with the Gaia hypothesis. Our planet is a living organism. Humanity has brought consciousness to this organism\u2014for a purpose, undoubtedly. This purpose cannot be the destruction of the planet. As conscious cells of this organism, we have a responsibility to take care of our planet. Otherwise, we behave like a virus in a sick body, and the organism will try to get rid of us. A lose-lose situation. Our planet, the body we all live in together, is presently going through an acute toxic crisis. For those of you familiar with natural healing, this means that our planet will most probably need to go through a dramatic discharge process. But this is an emergency. No economic or other consideration can prevail against this absolute necessity. There is now an enormous worldwide awareness of this crisis. This can be viewed as a natural defense mechanism of our planet. We must capitalize on this movement and start acting now. We can do it, individually and collectively. For Review Only *Interestingly enough, in the late 1970s, my research in logic and the theory of information came very close to the ideas that Rupert Sheldrake was developing (I talked about field of forms; he talks about morphogenetic fields). I presented a paper at the University of California at Berkeley in 1980 to explain my theories. I was not aware of Sheldrake at that time, nor was he aware of my work. EsOiAr.indd 92 BACK TO THE BOTANICAL FAMILIES Botanical Families and the Gaia Hypothesis The vegetable kingdom appeared on our planet long before the animal kingdom. Through evolution, from the primitive moss or fern, it gradually 2/11/20 12:34 PM Essential Oil Classifications 93 differentiated to generate the thousands of species that we now know. This evolution was at first independent of the animal kingdom (but maybe it was preparing the ground for it\u2014by producing oxygen, for instance). Then, when the first animals appeared on our planet (and they appeared because the morphogenetic field was ready for them), the two realms evolved in close interaction. For example, more and more vegetable species came to depend on insects for pollination. And, of course, animals were totally dependent on plants for their subsistence. It is not unreasonable to think that this interaction went very far; plants were not only food for the animal kingdom but were also medicine. Animals provided fertilizers; they carried the seeds and buried them, moved the ground with their feet, and trimmed the bushes. If the Gaia hypothesis is well founded\u2014and I believe it is\u2014and if our planet can be viewed as a living organism, this is not surprising. Certain plants became specialized in their interaction with the animal kingdom. Human intervention further accentuated this process; the plants that are now cultivated domestically have been \"created\" through a long selection process. The varieties of corn, wheat, apples, or potatoes that we buy in our supermarkets do not exist in the wild\u2014they were produced through genetic breeding. The study of botanical families, by going from the global (the vegetable kingdom) to the particular (the species and the subspecies) through the differentiation process (the botanical families), gives us a better understanding of and appreciation for our living planet. Each plant has accumulated through the millions of years of its history the living memory of the vegetable kingdom, the memory of its family, the memory of its genus and its species. All this information is here for us to share and respect. This is an ongoing miracle. The Plant's Domain of Creativity When we look at a planet from the perspective of the botanical family, we can learn a lot from the family itself. We also can learn from the part of the plant where its creativity is the most developed, and, in studying aromatherapy, where its essential oil is produced. Each family seems to have a privileged domain of creativity. The Lamiaceae and Myrtacea produce their essential oils mostly in the leaves. The rose produces them in the flower; the citruses in the flower, the fruit, and the leaves; the Burseraceae in their exudate; and so on. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 93 Evolution Involution Each plant goes from the physical sphere, with the germ and then the roots, through the vital sphere with the leaves, and to the astral sphere with the flower in a natural evolution process. It then creates its fruit or seed in an involution back to the physical world. Essential oils produced in the roots (angelica, vetiver) tend to have a very grounding energy; they have a food-like quality to them. They are not very refined, but they usually are potent stimulants of the vital functions (especially digestion) of the organism. 2/11/20 12:34 PM 94 Essential Oil Classifications Typically, they are recommended for anemia. The plant's leaf system corresponds to its vital body. Essential oils produced in the leaves (eucalyptus, niaouli, peppermint, etc.) have a strong affinity with the prajna energy and the respiratory system. They tone the vital body. Excessive development of the leaf system of a plant is a sign of etheric imbalance that can produce toxicity (as in some Umbelliferae). The flower is the plant's ultimate achievement. Only the most spiritually evolved plants (such as the rose) can fully create at this level. The production of fragrance is then a sign of intense astral activity. Although the essential oils are found in extremely small amounts in the flowers, their fragrances are typically very intense, although refined in nature. The plants with the most intense floral creativity rarely produce any significant fruit or seed. These plants' creativity is exhausted with the fragrance, and their creation does not belong to the physical plant any longer. Such fragrances have a tendency to be exhilarating (jasmine) or even intoxicating (narcissus). The essential oils of flowers are then usually very refined and subtle but very hard to extract. They often are too far removed from the physical sphere to be extracted through steam distillation. (Neroli and rose are an exception, as they are particularly well-balanced plants; they For Review Only Vetiver roots EsOiAr.indd 94 2/11/20 12:34 PM Essential Oil Classifications 95 For Review Only Rose both produce edible fruits: oranges and rose hips, respectively.) Very sensitive to temperature, their molecules break apart when exposed to heat. Some of them can be extracted by solvents (jasmine, tuberose, narcissus). The oils produced in the seed bring us back fully into the physical world, being less sophisticated, more humble, and straightforward (citrus fruits, anise, fennel, coriander). They are invigorating and fortifying and show a strong affinity with the digestive system (especially those seeds that are food or spices). Trees and bushes also have the ability to create oils in their wood (sandalwood, cedar- EsOiAr.indd 95 wood). Such oils are centering and equilibrating. Here the creative process is drawn into the heart of the wood. These oils have the power to open our consciousness to higher spheres without making us lose control. They are particularly suited to rituals, meditation, and yoga. Finally, many trees and bushes (myrrh, frankincense, conifers, cistus) produce odorous resins or gums. These essential oils have a strong affinity for the glandular system; they control secretions and demonstrate cosmetic and healing properties (skin care, wounds, ulcers). 2/11/20 12:34 PM NINE The Essential Oils in Botanical Families ANONACEAE Exuberant Fruity Creativity of Tropical Living Fossils For Review Only Commonly known as the custard apple family or soursop family, Annonaceae is the largest family of the magnolia order (Magnoliales). It is one of the most primitive families of angiosperms (flowering plants) and can be considered a living fossil. Found mainly in the tropics all around the globe, especially in rain forests, the family consists of trees, shrubs, and, more rarely, lianas. Although the bark, leaves, flowers, and roots of many species are aromatic and used as spices and in folk medicine, only ylang-ylang essential oil is produced commercially. Many species produce large pulpy fruits, such as guanabana (soursop), pond apple, bush banana.

The \"complete\" (i.e., the whole oil) should be used for aromatherapy. The oil is yellowish and syrupy and makes a good fragrance fixative. Ylang-ylang, whose name means \"flower of flowers,\" is a tree growing up to 60 feet high that produces beautiful yellow flowers. In Indonesia, people spread them on the bed of newly married couples on their wedding night. In the Molucca Islands, people soak ylang-ylang and cucuma flowers in coconut to prepare an ointment called borri-borri that they use for skin care, hair care, and skin disease and to prevent fever. According to R. W. Moncrieff, \"Ylang-ylang oil soothes and inhibits anger born of frustration.\" Supremely exotic, ylang-ylang has the soothing, sedative, slightly euphoric, even lascivious quality of extreme fire and water, the luxurious laziness of tropical islands.

The two could in fact be the same tree; the slight difference between the essences would then depend on the country of production and the method of distillation. The distillation of the flowers is a delicate operation that lasts for days; it yields up to EsOiAr.indd 97 2/11/20 12:34 PM 98 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families as a perfume, in baths, for massage, and in cosmetics. It also has a soothing effect on the skin and is recommended for oily skin. Ylang-ylang's use as the distinctive scent of legendary perfume Chanel N\u00b05 propelled it to fame in 1921, and it has since been used in numerous perfumes. Medicinal properties: Hypotensive; aphrodisiac; antidepressant, sedative, hypertension, nervous tension, insomnia; impotence, frigidity; skin care APIACEAE (UMBELLIFERAE) Plants of the Air Element Essential oils of this family include angelica, aniseed, caraway, carrot, coriander, cumin, fennel, and lovage. Other oils of interest are Ammi visnaga, dill, asafetida, celery, galbanum, and parsley. This family is characterized by the extreme division of the leaves, ending up in an aerial explosion in such plants as fennel and anise. The leaf is the origin of interaction and confrontation between air and water, light and darkness. Apiaceae obviously are very sensitive to this confrontation. The interaction of air, light, water, and earth through these extremely ramified leaves gives birth, in a contraction process, to a strong root or vigorous rhizome, which stays underground for a year or more. This subterranean organ draws the cosmic forces into the ground. Then vegetation grows rapidly in a radiating explosion until it reaches the final bouquet of the inflorescence, with its radiating umbel\u2014each branch of the umbel splitting again in umbellules. The special interaction of this family with the air element is further emphasized by the plants' ability to incorporate air within themselves in hollow stems, hollow seeds, and even hollow rhizomes. In the archetypal plant, the interaction between the plant's etheric organism and the surrounding astral forces takes place in the flower area. This process is manifested in the colors and fragrance of the flower and the formation of nectar. Apiaceae attract cosmic forces in the leaves, the stem, and even the rhizome. Their aromatic substances are therefore heavier, harsher, and less refined than floral scents. Apiaceae, in fact, start their fructification process in the leaves, or even the root. They produce some of the most tasty vegetables (carrot, celery, fennel) and condiments (parsley, Christian Fischer CC BY-SA 3.0 For Review Only Wild carrot EsOiAr.indd 98 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 99 coriander, chervil, anise, cumin, caraway, etc.). In addition to this descending movement, there is also an ascending movement of mucilages and gums, another characteristic of the family. The therapeutic action of Apiaceae is then easy to understand. First, they have an affinity for the digestive system (especially the intestine); also, they have a strong effect on the secretions and the glandular system. Finally, they are useful in respiratory diseases. According to Robert Tisserand 's Aromatherapy to Heal and Tend the Body, \"Tissue regeneration in the livers of rats has been demonstrated in the essential oils, in particular the four seed oils\u2014cumin, fennel, celery and parsley\" (which all belong to the Apiaceae family). Carrot seed oil has been used successfully to fight against the aging skin process. Fragrance: Balsamic, nicely aromatic, and slightly musky Several varieties of angelica grow in northern Europe, mainly Angelica sylvestris (wild) and Angelica archangelica (domestic, cultured). The plant was highly valued by physicians of the Renaissance. Paracelsus reported that it was of great help during the epidemic of pestilence in Milan in 1510. This vigorous, prolific plant of the air element (with a hollow stem) grows in deep humid soils and rather cool climates. (It grows wild by streams and irrigation canals.) Therefore, it is a typical plant of elimination. It helps eliminate toxins, purify the blood and lymph, and stimulate the glandular system. It is recommended for weakness and nervousness, for convalescents, and for old people.

According to Pythagorus, it is an excellent carminative and appetizer. Unlike most Apiaceae, anise grows flowers and seeds in its first year. Only in a very dry climate can the seeds fully ripen. The forces of warmth are thus condensed in these small aniseeds, the taste of which is aqueous and fiery.

Other oils of interest are arnica, calendula, tansy, yarrow, and wormwood. The Asteraceae are characterized by their inflorescence, a collection of small flowers forming a unique superior entity. This basic simple structure is able to generate such a diversity that, with about eight hundred genera and thirteen thousand species, the Asteraceae constitute the largest botanical family. Unlike orchids, another large family with amazing floral variations, Asteraceae grow all over the world in large settlements. They live in almost every terrestrial zone, except the far north and the tropical forest, from seashores to mountaintops, from desert to swamps, with a preference for open spaces widely exposed to light, such as meadows and steppes. Very adaptive and intensely associated with For Review Only Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) Primarily produced in Spain, North Africa, India, and Japan Essential oil is distilled from the seeds; it is yellowish Fragrance: Strong, anise-y, and camphoric Fennel is used in the cuisine and medicine of India, Egypt, and China.

Medicinal stones EsOiAr.indd 101 2/11/20 12:34 PM 102 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families light, Asteraceae live primarily in the floral sphere. Because they embody a perfect balance of etheric and astral forces, the therapeutic activity of the plants of this family shows great diversity. Chamomile (Anthemis nobilis, A. mixta, Chamomilla matricaria, Ormenis multicaulis) Primarily produced in France, Morocco, Spain, and Egypt Essential oils is distilled from the flowers; the oil of Anthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) and Anthemis mixta is yellow, while the oils of Chamomilla matricaria (German chamomile) is light blue and Ormenis multicaulis (blue chamomile) is dark blue, owing to the presence of azulene Fragrance: Refreshing and aromatic Used in perfumery, cosmetics, and pharmacy Dedicated to the sun by the Egyptians for its febrifuge properties, chamomile is probably one of the oldest known medicinal plants. It was traditionally regarded as the plant's physician; that is, it was thought to keep other plants in good health. Interest in chamomile has recently been revived with the discovery of azulene, an excellent anti-inflammatory agent, which is not present in the fresh flower but is formed when the plant is distilled. Many different botanical species around the world are called chamomile. Roman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) and German chamomile (Chamomilla matricaria) are the most commonly used in herbology. The oil called chamomile mixta or \"wild For Review Only Chamomile EsOiAr.indd 102 2/11/20 12:34 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 103 chamomile\" (Anthemis mixta) is distilled from the wild in southern Spain and Morocco. Blue chamomile is distilled in Morocco and Egypt. A pineapple-scented chamomile grows throughout the United States (but its essential oil has not been distilled, as far as I know). Other varieties of chamomile grow in different parts of the world but are used only locally. Roman chamomile is an excellent calming and soothing essential oil and a liver stimulant. German chamomile (whose species name, matricaria, is German for \"mother herb\") is especially indicated for female disorders (painful or irregular period, excessive loss of blood, hemorrhage). The whole plant is radiantly aerial; each beam terminates in a white-and-gold flower with a bulging receptacle, which encloses a drop of air. This flower manifests a subdued ardor, an appeased and soothing flame. (See also appendix I for the differences between the chamomiles.) Chamomile likes light; it grows on roadsides and in open fields in light sandy soils. Its affinity for the air element and its particular connection with the aerial sphere indicate its strong therapeutic action on the abnormal astral processes in the human organism. It is beneficent against spasms, convulsions, hypersensitivity, menstruation troubles, colic, and neuralgic painful digestion, digestive problems dermatitis, skin diseases, skin care; conjunctivitis; pronounced effect on the mind and nervous system (anger, oversensitivity, temper tantrums in children) For Review Only Medicinal properties: Anti-inflammatory (especially German chamomile); antispasmodic, (Helichrysum italicum) Primarily produced in southern France, Italy, and Yugoslavia Essential oil is distilled from the whole plant; it is yellowish Fragrance: Strongly aromatic Everlasting is a fairly new oil in aromatherapy. My friend Gilles Garcin, with whom I used to distill wild lavender in the southern Alps of France, might very well have been the first to have distilled the plant for aromatherapy (incidentally, he used Henri Viaud's distillery). It has proved to be valuable for wounds and bruises.

Two varieties of birch essential oil have been differentiated: northern birch essential oils, produced in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and New Hampshire (which apparently is no longer produced), and southern birch essential oil, produced in the southern part of the Appalachian mountains. Wintergreen oil is similar to birch oil in its composition; essential oil sold as wintergreen is often methyl salicylate or birch essential oil.

Another oil of interest in the family is copal. Burseraceae grow in desert tropical areas where the intense cosmic activity promotes the formation of gum and etheric oils. The small boswellia tree (the source of frankincense), the most characteristic representative of the type, grows in the Arabian peninsula, in the most extreme climate of the planet. It is surrounded by a thin cloud of essential oil, which filters the sun's rays and freshens the air around it\u2014hence its strong anti-inflammatory action. Burseraceae act against inner fire in the body (bronchitis, cough, pleurisy, phthisis, consumption). The gum oozes from the incisions of natural fissures in the bark or the wood. It is cicatrizant and vulnerary and has powerful healing properties. It is especially useful in diseases related to secretion (inflammation of the breast or the uterus). Putrefaction cannot take place in the desert; the air is too dry and the heat too intense. Burseraceae condense the desert energy and therefore have strong antiputrescent effects on corpses. They also have a salutary action For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 106 Myrrh gum exuding from tree bark (top); myrrh close-up (below) on ulcers, gangrene, and gastric and intestinal fermentation.

There, everything is reduced to essentials. The contemplation of the endless petrified waves of the sandy dunes inspires one to go beyond the always-changing waves of one's own mind and connect with bare infinity and eternity. The powerful comforting scent of myrrh or frankincense carried by the burning wind of the desert gently soothes one's deepest wounds and gives one further inspiration in meditation. Since antiquity, myrrh and frankincense have been extensively used in incense in rituals and religious ceremonies. They have a very pronounced soothing, comforting, fortifying, and elevating action on the soul and the spirit. Medicinal properties and indications: Similar to those of myrrh and frankincense (see below) Type of action: Cooling, drying, fortifying Domain of action: Skin, lungs, secretion, mind, psychic centers Indications: Inflammation (skin, lungs, breast, uterus) Elemi (Canarium luzonicum) Gum is primarily produced in the Philippines, Central America, and Brazil Essential oil is distilled from the gum; it is colorless to slightly yellow Fragrance: Pleasant, balsamic (resembling camphor), and incense-like Used in perfumery and in some medical preparations One of the most highly priced substances of the ancient world, frankincense was once as valuable as gold. Its trade was one of the major economic activities in some Arabic countries, and its control provoked many local wars. The Queen of Sabah, a main producer of that time, undertook a perilous journey from Somalia to Israel and visited King Solomon to secure the flourishing trade. Frankincense has been burned in temples since antiquity, especially by the Egyptians and the Hebrews; it is still used in the rites of some churches. Frankincense gum was traditionally used to fumigate sick persons to drive out the evil spirits causing the sickness. The Egyptians used it in their rejuvenating unguents. Introduced to Europe in the fifteenth century, elemi was an ingredient in numerous balms, unguents, and liniments. It is still used in the balm of Fioraventi and other vulnerary preparations. Medicinal properties and indications: Similar to those of myrrh (see below); special action on breast inflammations and uterine disorders; pregnancy, childbirth preparation Frankincense (Boswellia carterii) Gum is primarily produced in northeast Africa and southeast Arabia (Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen); the supply has been quite erratic lately because of the political confusion in these countries Essential oil is distilled from the gum; it is clear or yellow Fragrance: Characteristic\u2014balsamic, camphor-like, spicy, woody, and slightly lemony Used in cosmetics and perfumery; blends well with almost any scent; makes a good fixative For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 107 2/11/20 12:34 PM 108 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families Myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) Gum is primarily produced in the same areas as frankincense, as well as in Libya and Iran Essential oil is distilled from the gum; it is yellow to reddish brown and more or less fluid Fragrance: Pleasant, balsamic, camphor-like, musky, and incense-like Used in perfumery and cosmetics; blends well with many oils; makes a good fixative The history of myrrh is closely tied to that of frankincense. These two substances were among the precious drugs reserved for fumigations, embalming, unctions, and liturgical practices. The Egyptian papyri, the Vedas, the Bible, and the Koran mention the numerous uses of myrrh in ceremonies, in perfumery, and in medicine. Myrrh was an ingredient of many unguents, elixirs, and other multipurpose antidotes. during the blooming season. They grow well in poor soils and prefer dry and sunny habitats. They are found in temperate or warm-temperate areas, especially the Mediterranean region. They have hard-coated, impermeable seeds that soften under heat, which makes them optimally adapted to repopulate areas destroyed by wildfires. Many Cistaceae are fragrant and sweet-smelling. Various Cistus species secrete labdanum, a sticky exudate coating their leaves and stems, mostly in summer. Cistus (Cistus ladanifer) Primarily produced in Spain and Cyprus Essential oil is distilled from the branches; it is reddish brown Fragrance: Musky and balsamic Used in expensive perfumes because it makes a good fixative and gives a natural musk note to the blends For Review Only The Rock Rose Family Cistaceae are a small family of beautiful small shrubs that are profusely covered by flowers EsOiAr.indd 108 Cistus 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 109 Cistus, or rock rose, is a small bush growing in dry rocky areas of the Mediterranean countries, especially in Crete and Cyprus. Its leaves naturally exude a gum called labdanum. This gum has been highly appreciated in perfumery, cosmetics, and medicine since antiquity and was one of the ingredients of the \"holy ointment\" of the Bible. The gum sticks to the wool of sheep grazing on the hills as they walk through the bushes, so shepherds in Crete and Cyprus used to comb the wool of their sheep to collect the precious gum. Labdanum was also collected by whipping the bushes with a special whip, this method giving a much better quality. Unfortunately, both methods have now been abandoned, and labdanum is not produced any more.

They include three major families: Cupressaceae and Pinaceae, both discussed below, and Taxaceae, commonly known as the yew family, which does not produce essential oils. A wide belt of Coniferae circles the frigid and temperate zones of both hemispheres, from the far north or far south and almost to the mountaintops, depending on altitude.

Many genera are incorrectly called cedars because their heartwood is as aromatic as that of the true cedars, Cedrus spp. (of the Pinaceae family). Many Cupressaceae are highly venerated by traditional societies. Cryptomeria japonica is the national tree of Japan, and four of the five sacred trees of Kiso belong to this family. Thuja plicata is highly revered among the tribes of the Northwest of North America. And sequoia and Sequoiadendron species inspire a deep sense of awe and wonder in all who see them.

Other oils of interest are hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and terebinth. With 10 genera and 250 species of shrubs and trees, the Pinaceae family is the largest, most widespread and abundant conifer family in the Northern Hemisphere, often being the dominant component of boreal, coastal, and montane forests. It includes many conifers of important economic value such as cedars, firs, pines, known as Methusaleh, in Nevada, is 4,851 years old and the oldest known living nonclonal organism on Earth. In order to protect themselves against 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 113 antagonists, Pinaceae have evolved numerous mechanical and/or chemical defenses, mostly prevalent in the bark of the trees as resins, phenolics, and polyphenols. The resins also help make them resistant to extreme temperatures. Cedarwood (Cedrus atlantica) Primarily produced in Morocco The essential oil is distilled from the sawdust; it is is thick and golden brown, like the color of old gold Fragrance: Deep, woody, balsamic, and very pleasant; like sandalwood Used as a fixative in perfumes; blends well with many oils and gives a woody note to preparations The Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodorata) is distilled in the Himalayas. The Eastern red cedar, distilled in the United States, is actually a juniper (Juniperus virginiana); its essential oil, however, is very similar to real cedarwood essential oil. Egyptians used cedarwood oil for embalming; it was one of the ingredients of mithridat, a famous poison antidote that was used for centuries. One of the most majestic trees, the Lebanese cedar (like its close relative, atlas cedar, growing in Morocco) expresses a great spiritual strength. Egyptians used its wood to build the doors of their temples, where its fragrance would stimulate psychic centers of the worshipers. The effects of cedarwood oil on the mind are similar to those of sandalwood.

This plant is totally different from the pelargonium used for the extraction of essential oils. Although the two species belong to the same botanical family, their uses are different. It has been discovered recently that gera- 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 115 Geranium For Review Only nium has the power to develop an extremely wide variety of chemotypes, none of them being distilled commercially at this point. The reason for such variations is not yet clear. In fact, geranium can be made to imitate almost any fragrance. In addition to the rose geranium, others\u2014tangerine geranium, lemon geranium, lime geranium, etc.\u2014are found in nurseries. Apparently, the species can produce almost any possible chemotype, including those with the hot, burning thymols and carvacrols that seem so remote from the sweet-smelling rose geranium that most people know. This seems to indicate a strong adaptability, indicative of immunostimulant properties. care; nervous tension, depression LAMIACEAE (LABIATAE) Plants of Heat; the Healing Family Essential oils of this family include basil, hyssop, lavender, lavandin, marjoram, melissa, mints (pennyroyal, rosemary, sage, spike lavender, and thyme. While medicinal plants are the exception in most families, all Lamiaceae have some curative power, which indicates their special relationship to humans. This phenomenon is due to the extraordinary influence of the cosmic forces of heat on the formation of the family. This calorific nature leads to the formation of essential oils. 2/11/20 12:35 PM 116 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families Lamiaceae have special predilection for open spaces, dry and rocky slopes, and sunny mountains, where their most characteristic species (lavender, rosemary, sage, thyme) appear. They prefer median climatic regions all around the Mediterranean and far from tropical and cold areas. Many Lamiaceae are culinary herbs, which indicates their affinity for the digestive processes. Their fragrance is invigorating, stimulating, fiery, and reawakening. There are no bland, gloomy, ecstatic, or narcotic notes in this family. Finally, many Lamiaceae (including basil, peppermint, rosemary, and thyme) have the power to develop chemotypes. This seems to indicate a strong potential for adaptability in the family, which could be interpreted as immunostimulant power. (Geranium is another plant with many chemotypes, and it is also considered an immunostimulant.) Type of action: Warming, stimulating (vital center, metabolism); appeasing effect on overactive astral body; brings it back under the control of vital centers Domain of action: Organization of vital centers\u2014metabolism, digestion, respiration, blood formation Indications: Weakness of vital centers (anemia, poor digestion, respiratory problems, diabetes); recommended for people with intense psychic activity (healers, mediums, etc.) to keep them from losing control and depleting their vitality Basil (Ocimum basilicum) For Review Only Primarily produced in India, Egypt, Comoro Islands, and R\u00e9union Rosemary in flower EsOiAr.indd 116 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 117 Essential oil is distilled from the herb; it is yellow Fragrance: Pleasant and anise-y, with a minty note Used in perfumery for its top green note; blends well with bergamot or geranium There are several chemotypes of basil (there is even a cinnamon basil); the most commonly used is the methychavicol type (from R\u00e9union and the Comoro Islands), as well as the eugenol type. One of the sacred plants of India, where it is dedicated to Vishnu, basil is extensively used in Ayurvedic medicine. Its actions on the digestive and nervous systems have been acknowledged in both Indian and Western medicine. and Dioscorides for its curative power on the respiratory system. The ancient pharmacopoeia mentions it as the major ingredient in numerous preparations, elixirs, and syrups. Hyssop grows all over southern Europe and western Asia on dry, rocky slopes, but its finest varieties grow above 3,000 feet in the sunny meadows of the southern Alps. Its abundant leaf system and its camphor-like scent indicate its special affinity for the respiratory system.

It has always been used in perfumery and cosmetics and blends well with a great number of essential oils, adding a light floral note to almost any preparation. Far from the ardor of rosemary, lavender emanates a noble, mellow peacefulness. Its blue flowers bloom at the top of a structure resembling a seven-branched candlestick; they give a clean, soothing scent that is one of our most beautiful perfumes. The finest quality of lavender grows above 3,000 feet on the sunny slopes of the southern Alps and up to the mountaintops. Lavender likes air, space, light, and warmth. It has an EsOiAr.indd 118 Lavandin (Lavandula fragrans, L. delphinensis) The lavandins are hybrids of true lavender and spike; their essential oils have a lower ester content and contain some camphor. Their fragrance is not as refined as that of lavender; their medicinal properties are similar, though less potent. Main varieties: The finest are Super and Abrialis; Grosso is feet. Its essential oils contain some camphor; it calms the cerebrospinal activity.

According to mythology, Aphrodite, goddess of love and fecundity, picked marjoram on Mount Ida to heal the wounds of Enea. According to Dioscorides, it tones and warms the nerves; Pliny recommends it for poor digestion and a weak stomach; and Culpeper praises its warming and comforting effects. Rather than altitude and rocks, marjoram prefers the light warm soil of gardens. The plant is sweet looking and delicate, with small, round, soft, velvety leaves and cute little white flowers, almost hidden among the leaves. Its gentle and appeasing fragrance has a warming and comforting effect, hence its beneficent action on the nervous system.

The production of the oil had been virtually abandoned until the late 1980s, when a few French producers started distilling it again. It is a very expensive essential oil and is therefore widely adulterated (the most common additives are lemongrass, citronella, and Litsea cubeba). So-called melissa oil has been sold, especially in England, at a fraction of the production cost of 2/11/20 12:35 PM 120 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families true melissa oil. While total world production of melissa essential oil was less than 50 pounds in 1988, total sales worldwide could have been well over 1,000 pounds (another miracle of modern technology)! Patricia Davis, in her excellent Aromatherapy: An A-Z, warns against possible skin irritations when using melissa essential oil externally. One wonders whether she used true melissa oil in the first place, since most of what is available for purchase is adulterated. The plant is named after the Greek nymph Melissa, protectress of the bees. In spring, when several queens are born in the same beehive, the swarm splits into several smaller swarms, and each has to look for a new hive. Fresh melissa leaves were traditionally crushed on empty hives to attract the migrant swarms. Melissa is a gentle and humble-looking plant with pale green leaves and small white flowers. There emanates from the whole plant a natural kindness that is soothing and comforting in itself. Melissa was traditionally considered calming and uplifting; it is soothing, relieves tension, and is, with rose and neroli, one of the major oils for the heart chakra. Melissa seems to thrive on iron. It likes the vicinity of houses, especially in the country where nails and other pieces of scrap iron are often buried around habitations. When I was a wildcrafter, the place where I could find the most abundant crop of melissa was an abandoned iron mine. This indicates a possible antianemic and immunostimulant property; indeed, melissa has been known to strengthen vitality. properties: Antispasmodic, calming, sedative, soothing; antidepressant, nervous tension, neurasthenia, anxiety; shock, grief Mints: Pennyroyal, Peppermint, Spearmint Pluto once fell in love with the nymph Mintha, but his wife, the jealous Proserpine, changed her into the plant that is now named after her. According to Pliny, \"The scent of mint awakens the mind and its taste excites the appetite and the stomach.\" Its fortifying and stimulating qualities have been acknowledge by Roman and Greek physicians. There are about twenty species in the genus Mentha, growing all over the world. They like abundant light and deep, humid soils. In them, the warmth principle struggles against an adverse principle of cold and water, and hence these herbs have a warming, stimulating, curative power, good for resolving congestion cramps and swelling, to promote menstruation and stimulate virility. On the other hand, mints also have vivifying, refreshing, and appeasing qualities.

Theophrastes, Aristotle, and Hippocrates praised its beneficent action on respiratory diseases, ulcers, burns, and poor digestion. A rustic variant of marjoram, oregano grows wild all over Europe and Asia; however, only the Mediterranean varieties yield a significant amount of essential oils. Their hot, almost burning quality indicates their beneficent action on infectious diseases, infected wounds, and inflammations.

Patchouli (Pogostemon patchouli) Primarily produced in India, Malaysia, Burma, and Paraguay E ssential oil is distilled from the dried, Mentha piperita has several subspecies and chemotypes (M. piperita var. bergamia, M. piperita chemotype linalool, etc.), none of them being commercially distilled as far as I know.

One of the best fixatives, used in small amounts in Eastern and rose perfumes Patchouli essential oil was part of the materia medica in Malaysia, China, India, and Japan, where it was used for its stimulant, tonic, stomachic, and febrifuge properties. It was a renowned antidote against insect and snake bites. Indians also used it to scent their fabrics, especially the famous Indian shawls so fashionable in England in the nineteenth century. The essential oil contains patchoulene and other products close to azulene. One of the most tropical Lamiaceae, patchouli is a plant of excessive warmth and water; its large leaves and its morphology indicate that these energies are not fully dominated. Therefore, although it is a stimulant and tonic at low doses, good for dissipating the type of lethargy related to such energies (sluggishness, inertia), it becomes sedative or even stupefying at high doses. Its anti-inflammatory and decongestive properties also derive from these characteristics. Because the essential oil is produced after a period of fermentation, it has certain control over all processes of stagnation, putrefaction, and aging (uses in skin care and rejuvenation). Opus niger (black work), which in the physical world is a process of fermentation and putrefaction, is one of the major phases of the alchemist's work, a phase conducive to the illu- mination of the adept after cold burning of all impurities and decantation. Patchouli is then a product of fermentation in the alchemical sense. It has powerful action on the psychic centers on a metaphysical level.

The phenol-cineole chemotype grows in North Africa (Morocco and Tunisia), the cineole chemotype grows in Spain, and the verbenon chemotype grows in southern France, Corsica, northern Italy, and Yugoslavia. This vigorous, thick bush has a predilection for rocky, sunny slopes and grows all around 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 123 the Mediterranean, from the seashore to about 2,000 feet. It has been used extensively since antiquity for medicine and in cooking, as well as for rituals. Highly praised in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it appeared in various formulas such as the famous Queen of Hungary's water, a rejuvenating liquor. (At the age of seventy-two, when she was gouty and paralytic, Elizabeth of Hungary received the recipe from an angel (or a monk) and recovered her health and beauty.) Madame de Sevigny recommended rosemary water for sadness. A calorific plant above all, rosemary, according to Rudolf Steiner, fortifies the vital center and its action of other constituents of the human being. It restores the balance of the calorific body and activates the blood processes (blood is the privileged medium of the healing principle in the human body). It is thus recommended for anemia, insufficient menstruation, and troubles of blood irrigation. Its acts on the liver as well. A better irrigation of the organs eases the action of astral and vital forces and stimulates metabolism. Thus, rosemary is digestive and sudorific; it promotes the assimilation of sugar (in diabetes) and is indicated to rebuild the nervous system after long, intense intellectual activity. rubefacient; healing for wounds and burns Indications: Hepatobiliary disorders debility, mental fatigue, loss of whooping cough; Salvia With over five hundred species, the genus Salvia is the most important of the Lamiaceae family. Salvia officinalis likes chalky rocks and the desert mountains of Spain, Greece, Dalmatia, and the Balkans. Its fragrance is severe, solemn, earthy, and harsh. Its well-developed leaves and large, odoriferous flowers shaped to receive the bodies of bees indicate its affinity for all processes of life and creation\u2014even procreation.

It is not recommended for people with epileptic tendencies. Renowned since antiquity, the salvia salvatrix of the Romans is one of the most powerful and versatile medicinal plants. Indeed, as they said, Cur moriatur homo, cui salvia crescit in horto? (Why should he die, the one who grows sage in his garden?) That panacea, which preserves health and youth, was always recommended for conception and pregnancy.

It has been suggested that such variations may be caused by climatic and other environmental conditions. Thus, the burning hot thymol and carvacrol chemotypes would grow at lower altitudes and in dryer while the milder geraniol, linalool, citral, and thuyanol chemotypes would grow at higher altitudes and milder climates. It has even been suggested that a plant of thyme transplanted from one climatic area to another may begin to develop the characteristics of its new location (i.e., thyme growing in dryness at sea level would be a thymol-carvacrol chemotype, but it would become a linalool or geraniol chemotype if transplanted to a high altitude). As seductive as this theory might be, the reality is slightly different. There is, in the wild, a predominance of the thymol and carvacrol chemotypes in the dryer and warmer areas, while the milder chemotypes are more abundant under milder conditions. But more than seven years of wild harvesting of thyme have shown me that the different chemotypes can be found everywhere. Furthermore, most of the commercial production of chemotyped thyme comes from the same area of southern France, and several farmers grow all the chemotypes on their farms. This tiny bush, with no special requirements for soil quality or the amount of humidity, is quite avid for warmth and light. It is helpful whenever inner warmth is poor or missing: excess of water, chilling tendencies, cold, and weakness of the vital center, especially when it is manifested at the level of the lungs or stomach. Thyme has been widely used for therapy since antiquity for its warming, stimulant, and cleansing properties. Thyme is able to create, by itself, almost the entire spectrum of fragrances demonstrated by the medicinal Lamiaceae family, from the hot burning thymol-carvacrol (reminiscent of oregano or savory) to the citral types (similar to melissa) and through the linalool types (akin to marjoram and lavender). This shows the amazing adaptability of the genus, its broad-spectrum curative power, and its incredible vital energy. Thymes certainly are among the major oils of aromatherapy. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 125 Medicinal properties: General stimulant (physical, urinary); pulmonary diseases (bronchitis, 2/11/20 12:35 PM 126 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families tuberculosis, asthma); poor digestion, fermentation; rheumatism, arthritis, gout; flu, influenza, sore throat; wounds LAURACEAE Intense Etheric Activity Lauraceae are mostly evergreen trees or shrubs with worldwide distribution in tropical and warm climates that are important components of tropical forests. Most of the species are strongly aromatic, indicative of intense etheric activity, with high concentrations of essential oils in their leaves, wood, and bark, which they use to repel parasites and predators. The wood of the camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora), for instance, may be up to 5 percent crude essential oil, and a single tree can yield up to 3 tons of the oil. The Lauraceae are often used as spices or for medicinal purposes. Their fragrant wood is prized for making insect-repellent furniture. Many species, most notoriously rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora), have been overexploited for timber or essential oil and are now endangered. Their fruits are drupes that may be edible or produce vegetable oils. Avocado (Persea americana), for example, produces a highly nutritious fruit that is low in sugar and rich in protein, fat, and vitamins, such as A, B, C, D, and E. Essential oils of this family include cinnamon (both the bark and the leaves), Litsea cubeba, and rosewood.

In 2700 B.C.E., the Chinese emperor Shen Nung included it in his pharmacopoeia, calling it kwei. Cinnamon is often mentioned in the Bible. Yahweh ordered Moses to use it in the fabrication of the holy ointment. It was one of the most important 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 127 drugs of the Greek and Roman pharmacopoeia and was quite renowned for its stomachic, diuretic, tonic, and antiseptic properties.

It is mostly used for blending (especially in the diffuser). It gives a pleasant, fresh, lemony top note to any blend. Medicinal properties: Stimulant or deodorization Rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora) Primarily produced in Brazil Essential oil is distilled from the chopped wood; it is clear to pale yellow Fragrance: Very sweet, floral, and woody EsOiAr.indd 127 Rosewood essential oil is one of the major oils of perfumery, where it is used as a middle note. It was little used in aromatherapy until recently. Although it does not have any dramatic curative power (like tea tree or lavender), I find it very useful, especially for skin care. It is mild and safe to use. It is also very useful in blending; it helps give body to a blend and rounds out sharp edges. Rosewood is excellent for any type of body care or skin care preparation (bath oils, lotions, masks, facials). Medicinal properties: Cellular stimulant, tissue regenerator; uplifting, antidepressant, tonic; calming, cephalic Indications: Headache nausea; skin care (sensitive skin, aged skin, wrinkles, general skin care); scars, wounds 2/11/20 12:35 PM 128 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families MYRISTICACEAE Intense Astral Activity The evergreen flowering trees, shrubs, and, rarely, lianas of the Myristicaceae, or nutmeg family, are found in tropical rain forests across the world (humid lowland, swamps, and cloud forests). Most of the species are large trees valued for their timber. Most species have fragrant wood and leaves. The small, highly reduced, fragrant flowers are either male or female and produce a starchy seed surrounded by a fleshy covering, known as an aril. The family exhibits highly complex phy- tochemistry, with essential oils, alkaloids, and other compounds found in the leaves, bark, fruits, arils, and seeds of many species. The seeds of Virola guatemalensis are used in flavoring and in the manufacture of candles; the leaves are generally spicy and aromatic. The tree bark in some genera, such as Virola, exudes a dark-red resin that contains several hallucinogenic alkaloids, indicative of intense astral activity. The bark of Virola elongata and other closely related species contains a derivative of tryptamine and is used by some Amazon tribes as a hallucinogenic snuff. Myristicin, found in nutmeg and its essential oil, is a strong deliriant that can induce convulsions, palpitations, and nausea; fatal myristicin poisonings have been reported. Essential oils of this family include nutmeg. Another other oil of interest is mace.

Portugal had the monopoly of its trade until 1605, when the Dutch took over their possessions. The plantations were placed under military protection, and prices were kept high by systematic destruction of the trees growing on nearby islands. Huge amounts of the spice were even burned at intervals to keep the price high. Frenchman Pierre Poivre finally stole a few plants in 1768, and the nutmeg tree was then grown in other tropical countries. Nutmeg has been highly appreciated since the early Middle Ages and was an ingredient of numerous balms, elixirs, and unguents. In 1704 Pollini wrote more than eight hundred pages on the invaluable virtues of nutmeg. He concluded that \"in good health or disabled, alive or dead, nobody can do without this nut, the most salutary medicine!\" It is indeed a very powerful tonic and stimulant. Essential oils of this family include cajeput, clove, eucalyptus, myrtle, niaouli, and tea tree. Other oils of interest are allspice, bay, and red pepper. Myrtaceae grow in the tropical zones of every continent. Confronted with the powerful forces of earth and water in relation to strong tropical influences, Myrtaceae oppose a very structured formatting principle. The plants and trees of the family have a noble and harmonious aspect, which expresses the perfect equilibrium among the four elements (fire, air, water, earth) in the constitution of the type. The astral sphere is never violent to etheric formatting forces: the type does not produce any poisonous plant. The family's evergreen leaves are strong and simple. They open themselves to the supra vegetal and animal sphere in an intense floral process (pollination is accomplished by insects and birds). The sugar process is very strong in this family, which produces some delicious fruits, such as pomegranate, gooseberry, guava, myrtle fruits, and jaboticaba plums. The deep penetration of tropical warmth into the leaf, flower, bark, and wood generates etheric oils and aromatic resins.

It was so precious in ancient times that it caused a few wars: its trade was almost exclusively controlled by the Portuguese, who possessed the Molucca Islands until the seventeenth century, when the EsOiAr.indd 131 Dutch drove them out. To better control the monopoly and raise prices, the Dutch destroyed all plantations except the one on Ambon Island. The French finally stole a few plants to start new plantations in Guyana, Zanzibar, R\u00e9union, and Trinidad. Clove oil was long used in dentistry as an analgesic. In the clove tree, the terrestrial forces of the roots rise into the floral area: the essential oil of the buds, heavier than water and not easily volatile, is heavy and burning, which reveals that the fire cosmic forces have been strongly drawn into the ground. This special interaction of the fire and earth energies in the floral area results in a strong action on the metabolism: clove stimulates the digestion of heavy food and regulates the digestive tract. 2/11/20 12:35 PM 132 The Essential Oils in physical and asthenia (to strengthen memory); dyspepsia, gastric fermentation, flatulence; impotence; infected wounds, ulcers Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) Primarily produced in Australia, Spain, and Portugal Essential oil is distilled from the leaves; it is yellow to red Fragrance: Fresh, balsamic, and camphor-like Numerous uses in pharmacy the solidifying forces of earth and water into the clear and dry area of air and light, where it attracts astral force for the production of essential oils\u2014hence its action on the urinary and pulmonary systems.

It has a long tradition of use in medicine, and its essential oil is one of the most powerful and versatile remedies. Eucalyptus is one of the tallest trees in the world and is deeply rooted: its roots go amazingly deep in the ground to find aquifer veins and strongly draw water to its vigorous branches and leaves. It is used to drain marshy areas and cleanse them from mosquitos. It grows incredibly fast but forms nevertheless a very strong wood that is fairly resistant to rot. The leaves, shaped like swords, are oriented in such a way as to avoid a strong exposure to the sun and allow the light to pass through the whole tree's growth and reach the ground. Eucalyptus energetically draws EsOiAr.indd 132 Myrtle (Myrtus communis) Primarily produced in North Africa Essential oil is distilled from the branches; it is yellow Myrtle 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 133 Fragrance: Fresh; close to eucalyptus The Greeks and Romans used myrtle for pulmonary and urinary diseases. In the sixteenth century, the leaves and flowers were used for skin care; they served in the preparation of \"angel water,\" a renowned tonic and astringent lotion. The medicinal properties of myrtle closely resemble those of eucalyptus. Specific therapeutic indications: Skin care Niaouli (Melaleuca viridiflora) Primarily produced in Madagascar, Australia, and New Caledonia Essential oil (also called gomenol) is distilled from the leaves; it is yellow Fragrance: Strong, camphor-like, and balsamic; close to eucalyptus Same medicinal properties and indications as eucalyptus documented. Research in Australia begun in the late 1920s showed the amazing anti-infectious power of the oil. During World War II, it was even included in military first-aid kits in tropical areas. Extensive research during the 1970s and 1980s (by Morton Walker, Dr. Eduardo F. Pena, and Dr. Paul Belaiche, among others) showed its strong antifungal action. Its wide range of action and its low toxicity make it an ideal home remedy for inclusion in any aromatherapy first-aid kit (the same can be said of lavender and eucalyptus). A somewhat small tree with needlelike leaves (similar to cypress), tea tree shows an amazing vitality. Before the demand for its oil increased dramatically beginning in the 1980s, tea tree was considered a weed\u2014a real plague, in fact\u2014and farmers could not get rid of it. Cut down to the roots, it regrows flourishing, thick foliage in less than two years. Even more than eucalyptus, it likes swampy, marshy areas. Unlike eucalyptus, though, its leaves are hardly developed, which indicates a predominance of earth, fire, and water over air. Tea tree yields one of the best antifungal, anti-infectious, and antiseptic oils, but eucalyptus works better on respiratory conditions. The amazing vitality of tea tree indicates its strong immunostimulant properties.

Among these are examples of the most exquisite and refined fragrances of the vegetal realm, such as lilacs, jasmines, osmanthus, privet (Ligustrum spp.), and forsythia. Such fragrances are so delicate that they cannot withstand steam distillation and must be extracted by solvent or CO2 extraction to produce absolutes. In addition, members of the genus Fraxinus (ashes) are noted for their hardwood timber. Oleaceae are distributed throughout the world, except for the Arctic; they are especially abundant in tropical and temperate Asia. The tropical and warm-temperate species are evergreen; those from colder regions are deciduous. Absolutes of this family include jasmine. Other absolutes of interest are osmanthus and lilac (CO2 extraction). Jasmine (Jasminum officinalis) Primarily produced in southern France, North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco), and India There is no essential oil of jasmine; the absolute is obtained by either enfleurage or solvent extraction (see chapter 3), and it is brown and rather viscous Fragrance: Deep, sweet, warming, long- lasting, exhilarating, and supremely exotic Blends beautifully with rose, neroli, bergamot, petitgrain, sandalwood, citruses, palmarosa, geranium, and rosewood Only Lilac EsOiAr.indd 134 With rose and neroli, jasmine is one of the major \"noble\" oils of perfumery. It is also one of the most expensive oils; therefore, it is very often adulterated. If rose is the oil of love, jasmine is certainly the oil of romance and was revered as such in the Hindu and Muslim traditions. It inspired burning lascivious songs by the Arab poets. In the harem, the prince's favorite soaked in a jasmine-scented bath and received an elaborate jasmine massage to induce sensual ecstasy in her lover.

Their leaves and fruits have a pungent flavor that can be attributed to their constituents chavicine, piperine, and piperidine. Fruits are drupe-like, with a single seed per fruit. Native to southern India and Sri Lanka, Piper nigrum is a tall woody climber that yields most of the peppercorns that are used as spices, including black and white pepper. Many Piperaceae are used in medicines and in food and beverages as spices and seasonings. Cubeb (Piper cubeba), grown in Southeast Asia for its fruit and essential oil, is used in various medicines and for flavoring cigarettes and bitters. Betel pepper (Piper betle) is chewed with slices of betel nut (Areca catechu) and lime as a mild stimulant. Pacific Islanders prepare a ceremonial drink known as kava or kawakawa from the root of Piper methysticum, which has narcotic and sedative effects.

A wide majority of the plants covering the ground belong to the Poaceae family. From the poles to the equator, from the swamps to the deserts, this family shows an amazing adaptability and diversity. Its ability to cover almost exclusively huge areas denotes a singular strength. This strength lies in its powerful root system, which forms an intricate network that blends almost perfectly with the soil (to create lawns, modern gardeners lay on the soil a kind of carpet that is vegetal and ground together). Above this intense root system, the aerial part of Poaceae is dominated by a linear principle: long narrow leaves and straight stems. Even the inflorescence (ear) obeys this principle. This family does not spend much energy in the floral process. It is entirely dedicated to another aim: nutrition. Its leaves and seeds are a gift to the animal kingdom, with grass for herbivores and grain (wheat, rice, corn, barley, oats) for rodents, birds, and humans. Poaceae has the potential to develop fragrances\u2014like the scent of freshly cut hay! But it usually remains a potential, nascent fragrance. Only under the tropics has this ability been fully developed in some species.

Vetiver expresses this fundamental aspect of the type through its sandalwood-like note; it is inspiring and uplifting. Indication: Arthritis ROSACEAE The Quest for Perfection With over 4,800 known species of herbs, shrubs, and trees in ninety genera distributed worldwide, the rose family (Rosaceae) is the third most economically important angiosperm family, after the Poaceae (grasses and grains) and Fabaceae (legumes, peas, beans, alfalfa, etc). Usually divided into three subfamilies (Amygdaloideae, Dryadoideae, and Rosoideae), it produces a vast array of delicious fruits: strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, boysenberry, almond, plums, apple, pear, quince, hawthorn, loquat, rose hip, and so on, with all their subspecies and varieties. The Rosaceae also include many important ornamental trees and shrubs, such as roses, of course, as well as cherry trees (of cherry-blossom fame), meadowsweets, photinias, firethorns, rowans, and hawthorns. All Rosaceae of commercial value, whether fruits or ornamentals, have evolved dramatically from their wild relatives, increasing in size, sweetness, appearance, or other desirable attributes as a result of their interactive coevolution with the humans. Domestication led to constant selection, hybridization, grafting, cloning, and other propagation techniques, resulting in For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 139 Raspberries and blackberries of the Rosaceae family accelerated evolution that created the commercial Rosaceae we are familiar with. To the best of my knowledge, rose is the only plant among the Roasaceae from which essential oil is produced, but with rose, the family comes as close to perfection as any plant can be in the botanical realm. Its flower is almost universally revered as a symbol of pure love, mysticism, and devotion. Rose is a symbol of the Virgin Mary and is often associated with sainthood and angels in Christianity. Its fragrance is one of the most highly prized by perfumers and aromatherapists alike. 2/11/20 12:35 PM 140 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families Rosa damascena For Review Only Rose (Rosa centifolia and R. damascena) Primarily produced in Bulgaria, Morocco, and Turkey Rose buds are picked during a few morning hours only, right after the dew, and distilled immediately; the essential oil is rather thick and yellow to greenish yellow Fragrance: Characteristic One of the most expensive essential oils, rose oil is almost always adulterated with substances processes of adulteration have become so refined that is almost impossible to disclose frauds. Real rose oil is used only in very high-grade perfumes. Rose water is EsOiAr.indd 140 widely used in cosmetics and perfumery. Whether it sprang from the blood of Venus, the blood of Adonis, or the sweat of Mohammed, the rose\u2014the queen of flowers\u2014 is certainly immemorial. Praised by the poets, revered in the sacred books, and offered to the kings and the gods, the rose is a traditional symbol of love. Bunches of roses were found in the sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, offered by Queen Ankhsenamon as a token of her love. When the Persian emperor Djihanguyr married the princess Nour-Djihan, a canal encircling the gardens was filled with rose water. Droplets of oil were noticed floating on the top of the water; that is said to have been the beginning of the production of the famous Persian rose oil. Rose water is an excellent skin tonic, recommended for any type of skin; it is good for 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 141 wrinkles, inflammation, redness, and sensitive skin and is indicated for ophthalmia.

Other oils of interest are rue (Ruta graveolens)\u2014though note that rue essential oil is highly toxic and should be used only with great care. Most Rutaceae grow in tropical areas; here, they are mostly small thorny trees with hard wood, which is often resinous, and firm green leaves. Their beautiful abundant flowers are shaped like symmetrical stars and exhale a delicious, sweet, slightly exhilarating fragrance. The scent of the leaves is fresh and comforting, with a hint of bitterness. The trees develop juicy acid fruits (citrus) or small, hot, spicy berries. The general therapeutic activity of Rutaceae concerns the interaction of warmth and fluid in the body. The oils reduce proliferations, distensions, inflammations, and looseness; they strengthen the astral body, and their formatting For Review Only Rutaceae, citrus blossom EsOiAr.indd 141 2/11/20 12:35 PM 142 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families forces are activated by air and warmth. Many members of the genus Citrus are listed and discussed here. Distillation of the flowers of bitter orange yields neroli essential oil; cistillation of the leaves gives petitgrain. The essential oils of bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, and tangerine are extracted from the peel of the fruits by cold pressure. Extremely prolific (each tree can produce up to a hundred fruits), deeply rooted, and densely ramified, citruses perfectly control the interaction of the two powerful opposite flows of forces: centrifugal forces that strongly draw up the terrestrial forces, charging them with vitalized fluid elements of a tropical luxuriance, and cosmic forces of light and warmth that are absorbed by the leaves, the bark, the wood, and the fruit. Their energetic floral process and their light, suave, almost ethereal and very pervasive fragrance suggest an etheric organism intensely penetrated by the peripheral astral sphere. Citrus fruits are liquid, like a berry, but are surrounded with a tough envelope shaped by the forces of air and warmth. Citruses strive against the dissolving centrifugal forces of the tropical world. Their action is refreshing, vivifying, and tonic and tends to gather the constitutive elements of the body. The floral area expresses a soft, delicious, appeasing exhilaration, indicative of the remarkable sedative, antidepressant power of the blossoms. The fragrance of the thick, vigorous leaves is less refined, more hearty and grounded, and slightly bitter.

It makes a very good aftershave lotion. 2/11/20 12:35 PM 144 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families Neroli (Citrus aurantium) Primarily produced in France, Spain, North Africa, Italy, and the Comoro Islands Essential oil is distilled from the blossoms of the bitter orange tree and has a golden color One of the most expensive oils, and therefore widely adulterated Fragrance: One of the finest floral essences; sweet, suave, delicious, and slightly euphoric Used in expensive cologne and perfumes; blends well with almost any oil and is useful as the heart of a floral blend Real neroli (also called neroli biguarade) is extracted from the blossom of bitter orange (biguarade). However, blossoms of other citruses (sweet orange, lemon, mandarin) are also sometimes distilled. Native to China, where its flowers were traditionally used in cosmetics, bitter orange now grows all around the Mediterranean, in the United States, and in Central and South America. Neroli essential oil was already being produced by the beginning of the sixteenth century. It became a fashionable perfume when the Duchess of Nerole started using it to scent her gloves. The hydrolate obtained by distillation of bitter orange blossom is more commonly known as orange-flower water; it is widely used for skin care and pastry making. It is soothing, digestive, and carminative. Indications: Insomnia, hysteria, anxiety, depression, nervous tension; palpitations; diarrhea related to stress; skin care (dry or sensitive skin); grief, emotional shock; mild remedy for infants' colic and to send them to sleep Sweet Orange (Citrus aurantium) Primarily produced in Spain, North Africa, the United States, and Central and South America Essential oil is extracted by cold pressure of the rind of the fruit; it is orange Numerous uses in perfumery and food industry Biguarade, or bitter orange, is even more thorny than lemon; the strong bitterness of its fruit indicates a special affinity for the liver.

Though their green leaves contain some chlorophyll, allowing the plants to photosynthesize some of their own nutrients, all Santalaceae are parasites to a certain extent and rely on their hosts for water and nutrients. Most, including sandalwood, are root parasites; the others are stem parasites. Most Santalaceae have tiny bisexual or unisexual flowers and bear one-seeded fruits often surrounded by a brightly colored nutlike structure. Some of the fruits are edible, most notably quandong (Santalum acuminatum). Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) and its close relatives, the Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) and New Caledonian sandalwood (Santalum austrocaledonicum), are the only Santalaceae of commercial value. All have become endangered in the wild due to overharvesting. Red sandalwood (Pterocarpus santalinus), though it bears the sandalwood name, belongs to the Fabaceae family and is not botanically related. For Review Only Native to China, mandarin is the most delicate fruit; it was traditionally offered to the mandarins (hence its name). Its medicinal properties are very close to those of orange. The sedative and antispasmodic properties, however, are more pronounced. Mandarin is certainly the softest of all citrus trees. The leaves are delicate, the fruit is very sweet, and the taste is quite refined. The peel is soft and the fragrance is almost exotic. The soothing action on the nervous centers is then quite pronounced. The same can be said EsOiAr.indd 145 2/11/20 12:35 PM 146 The Essential Oils in Botanical Families Sandalwood For Review Only The Viscaceae (mistletoes) are sometimes considered a subfamily of the Santalaceae. Sandalwood (Santalum album) Primarily produced in India, Indonesia, and China Essential oil is distilled from the inner wood; it is thick and yellow Fragrance: Characteristic (persistent, woody, sweet, and spicy) Very good fixative, widely used in high-class perfumes. Often adulterated. A sacred tree of India, sandalwood is mentioned in ancient Sanskrit and Chinese texts. It is widely used as incense, in religious ceremonies, and in medicine and cosmetics. The Mysore district of Karnataka in India produces the most valued sandalwood in the world. Mysore EsOiAr.indd 146 sandalwood has become endangered in recent years and its export is strictly controlled. Sandalwood is one of the greatest essential oils for blending, acting as a base note and fixative and imparting a deep, woody, exotic, smooth tone to any blend. Considering its endangered status, its scarcity, and its price, its use should be restrained to emotional, mental, and spiritual applications. Sandalwood promotes alertness and is anxiolytic and relaxant. It can reach deep into the soul and help soothe emotional wounds and open up spiritual channels. Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) was traditionally used for furniture, incense, and perfumery. It is now rare and endangered in the wild, having been overharvested in most of India's forests. Scarcity has led to a price explosion exacerbated by poor enforcement of arcane regula- 2/11/20 12:35 PM The Essential Oils in Botanical Families 147 tions and corruption, leading itself to widespread smuggling, in a vicious circle to near extinction. Cultivation is challenging as germination is unpredictable and the plant, being semiparasitic, must anchor on the root system of host trees. The best quality and highest yields require forty-year-old trees in the wild, with the very finest coming from eighty-year-old trees. The cycle can be reduced to fifteen years in cultivation. Santalum spicatum, the Australian sandalwood, a tree native to semiarid areas at the edge of southwest Australia, is a potential candidate for substitution for S. album. It has been severely depleted in the wild due to overharvesting and deforestation, but large-scale cultivation was successfully launched at the turn of the millennium, with over 10,000 hectares in cultivation as of 2019, and rapid expansion. The first harvest came in 2014.

Indications: Nervousness, insomnia, tachycardia; ginger family, has about fifty-two genera and more than 1,300 species distributed in moist areas of the tropics and subtropics. These flowering aromatic perennial herbaceous plants have creeping horizontal or tuberous rhizomes and grow up to 6 meters. The overlapping rolled-up sheathing at the base of the leaves sometimes forms a short pseudo aerial stem. The family includes some important ornamental plants producing spectacular flowers with bright colors and unusual shapes. The Zingiberaceae include a large number of medicinal plants and play a major role in Ayurvedic medicine, the traditional medicine of India. They produce some of the most important spices of Asian cuisine, like ginger, cardamom, galangal, and turmeric. They are an important source of essential oils and oleoresins for aromatherapy, perfumery, and the food industry. Essential oils of this family include ginger. Other oils of interest are cardamom, galangal, and turmeric. Primarily produced in southern France and North Africa Essential oil is distilled from the leaves and branches; it is yellowish green Fragrance: Fresh and lemony; similar to lemongrass but more refined There is much confusion about verbena oil; many essential oils are improperly called verbena. Indian verbena, for example, is actually a variety of lemongrass (from the Poaceae family), while exotic verbena is Litsea cubeba (from the Lauraceae family). Native to Chile and Peru, true lemon verbena is a small bush with an abundant leaf system. The leaves and branches are steam distilled for the production of the oil. The yield is very low, making true lemon verbena essential oil rather rare and expensive. The world production of the essential oil is limited and represents only a fraction of the total sales of the oil (you can guess where the rest comes from). Lemon verbena is a lovely oil that gives a nice fresh lemony top note to blends. It is best used in a diffuser.

To maximize the aromatherapeutic power, all of these effects must act in synergy. This is especially the case for skin care products, especially those intended for facial care, the nose being at the center of the face. True beauty is a perception, an attitude, a way of being, and the way a beauty product makes you feel is a fundamental part of its effects. It is inconceivable for a beauty product to have an unpleasant odor; if it did, it would not be a beauty product. olfactory ballet or a fragrance orchestration. Consider Maurice Ravel's Bol\u00e9ro, one of the most famous musical works in the classical repertoire. It is based on a simple rhythm, which is repeated throughout the work, and two melodies, also very simple, that repeat themselves crescendo eight times before the final climax. The bolero is a useful metaphor for the art of aromatic composition in several aspects. First, it shows us that a masterpiece does not have to be complicated; on the contrary, it can be exceedingly simple. Second, the structure of the work is interesting, as it is built in layers, arising from a very simple theme, with each layer based on the previous one. It should be noted that Ravel did not consider Bol\u00e9ro to be real music; to him, it was just an experiment, \"an orchestral fabric without music.\" Master perfumers may blend over a hundred aromatic compounds to create a perfume, but following the musical metaphor of the Bol\u00e9ro, simplicity is often preferable for For Review Only THE ART OF BLENDING In this chapter, we will explore the art of aromatic choreography\u2014that is, combining essential oils to create a blend in which all the parts come together, therapeutically and aesthetically, in an aromatic composition akin to an 150 EsOiAr.indd 150 2/11/20 12:35 PM Aromatic Choreography 151 For Review Only Dancer with a Bouquet of Flowers by Edgar Degas, 1878 blending purposes, especially for beginners. As we have seen, aromatherapy acts on different levels (see fig. 6.1, page x [x-ref]): d On the physical level, essential oils can cure many common diseases. They are formed of very small molecules that are readily absorbed through the skin and penetrate the body. They act physiologically as antiseptics, antispasmodics, and analgesics, among other properties; they can stimulate organs and systems, such as the liver, the respiratory system, etc. d Essential oils have a profound action on the energetic level. EsOiAr.indd 151 d Essential oils deeply affect our emotions and the psyche through their interaction with the olfactory system. The olfactory system is the most primitive part of the brain and is closely linked to memory and emotions. d On the spiritual level, essential oils can have a profound effect in lifting our minds to higher planes. Sandalwood, benzoin, cistus, incense, and myrrh have been used since time immemorial to facitlitate spiritual rituals, ceremonies, and meditation. More importantly, aromatherapy has a definitive ludic, Dionysiac dimension to it\u2014it 2/11/20 12:35 PM 152 Aromatic Choreography is playful, joyful, lightening, and heartening. Unlike allopathic medicine, where you often must suffer first to deserve your recovery, enjoyment is part of the aromatic treatment! Blending is the most creative part of aromatherapy; it is an art. Like any art, it requires a balance of practice and intuition. There are some basic rules, but rules will not create a masterpiece without the proper dose of intuition. Blending is also what makes aromatherapy such a powerful therapeutic tool. You can blend essential oils targeted to treat specific needs or issues, enhancing the effectiveness of your treatments. For the amateur as well as the professional, blending is one of most enjoyable aspects of aromatherapy. It can, in fact, become a very enjoyable hobby. Just like you don't have to be a virtuoso to enjoy violin or piano, you don't have to be a master perfumer to enjoy blending. You might occasionally offend the nose of some of your friends, especially in the beginning, but you'll also have fun and learn from your mistakes. Nature has created hundreds of essential oils. In practice, you can readily find on the marketplace fifty to eighty of the most common oils (such as lavender, eucalyptus, lemon, bergamot, cedarwood, and ylang-ylang) and some more exotic and unusual ones (such as cistus, everlasting, lovage, and melissa). While there are a number of reputable sources offering a wide variety of essential oils, you can use the art of blending to have access to infinite variations. THE CONCEPT OF SYNERGY Just like almost anything that deals with life forces, aromatherapy does not abide by the laws of arithmetic. The whole is not the sum of its parts. Two plus two does not necessarily equal four; it might equal three or five, or sometimes even ten! The situation in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts is called a synergy. Some essential oils have mutually enhancing powers, while others inhibit each other. A combination of mutually enhancing oils is called a synergy. Synergies help the therapist to be very accurate and precise in the treatment. Creating synergies is the most important part of blending, requiring a deep understanding of essential oils, a fair amount of experience, and a lot of intuition. Intuition and experience are very important because synergies are rather context dependent. A given combination of oils might be an excellent synergy for one patient, but totally inappropriate for another. To create a good synergy, you need to take into account not only the symptoms that you want to treat, but also the underlying causes of the disorder, the biological terrain, and the psychological or emotional factors involved. All this may sound discouraging to the beginner, but if you follow some basic rules, you will be able to create decent blends. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 152 1. Do not blend more than three or four oils at a time in the beginning; wait until you've gained some experience. 2/11/20 12:35 PM Aromatic Choreography 153 2. Do not blend oils with opposite effects (like a calming and a stimulant). Check thoroughly the properties of the oils that you want to blend and make sure that they complement each other for the particular patient you are treating. 3. A blend has to be pleasant to your patient. This is possibly the most important part of blending. Once you have selected the oils that will be efficient in treating your patient's condition, look at their fragrance compatibility and adjust your blend accordingly. Below, I have given some basic rules about proportions. I have also provided some basic blends that can be used advantageously for common ailments. as you become more experienced with essential oils and blending. Systems of classification are tools and should be used as such. If you find a system that works better for you, do not hesitate to use it. Top Notes Top notes will hit you first in a fragrance. They do not last very long, but they are very important in a blend, because they give the first impression of the blend. Top notes are sharp, penetrating, volatile, extreme, and either cold or hot, but never warm. From a chemical point of view, they are found mostly in the aldehydes and the esters. In the plant, they are found in flowers, leaves, and fruits. Typical top notes include bergamot, petitgrain, neroli, lemon, lime, orange (all citruses, in fact), lemongrass, peppermint, thyme, cinnamon, and clove (see table 17 on page 155). While certain top notes can be used rather liberally (lemon, bergamot, petitgrain), the sharpest ones (cinnamon, cloves, thyme) should be used in very small amounts. Top notes should constitute 20 to 40 percent of your blend. Diffuser blends can use larger amounts of top notes. For Review Only THE PRINCIPLES OF BLENDING For blending purposes, essential oils are classified into top notes, middle notes, and base notes. A good fragrance composition should harmoniously balance these three categories. When I blend, I use an additional set of classifications: equalizers, modifiers, and enhancers, as well as fixatives. Fragrance classification is bound to be highly subjective. Different authors might disagree on the classification of certain oils. Although, for most of my presentation, I systematically checked my information against other people's findings, I generally relied upon my own knowledge and experience of the oils to establish the classifications. I encourage you to develop your own categories and classifications EsOiAr.indd 153 Middle Notes Middle notes give body to your blends; they smooth the sharp edges and round the corners. They are warm, round, soft, and mellow. They are often \"blend enhancers\"\u2014that is, oils to add to your blend less for their medicinal properties than for their fragrant qualities (for more on blend enhancers, keep reading). Monoterpene 2/11/20 12:35 PM 154 Aromatic Choreography alcohols are typically middle notes. They are mostly found in leaves and herbs. Typical middle notes are rosewood, geranium, lavender, chamomile, and marjoram (see table 17). Middle notes usually form the bulk of a blend (40 to 80 percent). Base Notes Base notes deepen your blend and increase its lasting effect. Base notes are warm, rich, and mostly pleasant. Most of them have traditional ritual uses. They generally affect the chakras and have deep effects on the mental, emotional, and spiritual planes and on the astral body. When smelled from the bottle, base notes may seem rather faint, but, when applied to the skin, they react strongly and release their power, which lasts for several hours. Typical base notes are sandalwood, clary sage, frankincense, vanilla, benzoin, cedarwood, and spruce (see table 17). They are found mostly in woods and gums and are typically sesquiterpenes. While base notes are not really necessary for a diffuser blend (although they do add depth to it), they are almost mandatory in any preparation to be applied to the skin. They can be used as 10 to 25 percent of a blend. such as musk or civet, can last for days. Typical fixatives are cistus, myrrh, patchouli, and vetiver (see table 17). The first hit of a fixative is not necessarily very pleasant (musk and civet are definitively obnoxious, while patchouli is unpleasant to many people and vetiver and cistus may seem weird), but no decent perfume could be made without them. Fixatives should be used sparingly to avoid overpowering the blend (they rarely account for more than 5 percent of any blend). They are found in roots and gums and are sesquiterpenes or diterpenes. For Review Only Fixatives Even deeper than base notes and often grouped with them, fixatives draw your blend into the skin, giving it roots and permanence. They are necessary for long-lasting effect and are deep, intense, and profound. Some animal fixatives, EsOiAr.indd 154 Ambergris, produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, has been highly valued by perfumers as a fixative 2/11/20 12:36 PM Aromatic Choreography 155 Table 17 Top notes Middle notes Base notes and fixatives Bergamot Caraway Ginger Only Rosewood EsOiAr.indd 155 Oils with More Than One Note Blend Equalizers Essential oils have rather complex chemical compositions, which means that many oils have notes in several categories (see fig. 10.2 on the following page). Certain oils even cover the whole spectrum from top note to base note. This is the case of ylang-ylang, jasmine, osmanthus, and tuberose (with a predominance in the middle and base notes) and with champaca flowers and rose (with a predominance in the top and middle notes). Neroli has most of its notes in the top but also has a fair amount of middle notes. It is not surprising that such well-balanced oils are the most pleasant that nature has to offer. They can, in fact, be used by themselves as perfumes. Blend equalizers are the oils that help you get rid of sharp edges. They fill the gaps, help your blend flow harmoniously, and control the intensity of your most active ingredients. Most of the blend equalizers are context dependent\u2014they perform better with certain types of blends. Rosewood, champaca flowers, and wild Spanish marjoram are universal equalizers, while orange and tangerine are great with other citruses (neroli, petitgrain, bergamot), spices (clove, cinnamon, nutmeg), and floral fragrances (ylang-ylang, jasmine, rose, geranium). Fir and pine greatly improve blends of Myrtaceae or Coniferae. (See table 18 on page 158.) The main purpose of blend equalizers is to 2/11/20 12:36 PM 156 Aromatic Choreography For Review Only Fig. 10.2. Gas chromatography clearly shows the various subnotes of a particular essential oil. Grapefruit is almost all top to middle notes. Lemongrass is pure middle notes. Lavender is more complex, with some top notes, lots of middle notes, and some base notes. Frankincense has some middle notes and mostly base notes. Patchouli has lots of base notes and fixatives. Ylang-ylang is the most complex, with a full range from top notes to fixatives.

Precious oils typically have a complex structure. hold your blend together while having little effect on its distinctive personality. They can be used in fairly large amounts (up to 50 percent), especially in those blends where you need to use some of the sharpest oils. Blend equalizers can also be used advantageously with the most precious oils (such as rose, jasmine, neroli, or melissa). Blend Modifiers (or Personifiers) Blend modifiers are generally the most intense fragrances. They can greatly affect the overall fragrant quality of your blend, even when used in amounts as small as a fraction of 1 percent. EsOiAr.indd 157 They are found at each end of the spectrum and are responsible for the sharp edges or deep roots of a blend. They also give your blend its very special kick, contributing to its distinctive personality (but an extra drop or two might kill it). If your blend is rather flat and uninteresting, you can, at your own risk, add such an oil\u2014drop by drop, please! Typical blend modifiers are clove, cinnamon, peppermint, thyme, blue chamomile, cistus, and patchouli (see table 18 on the following page). Blend modifiers should be used sparingly (never more than 2 to 3 percent). 2/11/20 12:36 PM 158 Aromatic Choreography Table 18 Blend equalizers Blend modifiers Champaca leaves Blue chamomile Bergamot Jasmine Fir Marjoram Cistus equalizers we find the enhancers. Enhancers have a pleasant fragrance by themselves. They have enough personality to modify your blend and give it a personal touch, without overpowering it, as long as they are used in reasonable amounts. Bergamot, cedarwood, geranium, clary sage, lavender, lemon, lime, litsea cubeba, palmarosa, sandalwood, spruce, ylang-ylang and, for the precious oils, jasmine, rose, neroli, and myrrh belong to this category (see table 18). Oils like cajeput, eucalyptus, niaouli, and rosemary could also be considered enhancers, although they are best used in blends for inhalation (diffuser, sauna, steam room, etc.). Enhancers may amount to up to 50 percent of your blend, although each individual oil will rarely account for more than 15 percent of the blend. Blend enhancers Natural Extenders Some essential oils, such as rose, jasmine, and neroli, are very expensive, and whenever you use them in a blend you want to make sure that their fragrance is not wasted. For instance, I do not recommend blending neroli and red thyme. Red thyme would totally overpower and destroy the neroli. Instead, you want to find essential oils that are as compatible as possible with neroli from an olfactory point of view. Natural extenders are the oils used with the most expensive and precious oils to make affordable blends that respect the notes of the precious oils. (See table 19.) For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 158 Further Fragrance Classifications Many different classifications of fragrances have been created for blending purposes. The most commonly used, in addition to the top, middle, and base notes, is a more descriptive classification 2/11/20 12:36 PM Aromatic Choreography 159 Table 19 Precious Petitgrain, cedarwood into floral, fruity, green, balsamic, woody, etc. The classification can be refined at will. You may add further notes for your own use. Here again, many oils are a combination of several notes. For example, lime and lemon are fruity and green. Champaca flower oil has a fruity apricot-like note with a dominance of floral, jasmine-like fragrance. Lavender combines floral and herbal. Clary sage is musky and floral. Bergamot is fruity with green and floral notes. Cinnamon is sweet and spicy. Rosemary is herbal and balsamic. The classification here is bound to be highly subjective. Table 20 describes the most frequently used notes and gives some guidelines to blending proportions, as well as to mixing various notes. The oil names in italic are those for which the described note is the dominant note.

Vanilla, benzoin, Peru balsam For Review Only 2/11/20 12:36 PM Aromatic Choreography 161 Blending Guidelines Fragrance is a great stimulant of the imagination. Therefore, I always encourage people to use images when creating a blend. One of my favorite images for blend creation is that of a human assembly, a social event. Are you coordinating a work group, throwing a lavish party, having a neighborhood barbecue, or preparing for an intimate, romantic evening? When creating a blend, first look at the purpose of the blend. A blend to fight an infection will be very different from one to soothe emotional wounds or to relieve stress. An infection-fighting blend will be built like a small commando of very efficient no-nonsense soldiers. You want to get the job done, as quickly and cleanly as possible. Your main concern is that the purpose be clear and that all the oils you use work in a very disciplined way toward the same goal. Fragrance is totally secondary. For emotional problems, on the other hand, fragrance is of the utmost importance, and you will need to carefully and skillfully build your blend to produce a pleasant one. At this level, we can talk about aromatic choreography. It is important to have a clearly defined purpose when creating a blend. Most beginners try to cure everything with one single blend. Everytime I give a seminar on blending, a few students come up with a blend to cure menopause, arthritis, asthma, cellulitis, spleen problems, and stress, plus balance all the chakras in one single shot. This is the best recipe for failure and represents a misunderstanding of the concept of synergy. Essential oils can be used in many ways and applied to many areas of the body. Do not try to treat the lungs and the kidneys with the same blend. Instead, create a blend for each area that you want to address. Create each blend so that it attacks the problem from different angles, treating when possible the causes as well as the symptoms. Once you determine the purpose of your blend, you have to decide how you are going to use it: through inhalation with a diffuser, applied to the body in massage, bath, compress, or lotion, in skin care preparations, or in special preparations such as personal blends or perfume oils. Lungs are best treated with diffusers or compresses. Emotional issues are best treated with diffusers. Energy issues can be a combination of diffusers and body applications. Physical conditions should be treated through body applications. Be realistic: remember, for example, that inhalation is a useless route for treating cellulite or arthritis. The more physical the problem, the less important the fragrance of the blend. You should still always try to avoid aromatic disasters. Antiseptic, analgesic, or anticellulite blends need to do the job, whatever it takes. Leave-on blends (lotions, body oils) should be more sophisticated than the take-off blends (bath products, compresses, masks, cleansers). Skin care blends, especially those that are applied at the end of the skin care session (such as toners, creams, and lotions) should have as nice a fragrance as possible\u2014the nose is right in the middle of the face. Blends for emotional problems should be For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 161 2/11/20 12:36 PM 162 Aromatic Choreography as pleasant as possible. For personal blends and perfume oil, sophistication is mandatory. Personal blends are usually created to address deep emotional issues and are used on pressure points and chakras or sniffed directly from the bottle throughout the day. Such blends require a good balance of top, middle, and base notes. The next step will be to define the theme of the blend, the star of the blend. Are you going to invite a celebrity, such as rose, neroli, jasmine, tuberose, or mimosa, to your gathering? If so, make sure that you don't spoil the party by inviting some rogue oils such as red thyme, savory, clove, or the balsamics. You may use them in very small amounts, just as bodyguards watching the doors, but keep them well under 5 percent. Also, do not invite too many celebrities to the same party. Not only do they run up your bill quite fast, they also have strong personalities and bicker, or they pout and disappear for the rest of the party. My advice to the beginner is to use the stars only when you really need them and only one at a time, until you figure out who gets along with whom. Of course, not every blend needs a celebrity. It does not make sense to bring rose or jasmine to treat digestive or intestinal problems. In general, the precious oils are kept for emotional problems or for leave-on types of preparations, especially those applied to the face. If you choose a celebrity, a precious oil, make sure it is properly surrounded. The entourage should enhance the fragrance of the precious oil. Use the corresponding extenders. Avoid the clashes such as the balsamics with the florals. Use spices sparingly and cautiously. Finally, find a good balance of top, middle, and base. I have found that a small amount of cistus (2 to 4 percent) brings a deep, rich, musklike base touch to floral blends, especially when combined with 5 to 10 percent of sandalwood. Precious oils, if treated properly, will add a nice personality to your blend; conversely, without precious oils a blend may lack personality. Blends that use a lot of equalizers (such as marjoram, rosewood, orange, or tangerine), for instance, might end up being rather flat and boring, like a gathering of nice, decent, but rather shy people. Such blends can be greatly enhanced by the modifiers, such as spices and vanilla-y notes. For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 162 Unscented Bases and Carrier Oils for Preparations Once you have mixed your blend, you will use it straight only for inhalation (diffuser, sauna, steam room). For most other purposes, you will need to add some of your blend to a carrier oil or an unscented base. Carrier oils and unscented bases are now readily available; refer to the Resource Guide (unscented products can be purchased by those interested in making their own preparations). Tables 21-35, at the end of this chapter, give proper dosages for the most common preparations. The Carrier Oils Many vegetable oils can be used as carriers for your aromatherapy preparations. I classify them into bases and active additives, which will be 2/11/20 12:36 PM Aromatic Choreography 163 active ingredients in your preparation. They are used in small amounts for their medicinal and skin rejuvenation or skin protection properties. The Bases Apricot kernel oil: A fine and nourishing oil, especially recommended for skin care. Avocado oil: Used mainly in skin care for its nourishing and restorative properties and its high vitamin content. Canola oil: Low erucic acid rapeseed oil, expressed from the seeds of Brassica campestris. It is very light and odorless and penetrates easily, which makes it a good massage oil base. Its high linoleic acid content prevents rancidity. Low in polyunsaturates, canola oil is good for cooking in that it helps with high cholesterol problems. Grapeseed oil: The refined oil obtained by pressing numerous varieties of grape seeds. It is a highly polyunsaturated triglyceride oil. A fairly new oil on the American market, it is becoming very popular among beauticians and massage therapists. Very light and odorless, it absorbs easily through the skin. It cleanses, tones, and is widely used in hypoallergenic products as a great emollient film former on skin and hair. Hazelnut oil: The oil obtained from the nuts of various species of the hazelnut tree, genus Corylus. Highly concentrated in vitamin E, it provides deep skin nourishment and moisturizing action and improves cutaneous circulation. It is noncomedogenic and astringent, tightens the pores, and helps normalize sebaceous secretions; therefore it is recommended for oily and combination skin. Jojoba oil: Expressed or extracted from the beanlike seed of the desert shrub Simmondsia chinensis. Used by the Native Americans, jojoba oil is actually a wax; therefore it does not become rancid, which makes it the ideal carrier for perfume oils. Highly emollient, it contains nutrients that feed the skin and regulate its functions. It softens and moisturizes skin, hair, and fingernails. It permeates the stratum corneum, skin, and hair follicles and is very soothing after sun exposure. Some believe that it tends to clog the pores, while others find it very emollient and nourishing for the skin. It is also excellent for hair care (and recommended as a hair oil base). Sesame oil: Sun protection. Sesamol and sesamoline are natural antioxidants (found only in the virgin cold-pressed oil). For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 163 Sesame oil 2/11/20 12:36 PM 164 Aromatic Choreography Sweet almond oil: The triglyceride oil expressed from the ripe seed kernels of the almond tree, Prunus amygdalus dulcis or communis. It is a light, nondrying oil and a natural emollient oil for skin and hair. Since it does not have a good shelf life, keep it in glass and move to smaller containers as the amount you have decreases. The Active Additives Squalane: A saturated branched-chain hydrocarbon derived from olives. Occurring naturally in the skin and found in human sebum, it has high affinity with the skin and its natural lipids. It helps the skin act as a barrier and helps avoid transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Helio-carrot or carrot oil: Obtained from the carrots that are the roots of the Daucus carota sativa. Rich in vitamin A, it has cell-regenerating properties. It is recommended before and after sun exposure to help maintain suntan and gives firmness to the skin while helping to prevent wrinkles. Borage oil: Obtained from the seeds of Borago officinalis and very popular in Europe for skin care. It has one of the highest gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) contents (19 to 24 percent). GLA, an essential fatty acid, is at the origin of one class of prostaglandin. It increases the protecting function of skin cells, reinforces the skin as a protecting membrane, and is essential for the function and lipid synthesis of the keratinosomes. Research has demonstrated that GLA applied to the skin is incorporated into phospholipid molecules, which include essential fatty acids known as omega-3 and omega-6 (alpha-linolenic acid). They are essential for health because of their contribution to critical metabolic functions like fingernails, skin, and hair production; visual function; adrenal function (stress); and sperm formation. GLA helps restore the intercellular moisture barrier in the stratum corneum and reduces transepidermal water loss. It moisturizes the skin from within, providing nonocclusive moisturization. Deficiency in GLA increases TEWL, causing severe dryness. Borage oil is recommended in facial oils for its rejuvenative power. It should be refrigerated. Evening primrose oil: The oil obtained from Oenothera biennis or Oenothera lamarckensi. It is an expensive oil, rich in gamma-linolenic acid (13 to 15 percent), and therefore excellent for skin care (cf. borage oil). I recommend adding small amounts to a facial oil. This oil, being highly unsaturated, easily becomes rancid and should be refrigerated. Rosa oil mosqueta: From Chilean rose hip seeds. This is another oil with a high GLA content. It is an emollient, nourishing tissue regenerator and is recommended for facial oils. Wheat germ oil: Rich in vitamins E, A, and B. Its antioxidant properties make it useful in oil base preparations to prevent rancidity. It helps regenerate tissues and promotes skin elasticity. Being rather heavy and having a fairly strong odor, it is used in small amounts in the carrier. Vitamin E (tocopherol): An organic heterocyclic compound derived from soy. It protects For Review Only EsOiAr.indd 164 2/11/20 12:36 PM Aromatic Choreography 165 For Review Only Evening primrose oil the skin from ultraviolet radiation. It is an excellent natural antioxidant and free-radical scavenger. Free radicals are responsible for the aging process and are caused by numerous environmental factors (pollution, gas pipes, air conditioning, smoking). Other Carriers: Emulsifiers Essential oils do not mix directly with water. Emulsifiers are necessary to mix oil and water and therefore needed everytime we want to incorporate essential oils into water. Emulsifiers are molecules with two radicals, one hydrophile (likes water) and one lipophile (likes oil). Several suppliers offer emulsifiers or essential oil solubilizers (see appendix III). EsOiAr.indd 165 Suggested base for a facial oil in milliliters (30-milliliter preparation): Hazelnut oil: Evening primrose, borage, or Rosa mosqueta (or a combination of all): 2 Vitamin E: 1 Suggested base for a massage oil in ounces (4-ounce preparation): Canola oil: 2 Grapeseed oil: 1.5 Wheat germ oil: 0.5 2/11/20 12:36 PM 166 Aromatic Choreography FORMULAS FOR SOME COMMON AILMENTS The Problem of Rancidity Except for jojoba (which is a wax), any vegetable oil will eventually oxidize and become rancid. Keep your bases in tightly closed dark bottles and store them in a cool place (keep them in your fridge if you use them infrequently). I have noticed that essential oils have antioxidant properties: your aromatherapy preparations will keep longer than the carriers alone. They will have some shelf life but will still eventually go rancid. If stored properly, any oil base preparation should keep for at least six months. Several manufacturers offer an extensive range of premixed blends for a wide range of indications (refer to appendix III). I encourage you, however, to prepare your own blends. It adds to the fun and the efficiency of your aromatherapy treatment. Tables 21-35 give you some guidelines. Once you become more acquainted with the power of the oils, you will be able to create your own blends.

It might seem overwhelming at first glance, but I hope you find it comprehensive and practical. Many oils listed here cannot easily be found in any other book. I also differentiate between the varieties of the same species (such as chamomiles or the chemotypes of thyme). Since there are a few hundred essential oils, some have been left out. Still, I cover all the common oils plus all those that present some therapeutic interest and can be found on the market. The following codes represent suggested uses of oils for specific conditions: For Review Only D Diffuser M Massage B Bath F Facial masks C Compresses L Lotions O Oil for face or body U Unguents The power of the oil is indicated with regard to the specific condition on a scale from 1 to 5. 176 EsOiAr.indd 176 2/11/20 12:36 PM Appendix I: Essential Oils Reference Table 177 Plant name (Genus

handful of suppliers, even fewer training centers, and just a few dozen reputable retailers and treatment centers in the United States. Today, essential oils and aromatherapy products are available all across the Internet as well as from thousands of brick-and-mortar retailers. Most spas and many beauty salons offer some kind of aromatherapy treatments. Spas themselves have proliferated, and most upscale hotels now have spa facilities. I had to limit my ambition in the actualization of this resource guide. For it to be meaningful and not arbitrary, I renounced trying to come up with a list of retailers or treatment centers, and I've reduced myself to listing only associations and the major suppliers, aware that I am leaving out lots of very good small retailers and growers. Look around wherever you live; a good many local suppliers are thriving across the country. National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) naha.org For Review Only A member-based nonprofit association devoted to the holistic integration of aromatherapy into a wide range of complementary health-care practices, including self-care and home pharmacy.

EDUCATION NAHA has an extensive listing of dozens of aromatherapy training centers at PUBLICATIONS Aromatherapy Today, an international aromatherapy journal since 1995 (www.aromatherapytoday .com) International Journal of Clinical Aromatherapy (www.ijca.net) International Journal of Professional Holistic Aromatherapy (www.ijpha.com) SUPPLIERS The aromatherapy marketplace has changed tremendously since 1990 when this workbook was first published. Back then, there was a handful of reputable suppliers. There are now dozens and dozens, if not hundreds, of companies competing for the aromatherapy market, each claiming to be purer than pure. Here is a brief list of very reputable companies that have withstood the proof of time. I have deliberated avoided listing any of the numerous multilevel marketing companies, as the multilevel business model requires enormous markups from the cost of goods to the consumer price, and such high consumer prices are often justified by extravagant and even outrageous claims, with often cultish undertones. Most companies listed below offer a wide selection of essential oils of equal or much greater quality at a fraction of the cost of typical multilevel suppliers.

Examining the origins and applications of aromatics, from the mythical Queen of Sheba to Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gatefoss\u00e9, the author traces the medical, alchemical, and spiritual development of this healing art from classical civilizations up to the present. He explains the mysteries of the olfactory system and how this most ancient sensory system affects our moods, our emotions, and our sexuality. Illustrating the biochemistry of essential oils and how they work on the physical, energetic, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels, he explores more than 70 essential oils classified by botanical family, with detailed discussions of their specific actions. He shows how to use appropriate plant essences for beautifying, cleansing, and healing the body, as well as in massage, aromatic baths, ritual, and spiritual practice. He also addresses the controversy surrounding different methods of administration and explores in depth the risks, benefits, and safety guidelines for each technique. Addressing the fundamental issues of purity and quality, the author discusses the various methods of extraction in detail and includes a special section devoted to the art of blending. He offers specific formulas for common disorders such as digestive and circulatory ailments, headaches, insomnia, and menstrual and sexual problems. Lavabre also includes extensive reference tables to provide the reader with concise information on each essential oil and its therapeutic uses. This revised edition offers a perfect step-by-step guide for beginners as well as an ongoing reference for practicing aromatherapists.
