Public Law 89-97, the Social Security Amendments of 1965, established a health insurance program for the aged, consisting of a hospital insurance plan and a voluntary medical insurance plan. The hospital insurance plan affords basic protection to persons age 65 and over against the costs of inpatient hospital services, post\u00ad hospital home health services, and post\u00ad hosp1tal extended-care services. B111s for services rendered under the hospital insur\u00ad ance program are submitted by hospitals, extended-care faclUties, and home health agencies. In most instances, these bills are processed by the Blue Cross Association and private insurance companies acting as inter\u00ad mediaries for the Social Security Adminis\u00ad tration. The individual beneficiary records of utilization of hospital services are maintained in the central office of the Social Security Administration. Payments under the hospital insurance plan are ma.de from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund which ls financed by tax contributions collected from employees, employers, and the self-employed. The scheduled combined rate of contribu\u00ad tions from each employer and employee in calendar year 1969 is 0.6 percent applied to a maximum of $7,800 in earnings. For those aged who are not insured under Social Secu\u00ad rity or railroad retirement, but who are en\u00ad titled to hospital insurance benefits, the cost of hospital insurance payments is borne by the general funds of the Treasury. Benefit payments under the hospital insurance plan in fiscal year 1969 are estimated to be $4,445,000,000. Almost all persons age 65 and over are eligible to enroll in the supplementary medi\u00ad cal insurance plan. The plan covers 80 per\u00ad cent of the cost of physician services and other medical services after the beneficiary meets an annual $50 deductible. In fiscal year 1969, it is expected that approximately 18.8 m11lion persons wm be covered under part B. Enrollees in the plan pay a monthly premium of $4 and the aggregate of these premiums is matched by the Federal Gov\u00ad ernment by appropriations from the general *The 1969 appropriation for DHEW does not refiect the organizational changes in April, 1968. However, this report shows the accounts within the new administrations, but they must be considered simply estimates and do not reflect the many minor organi\u00ad zational transfers that have ta.ken place. Most of the transfers have occurred among pro\u00ad grams that make up the Health Services and Mental Health Administration and the Con\u00ad sumer Protection and Environmental Health Services Administration. The new organiza\u00ad tional relationships do not change the dollar amounts for the total health appropriations for the Department. fund. Bllls for services under the medical insurance p1an are submitted by either the provider of service or the beneficiary to Blue Shield associations and insurance companies who have been designated to act as inter\u00ad mediaries for the Social Security Adminis\u00ad tration in specific geographical areas. Benefit payments under the medical insurance plan in fiscal year 1969 are estimated to be $1,669,000,000.

Federal Surplus Property Donation Pro\u00ad gram: $130,460. Last year: $127,380. The Department of HEW administers a program of disposal of federal surplus real and personal property for public health pur\u00ad poses, including research. Surplus personal property is donated through state agencies to tax-supported and private nonprofit med\u00ad ical institutions, hospitals, clinics, and health centers. Surplus personal property is donated at no cost to the recipient other than the handling costs involved. Surplus real property is conveyed at market value against which a public benefit allowance discount is applied, based on the benefits accrued or to be accrued to the nation from the use of the property. The amounts of such allowances range from 50% to 100% of fair market value, and are earned over the normal 30-year period of deed restric\u00ad tions. Last year, personal property costing approximately $24,703,000 at the time of ac\u00ad quisition, and real property costing approx\u00ad imately $11,244,000 were transferred for health purposes. It ls expected that the level of donations and transfers for fiscal 1969 will be approximately the same as for 1968. Federal funds for the Federal surplus property program are only appropriated to defray the direct Federal administrative ex\u00ad penses of operations of the surplus property program. It is estimated that of the $1,186,-February 24, 1969 000 authorized for this use in 1969, approxi\u00ad mately $130,460 will be utilized for the dis\u00ad tribution of surplus property for health\u00ad related purposes.

EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 87-510) the U.S. makes contracts with private agencies for various types of care for es\u00ad capees or refugees. The program operates in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and the Far East, with medical care being pro\u00ad vided through American voluntary welfare agencies. During the calendar year 1968, ex\u00ad penditures for medical care in Europe amounted to approximately $23,000. These funds were used for medical care as part of the care and maintenance of refugees from the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe, and for medical examinations required for aliens to obtain visas for permanent settlement in other countries. For Chinese refugees in Hong Kong and Macao, the amount is ap\u00ad proximately $464,000. These funds include payment for the services of physicians and nurses, provtl.sion of medical supplies, reha\u00ad bilitation of handicapped children and the blind, purchase of ambulances, and parti\u00ad cipation in the construction of hospitals and chlnics in refugee communities. Assistance has also been given for the rehabilitation of TB convalescents. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS (This year: $242,220,000; year: $233,- $231,743,000. Last Under the terms of Public Laws 86-382 Mld 89-504, the Federal agencies, as employers, are authorized to provide health insurance benefits for their employees who are active or who retired on or after the effective date of the laws, and for their dependents. The em\u00ad ployee has the right to select one of the fol\u00ad lowing types of insurance plans: service benefits such as offered by Blue Cross-Blue Shield; an indemnity program offered by commercial insurance companies; programs offered by employee organizations; or com\u00ad prehensive health plans like HIP. Under the law, the Federal Government will oontribute a specific amount, depending on the em\u00ad ployee's marital status. 2,526,500 employees have elected to participate in the program. Over 5,290,500 of their dependents will also be covered. For fiscal year 1969, total subscription charges under the program are expected to approximate $780,389,000, with the Federal Government contributing approximately $231,743,000. While the law authorized a high and low option under both the service and indemnity plans, it anticipated that there would be at least one low option to which the Government would contribute 50% of the cost. If the employee selected one of the other higher priced options, he would still receive the same dollar contribution but would have to pay the difference. 85 % of the employees selected the high option. Approxi\u00ad mately 57.8% are enrolled in the service benefit plan, 21.4% in the indemnity benefit benefit plan, 14.4% in the employee organi\u00ad zation plans, 4.8 % in the group practice plans, and 1.6% in the individual practice plans. Health Insurance for Retired Federal Em\u00ad ployees: $10,477,000. Last year: $10,769,000. Under the terms of Public Law 86-724, Federal agencies, as employers, are author\u00ad ized to provide health insurance benefits for certain qualified retired employees and their dependents or survivors who are not cov\u00ad ered under the program authorized by Public Law 86-382 above. Under the law, the retired employee has the righlt to choose to par\u00ad ticipate in a single Government-wide plan which is underwritten by commercial insur\u00ad ance under a contract with the Government, or to receive protection under a qualified private pl.an of his own selection. Under the Government-wide plan, the retired employee may elect to subscribe for basic coverage only; for major medical coverage only, or for both. The Government's monthly contribu\u00ad tion ($3.50 for a single annuitant, $7.00 for 4219 an annuitant with a dependent) for any participant--in the Government-wide plan or in any privaite plan-is equivalent to ap\u00ad proximately 70% of the premium. (as a result of a. reduction in premiums made possible by the Medicare coverage) for basic coverage or for major medical coverage in the Govern\u00ad ment-wide plan. Those selecting the Govern\u00ad ment plan have their contribution deducted from their annuity. Those choosing a pri\u00ad vate plan have their annuity increased by amount of the Federal contribution. Retired employees numbering 182,000 (of which 71,565 had dependents) were covered under the program as of June 30, 1968. Of the employees covered, 83,500 chose the Gov\u00ad ernment plan; 98,500 purchased their own 62,475; employee organizations, 25,025; in\u00ad surance companies, 7,350; and The cost the Federal Government's con\u00ad tributions is estimated at $10,477,000. It is not possible to estimate the total cost of the program because there is no way of ascertain\u00ad ing the cost of the insurance programs car\u00ad ried by annuitants who are purchasing their own insurance. Since Public Law 86-724 provides coverage only for Federal employees who were retired at the time of its enactment, this program can be expected to become smaller with the passing of time. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (This year: $183,793,000; last $81,667,000. activities of this Service having medi\u00ad cal and health-related significance are aimed towards learning how infectious diseases and harmful parasites of livestock and poultry are transmitted to man, the role of insects as vectors, and developing methods for their diagnosis, prevention, eradication, and con\u00ad trol. Approximately 90 diseases of animals are transmissible to man, including brucel\u00ad losis, leptospirosis, mycotic protozoa, leukosis, Newcastle, ornithosis, and salm.onellosls. Research ls conducted to devise protective measures for decontamination and utillza\u00ad tlon of crops, animals, and soils affected by direct radiation or radioactive fallout to minimize their effects on the nation's supply of meat and other food products. Research is also conducted on the use of pesticides to avoid the side hazards of pesti\u00ad cide residues in insects, crops, and livestock and on the effects of chemicals on crops, livestock and water. This research includes the following: toxicological and pathological effects of pesticides, feed additives, etc., on livestock as found in their feed and on crops; physical and chemical nature of plant vi\u00ad ruses; effects of pesticides on the composition and nutritive value of the current food sup\u00ad ply; biological and other methods of con\u00ad trolling stored-products insects, and develop\u00ad ment of nontoxic mothproofing treatments.

This work also has included screening plant extracts for biological activity, such as for treatment of heart disease and cancer. The commercial development of penicillin came from Depart\u00ad ment research in the microorganism field. Marketing research is directed towards minimizing deterioration and spoilage of farm commodities in marketing channels in order to provide the consumer with a more wholesome product. Research is conducted on the effects of various disease organisms on poultry and the effects of light on the identification of poultry diseases in connec\u00ad tion with poultry inspection activities. To carry out the above programs, $43,- 658,000 will be expended ($39,928,000 for the conduct of research and $3,730,000 for re\u00ad search faclllties). The Service also conducts preventive and community services, which include eradica\u00ad tion of animal diseases, such as brucellosis and tuberculosis which are transmissible to man; prevention of the introduction of animal diseases from foreign countries which may affect man; the regulation of pesticides, which may be toxic to man; evaluation of pest control programs with special reference to environmental impact associated with control and eradication procedures; and monitoring pesticides in agriculture. For the above program, $39,180,000 will be expended in fiscal 1969. Consumer and Marketing service: $92,- 908,000. Last year: $69,730,000. The programs financed from these funds for 1968 consisted of meat inspection ($48,- 423,000) and poultry inspection ($2,307,000). For fiscal 1969, $68,102,000 will be obligated for meat inspection; and $24,806,000 for poul\u00ad try inspection. These services are performed as a protection to the health of consumers. They assure a clean and wholesome supply of meat and poultry through minute inspection in slaughter and processing plants of meat animals and their products, and poultry and its products. Any such products found to be diseased or otherwise unfit from human con\u00ad sumption are removed from channels of trade and destroyed. In addition to the appropriated funds shown above, fees paid by plants for over\u00ad time work s.nd by other users of the service are estimated for 1969 at $12,097,000 for meat inspection and $2,643,000 for poultry inspection. Cooperative State Research Service: $8,- 047,000. Last year: $7,776,000.

The Commission's total budget for fiscal year 1969 is $43,460,000, out of which about 1.5 % goes to the medical function for sal\u00ad aries of six medical officers in Washington and nine medical officers in the regional of\u00ad fices. The Medical Division's duties include establishing and reviewing physical stand\u00ad ards for positions in the competitive Federal civil service; arranging and evaluating phys\u00ad ical examinations for the disability claims under the Civil Service Retirement Act; help\u00ad ing to formulate educational and experience requirements for physician and paramedical positions in the competitive Federal service; and conducting the health program for Com\u00ad mission employees. OFFICE OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN OF CONGRESS (This year: $71,780; last year: $145,100.) The Attending Physician of Congress pro\u00ad vides outpatient care for members of the House and Senate and their staffs. Funds voted by Congress are for medical supplies, equipment, and contingent expenses ($56,000) and for a technical assistant to the Attending Physician ($15,780). NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE SELECTIVE SERVICE SYSTEM (This year: $60,000 (this appropriation is only for the National Advisory Committee's use; it does not include any monies for the Health Resources Advisory Committee); last year: $49,000). On June 24, 1968, the President combined the membership of the Health Resources Ad-February 24, 1969 visory Committee to the Ofilce of Emergency Planning, Executive Office of the President, and the membership of the National Ad\u00ad visory Committee to the Selective Service System. This merger took place on Decem\u00ad ber 15, 1968, with James C. Cain, M.D. as Chairman. Under the Selective Service Act, the Com\u00ad mittee has the responsib111ty of advising the Selective Service System on the deferment of physicians in such essential capacities as residents, teachers, laboratory and clinical researchers, as well as those in the civilian practice of medicine who are essential to their communities. In fiscal 1969, Congress provided an appropriation of $60,000 to main\u00ad tain a skeleton staff and for expenses for the Committee's operations, plus minimal ex\u00ad penses of state committees. The state and territorial committees re\u00ad quest deferment of physicians and allied personnel whom they consider to be essen\u00ad tial. In appeal cases the Committee always seeks the state committee's opinion. On the other hand, the state committees may re\u00ad quest and obtain deferments on their own. The National Committee has continued in its efforts to have as many cases as possible settled at the local level. On March 14, 1967, the National Committee revised the January, 1966 guidelines to assist the state committees in adjudicating these cases. As of August 31, 1968, 56 osteopaths and 1,070 physicians were called for induction. NATIONAL SCIENCE Unknown; last year: $43,- 810,000.) The Foundation's over-all appropriation for fiscal year 1969 is $400,000,000, but at this writing it had not been allocated. In past years, approximately 10% of the over-all appropriation has been earmarked for grants for research in the biological and medical sciences. In addition, approximately $1,000,000 is made available for construction and renovation of graduate-level biological research laboratories, and slightly over $1,000,000 is used to support specialized bio\u00ad logical facllities, including biological equip\u00ad ment. The Foundation provides support for basic scientific research, for scientific train\u00ad ing and education through fellowships and programs to improve science teaching and for prograins to improve the exchange of scien\u00ad tific information.

February 24, 1969 LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE HON. CHARLES W. SANDMAN OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, February 19, 1969 :M:r. SAND:M:AN. l\\:Ir. Speaker, on Feb\u00ad ruary 16, Americans of all nationalities joined with the American Lithuanians in celebrating the 51st anniversary of their proclamation of independence. However, in Lithuania itself, the celebra\u00ad tion is not so joyous. Although February 16, 1918, marks the date of the Lithuan\u00ad ian proclamation of independence, these courageous people are again living under the suppression of the Russians. The free world must not rest until the Soviets withdraw their army, police, and ruling apparatus from Lithuania, so the people of Lithuania may freely elect a government of their own choosing. On this historic occasion, the most fit\u00ad ting commemoration we can off er to the brave citizens of Lithuania, the heroes who have died in the quest of Lithuanian liberty, and the countless relatives and friends of Lithuania in the United States, is the reaffirmation that the cause of Lithuanian freedom has not been forgot\u00ad ten and the struggle for it will continue until won. It is my privilege to share with my distinguished colleagues the resolution unanimously adopted at a meeting of American Lithuanians and their friends living in New Jersey, sponsored by the Lithuanian Council of New Jersey, held on Sunday, February 16, 1969, at St. George's Lithuanian Hall, Newark, N.J., in commemoration of the 51st anniver\u00ad sary of the establishment of the Repub\u00ad lic of Lithuania on February 16, 1918: RESOLUTION Whereas the Soviet Union took over Lithu\u00ad ania by force in June of 1940; and Whereas the Lithuanian people are strong\u00ad ly opposed to foreign domination and are determined to restore their freedom and sovereignty which they rightly and deserved\u00ad ly enjoyed for more than seven centuries in the past; and Whereas the Soviets have deported or killed over twenty-five per cent of the Lithuanian population since June 15, 1940; and Whereas the House of Representatives and the United States Senate (of the 89th Con\u00ad gress) unanimously passed House Concur\u00ad rent Resolution 416 urging the President of the United States to direct the attention of the world opinion at the United Nations and at other appropriate international forums and by such means as he deems appropriate to the denial of the rights of self-determi\u00ad nation for the peoples of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and to bring the force of world opinion to bear on behalf of the res\u00ad toration of these rights to the Baltic peo\u00ad ples; now, therefore, be it Resolved, That we, Americans of Lithu\u00ad anian origin or descent, reaffirm our ad\u00ad herence to American democratic principles of government and pledge our support to our President and our Congress to achieve lasting peace and justice in the world; and be it further Resolved, That the President of the United States carries out the expression of the U.S. Congress conta.ined in H. Con. Res. 416 by bringing up the Baltic States question in the United Nations and demanding the So\u00ad viets to withdraw from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania and be it further. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Resolved, That the pauperization of the Lithuanian people, conversion of once free farmers into serfs on kolkhozes and sovk\u00ad hozes, as well as exploitation of workers, per\u00ad secution of the faithful, restriction of reli\u00ad gious practices, and closing of houses of worship, and be it finally Resolved, That copies of this resolution be forwarded this day to the President of the United States, Secretary of State Wil\u00ad liam Rogers, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Charles Yost, United States Senators from New Jersey, Members of U.S. Congress from New Jersey, and the Press. ANARCHY BY DESIGN HON. LOUIS C. WYMAN OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. WY:M:AN. Mr. Speaker, a letter ap\u00ad pearing recently in Foster's Dally Demo\u00ad crat of Dover, N.H., from Edward Lewis, of Durham, is interesting in light of re\u00ad cent disturbing developments within this country. At some point in each in\u00ad dividual case, conduct contributing to violence and anarchy ceases to be ex\u00ad cusable from any point of view and be\u00ad comes subversive of government itself. Those dealing with such actors owe it to society as well as to their own respon\u00ad sibilities to recognize this point and to act accordingly. The letter follows: ANARCHY BY DESIGN To THE EDITOR: Appearing in a recent issue of The Fact Finder, are the Comm.unist \"Rules for Rev\u00ad olution.\" They are reported to have been found among documents seized by the Allied Forces in Dusseldorf, Germa.ny, in May, 1919. A copy of these rules was secured by the office of the Florida State's Attorney from a known member of the Communist Party who acknowledged these objectives to be \"stlll a part of the Communist program for over\u00ad throwing our Government.\" The document reads as follows: RULES FOR REVOLUTION \"A. Corrupt the young, get them away from religion. Get them interested in sex. Make them superfictal; destroy their rugged\u00ad ness. \"B. Get control of all means of publicity and thereby: 1) Get people's minds off their govern\u00ad ment by focusing their attention on athletics, sexy books and plays and other trivialities. 2) Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial mat\u00ad ters of no importance. 3) Destroy the people's faith in their nat\u00ad ural leaders by holding the latter up to con\u00ad tempt, ridicule and obloquy. 4) Always preach true democracy but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible. 5) By encouraging government extrava\u00ad gance, destroy its credit, produce fear of inflation with rising prices and general dis\u00ad content. 6) Foment unnecessary strikes in vital in\u00ad dustries, encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government toward such disorders. 7) By specious argument, cause the break\u00ad down of the old moral virtues: honesty, so\u00ad briety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness. \"C. Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a view to confiscating them and leaving the population helpless.\" 4223 Let the reader judge for himself whether or not these \"rules for Revolution\" set forth the objectives which have been, and are being, pursued by communists and other subversive elements in the United States. EDWARD A. LEWIS. FEDERAL JUDGES HON. WILLIAM LLOYD SCOTT OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 :M:r. SCOTT. :M:r. Speaker, I have in\u00ad troduced a proposed amendment to the Constitution, House Joint Resolution 471, requiring that Justices of the Su\u00ad preme Court and judges of other Federal courts be renominated and reconfirmed every 10 years. This proposal differs from earlier reso\u00ad lutions limiting the tenure of Supreme Court Justices. The amendment ex\u00ad pressly provides that the President must renominate an incumbent if he wants to keep him in office. The other body will then carry out its traditional duty of confirmation. It is essential that we maintain our constitutional system of checks and balances and the Senate should not be placed in the position of reconfirming a Federal judge contrary to the President's desire. This resolution also goes beyond other proposals in extending the tenure limi\u00ad tation to all judges of constitutional courts. In recent years, attention has been focused upon the removal of judges who have become senile or are simply incompetent. A mandatory retirement age coupled with various administrative procedures has often been mentioned. It would seem that a review of these appointments every 10 years by the President and the other body would be the most direct means of eliminating this concern. While age may well be a factor in the fitness of a judge to continue to serve, in my opinion it should not be used arbitrarily to terminate the career of a capable and dedicated judge. :M:any Americans, including numerous lawyers, have expressed concern over the complete lack of control over both the Supreme Court and inferior courts by the people of the country or their elected representatives. I share this concern and believe the Court has contributed signifi\u00ad cantly to the atmosphere of permissive\u00ad ness so widespread today. I also believe that the Court's actions have hindered law enforcement unnecessarily and failed to show regard for the rights of the in\u00ad nocent victims of crime and society in general. The Court has lost its perspective and has failed our society. Regardless of how we individually view the Court, it should be responsive to the will of the people and concerned with their general welfare. No one in public office should be sacred. The only purpose of a govern\u00ad ment should be to serve the people and they should be able to change any seg\u00ad ment of it if it fails to serve them. If the courts and the judges are doing their duties as public servants, they have noth\u00ad ing to fear in having their stewardship reviewed ever 10 years. 4224: It may be argued that life tenure is essential to an impartial and independ\u00ad ent judiciary and that a limitation on tenure will subject the bench to partisan political influence. Yet, who can say that our Supreme Court is not influenced by political considerations I do not believe this body needs to be reminded of in\u00ad stances of Justices entering the politi\u00ad cal realm. Not only can a man retain his prejudices and political philosophy when he has received a lifetime appoint\u00ad ment, but he can arbitrarily use them to the detriment of society without any fear of reprisal. A reasonable limitation on the tenure of judges who have been carefully chosen and who are honest men regardless of political philosophy will not reduce their effectiveness on the bench. Ten-year ten\u00ad ures renewable at the will of the Presi\u00ad dent with the advise and consent of the Senate, in my opinion, will allow the courts to be independent without being arbitrary. I urge my colleagues, especially those on the judiciary committee, to con\u00ad sider this bill and determine whether it will benefit the people of this court. Since the bill is a short one, I insert it in full at this point in the RECORD: H.J. RES. 471 Joint Resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution relating to the con\u00ad tinuance in office of judges of the Supreme Court and of inferior courts Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article ls proposed as an amend\u00ad ment to the Constitution of the United States, to be valid only if ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of final passage of this joint resolution: \"ARTICLE- \"SECTION 1. Notwithstanding section 1 of article III of this Constitution, unless the President nominates and the Senate consents to the continuance In office of a judge o! the Supreme Court or of an inferior court or\u00ad dained and established by Congress, that judge may not hold office for more than ten years after- \" ( 1) he took office, \"(2) the Senate last consented to his con\u00ad tinuance in office, or \"(3) the ratification of this article, whichever last occurs. \"SEc. 2. Section 1 of this article shall not apply to a judge who has retired from active judicial service.\" THE DUTIES OF STUDENTS HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, disruptive tactics on college campuses all across the country seem to have become the rule rather than the exception. Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of the University of Notre Dame, recently addressed a let\u00ad ter to all Notre Dame faculty members, students, and parents in which he de\u00ad nounced such tactics for what they are and announced in no uncertain terms just what Notre Dame will do in the fu-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ture to handle force. The following lead editorial from the Chicago Tribune of Wednesday, February 19, 1969, was de\u00ad voted solely to excerpts from his letter: THE DUTIES OF STUDENTS Anyone or any group that substitutes force for rational persuasion, be it violent or non\u00ad violent, will be given 16 minutes of medita\u00ad tion to cease and desist. They will be told that they are, by their actions, going counter to the overwhelming conviction of this com\u00ad munity as to what is proper here. If they do not within that time period cease and desist, they will be asked for their identity cards. Those who produce these will be suspended from this community. Those who do not have or will not produce identity cards will be assumed not to be members of the com\u00ad munity and will be charged with trespassing and disturbing the peace on private property and treated accordingly by the law. After notification of suspension, or tres\u00ad pass in the case of noncommunlty members, if there is not then within five minutes a movement to cease and desist, students will be notified of expulsion from this community and the law will deal with them as non\u00ad students. There seems to be a current myth that uni\u00ad versity members are not responsible to the law, and that somehow the law is the enemy, particularly those who society has con\u00ad stituted to uphold and enforce the law. I would like to insist here that all of us are re\u00ad sponsible to the duly constituted laws of this university community and to all of the laws of the land. There ls no other guarantee of civilization versus the jungle or mob rule, here or elsewhere. If someone invades your home, do you dialog with him or call the law? Without the law, the university is a sitting duck for any small group from outside or inside that wishes to destroy it, to incapacitate it, to terrorize it at whim. The argument goes--or has gone-invoke the law and you lose the university community. My only response is that without the law you may well lose the university-and beyond that--the larger so\u00ad ciety that supports it and that is most deep\u00ad ly wounded when law is no longer respected, bringing an end of everyone's most cherished rights. I have studied at some length the new politics of confrontation. The rhythm is simple: 1] find a cause, any cause, silly or not; 2] in the name of the cause, get a few determined people to abuse the rights and privileges of the community so as to force a confrontation at any cost of boorishness or incivility; 3 J once this has occurred, justified or not, orderly or not, yell police brutality\u00ad if it does not happen, provoke it by foul language, physical abuse, whatever, and then count on a larger measure of sympathy from the up-to-now apathetic or passive members of the community. Then call for amnesty, the head of the president on a platter, the complete submission to any and all demands. One beleaguered president has said that these people want to be martyrs thrown to tooth\u00ad less lions. He added, \"Who wants to dialog when they are going for the jugular vein?\" So it has gone, and it is generally well orchestrated. Again, my only question: Must it be so? Must universities be subjected, willy-nilly, to such intimidation and vic\u00ad timization whatever their good will in the matter? Somewhere a stand must be made. I only ask that when the stand is made necessary by those who would destroy the community and all its basic yearning for great and calm educational opportunity, let them carry the blame and the penalty. No one wants the forces of law on this or any other campus, but if some necessitate it, as a last and dismal alternative to anarchy and mob tyranny, let them shoulder the blame instead of receiving the sympathy of a com\u00ad munity they would hold at bay. The only al-February 24, 1969 ternative I can imagine ls turning the ma\u00ad jority of the community loose on them, and then you have two mobs. I know of no one who would opt for this alternative-always lurking in the wings. We can have a thousand resolutions as to what kind of a society we want, but when lawlessness is afoot, and all authority is fio\\lted, faculty, administration, and student, then we invoke the normal societal forces of law or we allow the university to die beneath our hapless and hopeless gaze. I have no in\u00ad tention of presiding over such a spectacle: Too many people have given too much of themselves and their lives to this university to let this happen here. Without being melo\u00ad dramatic, if this conviction makes this my last will and testament, so be it. May I now say in all sincerity that I never want to see any student expelled from this community because, in many ways, this is always an educative failure. Even so, I must likewise be committed to the survival of the university community as one of man's best hopes in these troubled times. We cannot allow a small minority to im\u00ad pose their will on the majority who have spoken regarding the university's style of life; we cannot allow a few to substitute force of any kind for persuasion to accept their per\u00ad sonal idea of what is right or proper. We only insist on the rights of all, minority and ma\u00ad jority, the climate of civility and ration\u00ad ality, and a preponderant moral abhorrence of violence or inhuman forms of persuasion that violate our style of life and the nature of the university. A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JUDGE DESMOND GRAHAM HON. WILLIAM M. COLMER OF MISSISSIPPI IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. COLMER. Mr. Speaker, on October 17 last, a noble man, a great jurist, an able member of the legal bar, a warm personal friend and constituent, Judge Desmond M. Graham, died at his home in Gulfport, Miss. Judge Graham lived a long and fruit\u00ad ful life. When he left this mortal scene, he had lived to the ripe age of 95 years, a much longer span than the average mortal is permitted to live. During that period his activities included teaching school, a private practitioner, and a cir\u00ad cuit judge. Shortly after his graduation from Mill\u00ad saps College in Jackson and admittance to the bar, he moved to Gulfport where he formed a law partnership with the Honorable J. L. Taylor, also at one time a Mississippi judge. Later he was as\u00ad sociated with the late George P. Money, a son of a former U.S. Senator, Hon. H. D. Money, and the Honorable Lee Guice, a most able attorney who is presently still practicing law at Biloxi, Miss. Likewise, Judge Graham served as dis\u00ad trict attorney of the Second Judicial Dis\u00ad trict and was elected circuit judge of the same district in 1917, a position which he held with dignity and ability. In 1925 he resigned from the bench and for several years practiced law as a private prac\u00ad titioner with one of the outstanding law firms on the Mississippi gulf coast, Ford, White, Graham & Gautier. Thereafter, Judge Graham was ap\u00ad pointed by the late Judge Sidney Mize February 24, 1969 as U.S. Commissioner for a period of 12 years. Ever mindful of his civic responsi\u00ad bilities and dedicated to our system, he served for 6 years as president of the Gulfport city school system. In his ca\u00ad pacity as an activist in the matter of civil a:ff airs and out of a love for his fellow man, he was active in sponsoring and promoting the King's Daughters Hospital in Gulfport. In the interest of his State, he published an article on the early State constitutions which was delivered before the Mississippi State Bar Associa\u00ad tion, and subsequently, placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD where it received wider distribution. Judge Graham was truly one of God's noblemen. He lived by the side of the road and was a friend of man. He was one of the most genteel men whom it has ever been my privilege to know. He was as gentle and refined in his dealings with the members of the bar and his fellow man as a refined and cultured lady. His life enriched those with whom he came in contact. This truly great man is survived by Desmond M., Jr., with whom he practiced law the later years of his active life, Mrs. Zaidee Graham Bellion, and Olen E. Graham, his sons and daughter, not to mention thousands of people who had the privilege of knowing and honoring him. VOICE OF DEMOCRACY CONTEST WINNER HON. DAVE MARTIN OF NEBRASKA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MARTIN. Mr. Speaker, I deem it an honor to be able to put in the RECORD the winning speech in the Voice of De\u00ad mocracy Contest sponsored by the VFW and its ladies auxiliary from the State of Nebraska. The young man who was awarded first place in this competition is Mr. Richard K. Books, who lives at 405 West First Street, North Platte, Nebr. I commend his speech to the Members for their seri\u00ad ous reading. This is a great tribute to our young people who have the insight to realize the fortune which all of us in this coun\u00ad try have in living in a great Republic. I submit Mr. Books' speech, as follows: (By Richard Books} \"Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.\" Those words, by Harry Emerson Fosdick, a contemporary American writer, outline the basic concept of any free society, but especially America. In no other society than the American Re\u00ad public does the citizen have the ultimate choice as well as the ultimate responsibility. For instance, the American people are given the right to vote, but at the same time, they must accept the responsibilities that go along with self-government. Hand in hand with this principle is an\u00ad other one--that along with each liberty there goes an obligation, with each right a respon\u00ad sibility, and with each freedom a challenge to uphold that freedom so that it will not die. Recently in one of our larger cities, Vice\u00ad President Humphrey was harrassed by some EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS opponents to the point that he was unable to continue. Addressing them he said, \"You say you believe in free speech. To truly be\u00ad lieve in the freedom of speech, you must be\u00ad lieve in it not only for yourself, but for others.\" In other words, we must protect the freedoms of America, not only for the poli\u00ad tician, but the demonstrator, not only for the oftlcial, but the common citizen as well. The American democracy is based upon the ideal that the ordinary citizen is intelligent enough, alert enough, and ambitious enough to govern himself. The first challenge of freedom ls that of educating ourselves. Because our form of government is based upon the acceptance of responsibility by its citizens, we must edu\u00ad cate ourselves in order that we can make a coherent decision instead of blindly fol\u00ad lowing the pathway of others and going along with the crowd. The second challenge of a free society is that its citizens be constantly alert to the pollcies and operations of their government. We, as American citizens, must make sure that the principles of a representative de\u00ad mocracy are not distorted, and that America stands for Americans. Without this vigilance, our free government will collapse. In the words of James Madison, \"Apathy is the pathway to oblivion.\" The third, and final, challenge of freedom is that we be ambitious in taking part in our government. Quite often we have a tend\u00ad ency to let someone else take on our burden since \"one vote won't make a difference any\u00ad way.'' But one vote does make a difference. John Qincy Adams, our sixth President, was elected by Henry Clay's tie-breaking one vote, and Andrew Johnson, our seventeenth Presi\u00ad dent, was saved from impeachment by a sin\u00ad gle vote cast in his favor. Since the begin\u00ad ning of time, the role of one person has made the difference. We have seen th.at if we wish to retain and build upon the American democracy, we must bring out extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people. We must bring out the qual\u00ad ities of, first, inte111gence, second alertness, and third, ambition. If we bring out intelli\u00ad gence, alertness, and ambition in the or\u00ad dinary American citizen, we will have at\u00ad tained our highest goal; we will have met freedom's challenge. CLEVELAND'S RAPID TRANSIT Affi\u00ad PORT RAIL LINE BEGINS FULL OPERATIONS HON. J. J. PICKLE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. PICKLE. Mr. Speaker, in other parts of the country there have been many tests and experiments concerning improved methods of ground transporta\u00ad tion to major airports. One such program led to the sweeping and successful new system in Cleveland, connecting the downtown area with Hopkins International Airport, 11 miles away. I have often said that a similar proj\u00ad ect should be given serious considera\u00ad tion in connection with Washington's Dulles International Airport, and I am hopeful that the developing success of the Cleveland project might lead to this. At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert in the RECORD an article which appeared in the February 1969, edition of the Airport Services Manage\u00ad ment magazine: 4225 PEOPLE MOVING: CLEVELAND'S RAIL LINE BEGINS FuLL OPER\u00ad ATIONS Early reports on operations of the much heralded Cleveland Airport Rapid Transit line indicate that the new system is draw\u00ad ing enough passengers to worry taxi drivers. Especially popular with businessmen, who find they can leave their offices with hand luggage and be at the terminal counter in 30 minutes, the new system is being watched for continued patronage by many large city airport men. Although airlines will not comment on the number of their passengers who are using the system, it is known that there are fre\u00ad quent complaints because there are more passengers than baggage handlers available. Some patronage is also being enjoyed from airport employees who find the rail line a convenient way to get to their jobs on the airport. TRAVELS 11 MILES IN 20 MINUTES Using special new stainless steel cars called \"Airporters,\" the run from Hopkins Inter\u00ad national Airport to Union Terminal in down\u00ad town Cleveland has a scheduled time of 20 minutes for the eleven miles. This includes stops at eight intermediate stations. The first cars in the nation designed spe\u00ad cifically for an airport-to-downtown route, the new Airporters were built by Pullman\u00ad Standard for the Cleveland Transit System (CTS). They incorporate several unique fea\u00ad tures: For example, the 70-foot-long Air\u00ad porters are 21'6\" longer than the existing 48'6\" CTS cars. Consequently, twenty cars are able to do the work of thirty older cars and do it without any reduction in seating capacity. Conventional CTS cars seat 52 pas\u00ad sengers while the new cars accommodate 80 passengers each. The reduction in cars per train will also reduce maintenance below that normally expected with new equipment. MAINTENANCE SAVINGS CTS anticipates long-term savings in main\u00ad tenance because the cars are sheathed in stainless steel. Supplied by Cleveland-based Republic Steel Corporation, stainless was se\u00ad lected for the roof and sides of the cars, interior trim, seat back and hand rails, sub\u00ad flooring underframes and cross-members be\u00ad cause of its corrosion resistance, ease of maintenance, and high strength-to-weight ratio that permits lighter-weight cars which cost less to operate. Other benefits provided by the new cars in\u00ad clude faster acceleration and high top speed that reduce running time, with attendant savings in crew cost. The new jumbo Air\u00ad porters are powered by four G.E. 100-horse\u00ad power motors as compared with 55-horse\u00ad power motors on the older cars. Top speed ls 60 mph and average speed ls 34 mph. Cleveland ls .. the first U.S. city to request and qualify for Federal funds for an airport\u00ad to-downtown rapid-rail system, and it has now joined two other cities-Brussels and Tokyo-as the only cities in the world having such facilities. An added advantage to Cleve\u00ad lands's airport extension project, financed by a % Department of Housing and Urban De\u00ad velopment grant matohed by a Y:J City\u00ad County funds, ls that it connects with other CTS city-county ran commuter stations. THE 51ST ANNIVERSARY OF ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE HON. EDWARD J. PATTEN OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. PA'ITEN. Mr. Speaker, February 24, 1969, should be one of pride in Estonia 4226 for it marks the 51st anniversary of in\u00ad dependence for that nation. This cele\u00ad bration has been marred since 1940, how\u00ad ever, when troops of the Soviet Union be\u00ad gan their occupation of Estonia. They have yet to leave. As a nation founded on the struggle for independence, America, perhaps more than any other nation, knows full well the importance of this fight. To speak out on issues, to worship as you please, to better yourself economically and educationally, to travel where you want, to shop with a choice of goods and prices-these are the rewards of in\u00ad dependence. As a nation founded on the struggle for independence, America has taken in those who have been denied their free\u00ad dom. After the occupation of Estonia and her neighbors, many of her citizens came to America to find the freedom they had lost. We have been the beneficiary of their exodus. The gain of these industri\u00ad ous, skilled, and enthusiastic freedom fighters has not only added to the ma\u00ad terial wealth of our Nation, but it has made us aware once again of our herit\u00ad age-a heritage of freedom we had be\u00ad gun to take for granted. As a nation founded on the struggle for independence, America cannot re\u00ad main content while others still must fight to reach this goal. It is right that our fell ow Americans of Estonian descent should want to see their homeland free of aggression. On the occasion of this 5 lst anniversary let us once again pledge ourselves to aid all who likewise would be free. FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE HON. WALTER S. BARING OF NEVADA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BARING. Mr. Speaker, some 400,- 000 school students in the United States have just completed writing speeches on the theme, \"Freedom's Challenge.\" This nationwide effort of free thought w~ prompted by the annual Veterans of For\u00ad eign Wars of the United States and the Ladies Auxiliary \"Voice of Democracy Contest.\" The winner in each State will come to Washington for the final judging of the best speech and I will be honored to have Mr. Frank Patten, of Reno, here in March as the winning contestant from Nevada. Mr. Patten's speech in Nevada was the one chosen that best explained what is \"Freedom's Challenge\"; those rights which must be earned and used. With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I include Frank Patten's speech in the RECORD: FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE If we are fortuna.te enough to be born in a democracy such as ours, we receive the won\u00ad derful gift of freedom. A gift that allows us to think what we want to think; to say what we want to say; and do wha.t we want to do. But these rights must be earned and used\u00ad this is freedom's challenge. We are given the right to say what we want, but freedom challenges us to think. In a country where freedom does not exist, the people do not receive the opportunity to think. Freedom encourages thought. We a.re EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS challenged to expand the scope of thought and the mind; to think of new ideas; and to improve the world of literature, music, art, and other humanities. We are given the right to dissent, but free\u00ad dom challenges us to improve democracy. The greatest aspect of freedom is that it lends itself to change. Freedom depends on self-correction and expansion. We are given the right to travel and learn, but freedom challenges us to explore new worlds. Freedom allows us to learn anything, but it challenges us to put this knowledge to practical use. Freedom allows us to travel anywhere, but it challenges us to use these experiences to improve relations between peoples and countries. We are given the right to live as we want, but freedom challenges us to improve the lives of our people. In the communist coun\u00ad tries, the emphasis is not placed on comfort but on cold efficiency. People who still live in bombed-out apartments in East Berlin can testify to this. Freedom challenges us to improve our lives and make them more com\u00ad fortable and fulfilling . We are given the right to vote for our leaders, but freedom challenges us to take part in government. One of the greatest problems facing our freedom today is public apathy. Americans are given a chance to take part in government, but most Americans could care less. Freedom and self-government depend on citizens who are willing to take an active part. Freedom challenges us to work within our democracy. We receive the right to be equal, but free\u00ad dom challenges us to make all men equal. Freedom is color-blind, multi-lingual, ageless and a mixture of many races. It is easy to say we are a.ll equal, but its better to add as George Orwell did \"Some are more equal than others\". Freedom challenges us to re\u00ad move the boundaries of race, creed, and color. We receive the right to live freely, but freedom challenges us to preserve and fight for our freedom. The basic concept of com\u00ad munism ls world revolution and the death of freedom. Some people say its all right to turn our back on the slaughter of freedom in some far-off country. Some people think that the preachers of bigotry, racism, and prejudice are nothing to worry about. Some people think freedom is dead. But we are chai.lenged to fig::it for our freedom and the freedom of other people. Freedom challenges us to dispose of extremism. Freedom chal\u00ad lenges every single one of us to take it into our hearts to love, protect, and support our country . Too bad our flag doesn't \"turn-on\" as many people a.s drugs do. Too bad so many people think that if we leave the com\u00ad munists alone they'll leave our freedom alone; they should talk to the man-on-the\u00ad street in Prague, East Berlin, Warsaw, Guate\u00ad mala City, Luang Prabang, Seoul, or Saigon. Too bad so many people think extremism can be tolerated; Martin Luther King didn't. Too ba.d so many people think we can let crime and guns run rampant; ask Ethel Kennedy about that. Our freedom is a God-given gift. It allows us to live our lives as we please. But if we do not meet and accept freedom's challenge, we may lose our precious gift of freedom. THE 51ST ANNIVERSARY OF ESTO\u00ad NIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. EDWARD J. DERWINSKI OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, today, February 24, marks the 51st Anniversary of Estonian Independence Day. Unfortu-Februa'ry 24, 1969 nately, the brave people of Estonia are now among the captive peoples of com\u00ad munism and this great day in their his\u00ad tory cannot be celebrated in their home\u00ad land because of the tyranny of their Red rulers. The Estonians proclaimed their inde\u00ad pendence in 1918 after the tsarist gov\u00ad ernment fell and enjoyed a period of freedom and progress until 1940, when their country fell to the Russian Com\u00ad munist forces. We must not only commemorate his\u00ad toric national days such as Estonian Independence Day, Mr. Speaker, but we must also take practical steps to indicate our interest in the restoration of freedom to the captive peoples of communism. One such practical move would be the establishment of a Special House Com\u00ad mittee on Captive Nations, an action which I have repeatedly urged the House to take. Mr. Speaker, we must rededicate our\u00ad selves on this great historic day for the Estonians to continue efforts to see that freedom is restored to these proud people and all the other captives of communism. BEEKEEPING AND AGRICULTURE HON. HAROLD T. JOHNSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. JOHNSON of California. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ward Stranger, extension apiarist, University of California, has recently issued a release covering im\u00ad portant Points for beekeeping and agri\u00ad culture. I would like to share this in\u00ad teresting and important information with you at this time: BEEKEEPING AND AGRICULTURE Honey bees a.re necessary for the com\u00ad mercial production of $300 mllllon worth of food crops for man and animals . More than 400,000 colonies of bees (hives) are required annually for pollination of crops such as: fruit and nuts, forage seed crops, vegetable crops, and vegetable seed crops. Honey bees are exposed to a great variety of pesticides more frequently than any other agricultural plant or animal. They are unique in that their foraging area cannot be controlled by man. Bees forage freely, and they are exposed to pesticides up to three miles from the hive. Approximately 19% (76,000 colonies) of California's bees used for pollination were killed by pesticides in 1967. This is more than twice the kill reported in 1963. In addition, hives of bees are damaged to such an extent that they are no longer productive or effective pollinators; this type of economic loss prob\u00ad ably greatly exceeds the loss from colonies that are killed outright. The Departments of Entomology and the Agricultural Extension Service propose an emergency research and Extension program related to the effects of pesticides on the sur\u00ad vival of honey bees and their effectiveness as pollinators. The proposed research includes programs in pollination ecology, bee biology and activities, genetics of resistance of bees to pesticides, nutrition , and \"feedlots\", bee sanctuaries, pesticide residue analyses, and economics of the beekeeping industry. THE PROBLEM: PESTICIDE EFFECTS ON THE CALIFORNIA BEEKEEPING INDUSTRY The single most \u00b7impol\"ta.nrt ila.ctor in the loss of bees for po1liln'81tion ls .the loss caused February 24, 1969 by pesticides. The supply of bees is becom\u00ad ing critically limited for pollination. In re\u00ad cent years, the growers have not been able to obtain sufficient bees to pollinate almonds. This crop is especially vulnerable when honey bees are lost or damaged by pesticides the previous season. It is difficult to impossible for the beekeeper to buildup colony popula\u00ad tions by almond blossom time when they have been excessively reduced in the late summer and fall months of the previous sea\u00ad son. It is estimated that the damage to sur\u00ad viving colonies probably far exceeds the eco\u00ad nomic value of colonies that are killed. There\u00ad fore, the shortage produced by pesticide damage is felt most in almonds. Projected acreage for almonds in California indicates that there will be a need for 300,000 to 400,- 000 hives for almonds alone by 1970. Losses to pesticid.e damage have resulted In movement of bee hives to other parts of the state, as well as out of the state. This has reduced the supply of bees for pollination. New beekeepers are discouraged from en\u00ad tering a business with a high rate of loss of the producing unit, the honey bee colony. While it is clear that these pesticide prob\u00ad lems are serious and new ones are being created by changing agricultural conditions in California, it is equally apparent that no single approach or procedure for protecting honey bees is sufficient. An intense research effort should be made. The problem is be\u00ad yond the present :financial capacities of the University of California Departments of En\u00ad tomology and the Agricultural Extension Service. Additional staff and facilities are needed to do this work. The research committee offers to submit an annual progress report to the industry and at the end of the three-year period, the research accomplished will be reviewed. MAJOR AREAS OF RESEARCH I. Pollination ecology Because of their food foraging activities, honey bees are exposed to pesticides applied to many crops in addition to those crops which require bees for pollination. How can we reduce this type of exposure when it is not feasible to fence bees into a. crop. We can attempt to manipulate the ecology (for\u00ad aging activities and food preferences) of the pollinators so that they will behave as if they are \"fenced in\", that is, force them to specialize on the crops we wish to pollinate. The most promising ways to accomplish this specialization are: 1) obtain new knowl\u00ad edge of the function of odors in foraging and use this knowledge to direct the activi\u00ad ties of bees; 2) select genetic strains of honey bees exhibiting food preferences; 3) use specialized pollinating insects other than honey bees for specific crops. The foraging population of a colony is a composite of committed foragers who have learned the location of particular crops and of uncommitted recruits. Committed for\u00ad agers stimulate recruits to search for spe\u00ad cific crops. The odor of the crop plays an im\u00ad portant part in the message received and utilized by the bees being recruited. Research is needed to determine the possibilities of utilizing odors to direct bees to desired crops or repel them from areas or during periods of high pesticide hazard. The development of these or other possible means of manipulat\u00ad ing foraging activities would provide ex\u00ad tremely valuable tools for reducing potential detrimental effects of pesticides on honey bees. The United States Department of Agricul\u00ad ture has recently established the feasibility of selecting and breeding for a food pref\u00ad erence in honey bees. Further research needs to be conducted on the nature of food pref\u00ad erences in the honey bee. As a by-product of this study, certain strains exhibiting food preferences would be selected for a breeding program, and the resulting inbred and hy\u00ad brid strains would be evaluated. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS There are many pollinating insects other than the honey bee which are highly special\u00ad ized for food gathering and pollination of specific plants. These usually exhibit struc\u00ad tural and ecological specializations to their food plants; therefore, although they must be protected from pesticides, these specialized pollinators usually are not exposed to pesti\u00ad cides applied to other crops. Some of these also have characteristics which will allow them to be managed and manipulated on a commercial scale (e.g. alfalfa leaf-cutting bees, alkali bees, and bumble bees) . Research is needed to determine which poll1nators ex\u00ad hibit preferences for certain crops, to evaluate their pollination efficiency, and to develop techniques for their commercial management. An alternative to the protection of honey bees from pesticides would be to consider the pollinating unit as expendable. This would involve studies on the development and management of expendable units and com\u00ad parisons on the pollination efficiency of such units with standard hives of bees. The ulti\u00ad mate feasibiUty of this practice would depend on the abiUty of beekeepers to produce large quantities of package bees and queens in sanctuaries or feedlots. 11. Effect of pesticides on the biology and activity of honey bees Applied research on the relative toxicity of pesticides has been conducted a.t the Uni\u00ad versity of California, Riverside, for 15 years. Applied field research on protection of honey bees from pesticides should be expanded and accelerated to test the backlog of pesticides and pesticide combinations currently used commercially, The new ultra low volume (ULV) and low volume (LV) spray techniques developed in recent years have not been field tested sufficiently for their possible difierent effects on bees. Research on these spray tech\u00ad niques should be increased since they have been shown to cause higher and longer residual kills of bees than conventional sprays. \u00b7 Research is needed to develop techniques for rapid evaluation of colonies. Studies of normal bee foraging patterns on various crops will be accelerated to provide a basis for assessing the abnormal activity pat\u00ad terns of bee foragers following a pesticide application. By determining the temporal patterns of visitation, pesticide applications can be applied at the time that would be least hazardous to bees. Research is proposed on the effects of pesti\u00ad cides on the foraging activities of colonies. The reduction in foraging activity could be caused by repellant action of the pesticide and/or changes in the physiology of the nec\u00ad tar or pollen-producing plants, thus reducing the attraction of the plants. Repeated ap\u00ad plications of pesticides within the foraging range of hives may lead to chronic physiologi\u00ad cal injury to bees in which bee mortality may not be significant. For example, ex\u00ad tremely subtle effects, such as 20 % reduction in the longevity of foraging bees, will be seri\u00ad ous to pollination potential and honey pro\u00ad duction, yet pesticides may be overlooked a.s the cause. The objective of the proposed re\u00ad search is to develop techniques whereby the quantities of toxicant introduced into field colonies can be accurately determined and the effects on foraging activity evaluated. In addition the effect of pesticide residues in honey comb in bee colonies should be in\u00ad vestigated. Many organic pesticides are solu\u00ad ble to various degrees in beeswax. There is a possibility that pesticides gradually accumu\u00ad late in honey comb primarily as a result of absorption from stored pollen and from con\u00ad tamination by drift of pesticides under field conditions. Small doses may cause chronic poisoning of bees. Under stress conditlons\u00ad during winter months, under prolonged periods of bad weather, etc.-sublethal pesti\u00ad cide poisoning may be a significant faictor. The objective of this research would be to 4227 determine possible effects of pesticides as a contaminant in honey comb colonies. Feeding behavior of bees on pesticide con\u00ad taminated foods is suggested as another line of research. Pesticide contamination in nec\u00ad tar can reach a concentration which causes bees to cease feeding. The sensitivity of different lines of bees probably varies con\u00ad siderably and may be subject to regulation by controlled breeding. The acceptance or rejection of contaminated food also is a fun\u00ad damental aspect. of any pesticide study in which bees may be feeding on regulated doses of pesticides. The objective of this re\u00ad search would be to determine the levels of acceptance or rejection of bees under various conditions for pesticides that are adminis\u00ad tered in a. variety of food media. 111. Genetics of resistance of bees to pesticides It has been demonstrated that honey bees vary greatly in characters of economic im\u00ad portance, including the relative amounts of pollen gathered and stored in the hive and in resistance to poisons. Current experiments by the United States Department of Agricul\u00ad ture strongly indicate that bees can be selected and bred to prefer pollen from a par\u00ad ticular kind of plant, thus increasing their utility for pollinating specific crops. It is believed bees can also be bred for in\u00ad creased resistance to insecticides. Drones are genetically gametes of their mother and can be reared in large numbers. By treating drones with the insecticides most commonly used (perhaps by classes of insecticides) and using the surviving drones as sires, intensive selection can be accomplished. Virgin queens can be similarly treated. By repeated mating of surviving drones to surviving queens, in\u00ad secticide resistance should be increased. IV. Nutrition and feed lots Despite intensive research efforts to de\u00ad velop measures to prevent bee poisoning, it seems certain that very substantial losses will continue to occur in the future. The pesticide problem could be minimized con\u00ad siderably by the development of an econom\u00ad ical, dependable, food source, containing all necessary bee nutrients, that could be fed to bees in a feed lot management system. More continuity of food supply would give the bee industry the kind of stab111ty now present in the livestock and poultry industries. A feed lot management system for the la.rge scale production of bees would (a) help compensate for bees that are killed by insecticides, (b) provide bees to start \"ex\u00ad pendable hives\" to be used where pesticide risks are high, and (c) provide greater bee populations in each hive to enhance the ability of colonies to tolerate pesticide losses. V. Bee sanctuaries Using areas where good native honey and pollen plants are found as places where bees can be pastured when pesticide hazards are greatest in agricultural areas has been done in states north of California. The hazards of pesticides extend over a short period of the season. Providing sanc\u00ad tuaries would establish a location to move the bees away from pesticide hazards. These areas could be used to buildup colonies dam\u00ad aged by pesticides. An ecological study needs to be conducted preparatory to setting aside areas as sanc\u00ad tuaries. The ecological study would include surveying the areas for honey plants already present and preparing maps to show the distribution of these plants in each area. Based on this information, the advisability of planting honey plants could be deter\u00ad mined, as well as the number of colonies of bees which could be supported in specific areas. It is our suggestion tha.t the development of such areas be investigated in California in cooperation with forestry and wildlife authorities. 4228 VI. Pesticide residue analyses There 1s little or no information on the metabolic and nonmetabolic fate of pesti\u00ad cides once they reach the hive. It is in the hive where the bees convert or manufacture their collected products from the environ\u00ad ment and produce honey, bee bread, and beeswax. These products are then stored. In this factory or manufacturing process, there exists many different types of biological and chemical activity capable of degrading such chemicals as pesticides to even more toxic substances. It is a well-known fact that many of the organophosphorus pesticides can be converted to chemicals many times more toxic than the parent pesticide once they are subjected to metabolic and non\u00ad metabolic processes. In honey alone, there exists an oxidizing agent in great abundance which because of its antibacterial principle 1s commonly called \"inhibine.\" The anti\u00ad bacterial activity of this material is directly associated to the hydrogen peroxide accu\u00ad mulation in the honey which is brought about by the action of glucose oxide. The amount of hydrogen peroxide present in honey will depend not only on the rate of production of peroxide, which is a function of enzyme activity, but in addition wlll be affected by the rate of destruction of per\u00ad oxide by components present. In some honey over 300 micrograms hydrogen peroxide ac\u00ad cumulates per gram of honey in one hour under assay conditions. It is oxidizing agents such as this which could possibly convert some of the phospho\u00ad rothioate and phosphorodithioate pesticides to their respective phosphate derivatives which in turn are more toxic than their parent compounds. Beoause of this factor, as well as many others, present in bees and bee products which contribute to metabolic and nonmeta\u00ad bolic degradation of organophosphate pes\u00ad ticides, it ls the primary aims of this project to 1) try to discover if organophosphate pesticides are degraded, to what they are de\u00ad graded, and to what extent they are degraded in bee products, 2) to see where these pes\u00ad ticides and their respective metabolic and nonmetabolic products accumulate in the bee colony and to study their persistence in their respect! ve medium, 3) to see if the main cause of degradation is attributed to meta\u00ad bolic or nonmetabolic action in the bee colony, and 4) oorrelate presence of pesticide or pesticide product with toxicity and hive mortality. VII. Economics of beekeeping During the last two years, some beekeepers have begun to feed bees supplemental foods to overcome pesticide damage. Such feeding has resulted in increased populations in colonies of bees damaged by pesticides in the late summer or fall thus the bees go into the winter cluster with higher populations and in better condition. We expect that these colonies will prove to be stronger and more efficient polllnator units. The preliminary work has been done in the last two years by University of California research and Agricul\u00ad tural Extension personnel. More work needs to be done to determine more precisely the amounts to be fed, times to feed, and the eocnomic feasibility. Some crops are extremely productive for bee food, yet involve serious pesticide risk. The economic feasibility of beekeepers mov\u00ad ing in and out of such an area needs to be studied. For example, cotton is considered one of the ten leading sources of honey. On the other hand, cotton is an area of high pesticide hazard. To accurately appraise the extent of loss to the beekeeping industry in California through pesticide damage, an extensive eco\u00ad nomic study should be conducted. From such an economic study, we would expect to ob\u00ad tain indications of changes in management practices that would protect the honey bees and also reduce costs to the beekeeper. This, EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS in turn, would reduce costs for poll1nation services to the grower. It is estimated tha.t the damage to surviving colonies probably far exceeds the economic value of oolonies that are killed. There are no concrete figures or economic facts to judge the extent of the replacement and the repair costs due to dam\u00ad aged colonies nor the extent of the loss to the agricultural industry served by the bees. Honey bees aid in production.-To empha\u00ad size the importance of honey bees to agricul\u00ad tural production, the following three pages are reproduced from One Sheet Answer 188 entitled \"Honey Bees-Agricultural's Tool\" by Ward Stanger. HONEY BEES AID IN PRODUCTION Honey bees are used to pollinate crops in California worth $300 million. California ranks first in the United States in the pro\u00ad duction of 44 crops. Honey bees are the agri\u00ad cultural tool needed to produce 10 of these crops: California's shatre of U.S. production 1 ------------------- 34.6 Beeswax --------------------------2 9.4 Honey ---------------------------2 8.6 1 From State Department of Agriculture Crop and Livestock Reporting Service. 2 Honey Market News, USDA. California produces 50 to 100 percent of the vegetable seed crops of the nation. These crops need honey bees for poll1nation.

THE BEEKEEPING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA California leads all other states in the three enterprises of the beekeeping indus\u00ad try: queen and packaged bee production, pollination service, and honey and beeswax production. Queens and packaged bees are produced primarily in the Sacramento River Valley. Each year about 400,000 queens are shipped to beekeepers in Oanada and the northern U.S. west of the Mississippi River. It 1s esti\u00ad maited that 300 tons of packaged honey bees are shipped each year. Queens and packaged bees are a million dollar industry. Half the colonies of honey bees in Califor\u00ad nia are rented for pollination of crops. These 300,000 colonies are a critical agricultural tool in poll1nation. Table at bottom of page lists crops that depend on honey bees. None of these wlll produce a profitable crop without honey bees. Approximately $3,000,- 000 are paid for rental of colonies for polli\u00ad nation. In 1966, 21,242,000 pounds of honey were produced in Oallfornia-8.6% of the nation's crop. California leads the nation in beeswax production-9.4% of the national crop.a California's beekeeping industry produced \u00b7an estimated income of $9,000,000 in 1966. a Honey Market News, USDA. February 24, 1969 Approximately $15,000,000 are invested in beekeeping in Oalifornia.

THE CHALLENGE OF FREEDOM HON. WILLIAM D. HATHAWAY OF MAINE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. HATHAWAY. Mr. Speaker. each year the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its ladies auxiliary conducts a Voice of Democracy contest. The winner this year from the State of Maine is Miss Evelyn Miller, of Lewis\u00ad ton. Miss Miller will compete next week with the winners from the other States. I am proud to present Miss Miller's winning speech to my colleagues. The speech follows: THE CHALLENGE OF FREEDOM (By Evelyn Miller) I am as old as ancient Greece, yet, I am not withered, but stately, like a graceful ship. I came to this land with the very first boat\u00ad load of settlers, but was kept hidden in gar\u00ad rets and cellars, taken out only weekly to watch the men train on the village green. Since 1775, however, I have been allowed to roam this country, giving my gifts of free speech, free press, free religion, and civil llb\u00ad erty to all those I meet, and I meet all. What do I look like? I am big and all em\u00ad bracing. :M:y eyes are shrewd, they see all, yet they are kind. :M:y voice is deep, like the toll\u00ad ing of an old iron bell. I am a difficult woman, sometimes a bur\u00ad den, for it is up to you, the people of Amer\u00ad ica, to care for me, and to protect me, for 1f you neglect me, I may leave. 1 These are unable to produce a commer\u00ad cial crop without cross-pollination. 2 These generally produce a larger crop when honey bee pollinated. February 24, 1969 You have kept me well in the past, but there have been times when I considered going. In the years after the founding of our country, my heart cried out for my black brothers and sisters who were bent under the lash of oppression and slavery. But I am patient, so I stayed and saw one of my great\u00ad est champions free these tortured souls. Yes, I stayed to whisper to soldiers dressed in blue--to whisper words that made them fight more bravely and harder. They fought for me, and they won that war for me. Again I was wounded, by the sight of small children working in sweat shops and mothers struggling to find some food with which to feed those children; but as I hoped, prayed, and expected, those children were put back 1n school and bread was given them and their mothers. Again I was not betrayed. Even in these recent times, I have thrown my hands up in despair and cried out in angulsh- At the sight of lynched bodies lying in a ditch, the si~ht of bombed churches, the sight of rats running over small children sleeping in unheated slums. And when I smell the odour of the newly 1urned earth of the graves of some of our greatest men, shot d\u00b7own without mercy, blood drips from my heart. Tears have flowed from my eyes from the tear gas and mace sprayed into them. Yes, you have misused me, you have wounded me and pushed me out, ignoring my cries for compassion. But you have done this in the past and always, just in time, you have rushed to me and bound up my wounds and nourished me until I am healthy, healthy enough to again distribute my precious gifts. In light of this, I shall give you one more chance. People of America-look around you and see the swords that pierce me and draw them out; see the fire that consumes my soul and extinguish it--soothe my pain, I implore you-before I seek help elsewhere, or die. People of America-I challenge you. KANSAS STATE TO STUDY PETRO\u00ad PROTEINS HON. CHESTER L. MIZE OF KANSAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MIZE. Mr. Speaker, those who have committed themselves to the goal of eliminating hunger and malnutrition in the world community have two areas of primary concern: adequate food pro\u00ad duction and efficient food distribution. Failure to accomplish one or the other of these objectives has resulted in widely scattered pockets of extreme want since time immemorial. Today, man has the opportunity to successfully eradicate hunger, for his technology in this area is limited only by his commitment to the cause. With dedicated effort, scientists and managers can meet the demands of perhaps 7 bil\u00ad Uon persons by the tum of the century\u00ad only 31 years hence. Now we know that hunger is not con\u00ad fined to the developing nations. Studies conducted within the past 2 years have convinced even the most skeptical that nutritional deficiencies seriously deplete human resources in our own country. The administration is committed to an attack on this problem, and I am confi\u00ad dent the Congress will cooperate fully with the President in this effort. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Mr. Speaker, behind the official con\u00ad cern, behind the success of food for peace abroad, behind America 's unparalleled agricultural Potential works an unex\u00ad celled team of scientists and research personnel. Their base of operations lies within the academic community, to a large ex\u00ad tent. Our hopes for victory over hunger rest largely upon their continued high level performance. An imaginative study of petro-protein is being considered by Kansas State Uni\u00ad versity, long a leader in food technology. The February 11 issue of the Southwest\u00ad ern Miller highlighted this project, and because of widespread congressional in\u00ad terest, I include the article in the RECORD at this point: PETRO-PROTEINS IN KANSAS From Kansas State University has come an announcement that provides further dra\u00ad matic evidence of the need for recognition by wheat and wheat products executives of rapid changes in technology that could exert a lasting effect on their industry. The uni\u00ad versity, long considered the premier academic center in instruction and research in the en\u00ad tire breadstuffs field, has disclosed that it hopes to initiate a research project to find ways of producing food and feed proteins from petroleum. The study will concentrate on developing a method by which the state's crude oil and natural gas resources, which are comparable with the wheat and wheat processing industries as economic contribu\u00ad tors, could be utillzed to help solve world food problems. One researcher ls quoted as stating that the microbial production of single cell proteins from hydrocarbons of oil and natural gas affords Kar-'3.s the chance to create a new industry. The initiation at Kansas State University of such a project reflect.a welcome awareness by the university staff of advances being made around the world in production of so-called petro-proteins. At the same time, the project must stand as a startling reminder that wheat protein is not sacrosanct as a source of food protein. As matters now stand, the project is largely in the conceptual stage, awaiting approval and funding by the state legislature. Initia\u00ad tion of the project arose from a resolution that was introduced, but not passed, in the Kansas House of Representatives last year. If approved, the project will be carried out by the university's Department of Chemical Engineering, but the Food and Feed Grains Institute will be called upon for collabora\u00ad tion in determining acceptability of petro\u00ad protein as food or feed supplement. Certainly, particular significance should be attributed to the proposed project's loca\u00ad tion on the campus of Kansas State. Impos\u00ad ing credentials for potential accomplish\u00ad ment are readily apparent. With a century of agricultural research experience, with vast food and feed expertise developed in connec\u00ad tion with serving the nation's wheat growing heartland for many decades, with the exce!-; lent record of experience in foreign technical assistance programs and with the unique in\u00ad stitute of Food and Feed Grains resident on campus, resources of considerable authority are available. Brought to bear on petro\u00ad protein, particularly as regards marketing and practical application, these resources should readily contribute to the characteriza\u00ad tion of Kansas State as world headquarters for food and feed knowledge. Corroboration of the idea was inherent in comments made by the university president, Dr. James A. Mc\u00ad Cain, at the Senator Frank Carlson Sympo\u00ad sium on World Population and Food Supply held at the university in December. He said, \"The spectre of famine on a global scale 1s man's most serious problem today. Perhaps 4229 no other university is more deeply com\u00ad mitted to helping solve the world food prob\u00ad lem than Kansas State.\" Beyond the proposed project itself, the main inference that may be drawn is that, once again, affirmation is provided of the highly competitive arena in which wheat must be viewed. Coincidentally, Dr. John A. Shellenberger, distinguished professor in the Department of Grain Science and Industry at the university, recently commented on the possible substitution of other foods or syn\u00ad thetics for wheat. \"Changes are inevitable and are occurring constantly,\" Dr. Shellen\u00ad berger wrote, adding that \"I do hope that the entire wheat industry wm start looking ahead.\" The urgency for the wheat industry to \"look ahead,\" as expressed by Dr. Shellen\u00ad berger, this publication on numerous occa\u00ad sions and by others, is heightened by the an\u00ad nouncement from Kansas State University. In this context, \"looking ahead\" means an acceleration of research designed not only to strengthen the position of wheat foods as the most economical source of protein but also to search out new utilization horizons. - WILLIAM PASSMORE, OF EAST cm\u00ad CAGO, IND., HANDICAPPED AMER\u00ad ICAN FOR THE YEAR 1968 HON. RAY J. MADDEN OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MADDEN. Mr. Speaker, the Calu\u00ad met region of Indiana is indeed proud of the recognition our Nation is extending to Mr. William Passmore, of East Chi\u00ad cago, who has been selected as the \"Han\u00ad dicapped American of the Year for 1968.\" Mr. Passmore lost both his legs in an unfortunate accident during his high school days and has been confined to a wheelchair during his adult life. When he was 16 years old he was hospitalized for 11 months. Three years later he returned to have his legs amputated. Mayor John Nicosia, of East Chicago, recognizing his constant work for other handicapped cit\u00ad izens, appointed him as coordinator for the East Chicago Social and Economic Opportunities Committee. He has aided, and placed more than 100 handicapped and disadvantaged youth in suitable jobs in private industry and other areas. Mr. Speaker, with my remarks I in\u00ad clude a letter which I have received from Mr. Harold Russell, Chairman of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, wherein he states that Mr. William Passmore, of East Chicago, will be presented the President's Trophy at a ceremony in Washington on May 1. I include further a news release of Sun\u00ad day, February 23, announcing his recog\u00ad nition as a recipient of the President's Trophy. THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT OF THE HANDICAPPED, Washington, D.C., February 20, 1969. Hon. RAY J. MADDEN, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. MADDEN: It is with great pleasure that the President's Committee salutes In\u00ad diana, the home State of Mr. William Pass\u00ad more, of East Chicago, who has been selected as the Handicapped American of the Year for 1968. 4230 Mr. Passmore is a double amputee. Though confined to a wheelchair, he has fought back against seemingly impossible odds to make a record for himself as a community leader and an inspiration to the handicapped. Through his position as Work Coordinator for the East Chicago Mayor's Committee on Social and Economic Opportunity, Mr. Pass\u00ad more has opened many doors to employment for the handicapped and the disadvantaged so that these people may achieve economic independence and roles in community life. All of Indiana may take great pride in Mr. Passmore 's achievements because he is living proof that handicapped persons can earn their way and contribute to comm. -.1nity life. The President's Trophy, awarded annually by the President's Committee to the individ\u00ad ual chosen the Handicapped America .n of the Year, will be presented to Mr. Passmore at the Committee's Annual Meeting, Thursday morning, May 1 in the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C. Sincerely, HAROLD RUSSELL, Chairman. INDIANA AMPUTEE To RECEIVE PRESIDENT'S TROPHY A double amputee who has led the fight for jobs and equality for the disabled and disadvantaged of East Chicago, Indiana for the past 18 years, has been named \"Handi\u00ad capped American of 1968\" by the President's Committee on Employment of the Handi\u00ad capped. William Passmore, 39, chosen from among nominations from all parts of the country. will receive the award-known as the Presl4 dent's Trophy-at the Annual Meeting of the President's Committee at the Washington Hilton Hotel on May 1. President Nixon is expected to present the award-the Nation's highest tribute to the courage and determination of the physically and mentally handicapped. For the past two years, Passmore has been Work Coordinator for the East Chicago Mayor's Committee on Social and Economic Opportunity. He counsels , trains and places disadvantaged youth in the Neighborhood Youth Corps, and has recently helped over 100 of these young men and women to find permanent jobs in private industry. A football accident in 1945 cost Passmore his legs and left him confined to a wheel\u00ad chair. Knowing the loneliness of a hospital, he began, shortly after his own release, to visit patients at the East Chicago community hospital every Sunday afternoon. He con\u00ad tinues this practice and in 1967 received the hospital's \"Visitor of the Year\" tribute. He finished high school with the aid of tutors in 1951 and started work as a night dispatcher for the Red Top Cab Company. For 11 years, he worked the midnight shift and spent his days in volunteer work with the handicapped and disadvantaged. His knowledge of the community encour\u00ad aged him to start a weekly column for the Chicago Defender newspaper. For 18 years, his column \"East Chicago on the Go\" has been the voice of that community. In addition to his full-time job and volun\u00ad teer activities, Passmore is a part-time stu\u00ad dent at the local campus of the Indiana Uni\u00ad versity where he ls majoring in sociology and criminology. His interest in criminology stems from his experiences in the rehabilltation and job pro\u00ad grams at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. He helped to set up \"Convicts Anony\u00ad mous,\" a group therapy organization within the prison, and ls active in helping ex-con\u00ad victs ftnd jobs through \"Convicts Unlim\u00ad ited.\" In recognition of his strong ties with the community, the pollce last year sought his advice on how to handle what could have been a serious disturbance among East Chi\u00ad cago youth. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Some of Passmore's activities are: The Na\u00ad tional Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the Northern Indiana Po\u00ad litical Action Group; St. Mark's AME Zion Church; the East Chicago Junior Chamber of Commerce; and the Anselm Forum-an interracial, interreligious, and multiethnic group working towards better human rela\u00ad tions in the community. Last year's President's Trophy winner was Max Rheinberger, Jr., a businessman from Duluth, Minnesota. The President's Trophy is a sterling silver plaque mounted on a mahogany base. Made and donated by the students at the Insti\u00ad tute for the Crippled and Disabled in New York City, it bears the facsimile signature of the President of the United States. THE CATESBY ETCHINGS HON. JOEL T. BROYHILL OF VIRGINIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BROYHil..I.a of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the Virginia Museum in Rich\u00ad mond, Va., was the scene of a special program on Friday, February 21, featur\u00ad ing a film presentation of an excellent Colonial Williamsburg film, \"The Colo\u00ad nial Naturalist,\" the life of Mark Catesby, and introducing a private collection of 50 original, hand-colored etchings by the 18th-century naturalist, which will be exhibited at the museum through March 9. The Catesby etchings are owned by Dr. and Mrs. George B. Green, of Arlington, in my congressional district. They have been Virginia residents since 1954 when they returned to the United States fol\u00ad lowing 3 years in Paris, where Dr. Green was attached to the American Embassy. Dr. Green, a retired Air Force medical officer, is employed by the Food and Drug Administration, and Mrs. Green is active in a number of civic and cultural orga\u00ad nizations in northern Virginia. Mr. Speaker, Dr. and Mrs. Green, by making available for public display such a remarkable collection, are contributing to better understanding of the impor\u00ad tant work begun by Mark Catesby in Virginia over 250 years ago. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them and to commend the exhibit to all who may have the opportunity to view it during its all-too-brief display in Richmond. I insert at this point in the RECORD the full text of an article from the February 9 Richmond Times-Dispatch describing the Catesby collection, as well as a nota\u00ad tion in the Virginia Museum members' bulletin for February 1969, about the dis\u00ad play of the collection and the special program and reception on February 21, 1969: (From the Richmond (Va..) Times-Dispatch, Feb. 9, 1969] GATESBY ETCHINGS To BE SHOWN HEBE A private collection of original, hand-col\u00ad ored etchings by the 18th century naturalist, Mark Catesby, will be exhibited at the Vir\u00ad ginia Museum beginning Friday, and running through March 9. The 50 etchings are from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. George B. Green of Arling-February 24, 1969 ton, who over the years have become ex\u00ad perts on Catesby's life and his art. The exhibition, entitled \"Mark Catesby: Colonial Naturalist,'' will be on view in the Museum's Theater Gallery. The prints are from the three editions of Catesby's \"The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands: Contain\u00ad ing Figures of Birds, Beasts, Fishes, Ser\u00ad pents, Insects and Plants ... \" The first edition, when it appeared in 1731, represented the first comprehensive works on the natural history of North America. Names that Catesby placed on 75 different previously unknown species of both flora and fauna remain to the present day. A self-taught artist, the English horticul\u00ad turist made his first trip to North America in 1712, when he visited his sister in Wil\u00ad liamsburg. During his stay in colonial Amer\u00ad ica, he was encouraged in his studies of nature by two far-sighted Virginians, Col. William Byrd and John Custis. When he returned to England, his draw\u00ad ings, writings and specimens atracted spon\u00ad sors for the future publication of his work. With the support of these sponsors, he re\u00ad turned to Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands in 1724 to complete his studies and drawings from nature. \"Catesby,'' according to the Greens, \"learned to draw what he could not ade\u00ad quately describe with words. He found that bird 'feathering was more accurately por\u00ad trayed with the etcher's tool ... Prohibitive costs dictated that he etch his own plates, rather than hire engravers. \"Over 55 years of painstaking labor went into Oatesby's great life's work. He strived to depict the true colors of nature in all the seasonal changes . . . When he discovered that fish changed color if removed from water, he painted them swimming. \"He personally etohed the 220 copper plates bound in the two-volume, folio size work, and either hand-colored or personally supervised the coloring Of each of the nearly 34,000 sepa.\u00ad ra te impressions that ... were used in the 1731 edition.\" After Catesby died in 1749, his gOOd friend George Edwards took over and completed the second edition, in 1754, and a third edition appeared in 1771. Coloring in the later edi\u00ad tions, Mr. and Mrs. Green have noted, often was executed by colorists, including children, who were unfamilla.r with the actual sub\u00ad jects. \"In the opinions of the collectors,\" the Greens have written, \"Catesby's work has never been sufficiently or properly recognized far its great artistic contribution, as well as scientific and literary importance in Ameri\u00ad cana. \"This, and the known scarcity of Catesby's work, has deepened (our) determination to honor Catesby by making his work known, and to preserve the limited number of exam\u00ad ples that remain, through our own collecting and through encouraging museums and li\u00ad braries to collect, preserve and, where possi\u00ad ble, exhibit these fascinating examples of a remarkable self-taught artist.\" [From the Virginia Museum Members' Bulletin, February 1969] FLORA AND FAUNA Not until the eighteenth century was a comprehensive and serious study made of the flora and fauna of North America. The self\u00ad taught English artist who documented the birds, bees, insects, flowers, animals, reptiles and fishes of the colonies was Mark Catesby, who first came to Virginia in 1714. Encour\u00ad aged by Colonel William Byrd, this pioneer\u00ad ing naturalist gathered specimens (assigning names still in use today), taught himself to draw, learned to etch and personally hand colored 34,000 plates. The first edition of his book was limited to about 150 sets, each con\u00ad taining 220 etchings, and is thought to be the February 24, 1969 earliest hand-colored plate book on this sub\u00ad ject. Two later editions were published after Catesby's death in 1749. The amount of hand work involved in such an undertaking necessarily limited the num\u00ad ber of copies at the outset, and the ravages of time have, of course, increased the rarity of the plates, making them a fascinating object of search for the serious collector. Dr. and Mrs. George Benjamin Green of Arlington have, over the years, managed to assemble an impressive number of Catesby's plates. Fifty plates from the Greens' collection, in\u00ad cluding The Purple Martin and The Land Crab; will be on view in the Theatre Gallery from February 14 through March 9 in an ex\u00ad hibition entitled Mark Catesby: Colonial Naturalist. SPECIAL RECEPTION Sustaining, Supporting and Contributing Members of the Museum (as designated on page 6) will be invited to attend a reception on February 21 from 5 to 7 P.M. honoring Dr. and Mrs. George Benjamin Green. The Greens are the owners of the prints in Mark Catesby: Colonial Naturalist. After a showing in the Museum Theatre of The Colonial Naturalist, a 55-minute color film on Catesby's life produced by Colonial Williamsburg, guests will adjourn to the Members' Suite to meet Dr. and Mrs. Green and to enjoy refreshments. FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE HON. JAMES A. McCLURE OF IDAHO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. Speaker, the win\u00ad ner of the Idaho Voice of Democracy contest, sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, is Mr. Vernon Anderson, of Weiser, Idaho. Because I found his ad\u00ad dress to be thought provoking, I herewith submit the address for inclusion in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, as follows: FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE (By Vernon Anderson) According to Webster's dictionary, free\u00ad dom is-\"not being subject to another power or authority.\" The true spirit of American freedom is this and more. It is doing unto others as you would have others do unto you. It is placing God and country before self. Freedom is more than just fancy words. It is fighting for the right against impossible odds, as our forefathers did on the fields of Lexington and Concord. Every generation must meet freedom's challenge in order to preserve our heritage. Freedom's challenge was met at Gettysburg, and again during the dark hours of World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Our forefathers have sacrificed their all in order to preserve our heritage. A heritage that allows every man the opportunity to progress to his utmost, to gain a personal fulfillment and happiness out of life. We likewise have a moral obliga\u00ad tion to preserve, protect, and honor our heritage. And by we, I mean every patriotic American, no matter what his race, color, or creed may be. Not every American will be called on to serve in the armed forces; how\u00ad ever, there are many other ways in which we can meet freedom's challenge. The best place to start is with ourselves. Gain an education and then apply it to the advancement of humanity. Use your education constructively to become a useful member of society and to take an active role in our democratic government. When we see the \"Stars and Stripes,\" and hear the \"Star Spangled Banner\" being played we cannot help feeling a deep rever-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ence and pride of America. Hold your head high and share your patriotism with your family, friends, and neighbors. There are countless ways in which to display your patriotism, to meet freedom's challenge. It is the duty of every American to recognize, ac\u00ad cept and meet freedom's challenge at every opportunity. By strengthening the individ\u00ad uals we will have united the families, and by uniting the families, the nation will continue to be united. As Thomas Jefferson stated, \"The God who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time.\" It is our obligation to protect that liberty. Freedom's challenge is a personal challenge--one which we must all meet separately a.s individual citizens and unitedly as Americans. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCE\u00ad MENT IN THE VIENNA POLICE DEPARTM:ENT HON. WILLIAM LLOYD SCOTT OF VIRGINIA lN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. Speaker, while we may disagree as to the best way to con\u00ad trol crime, I believe the entire member\u00ad ship recognizes that criminal activity is one of the foremost problems confront\u00ad ing the country. Therefore, I thought you might be interested in the action taken by the town of Vienna, Va. This town, located near Washington, is up\u00ad grading the standards of its police force by providing incentives for officers to at\u00ad tend college in the evenings. In fact, the town requires that each officer attend college in his off-duty hours in order to be considered for promotions. I com\u00ad mend the town officers for their fore\u00ad sight in upgrading the professional standards of their Police force and insert at this point in the RECORD a copy of a memorandum from Chief of Police Ver\u00ad non L. Jones showing requirements to advance within the department: TOWN OF VIENNA, VA., March 4, 1968. To: Town Manager. From: Chief of Police. Re: Educational requirements. For the past several years there has been been an upsurge in police salaries through\u00ad out the Metropolitan Area. Police depart\u00ad ments have been demanding recognition as professionals. The majority of these demands have been voiced through salary increases with little emphasis on professional qualifi\u00ad cations. Our department like all others, would like to be recognized a.s a professional unit. The Town has been very generous in in\u00ad creasing the pay scale which has enabled us to compete favorably with other jurisdic\u00ad tions. However, until now I do not feel our standards for promotion within our depart\u00ad ment have been high enough to qualify us as professionals. We have a very fair tuition reimbursement policy within our Town and I feel that with the opportunities available for self improvement through college courses all of our men should take advantage of these opportunities. It is recommended that as of this date the following requirements for promotion be adopted. 1. sergeant-To be eligible for promotion to Sergeant or other specialized grades, a Patrolman must have: 1. Three (3) years continuous service with the department. 4231 2. A minimum of 30 semester hours cred\u00ad it. 2. Lieutenant-To be eligible for promo\u00ad tion to Lieutenant, a Sergeant or other qual\u00ad ified specialist must have: 1. At least three (3) years continuous serv\u00ad ice as a Sergeant. 2. A minimum of 45 semester hours. 3. Captain-To be eligible for promotion to Captain a Lieutenant must have: 1. At least three (3) years service as a Lieutenant. 2. A minimum of 60 semester hours. It ls further recommended that our pres\u00ad ent supervisors be granted time to meet the above requirements. For example, in order to retain their present rank, our Sergeants and, Lieutenants must meet the above educational qualifications cm or before July 1, 1972. I feel that by adopting the above policy our men will be further encouraged to take ad\u00ad vantage of existing opportunities and as a result will improve the professional image of our department. It is further recommended that applicants with a minimum of two (2) years college be appointed as patrolman, Grade 17 Step C. Applicants with degrees in police science or related fields would be appointed as patrol\u00ad man, Grade 17 Step D. Our present men upon completion of 48 semester hours be awarded a meritorious increase of one step. Upon completion of 96 hours a two step increase will be awarded. By initiating these requirements at this time, Vienna will be taking a big step toward professlonalization. If we are going to an\u00ad nually request professional salary increases we should at least attempt to qualify as professionals. VERNON L. JONES. ROBINSON, ILL. HON. GEORGE E. SHIPLEY OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. SHIPLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud that Robinson, Ill., has been se\u00ad lected as one of the 10 most beautiful cities of its size in the Nation. Mrs. Maxine Zwermann, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Beautifica\u00ad tion Committee of Robinson, as well as the Robinson High School dance band are presently in town to attend the award ceremonies. Under leave to extend my remarks, I would like to submit for inclusion in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article which appeared in the Robinson Argus on this award: [From the Robinson (Ill.) Argus, February 6, 1969] ROBINSON, ILL. Robinson has been selected as one of the ten cleanest and most beautiful cities of its size in the United States. Chamber of Commerce Beautification Chairman Maxine Zwermann has received notification of the honor from the Director of the National Clean Up-Paint Up-Fix Up Bu\u00ad reau in Washington, R. H. Hackendahl. Robinson's clean up and beautification program is among the ten best in the nation of under 25,000 population. Only 30 a.wards are given annually, with 20 of them going to larger city categories. Robinson will be honored at the National Congress of Beautification, to be held in Washington, D.C., February 23-25. An en\u00ad graved trophy will be presented to represent\u00ad atives of the city on February 25. 4232 As a trophy winner, Robinson, will be in competition for the National Award of Ex\u00ad cellence, the Trigg Trophy, which is the highest honor any city can receive for clean up beautification and civic improvement. Mrs. zwermann's committee this year pre\u00ad sented two sections covering the beautifica\u00ad tion work here, one containing 99 typewritten pages, and one containing two books, weigh\u00ad ing 92 pounds. Covered in the program here for the past four years have been community-wide beautification, property improvements, youth activities, and miscellaneous activities. Robinson previously has won three Dis\u00ad tinguished Achievement Awards, l.!D.der the chairmanship of Mrs. zwermann and her predecessor, Jim Woodworth. RAY MARTIN ON COAL MINE SAFETY HON. KEN BECHLER OF WEST VIRGINli IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. HECHLER of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of February 5, 1969, pages 2887 tlhrough 2913, was printed an excellent series of articles on coal mine health and safety written by Ray Martin, city editor of the Morgantown, W. Va., Dominion\u00ad News. Since the reprinting of these arti\u00ad cles, Mr. Martin has written a number of subsequent articles which deserve the attention of all those interested in im\u00ad proving conditions in the coal mines. These articles cover the period from February 6 through February 22, 1969: [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 6, 1969] UMW A RAPS HECHLER, NADER-PRAISES RANDOLPH (By Ray Martin) The United Mine Workers of America has launched a sweeping attack against critics of the union in the field of miners' health and safety. Named specifically in the latest issue of the UMW Journal were Rep. Ken Hechler, D-W. Va. and Ralph Nader. The Feb. 1 issue of the UMW Journal had praise for both Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. and Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W. Va. in regard to their actions on mine safety and health legislation. In a message addressed to UMWA mem\u00ad bers, Justin McCarthy, Journal editor, says, \"There are some arrogant troublemakers scurrying about--or sending messages to the coal fields these days trying, for devious mo\u00ad tives of their own, to convince the members of the United Mine Workers of America that your union is not doing its job in behalf of safety and health for coal miners. \"The French have a name for such persons. They are called agents provocateurs. Agents provocateurs are secret agents hired to in\u00ad cite others to actions that will make them liable to punishment. \"The American labor movement has a shorter and more concise term for such troublemakers. We call them finks. A fink is a spy, a strikebreaker, an informer and a stool pigeon among other things. \"In our book persons who accuse the United Mine Workers of America and its dedicated International President W. A. Boyle of not doing their jobs in behalf of the health and safety of coal miners are finks. \"Don't listen to them! Don't support them! \"This greater union of coal miners under EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS the inspired leadership of President Boyle is now engaged in an all-out fight in the Congress of the United States and in the legislatures of the several coal mining states to win better health and safety conditions for all coal miners in the United States. \"This issue of the Journal is full, from this page on back, of information for our mem\u00ad bers about what your union is doing and has done on such matters as coal mine safety, 'black lung'-coal workers' pneumoconiosis, workmen's compensation legislation, dust control and other matters of vital concern to all of us. \"Read it carefully. Save it. Tuck it in your pocket and use it for reference. \"Don't ever forget that this union is your union and it is the only organization in America that always has fought down through the years since our establishment on Jan. 25, 1890, 79 years ago, for the best in\u00ad terests of American coal miners. \"Don't allow cheap politicians and other 'instant' experts to try to split you away from the leadership of the United Mine Workers of America. The coal operators have tried this in the past to their regret. \"President Boyle and his associate officers need your support in this renewed but never\u00ad ending fight to bring better health and safety to all coal miners. So rally to the cause of your union and tell the finks to go peddle their anti-union propaganda elsewhere,\" the Journal editor concluded in the Page One article. The 24-page issue of the Journal now in the process of distribution by mail carries the texts of the UMWA's \"dust bill\" intro\u00ad duced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Jennings Randolph and a \"black lung\" bill filed in the West Virginia State Senate by the Senate president. It quotes Senator Randolph as saying on the floor of the Senate: \"It has always been my experience in working with UMWA of\u00ad ficials in this legislative area to know that they, like all of us, must keep in Inind the coal miners' payrolls as well as their health and safety.\" The UMW A Journal reports the presence of a delegation of union leaders at the inaugura\u00ad tion of Governor Moore and cites Vice Presi\u00ad dent George J. Titler as \"a man who played a large part in Moore's election.\" An editorial written by Rex Lauck, assist\u00ad ant editor, takes Representative Hechler and Mr. Nader to task and describes them as \"in\u00ad stant experts.\" Mr. Lauck's editorial compares Mr. Nader with the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy o! Wisconsin. The editorial discusses the number of lines Congressman Hechler's biography consumes in the Congressional Directory-41. It notes that the late Sen. Robert Kennedy used 28 lines and Rep. Harley 0. Staggers of West Virginia uses 13 lines. \"We did not take time to check the com\u00ad plete Congressional Directory, but we do believe Hechler's biography is among the longest in it, probably exceeded only by a lengthy recital of the record of Rep. Joel T. Broyhill (R., Va.),\" the editorial states. Representative Hechler read Mr. Nader's message to the miners' rally. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 7, 1969] BLACK LUNG DISEASE BILL FATED TO LONG LIST OF DELAYS (By Ray Martin) CHARLESTON .-There are occupational haz\u00ad ards and occupational diseases. Usually they affeot only the individual worker subjected to them. As in the case with all laws, or rules of thumb, there are exceptions which cross lines and affect others. Former State Sen. Paul Kaufman was re\u00ad tained by the West Virginia Black Lung Association to prepare legislation on the sub-February 24, 1969 jeot for submission to the Sta.te Legislature and act as the group's lobbyist in shepherd\u00ad ing it through the channels of legislators. During the course of the miners mass rally in the Charleston Civic Center on Jan. 26, Kaufman announced thait the bill would be introduced during the week by Sen. Wil11am T. Brotherton, Jr., Charleston Democrat, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Robert K. Holiday, D-Oak Hill, was to be the bill's co-sponsor. A companion measure was to be introduced in the House of Delegates by Del. Robert Nelson, D-Cabell. At the time Kaufman made his announce\u00ad ment at the Charleston rally, the legislators had had the 30-page bill for a week. Daily during the week of Jra.n. 26, miners eagerly awaited the introduction of their bill. It didn't happen. Woodrow Mullins of Gallagher, spokesman for the Black Lung Associ-a.tion, said mem\u00ad bers of his group met with Sena.tor Brother\u00ad ton on Friday, Jan. 31, and were assured that the bill would be introduced Monday, Feb. 3. Is wan't. Rumors started to fly around Capitol cor\u00ad ridors that Senaitor Holliday was withdrawing as a sponsor of the bill. No trace of the bill could be found at the Capitol on Monday. Dr. I. E. Buff, Charleston heart specialist and head of the Physicians Committee for Miners' Health and Safety, expressed fear that \"the bill might be lost or delayed until Feb. 14.\" Hearings on black lung bills already intro\u00ad duced are scheduled Feb. 11 before the Judi\u00ad ciary Committees of House and Senate meet\u00ad ing in joint session. There were persistent reports that the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman wasn't responding to inquiries about the status of the black lung proposals from his former Sen.ate colleague. Dr. Buff called for the prompt introduction of the Black Lung Association's proposal and requested the Judiciary Committee's vote on the bill be made public. \"It is unfair to penalize the entire member\u00ad ship of the State Legislature if the commit\u00ad tee delays action until Feb. 13, which means that the measure must go through the Rules Oommittee.\" Dr. Buff said. He said killing of the bill on Feb. 14 would be \"a St. Valentine's Day massacre as far as the coal miners of West Virginia are con\u00ad cerned.\" The Charleston doctor said Senator Broth\u00ad erton gave him no \"satisfaction\" when he was asked about the delay in introduction of the black lung compensation measure. Early Tuesday morning the bill suddenly had a number-Senate Bill 216. Word started to spread through the corri\u00ad dors of the Capitol and around Charleston law offices that the Senate measure and Dele\u00ad gate Nelson's bill would be introduced at Tuesday's sessions. The clerks of both House and Senate said the measure wasn't on the list to be read at the session and referred to committee. Some members of the Senate expressed the belief that an age-old legislative trick was being brought into play. The bill is numbered and then gets mislaid or lost between the clerk's office and the floor of the Senate. A half-hour before the Senate convened on Tuesday, senators inquiring about the bill were told that it would be brought out on Wednesday. Members of the Capitol press corps joined the hunt for the \"missing bill\" and it was found in time for introduction at the Tues\u00ad day session of the Senate. The Nelson bill was introduced in the House Thursday. It is HB 814. Senator Brotherton was not available for comment concerning delay in the introduc\u00ad tion of the Black Lung Association bill. February 24, 1969 Senator Holiday, however, said the delay was caused by the length of the bill and the time required for clerks to type it on the llne\u00ad numbered forms used in the legislature. He expressed the belief that the draft copy of the bill probably \"contained certain minor errors\" and he thought that the explanation of the bill's purpose had to be \"rewritten.\" The Black Lung Association bill is the sixth one aimed at providing Workmen's Com\u00ad pensation Act benefits for coal miners afilict\u00ad ed with pneumoconiosis (Bl\u00b7ack lung) intro\u00ad duced in the current session of the legisla\u00ad ture. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 7, 1969) COAL MINERS HEAD LIST OF INJURED WORKERS Ninety per cent of West Virginia's work\u00ad men who are injured and who are awarded compensation payments under the state's Workmen's Compensation Act are coal miners. This was the contention of Dr. Murray Hunter, of the United Mine Workers Clinic at Fairmont, last night as he participated in a dialogue with two doctors at the College of Law at West Virginia University. Other par\u00ad ticipants were Dr. H. A. Wells of Johnstown, Pa., a member of the Physicians' Committee for Miners' Health and Safety, and Dr. Leroy Lapp, instructor in WVU's Department of Medicine and a member of the cardio-pul\u00ad monary section of Project ALFORD, a U.S. Public Health Service project headquartered atWVU. The position of Dr. Oharles E. Andrews, WVU provost for health services, was stated in a paper read by William Tantlinger, a law student. Dr. Andrews had been scheduled to appear at the program arranged by a group of students headed by Davitt McAteer . \"When you talk about compensation in West Virginia,\" Dr. Hunter said, \"for all practical purposes you are talking about coal miners.\" The UMW doctor estimated that bills now pending in the State Legislature relative to \"black lung\" would increase compensation costs by $48 million annually. This, he said, includes only the amount of money needed to bring existing payment schedules in line with the current cost of living. Dr. Hunter would not hazard a guess as to the cost of includ\u00b7ing \"black lung\" as a compensable disease. He warned against the use of terms in legislation which are not generally acceptable to the medical profession. He said that law\u00ad yers could challenge the law if the terms were not found in some referrable medical source. He did not, however, suggest a term for pneumoconiosis or black lung which would meet the legal test. Dr. Hunter praised Dr. Wells for helping to popularize the term \"black lung\" and said this has helped the general public under\u00ad stand the coal miners' problem. The UMW physician said the nation now recognizes air pollution is \"bad\" and \"it can't be seen anywhere except in Los An\u00ad geles. Why do they question the pollution of coal mines with coal dust--which can be seen?\" Dr. Wells told the students assembled to discuss the pending black lung bills \"un\u00ad fortu:na tely most big medical problems have only political solutions.\" He said there were 52,000 disabled coal miners in West Virginia and asserted the fig\u00ad ures used by Dr. Andrews in his presentation didn't agree with the several sources he had cited. Dr. Wells said he wasn't interested 1n com\u00ad pensation as such but his emphasis was on early detection of black lung and its preven\u00ad tion. Dr. Hunter disagreed on the compensation phase of Dr. Wells' position. Dr. Hunter said this was vital to the worker and was the only EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS palpable way available to help clean up the mines. \"We are still a cash society,\" Dr. Hunter declared. Dr. Lapp described three different types of respiratory ailments and the problems which face physicians in their diagnosis. He noted that British records of investigation of black lung do, however, serve as basis on which to make judgments in the U.S. The British began their research in 1942. There was general agreement among the discussants that cigarette smoking would be raised as an issue in Tuesday's hearing at the State Legislature on the pending bills. Dr. Wells asserted that release of a federal study on the relationship of smoking to coal miners' diseases would shed light on the problem. Dr. Wells disagrees that smoking is a major factor in black lung. George Fleming, a miner at Pursglove told the audience that masks issued to miners \"are worthless after just a few minutes.\" ''There are quite a few things down there (in the mine) besides cigarettes,\" Mr. Flem\u00ad ing said emphatically. Dr. Wells then read a letter from another miner showing that it was impossible for a miner to smoke the number of cigarettes in a 24-hour period that some researchers claim. Students read abstract accounts of the various bills now before the legislature and then asked the three doctors specific ques\u00ad tions about the bills. The students will review their abstracts and then adopt a group view on the legisla\u00ad tion and send it to the legislators. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 8, :969] CONGRESSIONAL RECORD CITES EDI'rOR'S WORK Reports on mine safety and health written by Ray Martin, Dominion-News city editor, have been cited in the Congression al Record. Rep. Ken Hechler, Huntington Democrat, referring to Mr. Martin's reports said, \"Na\u00ad tional attention is focused on coal mine health and safety whenever there is a disas\u00ad ter in the coal mines. Since the Nov. 20 disas\u00ad ter at Farmington, W. Va., which resulted in the deaths of 78 miners, many questions have been raised as to what can and should be done to protect the lives and safety of the men who work in these dangerous conditions. \"Ray Martin of the Morgantown Dominion\u00ad News, a member of the National Conference of Editorial Writers, has examined this sub\u00ad ject in depth in a series of articles which should be carefully read by all those inter\u00ad ested in taking construct! ve action to clean up the mines and make them safer for those who work in them. These articles should provide a sound basis for action in this vital and complex area.\" The Fourth District congressman's office said that the Washington Journalism Center has started to use Mr. Martin's articles as a major research source for one of its current projects. Representative Hechler included a synopsis of Mr. Martin's professional background in his remarks and referred to a Dec. 6 Domin\u00ad ion-News editorial which commented on the series of articles authored by the newspaper's city editor. The congressman followed this with pub\u00ad lication of Mr. Martin's articles between Dec. 4, 1968, and Jan. 31. The articles consumed 26 pages in the Congressional Record. The Record clerk's office reported that pub\u00ad lication of Mr. Martin's work in the daily newspaper of Congress is among the longest single entries in recent years. The record for the longest single insertion is held by former Sen. Wayne Morse, &-Ore., who inserted over 100 pages of material in 1958 relative to the Taft-Hartley Act. The clerk's office said insertion of Mr. Mar\u00ad tin's work may possibly set a record for the longest entry of one Individual's writing. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 9, 1969] BLACK LUNG MEET To BEGIN TuESDAY (By Ray Martin) The stage is set and the actors have re\u00ad hearsed well the lines and gestures they will use In Charleston Tuesday when the House and Senate Judiciary Committees hold a joint hearing on proposed legislation to make \"black lung\" a compensable disease under the Workmen's Compensation Act. Of 30 bills introduced in the current ses\u00ad sion of the state Legislature dealing with the Department of Mines, mine safety and health, nine are relative to the compensation ques\u00ad tion. Although compensation awards for coal miners pneumoconiosis have been made in four instances over a four-year period, the state of West Virginia does not specifically recognize the lung disease as compensable. A great deal of furor has been raised, ac\u00ad companied by character assassination and vilification, since the campaign was launched to get the legislators to include black lung in the compensable disease category. It is ironic that such tumult should ensue when one considers there is nothing com\u00ad pulsory about the state's basic compensation law and hence no penalties for industrial and business entities which do not choose to participate in the state's system of work\u00ad men's compensation. Participation in the state plan merely pro\u00ad vides certain immunities for the employer in the courts in case an injured worker brings suit. One of the principal immunities is tha1l dealing with \"deliberate intent\" to injure or kill an employe. Many lawyers in West Virginia believe the deliberate intention clause and its restric\u00ad tive interpretation by the courts has worked a great injustice on injured workers and placed employers in a highly favored posi\u00ad tion. Regardless of the nature and extent of ac\u00ad cidents in coal mines it is practically impos\u00ad sible to hold the mine operators legally ac\u00ad countable, if they carry workmen's compen\u00ad sation, many lawyers assert. It is impossible, they say, to prove in a court of law that the mine operator previously picked out a specific individual out of perhaps hundreds to injure or kill. These lawyers advocate changing the laws to provide that an employer can be held ac\u00ad countable if there is evidence of willful or wanton misconduct or negligence. They would include violation of state or federal safety laws and rules, where applicable, as evidence of such conduct . All nine black lung compensation pro\u00ad posals contain a provision that blocks aware of payments to employes of employers who are delinquent in the payment of their pre\u00ad miums to the compensation fund. The October, 1968, contract between the United Mine Workers of America and various coal mine operators t'ontains this clause rela\u00ad tive to workmen's compensation and occupa\u00ad tional diseases: \"Each operator who is party to this agreement will provide the protection and coverage of the benefits under Work\u00ad men's Compensation and Occupational Dis\u00ad ease Laws, whether compulsory or elective, existing in the states in which the respective employes are employed. Refusal of any op\u00ad erator to carry out this direction shall be deemed a violation of this agreement. Notice of compliance with this section shall be posted at the mine.\" The Tuesday hearings will be conducted in the House of Delegates chamber at the state Capitol starting at 1 :30 p.m. Everyone except the registered speakers , legislators and the press will be barred from the floor of the chamber during hearings. Spectators will be seated in the galleries. Area members of the Senate .:-udiciary Committee headed by Sen. William T. 4234 Brotherton Jr., D-Charleston, include 0. G. Hedrick, D-Fairmont and William Moreland, D-Morgantown. Del. J. E. Watson, Fairmont Democrat, chairs the House Judiciary Committee. Other area members of the committee include Rob\u00ad ert W. Dinsmore, D-Morgantown; Harry U. Howell, D-Morgantown and Robert C. Hal\u00ad britter, R-Kingwood. Before the joint committee wm be the following House bills dealing with black lung: H.B. 570 (Deis. Goodwin, Seth and Jones of Charleston), H.B. 605 (Del. Simp\u00ad kins), H.B. 606 (Deis. Stacy H.B. H.B. 720 (Del. Boiar\u00ad sky), and J.B. 814 (Del. Nelson). There are three Senate bills. Their numbers and sponsors are: S.B. 96 (Sens. Kinsolving and Moreland), S.B. 167 (Sen. Jackson), and S.B. 216 (Sens. Brotherton and HolUday). All of the bills amend the present Work\u00ad men's Compensation Act by inserting vari\u00ad ous versions of coal miners' lung disease, pneumoconiosis, black lung or occupational pneumocon iosis, thus making the ailment compensable. The two major bills which add new sections to the existing law are S.B. 167 and S.B. 216 and their companion bills in the House. The former ls sponsored by the AFL-CIO and UMWA and the I\u00b7atter was prepared under the aegis of the West Virginia Black Lung Association. All of the bills, with the exception of the Black Lung Association measure, contain provisions for denying payments to a widow or widower who is found living under com\u00ad mon law marriage circumstances. A widow living a life of prostitution is also prohibited from getting benefits. Provision is made in the proposed laws for investigation of reports concerning the two situations cited. The AFL-CIO-UMW A proposal contains a presumption clause specifying that an em\u00ad ploye exposed to the hazards of occupational pneumoconiosls for a perlOd of two years during the 10 years immediately preceding the date of his last exposure shall be regarded as getting the ailment as the result of his employment. The presumption, however, ls not considered conclusive and may be re\u00ad butted by the employer. The union proposal pegs payments under the compensation system to varying per\u00ad centages of the average weekly wage paid in West Virginia, which is determined after taking all state workers' salaries into account. Both major bills, as do the others, provide for disqualification of workers if they fall to follow posted safety rules or fail to use safety equipment supplied by the employer. As an example, a miner who failed to wear a mask could be disqualified for benefits. The Bliack Lung Association blll pegs bene\u00ad fits to the average wage earned by miners rather than all of the state's workers and the figure is calculated on the individual's earnings. The Association's presumption clause is predicated on the applicant being under 70 years of age and exposure to the dust hazard over a period of five years in a 15-year period preceding the date of the claim. Both major bills woUld set up a new board to consider black lung claims as distin\u00ad guished from others. Other measures com\u00ad bine silicosis and black lung into a single board. The Association bill calls for the establish\u00ad ment of a laboratory center at Charleston to determine whether employes have black lung or not. The A.FL-CIO-UMW A proposal makes no such suggestion. The union-sponsored bill provides for a schedule of payments to attorneys who assist applicants for compensation. The Association bill makes no mention of this procedure. All of the bills contain provisions for mak\u00ad ing adjustments in the amount of compen\u00ad sation now paid by the state commission. This has been estimated to cost about $48 million. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS No estimates have been given regarding the cost of making black lung a compensable disease. Some state lawyers contend that the state's compensation law could be simplified, thus reducing a great deal of confusion for work\u00ad ers and employers alike. They advocate the simple statement that any medical condition resulting from or through the cause of em\u00ad ployment is compensable. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) MINERS' BLACK LUNG-WHAT Is IT? LEGIS\u00ad LATORS TO HEAR TODAY (By Ray Martin) CHARLESTON.-\"Black lung.\" What is i\u00b7t? What's behind the heated discussion in\u00ad volving coal miners, doctors and coal mine operators? At 1: 30 p.m. today the proponents and op\u00ad ponents of legislation designed to make \"black lung\" or coal workers' pneumoconiosls a compensable disease in West Virginia will parade their separate panels of \"experts\" be\u00ad fore the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate. The coal mine operators and their doctors will stress that no new legislation is needed on the subject. The miners and a small group of dootors will endeavor to make the fountain State the fourth state in the Union to recognize the coal miners' lung ailment as an industry\u00ad related impairment. The position of the coal operators is best illustrated by the stand taken by the West Virginia Coal Association. After noting current miners' pay scales and the amount of taxes, direct and indirect, which the coal industry pays in West Vir\u00ad ginia and some of its past economic prob\u00ad lems, the Coal Association states: \"From a shivering sparrow which poorly wintered the years when it lost almost all of its steam locomotive market and almost all of its home heating market, the coal industry is now developing into the pro\u00ad ductive, proverbial goose. \"There are those who, greedy for their im\u00ad mediate desires, would open up this goose for a single golden egg. \"However, the coal industry is presently standing up well under new challenges. A nuclear power competitor subsidized by fed\u00ad eral tax dollars, Iron Curtain coal dumped at a loss for American dollars, markets lost because of unreasonable air pollution stand\u00ad ards and additional expenses occasioned by environmental pollution control standards, are among these challenges. \"New Canadian and Australian coal fields, increased coal production in other states and advantages of market proximity enjoyed by these states are other challenges to the continued strength of West Virginia's coal industry. \"As if these were not problems enough,\" the Coal Association states, \"the industry is now faced with an unrealistic attack in the form of a highly emotional thrust to rewrite the state's worklnen's compensation laws without regard to the welfare of the coal miners and the industry itself. \"In view of proposed legislation concern\u00ad ing coal workers' pneumoconiosis or black lung, coal, the cornerstone of West Virginia's economy, is being seriously threatened be\u00ad cause of a lack of understanding and misrep\u00ad resentation of faot. \"This legislation may severely hamper the coal industry and do great injustice to the coal worker. \"Briefly, the proposed legislation assumes that after working only two years in the mines, a coal worker with a respiratory ail\u00ad ment has automatically contracted black lung, and is entitled to an award under the state's workmen's compensation laws. \"This presumption is without precedent February 24, 1969 anywhere in the world. In fact, respiratory disease is the largest single public health problem of non-coal workers. \"What is pneumoconiosis? Dust in the lungs. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (Black lung) means coal dust in the lungs. Silicosis is a pneumoconiosis caused by rock or sand dust in the lungs. Miners often breathe both coal and silica dust. \"Cigarette smoke also ls dust. According to Dr. Wolfgang T. mmer, a West German lung physiologist of international renown, one single cigarette exposes the smoker to a greater amount of dust than a miner exposed to in three 8-hour shifts in the mines. \"Because it is frequently impossible to de\u00ad termine whether a disabled living miner has silicosis or coal workers' pneumoconiosis, thousands of claims have been paid by West Virginia's Silicosis Medical Board without regard to the distinction. \"What is important to this board of doctors is that if the disabled man is a miner with dust in his lungs, then he is compensated for any resulting disability. \"Anyone who says that Workmen's Com\u00ad pensation benefits are not being paid in West Virginia for the disease called 'black lung' is not stating the truth.\" A workmen's compensation law similar to that of Pennsylvania has been suggested for West Virginla's miners. This type law is bad for both the miner and the state. Unlike West Virginia's law, a Pennsylvania miner must be totally and permanently disabled before he is entitled to a single penny. His claim is heard by a referee with no medical training and may be appealed to a board of three lawyers. \"On the other hand,\" the Coal Association states, \"upon discovering dust in the lungs, West Virginia's three-doctor silicosis board may award the miner $1,000 even without a showing of disab111ty. If the miner is dis\u00ad abled, an award is made according to the per cent of disabil1ty up to $188 per month for life. Compare this to Pennsylvania's maxi\u00ad mum life award of $75 a month ... \"With over 56 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves, there is gold in the West Vir\u00ad ginia hills. At the present rate of production, the industry could keep producing its golden eggs for almost 400 more years-so long as coal remains competitive in the marketplace,\" the Coal Association position statement concludes. With respect to the state's present law, Cletus B. Hanley, former West Virginia Com\u00ad pensation Commissioner, has stated: \"There is a principle in law that you list specific things, enumerate them, then anything not listed is not covered. \"Our law follows this principle: We don't list specific conditions, except for silicosis. Therefore, any occupational disease is cov\u00ad ered if it meets the tests set up by law.\" According to available statistics, West Vir\u00ad ginia has recognized only four cases of black lung as compensable in a four-year period. The Coal Association statement appears to err on several points. It fails to note, for ex\u00ad ample, when a West Virginia coal miner ac\u00ad cepts the $1,000 award for silicosis or pneu\u00ad moconiosis he automatically waives his right to further claims for compensation for that cause either against the state commission or his employer. The reference to the Pennsylvania law 1s also misconstrued. The maximum amount of award is $12,750 and that state's law provides for the payment of $75 monthly for each month subsequent to the one in which the compensation was awarded. A bill to raise the latter sum to $100 a month was vetoed by the governor Of that state. Pennsylvania's payments are made from the general fund rather than the workmen's compensation fund. In West Virginia compensation payments are made from a state fund to which em\u00ad ployers contribute. Some large firms are al\u00ad lowed to self-insure themselves and make payments directly to injured workers under February 24, 1969 the general supervision Of the Workmen's Compensation Commission. The West Virginia Black Lung Association, which has spearheaded the campaign for ap\u00ad propriate state legislation, announced that it plans to record statements made by legis\u00ad lators at today's meeting. The Association will transcribe the statements and distribute them to United Mine Workers of America locals in each district represented by mem\u00ad bers of the joint Judiciary Committee. The UMW, which has sponsored legislation Of its own, is committed to support a strong black lung bill. Many UMW locals have sent delegations to Charleston for today's hearing. Among the many union representatives are Basil Callen and Wayne Lee of Local 1058. The local is comprised of miners who work at Humphrey No. 7 mine at Mt. Morris, Pa. The Black Lung Association and the three doctors-Drs. I. E. Buff, H. A. Wells and Donald Rasmussen-who have appeared at miners' rallies around the state came under new attack Monday in anonymous statements mailed to state newspapers from Parkersburg. The second such malling from Parkersburg states the West Virginia Coal Association has attacked the \"sideshow antics\" of advocates of black lung legislation. The anonymous mailing also criticized Rep. Ken Hechler, con\u00ad gressman for the Fourth District. C. E. Brooks, Black Lung Association pres\u00ad ident, said a U.S. Public Health Service sur\u00ad vey has ef:'tablished that only one out of 10, active soft coal miners and one out of five former miners have X-ray evidence of black lung. The study also reveals, he said, that death rates for U.S. coal miners were about twice that of the general working population while death rates for diseases of the respira\u00ad tory system are about five times that for the general working male population. \"S1licon dioxide is the only coal mine haz\u00ad ard that the present laws now state explicity may cause lung disease,\" Brooks haid. \"In every case, other than silicosis, the miner must prove that his lung disease came from the mines. Less than six miners have been successful in establishing this proof.\" Brooks noted that Britain has recognized coal dust as the cause of pneumoconiosis for more than 30 years and has compensated for it. Pennsylvania has compensated for it since 1965 on the basis of presumption, he said. \"Coal pneumoconiosis is not mentioned in the present law. Article 4, Section 2 places such a heavy burden of proof on the black lung claimant that he has a very slim chance of receiving compensation,\" Brooks said. The Association president said the law should not contain a release from liability for employers if the employe accepts a first stage silicosis award, and the law should provide for additional benefits if the respiratory disease ls aggravated by the occupation. Brooks also suggested that compensation payments should be adjusted to the cost of living and all those receiving compensation should receive it according to the latest pay\u00ad ment schedule passed. The West Virginia Black Lung Association has been conducting a drive for funds to help it wage the battle for passage of appropiate legislation. Funds are being received by the Association's treasurer, Ernest Riddle, at Cannelton. Each contributor receives a buff\u00ad colored card certifying that he has made a donation to the group. {From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominlon\u00ad News, Feb. 12, 1969] BLACK LUNG STEP TAKEN: WITNESSES AGREE DISEASE EX.ISTS-BOYLE DISAPPOINTS (By Ray Martin) CHARLESTON.-Achievement of a new mile\u00ad stone in the current debate over pneumo\u00ad coniosis and a bitter disappointment to the members of the United Mine Workers of America in West Virginia came Tuesday dur\u00ad ing the course of a hearing which lasted EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS more than six hours before the joint judiciary committee of the state legislature. The milestone was achieved when the ma\u00ad jority of the 23 witnesses appearing before the committee, including physicians, agreed that there was something called pneumoco\u00ad niosis, or black lung which affects soft coal miners. Some of the physicians, however, disagreed with their counterparts on the ex\u00ad tent of disability caused by black lung. The disappointment came when W. A. (Tony) Boyle, international president of UMWA, failed to appear at the meeting. He had been invited by miners attending a rally at Charleston Civic Center on Jan. 26. UMW's Washington headquarters had an\u00ad nounced that Vice President George Titler and other union officials would attend the hearing and support the miners' effort to secure black lung c\u00b7ompensation legislation. Titler was present in the House of Dele\u00ad gates chamber where the hearings were held. Coples of his prepared remarks were dis\u00ad tributed to members of the press corps and others. Some newspapers in the country with early deadlines will undoubtedly record that Titler spoke before the legislative committee. He didn't. After taking UMWA credit for the estab\u00ad lishment of the Pennsylvania program for black lung compensation, Titler noted that \"West Virginia is the largest coal producing state in the nation, last year producing a 151,000,000 tons of coal. \"In spite of this\", Titler continued, \"it does not recognize that the dust the employes of the coal industry breathe every day causes all of the ravages of coal workers pneumo\u00ad coniosis and all of the other disease common among coal miners. \"Many doctors here today will demonstrate that pneumoconiosis or black lung is a dis\u00ad ease caused by bituminous coal dust. Its vic\u00ad tims obviously should be compensated for this work-caused disease. We are proposing that it be added to the list of compensable industrial diseases in the state of West Vir\u00ad ginia. \"I am accompanied here today by mOl'e than a dozen of the leaders of the four UMWA districts in West Virginia and by three members of our staff in Washington, D.C. We plan to continue this fight until this legislation is passed,\" Titler said. Titler's distributed but unspoken views were rebutted by Charleston attorney Geoi:ge Burnett, who said he was the spokesman for UMWA Districts 6, 17, 29, and 31. He recalled that he had appeared before legislative sessions since 1961 in the interest of law compensation law improvements. Then in obvious reference to the three doctors--Drs. H. A. Wells, Donald Rasmussen and I. E. Buff-who had been in the fore\u00ad front of the campaign for black lung legisla\u00ad tion, Burnett said, \"Never in history have so many been confused by so few.\" He then asserted that black lung has been covered under West Virginia's compensation law since July 1, 1949. He said no claims have been paid, however. Burnett explained the reason no miner had received compensation for black lung was the inability to provide X-ray evidence of the disease. Burnett urged passage of the bill drafted by the UMWA and ~CIO. Miles Stanley, state AFL--CIO president, took a similar position. David Johnson, speaking for the West Vir\u00ad ginia. Coal Association, opposed the basic purpose of the legislation but said he agreed with some of the approaches taken by Bur\u00ad nett and the UMW bill. Many UMWA locals in West Virginia re\u00ad ceived letters from their district presidents implying possible expulsion from the union of members who supported the Black Lung Association and its efforts to secure legisla\u00ad tion. Many of the witnesses testifying at Tues\u00ad day's hearing said the Black Lung Association 4235 proposal would do more for the miners of the state than the other bllls. Ben Tissue of the West Virginia Manufac\u00ad turer's Association took exception to the UMWA proposal on the grounds that it would open up the respiratory disease pre\u00ad sumptive clause to all workers in the state. Tissue said the problem was that of the coal industry and that industry should face it. Some observers expressed the opinion that the UMW A inserted the broad provision in its bill to help assure its unacceptability to legislators. Several witnesses told the legislators that it would be \"useless\" for them to have \"an\u00ad other study\" made. All agreed that sufficient scientific data is available for the legislators' guidance in drafting and enacting appropri\u00ad ate laws on the subject. Dr. Jethro Gough of the Welch National School of Medicine was invited to the heM\u00ad ing by the Monongahela Valley Association of Health Centers. He is credited with being the discoverer and identifier of black lung disease in coal miners. Dr. Gough suggested that one of the diffi\u00ad culties in West Virginia and indeed much of the United States might lie in the failure to read X-rays properly and to adhere to stand\u00ad ards set for the detection of the disease by the International Labor Organizaion, an arm of the United Nations. The health center group also sponsored the appearance of Dr. Eugene Pendergrass of the University of Pennsylvania. and Dr. Leon Cander of the University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio. The West Virginia Coal Association relied on the director of Spindletop Research Inc. of Lexington, Ky. and Dr. William Anderson and Robert W. Penman to carry the main burden of its opposition to the pending bills. Under questioning, it was brought out that Spindletop sent out a list of six questions to 24 doctors it and some of the respondents re\u00ad garded as \"experts.\" Eighteen doctors replied and each was paid $50 for his answers. Dr. Anderson asserted that the union has been attacked and warned UMW A members to regard the union as the most valuable thing in their lives next to their families. He went on to say that it was neither the UMWA nor the coal operators' responsibility to control coal dust in the mines. It is the U.S. Bureau of Mines responsibility \"and it has been silent\". Dr. Charles Andrews, provost for health services at West Virginia University, was invited to appear before the committee by Sen. William Brotherton Jr. Dr. Andrews said he disagreed with some of Dr. Gough's findings, but admitted that the Welch doctor had good reasoning to sup\u00ad port his opinions. The WVU provost said black lung should be made a compensable disease but said diffi\u00ad culty arises in the determination of the de\u00ad gree of disability. He expressed opposition to proposals to make all respiratory impairment subject to compensation. Dr. Andrews said he favored a 10-year pe\u00ad riod of exposure to dust before presuming the miner contracted black lung as the result of employment. Dr. Keith Morgan, chief of the United States Public Health Service Project AL\u00ad FORD, headquartered at WVU, was also in\u00ad vited by the legislative committee. Dr. Morgan scored present legislation as in\u00ad adequate and stressed that black lung is not accepted as compensable in West Virginia. It is important to distinguish between sil\u00ad icosis and black lung, Dr. Morgan said. The legislators were told that 10 per cent of the miners in Appalachia had black lung accord\u00ad ing to a 1962-63 study conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service. He said while the Public Health Service has no jurisdiction over mines it has recom\u00ad mended a dust standard of 3 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air. 4236 Dr. Morgan cited British results with the dust standard that country imposed and the marked decrease in black lung cases in a 10 to 15 year period. Commenting on the Black Lung Associa\u00ad tion proposal for the establishment of a lab\u00ad oratory in Charleston, Dr. Morgan said the Public Health Service is already sponsoring such a facility in Morgantown. \"It is not subject to pressures from any side, at least I would like to think so,\" Dr. Morgan declared. Dr. Rasmussen was questioned about black lung's effect on the miners' sex status. Both Dr. Rasmussen and other doctors said the effect was one of the more tangible evidences of black lung's presence. Hearings will be held later on the mone\u00ad tary aspects of black lung compensation as well as general increases in state payments to injured workers. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 13, 1969] BLACK LUNG MULTIPLIED WrrH MINE MACHINES (By Ray Martin) FAmMONT.-Dr. Jethro Gough of Cardiff, Wales, father of the whole lung section tech\u00ad nique which led to the isolation of coal work\u00ad ers' pneumoconiosis (black lung) as a sep\u00ad arate disease, Wednesday said black lung ail\u00ad ments increased sharply after mechanization added to dust in mines. Dr. Gough conducted a three-hour sym\u00ad posium at Fairmont Clinic to which doctors from West Virginia University Medical Cen\u00ad ter as well as other area physicians were in\u00ad vited. Purpose was to bring them abreast of current and new knowledge in this sphere of medicine. Dr. Gough earlier described the current move to make coal workers' pneumoconiosis compensable in West Virginia is \"40 years late.\" \"The death rate of miners wasn't high during the first 20 years of the century.\" said Dr. Gough, founder of the British Col\u00ad lege of Pathology and consultant to the World Health Organization. \"A change occurred in 1925,\" he added. \"From this time on there was a steep rise ln the death rate due to mechanization of mines. Men died of respiratory diseases.\" Coal dust, resulting from mechanization, causes black lung disease and \"a special kind of emphysema\" as well, said Dr. Gough who is also the chief consultant on pneu\u00ad moconiosis for the British Ministry of Social and Occupational Research. \"It is called focal dust emphysema,\" Dr. Gough explained. \"When you talk of the total amount of emphysema, you get a far greater incidence among the coal mining population.\" Cigaret smoking is a contributing factor, but studies show tha.t \"there is some other factor producing emphysema,\" Dr. Gough said. \"If the disease among miners was due to cigaret smoking, you would expect to get a high degree of cancer,\" the Welsh physi\u00ad cian explained. \"We get a less degree of cancer among miners.\" Dr. Gough said chronic bronchitis usually precedes cancer, \"but we don't get the se\u00ad quence of cancer as often in miners as we do in the rest of the population. We can see that this is related to the disposition of coal dust.\" The Welsh pathologist explained that there may be various explanations; for the differ\u00ad ence. He believes that coal dust causes block\u00ad age in the lungs so that development of can\u00ad cer is thwarted. \"Coal dust destroys a lot of the tissue from which cancer can develop,'' Dr. Gough said. \"Miners develop immunity to cancer of the lung.\" He said coal dust may ca.use massive fi\u00ad brosis that leads to heart failure. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS He has conducted research in many parts of the world, including the United States, and is credited with having autopsied more coal miners than anyone else over a period of nearly 40 years. He explained that in Britain, for example, the autopsy is performed automatically whenever death is attributed to an occupa\u00ad tional disease. The British Government made black lung subject to workmen's compensation in 1943. Silicosis laws were enacted in 1929. Dr. Gough said various agencies in the U.S. had concentrated on coal dust as a contributing factor to coal mine explosions in conjunction with methane gas. He pointed out that other countries had performed re\u00ad search and have practical experience to show that coal dust itself can trigger explosions without methane and that dust itself is a heal th hazard. The British mines he said, have operated under strict dust control procedures since the 1950s. In that period there has been a marked decline in the number of cases of coal miners' pneumoconiosis, he noted. Two different medical control systems op\u00ad erate in England, Dr. Gough pointed out. Under one system specific groups of miners are examined for black lung or other disabil\u00ad ity under a schedule which assures exami\u00ad nation once every five years. The second system involves specific geo\u00ad graphic areas of the nation where miners are examined annually. The visiting physician also pointed out that in England mines are closed and or\u00ad dered to make necessary improvements when they fail to meet the published dust stand\u00ad ard. Individuals are given assignments away from the face of the mine when pneumo\u00ad coniosis ls first detected. No dust standards are enforced by West Virginia or the U.S. Government. Dr. Gough has taught pathology at Welsh National School of Medicine since 1948. He appeared at Tuesday's hearing on black lung legislation before the House and Senate Ju\u00ad diciary Committees in Charleston. His appearance there along with that of Drs. Eugene Pendergrass and Leon Cander was sponsored by the Monongahela Valley Association of Health Centers. The Associ\u00ad ation operates Fairmont Clinic. The Association is a chartered non-profit corporation with scientific, educational and charitable objective founded in 1958. Its board of directors consists of community leaders and serves without remuneration. It opera.tes Fairmont Clinic, general prac\u00ad tice community offices in Marion and Harri\u00ad son Counties and is the largest home health service in West Virginia. Its facilities are open to the public. There were almost 100,- 000 outpatient visits in 1968. The Association sponsors six teaching a1Iil\u00ad iations with leading universities and colleges in nursing and medical education, medical care administration, public health and busi\u00ad ness management. It has offered support fellowships for rural general practice. It.s educational program has included sponsorship of scientific and public forums and publications. Members of its medical, nursing and ancillary staff and ad\u00ad ministrative personnel serve as faculty mem\u00ad bers in the professional field and contribute to professional journals and conferences. Relative to the sponsorship of the three doctors' appearance at Tuesday's legislative hearing, the Rev. Richard Bowyer of Fair\u00ad mont, member of the Association's execu\u00ad tive committee, said: \"OUr health care association is interested in guaranteeing that public and legislative opinion in the state has the benefit of the finest possible scientific experts in the na\u00ad tion and world. We therefore have sponsored the visit to West Virginia of three interna\u00ad tionally recognized speicalists in coal miners' lung diseases. February 24, 1969 \"Any appeal to reason requires the best minds with experience and medical knowl\u00ad edge of the subject. The superb credentials of Dr. Gough in pathology, Dr. Pendergrass in radiology and Dr. Cander in chest diseases assured a high level discourse. \"This action was taken as part of the pre\u00ad ventive medicine and public health program of our Association,\" the Rev. Mr. Bowyer said. \"The Association neither supports nor op\u00ad poses any legislation. It does not engage in lobbying. \"It is most important that those with the largest contribution to the medical litera\u00ad ture, reputations of the highest order in the profession and wide-ranging experience with coal workers' lung diseases be heard. These experts are without connection either with the coal companies, the union or the black lung movement. They are the top figures in this field Of medicine and in their appear\u00ad ance before the State Legislature, the sole function was to \"tell it like it is.\" \"Our first interest is in the coal miners who comprise a large part of the people in our area receiving health services,\" Mrs. Brown said. Both Drs. Pendergrass and Cander served as members of Gov. William Scranton's com\u00ad pensation study commission in Pennsylvania in 1964. Dr. Cander is chairman of medicine and physiology at the University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio. Dr. Pendergrass is chairman of the radiology department of the University of Pennsylvania. (From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 16, 1969) HECHLER DEPLORES DUST RULE DELAY (By Ray Martin) WASHINGTON.-Rep. Ken Hechler, D-W. Va., Saturday described Labor Secretary George P. Shultz's delay of the first federal dust stand\u00ad ards for coal mines as \"an outrage.\" Before leaving office former Labor Secre\u00ad tary Willard Wirtz issued revised heal th safety standards under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. The standards which apply to all employers with government con\u00ad tracts of $10,000 or more were to have taken effect today, 30 days after they were pub\u00ad lished in the Federal Register on Jan. 17. The Wirtz regulations would have affected between five and 10 per cent of the nation's coal operators, who do $200 million worth of business annually with the government. Hechler, a Huntington Democrat, said: \"This is an outrage. Here are clear and simple rules which will protect the health and safety of the coal miner but the profit\u00ad making producers scream that these simple protections cannot be carried out, and the Administration immediately says they should be 'studied.' \"I think it's high time that we should con\u00ad sider above all the health and safety of the men who work in the coal mines and die in the coal mines, and let the question of profits take second place,\" the West Vir\u00ad ginian said. The standards were postponed for at least 90 days Thursday when Shultz ordered a de\u00ad lay in the original effective date. The Repub\u00ad lican labor secretary said he wanted more time to study the effect of the new regula\u00ad tions before he decided whether to put them into effect. He said his action did not reflect on the merits of any of the standards. Shultz's statement did not mention that two days of public hearings ha.ct been held last November on the new proposals, and that industry objections had been aired in detail then. Neither did it disclose that the same in\u00ad dustry groups that had raised objections then-the National Association of Manufac\u00ad turers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce foremost among them-had sent telegrams to February 24, 1969 the new secretary since inauguration day de\u00ad manding that he postpone or cancel the reg\u00ad ulations. The revision, which updates the standards in effect since December 1960, protects the worker by strengthening the standards per\u00ad taining to fire, safety, noise, and air con\u00ad taminants. The standards delayed include the require\u00ad ments limiting dust to three mUllgrams of dust per cubic meter of air. This standard, the first to be imposed in the U.S., is com\u00ad pared to the standard used in England since the 1940s. It is aimed at reducing the number of workers injured in fire and industrial acci\u00ad dents, and the alarming number of cases of impaired hearing and pneumoconiosis caused by exposure to excessive noise and air con\u00ad taminants. Highlights of the revision delay by Shultz are: Adoption by reference of nationally rec\u00ad ognized consensus standards, such as the na\u00ad tional fire codes established by the National Fire Prevention Association and the American Safety Standards set up by the United States of America Standards Institute. Adoption by reference of other federal agency regulations, such as the Ordnance standards of the Department of Defense and the Hazardous Materials standards of the De\u00ad partment of Transportation. Adoption of an occupational noise-stand\u00ad ard designed to reduce the threat of loss of hearing from job noise which now hangs over an estimated six to 16 million workers. This standard sets a maximum acceptable level of 85 decibels. However, in those cases where a firm 1S unable to meet this requirement immedi\u00ad ately, an interim level of 92 decibels is ac\u00ad ceptable if an effective hearing conservation program is established to protect the hear\u00ad ing of employes and to reduce the noise level to 85 decibels by Jan. 1, 1971. While the noise levels exceed 85 decibels, annual audiometric exa.mina.tions shall be performed on exposed employ es. Adoption of stricter standards to control air contaminants, including the adoption of the Threshold Limit Values set forth by the American Conference of Governmental In\u00ad dustrial Hygienists with certain exceptions. The exceptions include the current stand\u00ad ards issued by the American Standards In\u00ad stitute in the field of air contaminants and, in the area of dusts, the new standard of the U.S. Public Health Service for coal dust. The three milllgrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air standard set by the Public Health Service is designed to prevent coal miners' pneumoconiosis, which has resulted in serious illness among miners and an alarming number of deaths. Many of the Witrz standards for health and safety are contained in legislation in\u00ad troduced last year by Rep. James O'Hara, Michigan Democrat, and which were defeated in committee. The Michigan congressman has submitted his bill again this year. Under the O'Hara bill, the labor secretary could issue standards already adopted by other federal agencies, which would give him exclusive jurisdiction over the affected in\u00ad dustries. He also could issue temporary standards adopted. by private groups by other than the consensus method. While providing opportu\u00ad nities for judicial review, there would be no court challenges in cases where standards are finally adopted and where state plans to enforce their own programs are rejected. (From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad Post, Feb. 16, 1969] UMW SHOULD FIGHT FOR STRONGEST LAws The Feb. 1 edition o! the United Mine Workers Journal proclaims on its first page: \"In our book persons who accuse the United EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Mine Workers of America and its dedicated International President W. A. Boyle of not doing their jobs in behalf of the health and safety of coal miners are finks. \"Don't listen to them! Don't support them! \"This great Union of coal miners under the inspired leadership of President Boyle is now engaged in an all-out fight in the Con\u00ad gress of the United States and in the legisla\u00ad tures of the several coal mining states to win better health and safety conditions for all coal miners in the United States.\" Elsewhere in the issue of the UMW Jour\u00ad nal appears an account of the union's spon\u00ad sorship of legislation to make coal workers' pneumoconiosis compensable under West Virginia's workmen's compensation law. With specific reference to the Feb. 11 hearing held in Charleston, the Journal said that Vice President George J. Titler, former president of UMW District 29 in West Virginia, would recommend to Tony Boyle that the union's position be stated by Lewis E. Evans, the sole full-time person the UMW has engaged in the pursuit of safety causes. Mr. Evans didn't address the legislators. Neither did Mr. Titler, although copies of his remarks were distributed at the hearing. Ironically, his words were rebutted by the testimony of a Charleston lawyer who spoke as the representative for the four UMW dis\u00ad tricts in the state. UMW members in our state were warned, under penalty of union punitive action not to support any other bill than that endorsed and authored by the UMW. It is hard to see how anyone, coal miners least of all, can benefit when there ls a rift exlstant between those who seek reform in the mine laws of the several states as well as federal statutes. On the contrary, the cause of mine safety and miner health seems cer\u00ad tain to suffer from the discord among the various groups and lawmakers seeking new laws on both levels of government. If these groups are seriously interested in helping the miner, they could best prove it by ceasing their screams and accusations and trying to find the best route to new mine safety and health laws. This includes the United Mine Workers, whose officials seem to spend more time de\u00ad f ending themselves against critics than in promoting passage of decent mine laws. Arguments over how strict new legislation should be actually tend to reduce chances for passage of any mine laws. Some reform work\u00ad ers have suggested that such divisive action is typical of the UMW, adding that the un\u00ad ion has always been more concerned with collecting royalties and winning pay raises than in protecting miners on the job. It was such statements that sent the UMW leader\u00ad ship scrambling from the trenches, scream\u00ad ing the organization's indignation and con\u00ad demning its critics as \"fink.\" Maybe the accusers went too far in their charges, but no one can successfully deny that the UMW stand is hurting chances for effective mine health and safety laws. Not even the staunchest friend of the mine union can argue sucessfully that the UMW has an unblemished record in regard to the health needs of its members. In 1963 the UMW's Welfare and Retirement Fund unceremoniously <:<umped the coal field hospital chain on which its miners depended for health care because the hospitals proved costly to operate. A few months earlier the Fund cancelled all welfare benefits of miners employed by operators who had failed to pay the union's 40-cents a ton royalty, thus pun\u00ad ishing its own members rather than the of\u00ad fending operators. In view of what has gone before, the pres\u00ad ent conduct of the UMW in Charleston and Washington is not reassuring. It may be un\u00ad fair to say that the union wants no new health or safety laws. But i! it does it would do well to stop screaming \"fink\" at its critics, come down from the self-built pedestal and 4237 do something substantial in the quest for long overdue health and safety legislation. The miners of West Virginia as well as the non-miners will have an opportunity within the next few days to see the real posture of the UMW leadership as it concerns the health and safety of its members. The House Judi\u00ad ciary Committee, under the chairmanship of Del. J. Ned Watson of neighboring Fair\u00ad mont, is to report out a bill concerning black lung. The strength and fate of that legislation will be the real test of sincere interest in the miners' life by those sworn to preserve it. The action in Charleston wm also be a harbinger of what we can possibly anticipate in Wash\u00ad ington. The UMW has a splendid opportunity to cleanse itself of past sins, real and imagined. We would hope that the union takes full ad\u00ad vantage of this opportunity. Also, we would hope that West Virginia's legislators w111 avail themselves of the opportunity to do something for coal miners for a change rather than continued enchantment with the now booming black gold they harvest. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 8, 1969] UMW RESTRICTS ITS MEMBERS (By Ray Martin) Article Ill of West Virginia's Constitution proclaims: \"All men are, by nature, equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity, namely: the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\" Another section of that same Article de\u00ad clares: \"The right of the people to assemble in a peaceable manner, to consult for the common good, to instruct their representa\u00ad tives, or to apply for redress of grievances, shall be held inviolate.\" The authors of the United Mine Workers of American Constitution appear to ignore these constitutional mandates as well as sim\u00ad ilar protection embodied in the United States Constitution. The UMW Constitution, including the one adopted in Denver, on Sept. 9, 1968, leads to the conclusion that some of the rights of citizenship in a democratic society are ex\u00ad pressly forbidden if they are exercised to the detriment of the union's hierarchy. The position of the UMW leadership in Washington toward persons outside the union who have expressed views on miners' health and safety needs is well known. Per\u00ad sons who espouse such views are regarded as \"finks,\" which, according to the UMW Jour\u00ad nal, is used interchangeably with \"spy, strikebreaker, informer and stool pigeon among other things.\" The chief targets of this kind of in vec\u00ad tive on the part of the mine workers' union leaders have been individuals such as Ken Hechler, U.S. Representative from West Vir\u00ad ginia's Fourth District, and Ralph Nader, the Washington-based consumer protection cru\u00ad sader. And in West Virginia the Black Lung Association came under UMW fire for leading the drive for tougher legislation than that UMW advocated. But what about the miners themselves?\u00ad particularly those who have chosen to exer\u00ad cise their civil rights? Do they face retribution from the UMW hierarchy? Yes, if the provisions of the UMW Consti\u00ad tution and letters of District officials were to be implemented. The UMW Constitution provides the black gold spike with which the miner is deprived of fundamental rights under the U.S. and west Virginia constitutions as well as provi\u00ad sions of the National Labor Relations Act. This spike is not limited to coal mining matters. It could be used to silence a miner on any question which the heirarchy decides is against the union's interest. The fact that the NLRB regards as illegal threats to employes that they will lose their jobs unless they support the union's actiVi\u00ad ties hasn't deterred the UMW's position at all. A miner can't work in a UMW-organized mine unless he holds a membership in the union. Late last month the presidents of the sev\u00ad eral UMW Districts in West Virginia sent letters to their respective locals regarding black lung legislation which was to be intro\u00ad duced in the State Legislature. After calling for support of the UMW\u00ad AFL-CIO bills introduced by the Senate president and the Speaker of the House, the letters said : \"No doubt you are aware of the self-ap\u00ad pointed group which is now sending letters to all local unions, not only in West Virginia, but in Kentucky and Virginia, soliciting funds to pay an attorney $10,000 they are alleged to have hired to prepare a compensa\u00ad tion bill. As working members of District (the number), you are now paying an at\u00ad torney to handle your legal affairs, under the compensation law, and some of the best legal minds in West Virginia had a part in preparing the UMWA Bill, as stated above. Therefore, your local union has no authority to donate money from the treasury, to some unknown group which, in my opinion, is dual to the UMW A, to be used for any purpose they see fit.\" The UMW Constitution provides for the imposition of penalties on its members for support of or aid to \"dual\" organizations. These penalties include suspension and ex\u00ad pulsion from the union. In the case of West Virginia's effort to ob\u00ad tain legislation to make moconiosis a compensable disease, it appar\u00ad ently mattered not that the effort was launched by coal miners themselves. Miners who had in the main been frustrated by the UMW hierarchy which now, in e1fect, threat\u00ad ens them with loss of their jobs. The UMW leadership also sent out direc\u00ad tives limiting the number of miners who could attend the Feb. 11 hearing in Charles\u00ad ton to two from each local union. Many unions, particularly in the southern part of the state, chose to ignore the direc\u00ad tives from the respective District presidents. Article XX, Section 3 of the UMW Consti\u00ad tution states: \"Any member guilty of slandering or circu\u00ad lating, or causing to be circulated, false statements about any member or any mem\u00ad bers circulating or causing to be circulated any statement wrongfully condemning any decision rendered by any officer of the Orga\u00ad nization, shall, upon conviction, be sus\u00ad pended from membership for a period of six months and shall not be eligible to hold of\u00ad fice in any branch of the Organization for two years thereafter.

In addition, the current contract between the UMW and coal mine operators says rela\u00ad tive to the enforcement of coal mine in\u00ad spectors' reports, that \"whenever either party to the contract feels that compliance with the recommendations of the federal mine inspectors as provided. above would cause irreparable dam.age or great injustice, they may appeal such recommendation to the Joint Industry Safety Committee as hereinafter provided.\" The joint management-union committee can issue a ruling which supersedes the in\u00ad spectors' findings and recommendation for correction of safety violations.

Beecher Charm\u00ad bury, Secretary of Mines and Mineral Indus\u00ad tries in Gov. Raymond P. Shafer's cabinet, confirmed Monday that he had been offered the post as director, U.S. Bureau of Mines. Charmbury, who assumed the Pennsyl\u00ad vania post on Jan. 30, 1963, as an appointee of former Gov. William Scranton, said he had made no decision on the possible acceptance of the federal post under Secretary of the Interior Walter Hickel. \"There are a lot of things to be considered,\" Charmbury said. He declined to give any indication of when he might make a decision on the federal job offer. Charmbury would succeed John F. O'Leary, a Democrat, who has held the Bureau of Mines post for the past four months. O'Leary, 42, was an economist at the Fed\u00ad eral Power Commission until he was named to the Bureau of Mines directorate by Presi\u00ad dent Johnson. Robert Bloom, Governor Shafer's secre\u00ad tary, said the 54-year-old mine secretary talked with the Governor Friday following a visit to Washington. \"The decision on acceptance of the federal post is up to Dr. Charmbury,\" Bloom said, adding that as of late Monday afternoon he (Charmbury) had not indicated he would resign from the state post. Delbert Klaus, personnel official at the In\u00ad terior Department in Washington, takes a different view of Charmbury's job status, however. \"I don't think it was a definite offer of a job,\" Klaus said. \"He was interviewed. He is deserving and is getting consideration.\" Klaus said Dr. Karl McMurray conducted the departmental interview with the Penn\u00ad sylvanian. The directorship of the Bureau of Mines is a presidential appointment and, generally, the recommendation of the secretary is ac\u00ad cepted by the White House. February 24, 1969 Neither Secretary Hickel nor McMurray were available for comment on the Charm\u00ad bury appointment. Reports of the impending appointment of Charmbury to succeed O'Leary sparked com\u00ad ments from two West Virginians who have been in the forefront of the effort to obtain better health and safety conditions in coal mines. Rep. Ken Hechler, a Huntington, W. Va., Democrat, Monday urged coal miners and their families to write to President Nixon, asking him to retain O'Leary as director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Hechler made his appeal at a Washington news conference after the appearance of a published report that O'Leary would be re\u00ad placed by Charmbury. \"I urge every coal miner, every miner's widow and every coal miner's youngster whose father was killed or disabled in the mines to write to President Nixon and urge that O'Leary stay on the job,\" Hechler said. The Fourth District congressman who has been fighting with the coal industry and the United Mine Workers because he feels they are lax in providing safety and health standards for miners, also criticized an an\u00ad nouncement by Labor Secretary George P. Schultz. Shultz announced he would postpone for 90 days the limits on the amount of coal dust in coal mines at some 300-400 mines which receive federal contracts. \"These limits of three miligrams of coal dust per cubic meter of air were to go into effect at midnight last night, but now they have been postponed for 90 days because of the National Association of Manufacturers and some coal producers have objected,\" Hechler said. The labor secretary said last Thursday he wanted time to study the requirements before putting them into effect. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare announced on Dec. 9, 1968, that three milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air was a recommended standard of coal dust to protect the coal miner against pneumoconiosis, or black lung. Hechler added that O'Leary should be retained because \"his dismissal would be a victory for the special interests who oppose vigorous enforcement of the law.\" Hechler said he was hopeful that con\u00ad gressional hearings on health and safety legislation would begin in mid-March. The Nixon administration has not submitted its recommendations on coal bills yet. Dr. I. E. Bu1f, Charleston, W. Va., heart specialist and chairman of the Physicians, Committee for Miners Health and Safety, said the departure of O'Leary would cause the miners \"to lose hope that the mines Will be made safe.\" Dr. Bu1f described the replacement of O'Leary as a \"death knell\" for the cause of \"mine safety and health.\" The Charlestonian said that O'Leary had accomplished more in four months than all of his predecessors. \"For the first time in history, many laws were being enforced and inspectors were not informing mine owners of the visits in ad\u00ad vance,\" Dr. Buff said. Dr. Buff also voiced his criticism of Labor Secretary Schultz's action in postponing Sec\u00ad retary Wirtz's order concerning the level of coal dust in mines. Referring to Shultz's statement that he had received telegrams from what Dr. Buff termed \"the vested interests\" who com\u00ad plained that the be \"too expensive,\" Dr. Bu1f said: \"Is it really too expensive to save lives or is this just a means of making more money?\" O'Leary ordered a vigorous enforcement of federal mine safety regulations and advo\u00ad cated stricter new safety rules. After the underground explosion and fire February 24, 1969 that took the lives of 78 miners at Farming\u00ad ton, w. Va., last Nov. 20, O'Leary stated pub\u00ad licly that the Bureau of Mines had not been doing a satisfa<:tory job of promoting safety In mines. In his short time on the job, O'Leary startled the old-line staff at the U.S. Bureau of Mines-an agency that former Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall called \"timorous and almost apologetic\" in its regulation of the mining industry-by in\u00ad sisting that the Bureau \"represent the pub\u00ad lic interest rather than the industry alone.\" O'Leary has been reminding top aides at the Bureau's Washington headquarters that, despite the Bureau's new safety campaign, 42 miners have died in accidents in the 63 working days since the Farmington disaster. O'Leary has come under pressure since his order last month to the Bureau's inspec\u00ad tors to make unannounced spot checks of coal mine compliance with federal safety rules. This step involved an element of surpris~ that the Bureau rarely tried before although it ls directed to do so by existing laws. The O'Leary direct! ve was one of several issued after the West Virginia mine ex\u00ad plosion. He also set up provisions for miners to petition his office directly when they sus\u00ad pected that federal laws and regulations were being violated at their places of work. The identity of the complainants was kept secret and inspectors were sent from Wash\u00ad ington rather than the field office which nor\u00ad mally inspected the mines in question. Over 600 spot checks were made 1n De\u00ad cember alone, compared with 137 in all of 1967. With the power to close mines only with evidence of \"immiment disaster\" or \"unwarrantable disregard\" or previously re\u00ad ported safety violations, the inspection staff under O'Leary's directives since November has ordered workers temporarily out of more than 200 coal mines considered unsafe. Dur\u00ad ing the entire previous 10 months, only 129 such closure orders were issued: Charmbury, a graduate of Gettysburg State College received his master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania and his doc\u00ad torate at Pennsylvania State University. Between 1937 and the time of his state appointment in 1963, Charmbury taught and conducted research at Penn State. He was head of the Mineral Preparations Depart\u00ad ment. Whlle associated with the university, Charmbury served as a consultant to sey\u00ad eral coal companies and municipalities. He explained that he also served metallic and non-metallic mining companies. In 1958 he was elected as a member of the Centre County Republican Executive Committee and became its chairman two years later. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 19, 1969] MINERS BACK O'LEARY The three-member safety committee of Local 1058, United Mine Workers of America, last night appealed to President Nixon to retain John O'Leary as director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The committee, representing miners who work at Humphrey No. 7 mine at Mt. Morris, Pa., made its views known in a telegram which was sent to the President. Text of the telegram was as follows: \"John O'Leary may be new to the job as Bureau of Mines director, but in four months he has discovered what his many predeces\u00ad sors should have known and did nothing about-the lack of safety and healthful working conditions in the mines of this na\u00ad tion. He had identified the problem and dili\u00ad gently sought the answers without fear or favor and this is the kind of guardian llfe in the mines demands. \"Like changing horses in midstream, to de-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS prive the miners of America an equal chance to live and breathe at this time through fail\u00ad ure to retain Mr. O'Leary will be to confine them to another three decades of eternal fear and needless death and misery suffered through injury. \"Politics has no place in law enforcement and the ability to get the job done ls what counts. Mr. O'Leary has that abllity. \"Mr. President, you have a golden oppor\u00ad tunity to restore the American miners' faith in justice and equality before the law and God. Failure to keep Mr. O'Leary as the Bu\u00ad reau of Mines director will result in as bleak and black a picture of life as the black gold which we mine day in and day out. \"Please, Mr. President, keep the faith and remember those who have died because there wasn't a Mr. O'Leary around to protect them.\" [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 19, 1969] MINE WORKERS' JOURNAL LEVELS NEW A'ITACK AT OPPONENTS (By Ray Martin) WASHINGTON.-The United Mine Workers of America, through its official publication, the United Mine Workers Journal, has lev\u00ad elled a new attack against some of the indi\u00ad viduals and groups seeking to improve coal mine health and safety through more strin\u00ad gent measures than those recommended by theUMW. While dropping the label \"fink,\" which ap\u00ad peared in the Feb. 1 issue of the Journal, the mine workers' publication released Tuesday continued to stress that the UMW and its president, W. A. (Tony) Boyle, are the key and virtually sole tacticians in the cause of miners' health and safety. After reporting that 309 American coal miners died last year in coal mine accidents, the Journal in a Page One message to UMWA members states: \"This is a sorry record and no one--least of all the above mentioned safety directors (the safety director of the International Union, United Mine Workers of America, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the safety director of the Bituminous Coal Op\u00ad erators Association) who are experts on the field-tries to minimize the record. \"So, what do we do about it? \"Well this organization most urgently seeks the support of all parties now con\u00ad cerned with coal mine health and safety. We find some of the 'support' a little hard to take. There are a lot of 'instant experts' who, finding that the November disaster in Mannington, W. Va., was 'hot news and could get them time on television and head\u00ad lines in newspapers, jumped at the opportu\u00ad nity to sound off. \"This Union, as we have said so many times before and repeat here, has been at the business of trying to get more safety and better health in American coal mines since its establishment in 1890. The labor organiza\u00ad tions that preceded the establishment of the United Mine Workers of American on Jan. 25, 1890, in Columbus, Ohio, also were primarily concerned with coal mine safety. More than with the question of wages, the men who founded the United Mine Workers of America and the leaders of our Union ever since then have been basically con\u00ad cerned with safety. UMWA President W. A. Boyle carries on this vital work in the great tradition of his predecessors. \"Those who publicly attack this Union and its president, for whatever reason, on the question of coal mine health and safety are being dishonest. We charge that their real motive, in many cases, ls to prevent any constructive action at either the federal or state levels. \"We took the occasion to check back through some of our microfilm of old Jour\u00ad nals the other day. The record of death and 4239 injury in American coal mines in the past was shocking. But it was not as shocking last year as it used to be. \"We have made some progress because of the never-ending battle by this Union, and to a great extent this Union alone, in the fight to save lives. This is not for one minute to argue that more cannot and should not be done. \"As previously reported, this Union has once again, initiated legislation at the fed\u00ad eral and state levels to try to solve the problems and to bring greater health and safety to coal miners. Many details were contained in the Feb. 1 issue of this publica\u00ad tion. More are in this issue. \"The nit-pickers are now at work, of course. You will hear and read that our proposals, based on nearly 80 years of experience as THE representative organization of American coal miners are 'inadequate,' or is 'too ex\u00ad treme,' or 'won't work,' or can't be enacted into law, or are not based on true facts. \"Such charges are, of course, outright lies. The legislation being supported by the United Mine Workers of America in the 9lst Con\u00ad gress and at the state level is, in the con\u00ad sidered judgment of the leaders of this Union the best legislation that can be proposed. It ls practical, realistic, humanitarian legisla\u00ad tion designed to accomplish the objectives sought by the men who work in the coal mines of America, the men whose lives are at stake. \"At this writing we do not know what the outcome will be 1n our battle for new safety and health legislation. We do know that all coal miners are going to have to help. And that includes every man who works in a coal mine in the United States and every leader of every Local Union and every District or\u00ad ganization of the United Mine Workers of America. \"The opposition wm try to divide you, as usual. The opposition, aided by some seg\u00ad ments of press and television who are not interested in saving lives but are interested in stirring up a name-calling fight for the amusement of the public, this opposition will engage in dirty strategy and tactics as it al\u00ad ways has. \"But this Union does not intend and will not be diver.ted from its objective because of such tactics. \"Our advice to the members of the United Mine Workers of America is to 'keep your cool'-as the saying goes.

It's your lives and your lungs that are at stake. \"With your support, this Union will win the fight to make the nation's coal mines safer and to solve the problem of coal work\u00ad ers' pneumoconlosis, or 'black lung.' \" The Journal message was written by Justin McCarthy, editor of the twice-a-month pub\u00ad lication.

The We1:1t Vir\u00ad ginia Legislature will conclude its 1969 ses\u00ad sion on March 8, 17 days from today. What is the status of these legislative pro\u00ad posals? What kind of bill, if any, will be en\u00ad acted into law? Will the placards in evidence at the State Capitol on Feb. 11, date of the six-hour hearing, which read: \"No law, no coal\", be implemented to the full meaning of their words? Sen. William T. Brotherton Jr., D-Charles\u00ad ton, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com\u00ad mittee said his committee plans to take no action on the amendments to the Workmen's 4240 Compensation Act until the Senate gets the bill from the House of Delegates. Brotherton along with Sen. Robert K. Holi\u00ad day, D-Oak Hill, is a sponsor of Senate Bill 216, which was drafted by the West Virginia Black Lung Association. House Speaker Ivor F. Boiarsky, D-Charles\u00ad ton, said he thought that the House Judici\u00ad ary Committee might report out a black lung bill tomorrow. Whether this happens or not, Boiarsky said, dependent on Del. J. E. Ned Watson, D-Fairmont, chairman of the com\u00ad mittee. Watson had hopes that his committee might report the bill out. But, he wasn't really sure it would and he didn't know what kind of a measure it would be. The :Flalllrmont Democrat was posiit.tve abouit only one thing; the bill whiCh comes out of his commi'ttee won't be a.ny of ithose which were referred to lit. Del. T. E. Myles, D-Fayettevme, ils chair\u00ad man of the Judiciary subcommittee which has been given responsibility by Watson for the shape that the Workmen's Compensa\u00ad tion Act amendments take. The Myles subcommittee will prepare a committee substitute bill, Watson said, not\u00ad ing \"that none of the bills do what the com\u00ad mittee desires.\" The sulbstit'lllte measure had not been wr1Jt\u00ad ten as of Wednesday, Wa.tson told The !Do\u00ad minion-News. The House Judiciary Committee chairman said that he was not aware of any opposition to the basic black lullg proposal. The princi\u00ad ple behind pending legislation is the recog\u00ad nition of pneumoconiosis, or black lung, as a compensable disease under state laws. Watson said he didn't foresee any difficulty in getting the bill to the floor of the House for a vote after it is reported out by his com\u00ad mittee. Since Friday, Feb. 14, all bills must be approved by the House Rules Committee before they are placed on the special calen\u00ad dar for action of the House. The Senate has been operating under the special calendar rules since Monday, Feb. 10. Advocates of the more liberal black lung proposals, which encompass increased com\u00ad pensation for all injured workers and a pre\u00ad sumption clause pertaining to pneumoco\u00ad niosis, have expressed concern over the legis\u00ad lative timetable. Dr. I. E. Buff, Charleston heart specialist and ob.airman of the Physicians' Committee for Miners' Health and Safety, speculated that the timetable may doom the measure. Dr. Buff, recalling difficulties surrounding the actual introduction of the bill sponsored by the Black Lung Association, said the hear\u00ad ing on the measure was first set for Feb. 5. It was then postponed until Feb. 11, a day after the Senate's special calendar rule be\u00ad came operative. The hearing on the monetary phase of the Workmen's Compensation Act amend\u00ad ment was then continued until Monday, Feb. 17, a date after the House special cal\u00ad endar rule went into effect. The Charlestonia.n, who is a member of the state Air Pollution Control Commission, expressed dual fears concerning the pend\u00ad ing legislation. He suggested the possib111ty that House action would be delayed until the last day of the session, thus precluding any vote on the measure in the Senate. He said that it was also conceivable that the Senate Rules Committee might delay the b111, assuming it did get to the Senate before the final day of the 1969 session. Dr. Buff said opponents of the black lung measure are trying to confuse the public and the legislators about the intent of the presumption clause. \"They would have you believe,\" Dr. Buff said, \"that we want the law to say that just because a man worked in the coal mines for a specified number of years he con\u00ad tracted pneumoconiosis and therefore is en\u00ad titled to compensation for life. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS \"This is simply not so,\" Dr. Buff de\u00ad clared. \"The presumption clause means that if a miner shows the tangible signs of pneu\u00ad moconiosis after working in the mines for a prescribed period of time he is presumed to have contracted the ailment as the result of his employment. \"Even that isn't final, because the em\u00ad ployer ls provided the opportunity to prove, if he can, that the disease was not related to the worker's occupational activity. In short, it shifts the burden of proof from the worker to the employer,\" Dr. Buff said. David D. Johnson, a Charleston lawyer representing the West Virginia Coal Asso\u00ad ciation, told the Senate Judiciary Commit\u00ad tee this week that \"if a substantial part of the proposed increases in workmen's com\u00ad pensation are enacted, the end result will be a lot of now active coal miners being un\u00ad employed .\" At the Feb. 11 hearing Johnson publicly praised the approaches taken by George Bur\u00ad nette, an attorney for United Mine Workers Districts 6, 17, 29 and 31, who voiced oppo\u00ad sition to the Black Lung Association's more liberalized proposal. \"I find it difficult to believe that pro\u00ad ponents of these measures believe that the coal industry could withstand a substantial part of this increase,\" Johnson told the sen\u00ad ators this week. \"It appears that the pro\u00ad ponents have given little thought to, or paid less attention to, how the cost of these pro\u00ad posals would affect the coal industry. \"Contrary to the apparent assumption be\u00ad ing made by these proponents,\" the profit margin in the coal industry today is very narrow. Many operators employing a large number of miners are in serious economic trouble. In fact, a considerable number of other opera tors are ska ting on thin ice financially,\" said Johnson. He focused attention on recently published reports which he said showed a drastic de\u00ad cline in the net income and earnings per share in some of the more prominent coal companies in West Virginia. Johnson referred to a group of 10 coal companies operating 28 mines in the state who disclosed their margin of realization on their 1968 production, in excess of 18 million tons. (West Virginia's annual production is about 700 million tons.) The report, Johnson said, showed that of these 10 companies, three actually lost money in 1968 and of the remaining seven companies, three had a margin of realization (the difference between cost of production and the selling price of coal) of 10 cents a ton or less. \"Under West Virginia's present compen\u00ad sation law, minimum weekly benefits are al\u00ad ready higher than 35 states and the present maximum benefits are equal to or higher than 18 states,\" the Coal Association spokes\u00ad man told the Senators. \"Furthermore,\" said Johnson, \"A com\u00ad parison of the minimum and maximum benefits in West Virginia and other states doesn't tell the whole story. Unlike many other states, West Virginia has no limit to the amount of benefits which can be paid out to a totally disabled workman or to widows in the event of fatalities.\" Earlier this month, Robert E. Lee Hall, senior vice present of the National Coal As\u00ad sociation, told. officials of the Joy Manu\u00ad facturing Co. at Franklin, Pa., that mecha\u00ad nization of the coal industry during the past two decades increased the average daily out\u00ad put of a miner from six tons a day to 19.17 tons per day. It also helped to lower cost, he said. The average f.o.b. mine price of coal per ton in 1967 was $4.62-37 cents a ton cheaper than it was in 1948. Because the prospects of increased coal production are so good, many coal companies a.re now subsidiaries of major oil companies, he said. In fact, Hall said, \"there ls hardly February 24, 1969 a major oil company that is not looking seriously at some ooal company.\" [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 20, 1969] ENORMOUS STEP BACKWARD IN MINE SAFETY\u00ad EXPERTS DISCUSS NEED FOR ACTION (By Ray Martin) The current issue of the Unit.ed. IMlne Workers Journal, contains statements con\u00ad cerning health and safety. Following an annual custom instituted in 1955, the Journal includes statements by the UMWA safety director, the director of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and the safety di\u00ad rector of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association. By Lewis E. Evans, UMWA Safety Director. In 1968 coal mine safety took an enormous step backward, both in reality and in the eyes Of the public. Th\u00b7e tragic reality was that there were 309 fatalities during the year, a horrible contrast with 1967, when 200 were killed. The impact on the public was made by a Nov. 20 coal mine explosion and fire at the Consol No. 9 mine near Farmington, W. Va., where 78 men were killed. The bodies were sealed in the mines after a dramatic, but futile rescue effort. No one yet knows what caused this horrible disaster but in my mind it would seem almost a sure thing that it was caused by haste and the pressure for production. This one tragedy focused the eyes of net\u00ad work TV cameras on the nation's coal mines and brought out the sharpest and most criti\u00ad cal reporting in history on the coal industry in the nation's newspapers and magazines. Not only were the news media attracted to telling the story of the tragedy itself, but inevitably to probe into the general subject of coal mine health and safety in our nation. It is sad but true that every advance made in coal mine safety legislation has come after a horrible disaster. This time we must again press for improvements in legislation that would protect the coal miner not only from explosion and fire but from the every-day hazards which their deadly but unpublicized toll. Roof falls kill more coal miners by far than any other type of accident. The UMW A will insist that present roof-control proce\u00ad dures be immediately improved by manage\u00ad ment under existing laws, and will also in\u00ad sist that the federal law be made mandatory instead of permissive insofar as proper roof\u00ad control procedures are concerned. The fact that 99 men died under roof falls in coal mines is as much of a disgrace to the industry as the fact that 78 men died in an explosion Nov. 20. If coal mine operators are ingenious enough to bring productivity to the fantastic heights of today they should be ingenious and humane enough to put money and effort into solving the problem of how to stop the slaughter and maiming of men under roof falls in the mines they own and operate .... I would like to point out that deaths in coal mines are completely unnecessary. I believe that each and every one of the 309 men who died last year should be alive to\u00ad day. It is primarily the duty of management of the coal industry to operate its mines safely. It is also the duty of federal and state gov\u00ad ernment enforcement agencies to enforce laws now on the books. It is up to our Safety Committees to protect the men in the mines who elect them to their positions. UMWA President W. A. Boyle has ordered every member of the staff of the Internation\u00ad al Union to fight for improved safety and health legislation. This we are doing and will continue to do as long as our union exists. The 1968-death reoord in the coal mines ... probably was merely the same old, sad story of inadequate laws, timid or operator-domi\u00ad nated enforcement of those laws, and the February 24, 1969 continuation of the made production race where human lives are sacrificed to make money. By JOHN O'LEARY, Director, U.S. Bureau of Mines: For everyone who has an interest in the future of coal, and especially for those of us who share responsibility for the lives and health of coal miners, 1968 was a bitter year. Even before the tragic events of Farming\u00ad ton, W. Va., shocked the entire nation late in November, the industry's health and safe\u00ad ty record had become a matter of concern. The fatality-frequency rate for the first nine months of 1968 already had exceeded sub\u00ad stantially the rate recorded !or all of 1967, a year that ironically had seen the lowest fatal\u00ad ity rate ever achieved in the history of Amer\u00ad ican coal mining. Not for a quarter of a cen\u00ad tury has the fatality rate soared as high as le did last year. The Farmington disaster, with the fate of its 78 victims in doubt for nine agonizing days, generated light and heat that spread to every segment of the industry and to the governmental institutions , state and federal, that have authority and responsibility for coal mine health and safety. Through tele\u00ad vision, radio, and the daily press, the eyes of the nation were focused on us all. To the Bureau of Mines, a basic truth be\u00ad came quickly apparent. We recognized that, regardless of our good intentions and our dedication to the cause of health and safety, we had not fully utmzed the limited au\u00ad thority given us under the law. Whatever the reasons, we had failed to discharge all of the responsibility entrusted to us. In the months that have passed since Farmington, we have done everything in our power to rec\u00ad tify that failure. In following our present course, we rea\u00ad lized that the law we now have cannot guarantee safe and healthful working condi\u00ad tions for every coal miner. No law, by itself can provide such a guarantee; though a law more realistic than the existing one most certainly is needed, and we can look for its passage during 1969 .... In the last analysis, however, neither law nor research can be expected to free coal mine management and coal mine workers from their ultimate responsib111ty for the in\u00ad dustry's safety record. By accepting that re\u00ad sponsibility by dedicating themselves to their own best interests, they can help assure that the deplorable record of 1968 is not repeated in 1969 or in any of the years to come. By ROBERT L. VINES, Safety Director, Bitu\u00ad minous Coal Operators Association: In keep\u00ad ing with its 79-year history of leadership in the movement to improve safety in the coal mines, it is fitting that the United Mine Workers start the new year with a review in the Journal of coal mine safety and with a forecast for the future. A review of the record of fatal and nonfatal mine accidents since the U.S. Bureau of Mines started keeping those records in 1930 shows a reduction of 86 per cent in total number of coal mine accidents. This reduction in accidents would not have been accomplished without the joint effort of the miners, under the leadership of the International Union, the coal operators guided by their industry leaders, and the federal and state mine safety agencies. The tragic Mannington disaster in Novem\u00ad ber, 1968, has caused some individuals to lose sight of the great improvement in coal mine safety that has been made in the past and has caused them to forget those who have been responsible for making this marked improvement. It has provided an opportunity for these individuals to use this tragic loss of life to advance their own personal ambitions by criticizing those who lose the most when such a disaster _ occurs-the mine workers and the mine operators. The greatest asset of any coal mine is not CXV---468-Part 4 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS its huge reserve of the raw material which is so essential to the strength and progress of our nation, nor is it the equipment and investment needed to mine the coal. Our greatest asset is the men who do the work of mining the coal. This is evidenced by the fact that a new man entering the mine today can expect to be paid more than half a mil\u00ad lion dollars for his services. We, intend to protect these men, our great\u00ad est asse);S, through continued and ever-in\u00ad creasing efforts to improve safety in coal mines. Many of the member companies of Bi.1mminlous Ooa;l Operators' Assooiialtnon, through cooperative efforts of the mine workers, supervisors and managers, have achieved better accident frequency records than the average for all industries. It ls our aim that by giving our support to construc\u00ad tive and meaningful legislation designed to improve mine safety that the safety record for our entire industry will reach this level. As employers, we are equally concerned with the health of our employes and their families. In the few short years since the Welfare and Retirement Fund was created by the Union contract, to be financed by payment made by the mine operators, the life expeotancy of coal miners has risen, from a level considerably below the national aver\u00ad age, to a point where the coal miner can now expect to live years longer than the average American male. We cannot rest on these laurels. Recent government studies have shown that about 10 coal miners in 100 have coal workers pneum<>COilli.osi.s, which .ts 8IIl X-ray showing ithd.s con.dd.\u00ad tion can sometimes lead to disabllity. The coal industry can and will solve this prob\u00ad lem by finding the means of providing the coal miner with a working environment which will control pneumoconiosls. Through constructive legislation for the improvement of mine safety and health and through the continued efforts of the mine workers and operators, we can look forward to 1969 and future years to continue the impressive trend toward fewer injuries, bet\u00ad ter health, and still further increase in life expectancy of the men who mine the na\u00ad tion's coal. [From the Morgantown (W. Va.) Dominion\u00ad News, Feb. 22, 1969] JOHN O'LEARY GETS RANDOLPH ENDORSEMENT (By Ray Martin) WASHINGTON.-U.S. Bureau of Mines Di\u00ad rector John J. O'Leary received a strong en\u00ad dorsement Friday from U.S. Sen. Jennings Randolph, D. W.Va. The endorsement was contained in a mes\u00ad sage the West Virginian sent to Secretary of the Interior Walter J. ffickel. The senator requested Hickel to make O'Leary available as an official witness before the Senate Labor Subcommittee when it be\u00ad gins hearings on coal mine safety and health b1lls. Those hearings are scheduled to start next Thursday. Randolph, the ranking majority member of the subcommittee, introduced a coal mine health and safety bill based on proposals prepared under O'Leary's direction and sent to Congress by former Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall. West Virginia's senior senator sent the following message to mckel: \"The incumbent director of the U.S. Bu\u00ad reau of Mines, John J. O'Leary, is competent, capable, and diligent in the performance of the duties of that office. Under his di\u00ad rection, legislative proposals for recodifica\u00ad tion and modernization of coal mine safety and health laws have been prepared and presented to the Congress. \"I have confidence in Mr. O'Leary and his proposals. Hence, I introduced Senate Blll 355, and request that you make Mr. O'Leary 4241 available as an official witness when hearings on the substantive language of Senate Blll 355 and other measures are held. \"This would be subsequent to the open\u00ad ing hearing by the Senate Subcommittee on Labor on Feb. 27, when these measures will be brought formally to the attention of the subcommittee. Your cooperation and understanding will be appreciated,\" Ran\u00ad dolph concluded. On the other side of Capitol Hill, Rep. Ken Bechler, a Huntington Democrat, ex\u00ad pressed his concern about the current wave of miners' strikes in West Virginia. \"I can understand very well why the West Virginia coal miners are striking to drama\u00ad tize their grievances, and to call attention to the desperate need for state legislation on black lung and safety,\" Bechler said. \"But I don't feel that endless, bitter and disorganized strikes and walk-outs w111 either solve the problem or necessarlly result in good legislation. Rather, it would be better for the miners to select spokesmen for a meeting which has been scheduled for next Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the Charleston Mu\u00ad nicipal Auditorium. \"I am informed that at next Wednesday's meeting there will be an excellent opportu\u00ad nity for the coal miners and their represent\u00ad atives to voice a direct and clear-cut course of action for the legislature. In this way, a series of minimum legislative standards can be presented to those in a position to act in order to produce effective legislation,\" the Fourth District congressman said. Representative Bechler indicated that he had written to a number of coal miners in\u00ad terested in state legislation, urging them to attend next Wednesday's meeting and to in\u00ad sist on certain minimum s-tandards neces\u00ad sary to be included in any action by the State Legislature. March 4 has been set as the date for the start of hearings on mine safety and health legislation before a House Subcommittee on Labor. The hearings w111 continue until March 26. Among the measures to be considered are bills introduced by Rep. John Dent, D-Pa., chairman of the general labor subcommit\u00ad tee; Rep. Dari Perkins, D-Ky., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee; Rep. James O'Hara, D-Mich., and Represent\u00ad ative Bechler. The Senate Subcommittee on Labor, un\u00ad der the chairmanship of Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J., will begin its hearings next Thursday. At that time the committee will hear from mem\u00b7bers of the Senate rels\u00ad tl ve to the pending legislation. In addition one representative from the coal industry and one representative of the coal miners wlll be heard. Senator WilUams is the sponsor of the Sen\u00ad ate version of the bill introduced in the House by Representative Bechler. Senator Randolph has introduced two bills. One is the Bureau of Mines proposal sent up to Capitol HUI while Secretary Udall was in charge of the Interior Department. The other 1s one drafted by the United Mine Workers of America . The West Virginia senator said he expects that the UMW bill on mine safety as well as measures proposed by the Nixon Admin\u00ad istration wm be submitted before the com\u00ad mittee starts its hearings. Senator Randolph acknowledged that new laws are needed to improve the safety and health conditions under which the nation's coal miners work. He stressed that he was keeping an open mind on the subject until all the legislative proposals had been studied by the committee. \"If we legislate provisions technically un\u00ad obtainable or if obtainable only by closing the mines and wiping out the jobs of miners, we have failed in our mission,\" the West Virginian said. 4242 FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE-VIEWS OF A YOUNG AMERICAN HON. JOHN W. BYRNES OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BYRNES of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak\u00ad er, I am pleased to announce that the winner of the Voice of Democracy con\u00ad test in Wisconsin is a resident of my dis\u00ad trict, Mr. Leslie Fuszard, of Little Chute, Wis. The contest is sponsored by the Veter\u00ad ans of Foreign Wars and its ladies aux\u00ad iliary. The theme of this year's national competition is \"Freedom's Challenge.\" I commend Mr. Fuszard on his winning speech. This young American expresses a deep pride in this country's ideals while showing a mature awareness of current threats to freedom's continued existence in American society. Moreover, he read\u00ad ily accepts the responsibilities which the preservation of that freedom demands. The speech follows: FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE (By Leslie Fuszard) The most dangerous gift we have ever re\u00ad ceived ls freedom. I do not deny that it ls the most precious and should be jealously guarded. This gift, however, will soon destroy us unless we learn how to use it wisely. Take a look at this country today for an example. Everywhere there seems to be a sharp decline in morals: cheating where once there was honesty, crime where once there was respect for the law. Everywhere there seems to be a growing laxness, an indUier\u00ad ence, a softness that terrifies people when they think about it. Perhaps we have a blind and misguided concept of liberty. Maybe we are using our freedom of choice, gained for us by the bloodshed of our forefathers, to choose the wrong things. This ls where the confusion lles--in the choices a man makes as to the course of his life, and in the awareness that a wrong choice or none at an can turn his life into emptiness and futllity. \"Give us more freedom!\" has been man's incessant cry. This plea was valid when it was directed against tyranny or oppression, but we have pushed far beyond freedom from this. The freedom we now desire has come to mean freedom from all unpleasantness: from hardship, from discipline, and from the pains of self-sacrifice. Man wishes for fewer and more elastic rules, but this will weaken our courts and shake our government's foundations. Man longs for more leisure and less work, but this wm weaken him physi\u00ad cally and mentally. As a nation then, we have clamored for complete freedom. Now we just about have it and also face a bleak and horrifying truth: we have flung off one restraint after another, but in the process we have not learned how to control ourselves . There is a fear that if we do not learn to preserve our best values, some form of tyranny will surely take them from us. We should not be thinking so much about the freedom from tyranny our ancestors won as the chaos that freedom can bring to those who do not use it wisely. We must consider the truth of the old saying, \"A man's worst dlffi.culty begins when he ls able to do what\u00ad ever he likes,\" and we must be able to control ourselves. The time has come in our lives when we need to look straight into some of the ugly areas of our society-the crime, the weaken-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ing of family ties, the racial hatred, the death rate on our highways-end ask our\u00ad selves to what extent these things stem from a distorted concept of freedom which leaves man free to be lazy, to be selfish, and to be weak. Our generation ls looking for ideas in which we can believe and for which we can fight. We want peace, but not at the price of freedom. We would rather be challenged by hard work and self-sacrifice than shel\u00ad tered by society. Ours is a generation on the move, ready to be disciplined, ready to dare. We are an inspiration to our country and to the world! This enthusiasm and patrio\u00ad tism can be seen in the words of a young dying serviceman in his last letter to his parents: \"Believe me, I didn't want to die, but I know that it was part of my job. I want my country to live for billions and billions of years to come. I want it to stand as a light to all people oppressed and guide them to the same freedom we know. If we can stand and fight for freedom, then I think we have done the job God has set down for us.\" Therefore, if we can learn to choose the right things, not always the easy things; to keep from abusing our freedoms, not cring\u00ad ing from hardships or discipline, then our freedom has been used wisely and construc\u00ad tively-has met its challenge, and has triumphed. ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. THOMAS J. MESKILL OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MESKILL. Mr. Speaker, today as we observe Estonian Independence Day, we are reminded that Estonians form one of the smallest nationality groups in Europe, numbering just over 1 million in their homeland in northeastern Eu\u00ad rope. Their modern history is full of mis\u00ad fortune and misery. These sturdy and stouthearted peasants endured the op\u00ad pressive yoke of Russian czars for more than 200 years before they attained their freedom and independence early in 1918. The Estonians took advantage of the Russian revolution of 1917, broke away from the Russian state and proclaimed their national political independence on February 24, 1918. From that day on for about two decades they lived happily under the democratic institutions of their rebuilt country and were quite con\u00ad tent with their lot. That seemed to be their national desire, but their more powerful neighbor in the east seemed determined to eliminate democratic Es\u00ad tonia. The Communists of the Soviet Union had their chance to do this early in the last war. In mid-1940 Estonia was overrun and then occupied by the Red army, and became part of the Soviet Union. Since then, for nearly three dec\u00ad ades, unhappy Estonians have been liv\u00ad ing under tyranny in their once-free homeland. They still suffer under the ruthless agents of the Kremlin, and their lot is in many respects worse than it was under the callous agents of the czars. They have not, however, given up their national ideals, their desire to attain freedom and independence. Today on February 24, 1969 the 51st anniversary observance of Es\u00ad tonian independence day let us all pray for the deliverance of these peoples from Communist totalitarian tyranny. NIXON URGED TO PURSUE STRONG LIBERAL TRADE POLICY HON. PHILLIP BURTON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BURTON of California. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times on Sunday, February 23, 1969, had an article entitled \"Nixon Urged To Pursue Strong Liberal Trade Policy.\" When that urging comas from a man of the stature and experience of William M. Roth, it is a view which I should like to share with my colleagues. Mr. Roth, a native San Franciscan, was first appointed special representa\u00ad tive for trade negotiations in July 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. He served with distinction under President John\u00ad son as U.S. representative with the Ken\u00ad nedy round. William Roth is a public servant of the highest caliber and I enter the article from the New York Times by him, at this point in the RECORD: NIXON URGED To PuRsUE STRONG LIBERAL 'l'RADE POLICY (By Wlllia.m M. Roth) President Nixon has lost no time 1n mak\u00ad ing his position on trade policy clear. In his Inaugural Address he called for \"a world . . . open to the exchange of goods\" and at his second press conference he said: \"I believe that the interests of the United States and the interests of the whole world will best be served by moving toward freer trade rather than toward protection.\" My own views on future trade policy a.re set forth in detail in a report submitted to President Johnson last month. This report is the first comprehensive review of United States trade policy in more than a decade. It was based on the work of a number of task forces within the Government, as well as intensive discussions with a distinguished. public advisory committee appointed by President Johnson. The report concludes that our policy of trade liberalization and expansion has con\u00ad tributed importantly to the achievement of such major national goals as economic growth, full employment and higher real in\u00ad comes, and that it should be continued and strengthened. There have, of course, been changes 1n world trade in recent years. Because of the dramatic postwar economic growth of West\u00ad ern Europe and Japan, competition is keener than ever before. The patterns of trade have also been profoundly affected by the crea\u00ad tion of regional trading blocs, notably the European Common Market and EFI'A, and by the spectacular growth o<f great multi\u00ad national corporations. There are some who, citing these changes. maintain that our liberal trade policy has outlived its usefulness. They would have us take refuge in a commercial \"Fortress Amer\u00ad ica.\" The typical form that this economic neo-isolationlsm has taken ls the advocacy of restrictive import quotas. The professed objective ts \"orderly marketing-a euphe\u00ad mism for restraining competition through February 24, 1969 market sharing. This is in fa.ct the goal of the old-style cartels, which Americans have traditionally rejected as the antithesis of our system Of free competition and individual enterprises. For consumers, import quotas would mean higher prices and less freedom of choice. For producers, they would mean higher costs and impairment Of their ab1llty to meet foreign competition at home and abroad. For the economy as a whole, they would mean a further push toward inflation. Therefore, I welcome the President's statement that he takes \"a dim view\" of quotas, though I wish he had expressed the same opinion of voluntary quotas which 1n most cases are as unjustifiable as mandatory quotas. This is certainly true of those cur\u00ad rently being suggested for woolen and syn\u00ad thetic textiles. Trade expansion, with all its benefits, does result in occasional hardships. Our means of alleviating them can and must be signifi\u00ad cantly improved. My report recommends the liberalization of the present unduly strict criteria for obtaining \"escape-clause\" relief in the form of quotas or higher tariffs. It would be advisable, of course, for us to be 1n a position to provide compensation to those of our trading partners whose interests may be adversely affected-and for this purpose the President should be given authority by the Congress to make limited tariff adjust\u00ad ments. Similarly, the report recommends the lib\u00ad eralization of the criteria for adjustment assistance to individual firms and groups of workers--and for individual establishments within a firm, even when the firm itself may not be eligible for assistance. The criteria suggested for the granting of \"escape-clause relief to industry's are stricter than those for adjustment assistance. It is frequently the case that the weaker firms in an industry-those already falling behind their domestic competitors-are the ones that are most affected by imports. In such cases, across-the-board relief amounts, for the stronger firms, to a needless and unjusti\u00ad fiable windfall. Our over-all objective must be to help in\u00ad dustries and firms adjust to competition\u00ad not to shelter them from it indefinitely. It is therefore essential that \"escape-clause\" tariffs or quotas be regularly reviewed and that the firms concerned be required to re\u00ad port periodically on their progress toward meeting import competition. Internationally, the United States must continue to insist upon the principle of reci\u00ad procity. We can offer others access to our market only to the extent that they offer us access to theirs. We should continue to up\u00ad hold the rules of international trade em\u00ad bodied in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT). particularly the rule of non-discrimina tion in trade policy, but we must insist that others abide by them as well. The United States must take full advan\u00ad tage of the remedies available to it under the GATT whenever its interests are jeop\u00ad ardized by the actions of others. Indeed, we should put ourselves in an even stronger position to do so. We should amend our trade legislation to enable us to retaliate against 1llegal restrictions on our industrial exports as forcefully as we are already able to do in the case of agricultural products. There are many nontariff barriers that are not 1llegal. Together with its trading part\u00ad ners, the United States must work within GATT and bilaterally to reduce and even\u00ad tually eliminate them. We should begin by abolishing the American selling price system of customs valuation, an obsolete form of protection-which will enable us to realize the significant tariff and nonta.riff benefits embodied in a special agreement negotiated concurrently with the Kennedy Round. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Action against nontariff barriers is partic\u00ad ularly important for our farm exports. They are increasingly threatened by agricultural protectionism abroad, especially in the Com\u00ad mon Market. High price supports are pro\u00ad tected by high and variable duties against efficient outside suppliers, including the United States. The excess production they generate is being marketed on a subsidized basis in third countries, undercutting our own sales. Surpluses of dairy products in the Common Market have recently inspired a pro\u00ad posal to levy a heavy tax on oilseed products, menacing our very substantial soybean ex\u00ad ports. SPECIFIC TALKS URGED The current preparations for another gen\u00ad eral round of trade negotiations should be pressed vig\u00b7orously. Meanwhile , the United States should seek negotiations on specific nontarlff barriers wherever progress is pos\u00ad sible, as well as negotiations aimed at the elimination of tariff and nontariif barriers in particular industrial sectors. It is especially urgent that the nations take agricultural protectionism in hand before it provokes a major confrontation-and to do so they must be prepared to place their own domestic agri\u00ad cultural system on the bargaining table. One important respect in which the pres\u00ad ent GATT rules should be changed is in the field Of border tax adjustments. They now permit export rebates and levies on imports to compensate in full for domestic taxes on products, such as business sales taxes, based on the very dubious assumption that all such indirect taxes are passed on fully to the con\u00ad sumer. To the extent that such taxes are not passed on, these border adjustments are pro\u00ad tective and hurt our trade. We are seeking a satisfactory revision of the GATT rules and should continue to press hard for it in 1969. The United States must take account, in its trade policy, of the interests of the less\u00ad developed countries and give serious con\u00ad sideration to generalized preferences for them. We must consider means of extend\u00ad ing selective most-favored-nation treatment to the Communist countries of Eastern Europe, in return for equivalent commercial benefits. ACTIONS EXPLAINED During the last year and a half, balance-of\u00ad payments difficulties have repeatedly in\u00ad duced nations to take or. contemplate re\u00ad strictive trade measures. It is clear that the maintenance of an open trading world re\u00ad quires the strengthening of the world mone\u00ad tary system. Trade measures should be taken only under international supervision and as a temporary and supplementary means of easing balance-of-payments strains while more basic remedies are put into effect. And countries in surplus have an obligation to help in the adjustment process as well as the country that is in deficit. Finally, trade policy must be developed in full recognization of its close relationship with other economic policies, domestic and international. I believe that the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotations in the Executive Office of the President is well situated to fulfill this responsibility. During its six years of existence it has gained the confidence and cooperation of important sec\u00ad tors of American business, agriculture, labor and consumers . It seems to me urgent that the President appoint as special represent\u00ad ative a businessman of stature and that the status, budget and staff of his office be strengthened to measure up to its mission. As the world becomes more complex and interdependent, so do the problems of domes\u00ad tic and international economic policy. We must remember, however, how successful the basic thrust of American trade policy has been over the years. We must not risk all the gains we have made--rather, we should build upon them for the future. 4243 APOLLO 8, NA VY SATELLITE GET ENGINEERING HONORS HON. GILBERT GUDE OF MARYLAND IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. GUDE. Mr. Speaker, the Applied Physics Laboratory-APL-which has for more than a quarter of a century been a leader in Navy weapons research, today remains at the forefront of this research area. Guided missile technology is one area of their major achievement, but they face as well a broad spectrum of national needs in fields that included the peaceful uses of outer space, advanced air breath\u00ad ing engines, biomedical engineering, laser research, and urban transportation. The Applied Physics Laboratory was founded in Silver Spring, Md., in 1942 to pursue development of the radio prox\u00ad imity-VT-fuse which halted the threat of the buzz bomb over London and con\u00ad tributed materially to ending World War II. This success was followed by the in\u00ad vention of the supersonic ramjet-the flying stovepipe, as it was nicknamed\u00ad flown for the first time in 1945. This new defense for naval ships against high speed air attacks, guided bombs, and suicide planes opened the way for guided-missile defense of the fleet. By 1956, the guided-missile defense was in\u00ad stalled and operative in the U.S.S. Boston, and 2 years later a similar defense sys\u00ad tem, the \"Talos,\" existed on the U.S.S. Galveston. In succeeding years, numerous foreign countries have installed the \"Talos,\" or a smaller version of it, on their ships. Pioneering missile technology put APL in a position to accept other important challenges as they arose. When the Rus\u00ad sians launched their sputnik in 1957, APL scientists tracked it in orbit and from their calculations were able to provide the basis of a worldwide system of navigation. . From this beginning, the laboratory's space research and development efforts have evolved to include satellite naviga\u00ad tion, geodesy, and techniques for space\u00ad craft stabilization. More than 30 satel\u00ad lites designed by APL have performed successfully in orbit. With this auspicious background, it is not surprising that the Applied Physics Laboratory was recently honored for two of its projects. The Apollo 8 translunar :fiight and the Navy navigation satellite system have been named by the National Society of Professional Engineers as two of the top four engineering achievements of 1968. I am entering in the RECORD the following news article from the February 2, 1969, issue of the Evening Star news\u00ad paper, of Washington, D.C., with the thought that my colleagues and the Na\u00ad tion would want to make proper notice of this distinction most recently received by the Applied Physics Laboratory: APOLLO 8, NAVY SATELLITE GET ENGINEERING HONORS The Apollo 8 transluna.r flight and the Navy navigation satellite system developed by the 4244 Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring have been named two of the top four engineering achievements of 1968 by the National Society of Profes\u00ad sional Engineers. The Washington-based national association also listed a.s major achievements the Mera.\u00ad mec Power Plant in south St. Louis County, Mo., for its air pollution control system and the Palacio de Rio Hotel in San Antonio, Tex., for its unique crane-hoisted module construction. The Apollo moon voyage, under program direction of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency in Washington, was termed \"an unparalleled feat, attributable to the joint efforts of engineering and science.\" Program director for Apollo Samuel C. Phillips and mission director William C. Schneider are both of NASA headquarters here, as is George E. Mueller, assistant ad\u00ad ministrator for manned space flight. The Navy navigation satellite system de\u00ad veloped by the Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver Spring provides highly accurate world\u00ad wide, all-weather position information for surface vessels and submarines. It is used by the Navy in the Polaris sub\u00ad marine force and in major surface combat\u00ad ant ships. An adapted model for commercial shipping has been installed in Great Brit\u00ad ain's newest luxury liner, Queen Eliza.beth II, the laboratory reported. The navigation system involves measuring the \"Doppler shift\" of frequencir 3 trans\u00ad mitted from a satellite, to an accuracy of one part in a billion. The Glomar Challenger, oceanographic re\u00ad search vessel, the Navy's ocean research ship Mizar, and other oceanographic vessels are equipped with the sateIUte navigation system. ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. CHARLES W. SANDMAN OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. SANDMAN. Mr. Speaker, on Feb\u00ad ruary 24, all of the Estonians who are liv\u00ad ing in the free countries throughout the world will celebrate the 51st Independ\u00ad ence Day anniversary of the once free Republic of Estonia. Presently, Estonia is occupied by Soviet Russia. With the outbreak of World War II, Estonia was one of the first countries to experience the aggression of both Hitler and the Soviet Union. Russia's assault against its Baltic neighbors was the initial step westward in a ruthless march against Europe. The beginning of today's international tensions and threats to world peace may be found in the Soviet aggression against the Baltic States in 1940. Estonia, together with other nations behind the Iron Curtain, is waging a great struggle against world Communist expansion. Their fight for freedom is not only for their own liberation; it is also a fight for freedom in the world. We must not, for a minute, forget the fate of this and other nations who have contributed so much to civilization and whose right to self-government has so brutally been taken from them. All who cherish freed.om in the world have a com\u00ad mon interest, and likewise we share a .common threat. Estonian Independence EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Day, therefore, should be for Americans, a day of prayerful reflection and renewed dedication. FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE HON. JAMES H. (JIMMY) QUILLEN OF TENNESSEE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, Miss Mar\u00ad cella Elliott, a sophomore at Unaka High School, which is located in my district, has won first place in Carter County, Tenn., for her speech in the \"Voice of Democracy\" contest entitled \"Freedom's Challenge.\" Miss Elliott is an outstanding student and I know the future holds many won\u00ad derful things in store for her. It is indeed an honor for me to share such an outstanding achievement of one of my constituents with the readers of the RECORD: FREEDOM'S CHALLENGE What does democracy mean to the Ameri\u00ad can people? This is a question that few of us ever think about. We enjoy its privileges, such as freedom of speech, freedom of wor\u00ad ship, and the right to vote without really thinking of how precious they are to us. Democracy is a wonderful form of govern\u00ad ment, and almost every American would agree that the privileges it affords are indeed precious when we stop to consider them. But a.s we look around at all the violences, hatred, and turmoil within our country, many ask, \"If democracy is so wonderful, why does our country have more problems than many other countries that are governed in differ\u00ad ent ways? Has democracy failed us?\" Before we answer that question, let us consider how democracy got its start. Who is responsible for our nation's being demo\u00ad cratic? We, the people, choose our own gov\u00ad ernment. We formed and fought for democ\u00ad racy. Secondly, who has made it work for 200 years? Leaders selected by the people drew up our Constitution, and leaders se\u00ad lected by the people have put its laws in force. True, it has never been easy. Our country has always had its problems, but, through it all, it has been successful. And we, the people, are responsible for its suc\u00ad cess. But if the people can take credit for its past success, must we not also take the blame for its problems of today? Has democ\u00ad racy failed us--or have we failed democracy? We Americans seem to have forgotten that to everything there is challenge. Freedom is no exception . Even though the challenge of acquiring freedom was met in 1781, the chal\u00ad lenge of keeping our freedom and making democracy work is still very real today. Where did we fail? Perhaps one of the main areas of failure has been in taking our freedom for granted. In the past few years patriotism has become more and more a thing practiced only by children in grade school. Today, people who show flagrant dis\u00ad respect for their country get more attention than patriotic citizens. They are even ad\u00ad mired for their so-called courage. But the American who is not ashamed to stand up for his country is the person who has real courage. Even though most Americans are not flag burners, how many of us are flag saluters in the true sense of the word? When we salute the flag, do we think of what it means or do we do it mechanically? When we salute the flag, we are pledging our loyalty to our country. How can we fulfill this pledge in our everyday lives? February 24, 1969 For one thing, when we hear others crit\u00ad icizing democracy, we can point out its many advantages. This is a good way to prove our loyalty to those around us, and we might also influence their attitudes by taking this stand. Also, since so many young people are being deceived into ad.miring those who would tear our country apart, we should convince our friends that peaceful cbange is the only change that can benefit us. We must not misuse our privileges. Instead of using freedom of speech to condemn our country and its form of government, let us use this privilege to praise them. When we speak of freedom's challenge, we are speaking of a. challenge that has existed since the beginning of our country and is going to continue. Are we equal to it? We have been in the past, and there is no reason we cannot be now. The rewards will be well worth what we can do for our country. ABM DISCUSSION, FEBRUARY 26, 1969 HON. JEFFERY COHELAN OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVF.8 Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. COHELAN. Mr. Speaker, I have joined with several other Members of the House in scheduling a special order for Wednesday, February 26, 1969, t.o dis\u00ad cuss the question of ABM deployment. We recognize that a discussion of this type will not resolve all the outstanding questions. However, we hope that it will sharpen om\u00b7 understanding and focus the areas in which we are in doubt. I believe that it is important that every Member of the House have the oppor\u00ad tunity to study closely the arguments for and against the deployment of a lim\u00ad ited ABM. Accordingly, I would like at the conclusion of my remarks to include several pertinent items which may be of assistance to Members and their staffs in the course of deliberations on this most important matter. First, I will include the additional views from the rePort on the military construction appropriation for 1969. In these views, the gentlema::i from illinois (Mr. YATES), the gentleman from Con\u00ad necticut (Mr. GIAIMO), and myself have laid out the major facts which infiu\u00ad enced our conclusions that the Sentinel ABM should not be deployed. Second, I will include former Defense Secretary McNamara's speech of Sep\u00ad tember 18, 1967, in which he announced the decision t.o proceed with a limited Chinese-oriented ABM, but warned strongly against the deployment of an aDJti-Soviet ABM. Third, I will include an article from International Affairs by Mason Willrich again dealing with the ABM question. Fourth, I will include an article by Jeremy Stone, formerly of the Hudson Institute, in which he makes the case against ABM deployment in a paper published by the Institute for Strategic Studies. Finally, I will include an article by Robert L. Rothstein appearing in Foreign Affairs, April 1968. The material follows: February 24, 1969 ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF ROBERT N. GIAIMO, JEF\u00ad FERY COHELAN, SIDNEY R. YATES There is doub't amongst military and civil\u00ad ian defense experts about the desirability of deployment of an anti-ballistic missile sys\u00ad tem at this time. Similarly there is doubt in the academic and scientific communities over the desirability of ABM deployment. We want to take this occasion to express our doubt in the Congress over the wisdom of ABM de\u00ad ployment now. After a considerable study we find our\u00ad selves unconvinced that it is in the best in\u00ad terests of the United States to proceed with the deployment of a limited anti-ballistic missile defense at this time. We believe that ABM deployment now could well be unneces\u00ad sary, unwise and a misuse of precious fiscal and manpower resources. These are conclusions not idly arrived a. They are drawn largely from five simple facts. Limited ABM deployment will probably not save American lives in case of a Soviet attack. ABM deployment this year is not necessary to our security against China. ABM deployment threatens to escalate the arms race. ABM is enormously costly, especially at this time. ABM may be obsolete or ineffective even before it is operational. These are striking facts. But they are all ones which we believe can be supported with expert testimony. We would like to proceed with a brief re\u00ad view of each of these points. 1. The limited Sentinel ABM will probably not save American lives in case of a Soviet attack. This may seem startling-but it is the fact. It results simply because the Soviets, like ourselves, cannot refuse to respond to devel\u00ad opments by the other side which threaten their assured destruction capability. Accord\u00ad ingly, to overcome our ABM the Soviets would most likely deploy more and better equipped offensive missiles, and perhaps continue with or expand the deployment of their own light ABM. Because the Soviets, like ourselves, must prepare for the worst plausible case, they must prepare for an ABM which will be nearly perfect until it is overwhelmed. They wm thus build far more offensive capability than they need, and in the event of an ex\u00ad change, more damage wm be done to the United States than if they had not been forced to respond to our ABM deployment. Simply put, this means ABM may cost American lives, not save them. 2. ABM deployment this year is not neces\u00ad sary to our security against China. Again, this fact may seem striking in view of the common response to the statement of Secre\u00ad tary of Defense McNamara in September, 1967 that we had to act then to have our ABM in time for the supposed Chinese threat. Yet, statements made only a few weeks and months ago to the Congress by high officials of the Defense Department indicate that the Chinese are perhaps as much as a year be\u00ad hind the time table we estimated they would have to follow to have an ICBM in the mid 1970's. The turmoil in China continues. It would appear that with the Chinese a year behind or more, we could afford to postpone this declsion for at least a year while de\u00ad velopments in technology and in arms con\u00ad trol have an opportunity to work their will. In addition, we still find it remarkable that we do not believe that the offensive deterrent we possess against the Soviets will also be an adequate deterrent against the weaker Chinese. Further still we do not even know if the Chinese will deploy intercontinental missiles against which an ABM would be a defense, or if they do whether they wm not also build cheaper and less vulnerable sub\u00ad marine launched missiles, against which the Sentinel ABM will not be very effective. The Herbert Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University recently published a contingency study EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS \"Communist China and Arms Control.\" In it they staite- The recent U.S. decision to deploy a thin ABM system mounted against Communist China compounds Peking's problems in de\u00ad veloping a credible nuclear force. Obviously, China is now aware that she must find means to penetrate or circumvent these defenses Since any type of leadership (of China) would necessarily be committed to pursuit of the nuclear program, we can ex\u00ad pect each of them to bend every effort to overcome the strategic obstacles imposed by the (U.S.) ABM system. We believe that while the Chinese will rely primarily on a ground launched deterrent system, they may well seek to augment this with a submarine launched ballistic missile system (SLBM). Thus we anticipate that the major thrust in naval construction during the forthcoming decade will be toward ac\u00ad C!Uiring a fleet of transoceanic diesel-powered submarines, each equipped to launch three to four short or medium range ballistic mis\u00ad sile (range spread: 400-1,000 miles) from a deck-awash position. A fleet of fifty such boats, which-given priority-could be con\u00ad structed within ten years, would enable the Chinese to keep approximately twelve to fifteen on station southeast of Hawaii and off lower California for limited periods. This would provide insurance to their ICBM system. 3. ABM deployment threatens to escalate the arms race. This ls a fact which must be clear to us all. In the past several months we have heard of the development of fantas\u00ad tic new destructive weapons-multiple inde\u00ad pendently guided reentry vehicles, orbiting bombs-these are not deployed weapons, but weapons which could be deployed in response to the need to protect the strategic capability of either ourselves or the Soviet Union. A threat to this capability, like the ABM will likely set off a new round of increased num\u00ad bers and sophistication of offensive weap\u00ad ons--an escalation of the arms race. The Soviet deployment of an ABM around Moscow has already threatened to launch us down this path. In the end we will both have to remain capable of making the other side be\u00ad lieve that it will be destroyed if it engages in nuclear war. Quite simply, effective parity (Le .. mutual ability to infilct unacceptable nuclear destruction) is the basis of our de\u00ad fense. Every improvement we make will be reflected by the Soviets, as we have seen from past experience, thus neither we nor they can hope to get more defense simply by deploy\u00ad ing more systems. This is the logic of the mutual interest of the USSR and ourselves in arms limitation discussions. In recent weeks the ABM debate has been greatly influenced by the agreement of the Soviet Union to hold discussions on the limitations of strategic armaments. It has been argued that we must provide the funds for ABM to fortify our bargaining position in these negotiations. We submit that this is not necessarily the case. Our experts have testified that the best American response at this time to a Soviet ABM is to deploy a stronger offensive force, and not to reply with an ABM of our own. Thus the Soviets should be as interested as we are in assuring that neither side deploys an ABM if for no other reason than to preclude an increase in offensive weapons. An agreement which would remove the threat-however remote-\u00ad of ABM deployment would be meaningful to them. If we spend money on ABM deployment now, and then we agree to halt ABM deploy\u00ad ment, we may waste billions of dollars. Sound management as well as sound bar\u00ad gaining calls for us to hold ABM deployment in abeyance until the outcome of the arms limitation discussions is clear. 4. ABM ts enormously costly, especially at this time. $5 billion is an immense amount of money. It is the annual wages of 500,000 4245 families earning $10,000 a year. We face a difficult fiscal situation. We have a mandate to cut expenditures. We can no longer treat the Defense budget as a sacred cow. It must undergo the same form of searching inquiry as any other program. In view of the former Secretary of Defense there are only \"marginal grounds\" to support a Chinese oriented ABM, and no grounds to support a Soviet oriented ABM. If cuts must be made, and surely they must, let us cut out the marginal items and preserve the vital ones. 5. ABM may be obsolete or ineffective even before it is operational. The NIKE-ZEUS ABM which we were previously urged to deploy would have been by common consent ob\u00ad solete and ineffective by the time it would have been deployed. The same fate is prob\u00ad ably built into the SENTINEL. By the admis\u00ad sion of our experts it will have no capability against incoming weapons with any pene\u00ad tration aids. Yet any enemy building ICBM's today must certainly be encouraged to in\u00ad clude penetration aids, if we have an ABM. Accordingly, our unsophieticated system may already be passed by. Certainly it would con\u00ad stantly have to be up-dated and remodeled at enormous costs. The effectiveness of any ABM is much in doubt. Defensive systems against nuclear warheads must be extremely reliable since any warheads which do get through wm cause enormous damage. Viewed in this light the limited SENTINEL ABM is open to ques\u00ad tion. The reliability of the system is still fur\u00ad ther strained by the fact that when the ABM is called upon to function, it must perform exceedingly well the very first time. CONCLUSION We share with the proponents of the SEN\u00ad TINEL, ABM the belief that the security of the United States is a consideration which is second to none. Some proponents contend that while the ABM may not be technically perfect or strategically sound, it is better to deploy it and err of the side of safety. But that is the basic question: which is the side of safety? Is it to build an ABM system know\u00ad ing that such action must inevitably pro\u00ad voke a Soviet response, or is it to hold back, temporarily at least, the initiative until it is known where the current discussions on the reduction of nuclear weapons are going? There is only a very fine line between deter\u00ad rence and provocation. It is not clear at this point on which side of that line the current ABM deployment would fall. Certainly the possibility exists that meeting a commitment to expand funds for a program the merits of which are at best questionable, could in\u00ad jure the security of the United States. Thus we could, in effect, be misdirecting our ef\u00ad forts to the overall detriment of our defense posture. In view of these facts, we believe the SEN\u00ad TINEL ABM should not be deployed at this time. We urge support. for amendments to delete the $263.3 million in this b111 for SENTINEL ABM deployment. ROBERT N. GIAIMO. JEITERY COHELAN. SmNEY R. YATES. REMARKS BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT S. McNAMARA BEFORE UNITED PRESS INTERNA\u00ad TIONAL EDITORS AND PUBLISHERS, SAN FRAN\u00ad CISCO, CALIF., SEPTEMBER 18, 1967 Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to discuss with you this afternoon the gravest problem that an American Secretary of Defense must face: the planning, preparation, and policy governing the possib1llty of thermonuclear war. It is a prospect most of mankind would prefer not to contemplate. That is understandable. For technology has now circumscribed us all with a con\u00ad ceivable horizon of horror that could dwarf 4246 any catastrophe that has befallen man in his more than a million years on earth. Man has lived now for more than twenty years in what we have come to call the Atomic Age. What we sometimes overlook ls that every future age of man will be an atomic age. If, then, man ls to have a future at all, it will have to be a future overshadowed with the permanent possibility of thermo\u00ad nuclear holocaust. About that fact, we are no longer free. Our freedom in this question consists rather in facing the matter rationally and realistically and discussing actions to mini\u00ad mize the danger. No sane citizen; no sane political leader; no sane nation wants thermonuclear war. But merely not wanting it is not enough. We must understand the difference be\u00ad tween actions which increase its risk, those which reduce it, and those which, while costly have little influence one way or another. Now this whole subject matter tends to be psychologically unpleasant. But there ls an even greater difficulty standing in the way of constructive and profitable debate over the issues. And that is that nuclear strategy is excep\u00ad tionally complex in its technical aspects. Unless these complexities are well under\u00ad stood, rational discussion and decision mak\u00ad ing a.re simply not possible. What I want to do this afternoon ls deal with these complexities and clarify them with as much precision and detail as time and security permit. One must begin with precise definitions. The cornerstone of our strategic policy continues to be to deter deliberate nuclear attack upon the United States, or its allles. by maintaining a highly reliable ab111ty to inflict an unacceptable degree of damage upon any single aggressor, or combination of aggressors, at any time during the course of a strategic nuclear exchange--even after our absorbing a surprise first strike. This can be defined as our \"assured de\u00ad struction capability.\" Now it is imperative to understand that assured destruction is the very essence of the whole deterrence concept. We must possess an actual assured de\u00ad truction capability. And that actual assured destruction capability must be credible. Con\u00ad ceivably, our assured destruction capability could be actual, without being credible--in which case, it might fall to deter an aggressor. The point ls that a potential aggressor must himself believe that our assured, de\u00ad struction capability is in fact actual, and that our will to use it in retaliation to an attack is in fact unwaivering. The conclusion, then, is clear: if the United States is to deter a nuclear attack on itself or on our allies, it must possess an actual, and a credible assured destruction capabillty. When calculating the force we require, we must be \"conservative\" in all our estimates of both a potential aggressor's capabilities, and his intentions. Security depends upon taking a \"worst plausible case\"-and having the ab111ty to cope with that eventuality. In that eventuality, we must be able to absorb the total weight of nuclear attack and rely on our strike back forces; on our com\u00ad mand and control apparatus; on our indus\u00ad trial capacity; on our cities; and on our pop\u00ad ulation-and still, be fully capable of de\u00ad stroying the aggressor to the point that his society is simply no longer viable in any meaningful twentieth-century sense. That is what deterrence to nuclear aggres\u00ad sion means. It means the certainty of suicide to the aggressor-not merely to his military forces, but to his society as a whole. Now let us consider another term: \"first\u00ad strike capability.'' This, in itself, is an ambig\u00ad uous term, since it could mean simply the ability of one nation to attack another nation EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS with nuclear forces first. But as it is normally used, it connotes much more: the substan\u00ad tial elimination of the attacked nation's re\u00ad taliatory second-strike forces. This is the sense in which \"first-strike ca\u00ad pability\" should be understood. Now, clearly, such a first strike capab111ty ls an important strategic concept. The United States cannot--and will not--ever permit itself to get into the position in which an\u00ad other nation, or combination of nations, would possess such a first-strike capab111ty, which could be effectively used against it. To get into such a position vis-a-vis any other nation or nations would not only con\u00ad stitute an intolerable threat to our security, but it would obviously remove our ability to deter nuclear aggression-both against our\u00ad selves and against our allies. Now, we are not in that position today\u00ad and there ls no foreseeable danger of our ever getting into that position. Our strategic offensive forces are immense: 1000 Minutemen missile launchers, carefully protected below ground; 41 Polaris sub\u00ad marines, carrying 656 missile launchers with the majority of these hidden beneath the seas at all times; and about 600 long-range bombers, approximately forty percent of which are kept always in a high state of alert. Our alert forces alone carry more than 2200 weapons, averaging more than one megaton each. A mere 400 one-megaton weapons, if delivered on the Soviet Union, would be sufii\u00ad cient to destroy over one-third of her popu\u00ad lation, and one-half of her industry. And all of these flexible and highly reliable forces are equipped with devices that insure their penetration of Soviet defenses. Now what about the Soviet Union? Does it today possess a powerful nuclear arsenal? The answer is that it does. Does it possess a first-strike capability against the United States? The answer is that it does not. Can the Soviet Union, in the foreseeable future, acquire such a first-strike capa.b1lity against the United States? The answer is that it cannot. It cannot because we are determined to remain fully alert, and we will never permit our own assured destruction capability to be at a point where a Soviet first-strike capa\u00ad bility is even remotely feasible. Is the Soviet Union seriously attempting to acquire a first-strike capaibility against the United States? Although this is a question we cannot an\u00ad swer with absolute certainty, we believe the answer is no. In any event, the question it\u00ad self is-in a sense~irrelevant. It is irrelevant since the United States will so continue to maintain-and where necessary strengthen\u00ad our retaliatory forces, that whatever the So\u00ad viet Union's intentions or actions, we will continue to have an assured destruction capa\u00b7bility vis-a-vis their society in which we are completely confident. But there ls another question that ls most relevant. And that is, do we--the United States\u00ad possess a first-strike capability against the Soviet Union? The answer is that we do not. And we do not, not because we have ne\u00ad glected our nuclear strength. On the contrary, we have increased it to the point that we possess a clear superiority over the Soviet Union. We do not possess first-strike capability against the Soviet Union for precisely the same reason that they do not possess it against us. And that is that we have both built up our \"second-strike capabllity\" 1 to the point that 1 A \"second-strike capability\" is the capa\u00ad bility to absorb a surprise nuclear attack, and survive with sufiicient power to inflict unacceptable damage on the aggressor. February 24, 1969 a first-strike capability on either side has become unattainable. There is, of course, no way in which the United States could have prevented the Soviet Union from acquiring its present sec\u00ad ond-strike capability-short of a massive pre\u00ad emptive first strike on the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The blunt fact ls, then, that neither the Soviet Union nor the United States can at\u00ad tack the other without being destroyed in retaliation; nor can either of us attain a first\u00ad strike capability in the foreseeable future. The further fa.ct is that both the Soviet Union and the United States presently pos\u00ad sess an actual and credible second-strike ca\u00ad pability another-and it is pre\u00ad cisely this mutual capab111ty that provides us both with the strongest possible motive to avoid a nuclear war. The more frequent question that arises in this connection is whether or not the United States possesses nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union. The answer is that we do. But the answer is-like everything else in this matter-technically complex. The complexJity arises in part out of what measurement of superiority is most meaning\u00ad ful and realistic. Many commentators on the matter tend to define nuclear superiority in terms of gross megatonnage , or in terms of the number of missile launchers available. Now, by both these two standards of meas\u00ad urement, the United States does have a sub\u00ad stantial superiority over the Soviet Union in the weapons targeted against ea.ch other. But Lt is precisely these two standards of measurement that are themselves misleading. For the most meaningful and realistic measurement of nuclear capability is neither gross megatonnage, nor the number of avail\u00ad able missile launchers; but rather the num\u00ad ber of separate warheads that are capable of being delivered with accuracy on individual high-priority targets with sufficient power ;to destroy them. Gross mega tonnage in itself ts an ina.de\u00ad qua te indicator of assured destruction capa\u00ad bility, since it is unrel8ited to survivability, accuracy , or penetrability, and poorly related to effective elimination of multiple high\u00ad priority targets. There is manifestly no a.d\u00ad va~tage in over-destroying one target, at the eXiJ>ense of leaving undamaged other targets of equal importance. Further , the number of missile launchers available is also an inadequate indicator of assured destruction capability, since the fa.ct is thait many of our launchers will carry multiple warheads. But by using the realistic measurement of the number of warheads available, capable of being reliably delivered with accuracy and effectiveness on the appropriate targets in the United States or Soviet Union, I can tell you that the United States currently possesses a superiority over the Soviet Union of at least three or four to one. Furthermore, we will maintain a superi\u00ad ority-by these same realistic criteria-over the Soviet Union for as far ahead in the fu\u00ad ture as we can realistically plan. I want, however, to make one point pat\u00ad ently clear: our current numerical superi\u00ad ority over the Soviet Union in reliable, accu\u00ad rate, and effective warheads is both greater than we had originally planned, and ls in fact more than we require. Moreover, in the larger equation of secu\u00ad rity, our \"superiority\" is of limited signifi\u00ad cance--since even with our current superi\u00ad ority, or indeed with any numerical su\u00ad periority realistically attainable, the blunt, inescapable fact remains that the Soviet Union could still-with its present forces\u00ad effectively destroy the United States, even after absorbing the full weight of an Amer\u00ad ican first strike. I have noted that our present superiority is greater than we had planned. Let me ex-February 24, 1969 plain to you how this came about, for I think it is a significant lllustration of the intrinsic dynamics of the nuclear arms race. In 1961, when I became Secretary of De\u00ad fense, the Soviet Union possessed a very small operational arsenal of intercontinental mis\u00ad siles. However, they did possess the techno\u00ad logical and industrial capacity to enlarge that arsenal very substantially over the suc\u00ad ceeding several years. Now, we had no evidence that the Soviets did in fact plan to fully use that capability. But as I have pointed out, a strategic plan\u00ad ner must be \"conservative\" in his calcula\u00ad tions; that is, he must prepare for the worst plausible case and not be content to hope and prepare merely for the most probable. Since we could not be certain of Soviet intentions-since we could not be sure that they would not undertake a massive build\u00ad up-we had to insure against such an even\u00ad tuality by undertaking ourselves a major build-up of the Minuteman and Polaris forces. Thus, in the course of hedging against what was then only a theoretically possible Soviet build-up, we took decisions which have resulted in our current superiority in numbers of warheads and deliverable mega\u00ad tons. But the blunt fact remains that if we had had more accurate information about planned Soviet strategic forces, we simply would not have needed to build as large a nuclear arsenal as we have today. Now let me be absolutely clear. I am not saying that our decision in 1961 was unjusti\u00ad fied. I am simply saying that it was necessi\u00ad tated by a lack of accurate information. Furthermore, that decision in itself-as justified as it was-in the end, could not possibly have left unaffected the Soviet Union's future nuclear plans. What ls essential to understand here is that the Soviet Union and the United States mutually influence one another's strategic plans. Whatever be their intentions, whatever be our intentions, actions-or even realistically potential actions--on either said relating to the build-up of nuclear forces, be they either offensive or defensive weapons, necessarily trigger reactions on the other side. It is precisely this action-reaction phe\u00ad nomenon that fuels an arms race. Now, in strategic nuclear weaponry, the arms race involved a particular irony. Un\u00ad like any other era in military history, today a substantial numerical superiority of weap\u00ad ons does not effectively translate into politi\u00ad cal control, or diplomatic leverage. While thermonuclear power ls almost in\u00ad conceivably awesome, and represents vir\u00ad tually unlimited potential destructiveness, It has proven to be a limlted diplomatic in\u00ad strument. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it ls at one and the same time an all-powerful weapon--6nd a very inadequate weapon. The fact that the Soviet Union and the United States can mutually destroy one an\u00ad other-regardless of who strikes first--nar\u00ad rows the range on Soviet aggression which our nuclear forces can effectively deter. Even with our nuclear monopoly in the early postwar period, we were unable to deter the Soviet pressures against Berlin, or their support of aggression in Korea. Today, our nuclear superiority does not deter all forms of Soviet support of commu\u00ad nist insurgency In Southeast Asia. What all of this has meant ls that we, and our allies as well, require substantial non\u00ad nuclear forces in order to cope with levels of aggression that massive strategic forces do not in fact deter. This has been a difficult lesson both for us and for our allies to accept, since there is a strong psychological tendency to regard su\u00ad perior nuclear forces as a simple and unfail\u00ad ing solution to security, and an assurance of victory under any set of circumstances. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS What is important to understand is that our nuclear strategic forces play a vital and absolutely necessary role in our security and that of our allies, but it is an instrinsically limited role. Thus, we and our allies must maintain substantial conventional forces, fully capa\u00ad ble of dealing with a wide spectrum of lesser forms of political and military aggression\u00ad a level of aggression against which the use of strategic nuclear forces would not be to our advantage, and thus a level of aggres\u00ad sion which these strategic nuclear forces by themselves cannot effectively deter. One can\u00ad not fashion a credible deterrent out of an incredible action. Therefore security for the United States and its allies can only arise from the possession of a whole range of grad\u00ad uated deterrents, each of them fully credible in its own context. Now I have pointed out that in strategic nuclear matters, the Soviet Union and the United States mutually influence one an\u00ad other's plans. In recent years the Soviets have substan\u00ad tially increased their offensive forces. We have, of course, been watching and evaluating this very carefully. Clearly, the Soviet build-up is in part a reaction to our own build-up since the be\u00ad ginning of this decade. Soviet strategic planners undoubtedly rea\u00ad soned that if our build-up were to continue at its accelerated pace, we might conceivably reach, in time, a credible first-strike capabil\u00ad ity against the Soviet Union. That was not in fact our intention. Our intention was to assure that they-with their theoretical capacity to reach such a first\u00ad strike capability-would not in fact outdis\u00ad tance us. But they could not read our intentions with any greater accuracy than we could read theirs. And thus the result has been that we have both built up our forces to a point that far exceeds a credible second\u00ad strike capability against the forces we each started with. In doing so, neither of us has reached a first-strike capability. And the realities of the situation being what they are-whatever we believe their Intentions to be, and what\u00ad ver they believe our intentions to be-each of us can deny the other a first-strike capa\u00ad bility in the foreseeable future. Now, how can we be so confident that this is the case? How can we be so certain that the Soviets cannot gradually outdistance us-either by some dramatic technological break-through, or simply through our lmperceptively lag\u00ad ging behind, for whatever reason: reluctance to spend the requisite funds; distraction with military problems elsewhere; faulty intelligence; or simple negligence and naivete? All of these reasons-and others-have been suggested by some commentators in this country, who fear that we are In fact falling behind to a dangerous degree. The answer to all of this is simple and straightforward. We are not going to permit the Soviets to outdistance us, because to do so would be to jeopardize our very viability as a nation. No President, no Secretary of Defense, no Congress of the United States--of whatever political party, and of whatever political per\u00ad suasion-ls going to permit this nation to take that risk. We do not want a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union-primarily because the action-reaction phenomenon makes it foolish and futile. But if the only way to prevent the Soviet Union from obtaining first-strike ca\u00ad pabill ty over us is to engage in such a race, the United States possesses in ample abun\u00ad dance the resources, the technology, and the will to run faster in that race for whatever distance is required. But what we would much prefer to do is to 4247 come to a realistic and reasonably riskless agreement with the Soviet Union, which would effectively prevent such an arms race. We both have strategic nuclear arsenals greatly in excess of a credible assured de\u00ad struction capability. These arsenals have reached that point of excess in each case for precisely the same reason: we each have re\u00ad acted to the other's build-up with very con\u00ad servative calculations. We have, that ls, each built a greater arsenal than either of us needed for a second-strike capability, simply because we each wanted to be able to cope with the \"worst plausible case.\" But since we now each possess a deterrent in excess of our individuals needs, both of our nations would benefit from a properly safe\u00ad guarded agreement first to limit, and later to reduce, both our offensive and defensive strategic nuclear forces. We may, or we may not, be able to achieve such an agreement. We hope we can. And we believe such an agreement is fully feasible, since it is clearly in both our nations' interests. But reach the formal agreement or not, we can be sure that neither the Soviets nor we are going to risk the other obtaining a first\u00ad strike capability. On the contrary, we can be sure that we are both going to maintain a maximum effort to preserve an assured destruction capabiUty. It would not be sensible for either side to launch a maximum effort to achieve a first\u00ad strlke capability. It would be serious be\u00ad cause the intelligence-gathering capabillty of each side being what 1-t is, and the realities of lead-time from technological break-through to operational readiness being what they are, neither of us would be able to acquire a first\u00ad strike capability in secret. Now, let me take a specific case in point. The Soviets are now deploying an anti\u00ad balllstic missile system. If we react to this deployment intelligently, we have no reason for alarm. The system does not impose any threat to our ability to penetrate and inflict massive and unacceptable damage on the Soviet Union. In other words, it does not presently affect in any significant manner our assured destruction capability. It does not impose such a threat because we have already taken the steps necessary to assure that our land-based Minuteman mis\u00ad siles, our nuclear submarine-launched new Poseidon missiles, and our strategic bcmlber forces have the requisite penetration aids\u00ad and in the sum, constitute a force of such magnitude, that they guarantee us a force strong enough to survive a Soviet attack and penetrate the Soviet ABM deployment. Now let me come to the issue that has re\u00ad ceived so much attention recently: the ques\u00ad tion of whether or not we should deploy an ABM system against the Soviet nuclear threat. To begin with, this is not in any sense a new issue. We have had both the technical possibility and the strategic desirabil1ty o! an American ABM deployment under con\u00ad stant review since the late 1950s. While we have substantially improved our technology in the field, it is important to understand that none of the systems at the present or foreseeable state of the art would provide an impenetrable shield over the United States. Were such a shield possible, we would certainly want it--and we would certainly build it. And at this point, let me dispose of an objection that is totally irrelevant to this issue. It has been alleged that we are opposed to deploying a large-scale ABM system because it would carry the heavy price tag of $40 billion. Let me make it very clear that the $40 billion is not the issue. If we could build and depl<>y a genuinely impenetrable shield over the United States, 4248 we would be willing to spend not $40 billion, but any reasonable multiple of that amount that was necessary. The 'money in itself is not the problem: the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem. There is clearly no point, however, in spending $40 billion if it is not going to buy us a significant improvement in our secu\u00ad rity. If it is not, then we should use the substantial resources it represents on some- thing that will. . Every ABM system that is now feasible in\u00ad volves firing defensive missiles at incoming offensive warheads in an effort to destroy them. But what many commentators on this is\u00ad sue overlook is that any such system can rather obviously be defeated by an enemy simply sending more offensive warheads, or dummy warheads, than there are defen\u00ad sive missiles capable of disposing of them. And this is the whole crux of the nuclear action-reaction phenomenon. Were we to deploy a heavy ABM system throughout the United states, the Soviets would clearly be strongly motivated to so in\u00ad crease their offensive capabllity as to cancel out our defensive advantage. It is futile for each of us to spend $4 bil\u00ad lion, $40 billion, or $400 b1llion-and at the end of all the spending, and at the end of all the deployment, and at the end of all the effort, to be relatively rut th,e same point of balance on the security scale that we e.re now. In point of fact, we have already inititated offensive weapons programs costing several billions in order to offset the small present Soviet ABM deployment, and the possibly more extensive future Soviet ABM deploy\u00ad ments. That is money well spent; and it is neces\u00ad sary. But we should bea.r in mind that lJt is money spent because of the action-reaction phenomenon. If we in turn opt for heavy ABM deploy\u00ad ment-at whatever price--we can be certain thart the Soviets will react to offset the ad\u00ad vantage we would hope to gain. It is precisely because of this certainty of a corresponding Soviet reaction that the four prominent scientist&-men who have served with distinction as the Science Advisers to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and John\u00ad son, and the three outstanding men who have served as Directors of Research and Engineering to three Secretaries of Defense-\u00ad have unanimously recommended against the deployment of an ABM system designed to protect our population against a Soviet aittack. These men are Doctors Killian, Kistiakow\u00ad sky, Wiesner, Hornig, York, Brown, and Foster. The plain fact of the matter is that we are now facing a situation analogous to the one we faced in 1961; we are uncertain of the Soviets' intentions. At that time we were concerned about their potential offensive capabllities; now we a.r~ concerned about their potential de\u00ad fensive capabilities. But the dynamics of the concern are the same. We must continue to be cautious and con\u00ad servative in our estimates-leaving no room in our calculations for unnecessary risk. And at the same time, we must measure our own response in such a manner that it does not trigger a senseless spiral upward of nuclear arms. Now, as I have emphasized, we have al\u00ad ready taken the necessary steps to guarantee that our offensive strategic weapons will be able to penetrate future, more advanced Soviet defenses. Keeping in mind the careful clockwork of lead-time, we will be forced to continue that effort over the next few years if the evidence EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS is that the Soviets intend to turn what is now a light and modest ABM deployment into a massive one. Should they elect to do so, we have both the lead-time and the technology available to so increase both the quality and quantity of our offensive strategic forces-with particu\u00ad lar attention to highly reliable penetration a.ids-that their expensive defensive efforts will give them no edge in the nuclear balance whatever. But we would prefer not to have to do that. For it is a profitless waste of resources, pro\u00ad vided we and the Soviets can come to a real\u00ad istic strategic arms-limitation agreement. As you know, we have proposed U.S.-Soviet talks on this matter. Should these talks fail, we are fully prepared to take the appropriate measures that such a failure would make necessary. The point for us to keep in mind is that should the talks fail-and the Soviets decide to expand their present modest ABM deploy\u00ad ment into a massive one--our response must be realistic. There is no point whatever in our responding by going to a massive ABM de\u00ad ployment to protect our population, when such a system would be ineffective against a sophisticated Soviet offense. Instead, realism dictates that if the Soviets elect to deploy a heavy ABM system, we must further expand our sophisticated offensive forces, and thus preserve our overwhelming assured destruction capability. But the intractable fact is that should the talks fail, both the Soviets and ourselves would be forced to continue on a foolish and feckless course. It would be foolish and feckless because\u00ad in the end-it would provide neither the Soviets nor us with any greater relative nuclear capability. The time has come for us both to realize that, and to act reasonably. It is clearly in our own mutual interest to do so. Having said that, it is important to dis\u00ad tinguish between an ABM system designed to protect against a Soviet attack on our cities, and ABM systems which have other objectives. One of the other uses of an ABM system which we should seriously consider is the greater protection of our strategic offensive forces. Another is in relation to the emerging nuelear capability of Communist China. There is evidence that the Chinese are devoting very substantial resources to the development of both nuclear warheads, and missile delivery systems. As I stated last January, indications are that they will have medium-range ballistic missiles within a year or so, an initial intercontinental ballis\u00ad tic missile capability in the early 1970s, and a modest force in the mid-70s. Up to now, the lead-time faictor has al\u00ad lowed us to postpone a decision on whether or not a light ABM deployment might be advantageous as a countermeasure to (\",om\u00ad munist China's nuclear development. But the time will shortly be right for us to initiate production if we desire such a sys\u00ad tem. China at the moment is caught up in in\u00ad ternal strife, but it seems likely that her basic motivation in developing a strategic nuclear capability is an attempt to provide a basis for threatening her neighbors, and to clothe herself with the dubious prestlge that the world pays to nuclear weaponry. We deplore her development of these weapons, just as we deplore it in other coun\u00ad tries. We oppose nuclear proliferation be\u00ad cause we believe that in the end it only in\u00ad creases the risk of a common and cataclys\u00ad mic holocaust. President Johnson has made it clear that the United States will oppose any efforts of China to employ nuclear blackmail against her neighbors. We possess now, and will continue to February 24, 1969 possess for as far ahead as we can foresee, an overwhelming first-strike capability with respect to China. And despite the shrill and raucous propaganda directed at her own peo\u00ad ple that \"the atomic bomb is a paper tiger,\" there is ample evidence that China well ap\u00ad preciates the destructive power of nuclear weapons. China has been cautious to avoid any action that might end in a nuclear clash with the United States-however wild her words-and understandably so. We have the power not only to destroy completely her entire nuclear offensive forces, but to devas\u00ad tate her society as well. Is there any possibility, then, that by the mid-1970s China might become so incautious as to attempt a nuclear attack on the United States or our allies. It would be insane and suicidal for her to do so, but one can conceive conditions under which China might miscalculate. We wish to reduce such possibilities to a minimum. And since, as I have noted, our strategic planning must always be conservative, and take into consideration even the possible irrational behavior of potential adversaries, there a.re marginal grounds for concluding that a light deployment of U.S. ABMs against this possibility is prudent. The system would be relatively inexpen\u00ad sive--preliminary estimates place the cost at about $5 billion-and would have a much higher degree of reliability against a Chinese attack, ithan the much more massive and complicated system that some have recom\u00ad mended against a possible Soviet attack. Moreover, such an ABM deployment de\u00ad signed against a possible Chinese attack would have a number of other advantages. It would provide an additional indication to Asians that we intend to deter China from nuclear blackmail, and thus would contrib\u00ad ute toward our goal of discouraging nuclear weapon proliferation among the present non\u00ad nuclear countries. Further, the Chinese-oriented ABM deploy\u00ad ment would enable us to add-as a concur\u00ad rent benefits-a further defense of our Min\u00ad uteman sites against Soviet attack, which means that at modest cost we would in fact be adding even greater effectiveness to our offensive missile force and avoiding a much more costly expansion of that force. Finally, such a reasonably reliable ABM system would add protection of our popula\u00ad tion against the improbable but possible ac\u00ad cidental launch of an intercontinental mis\u00ad sile by any one of the nuclear powers. After a detailed review of all these con\u00ad siderations, we have decided to go forward with this Chinese-oriented ABM deployment, and we will begin actual production of such a system at the end of this year. In reaching this decision, I want to em\u00ad phasize that it contains two possible dan\u00ad gers-and we should guard carefully against each. The first danger is that we may psychologi\u00ad cally lapse into the old over-simplification about the adequacy of nuclear power. The simple truth is that nuclear weapons can serve to deter only a narrow range of threats. This ABM deployment will strengthen our defensive posture-and will enhance the ef\u00ad fectiveness of our land-based ICBM offensive forces. But the independent nations of Asia must realize that these benefits are no sub\u00ad stitute for their maintaining, and where necessary strengthening, their own conven\u00ad tional forces in order to deal with the more likely threats to the security of the region. The second danger is also psychological. There is a kind of mad momentum intrinsic to the development of all new nuclear weap\u00ad onry. If a weapon system works-and works well-there is strong pressure from many directions to procure and deploy the weapon out of all proportion to the prudent level required. The danger in deploying this relatively February 24, 1969 light and reliable Chinese-oriented ABM sys\u00ad tem is going to be that pressures will develop to expand it into a heavy Soviet-oriented ABM system. We must resist that temptation flrmly\u00ad not because we can for a moment afford to relax our vigilance against a possible Soviet first-strike--but precisely because our great\u00ad est deterrent against such a strike is not a massive, costly, but highly penetrable ABM shield, but rather a fully credlble offensive assured destruction capability. The so-called heavy AB'M shield-at the present state of technology-would in effect be no adequate shield at all against a Soviet attack, but rather a strong inducement for the Soviets to vastly increase their own offensive forces. That, as I have pointed out, would make it necessary for us to respond in turn-and so the arms race would rush hopelessly on to no sensible purpose on either side. Let me emphasize--and I cannot do so too strongly-that our decision to go ahead with a limited ABM deployment in no way indi\u00ad cates that we feel an agreement with the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic nuclear offensive and defensive forces is any the less urgent or desirable. The road leading from the stone axe to the IOBM-though it may have been more than a million years in the building-seems to have run in a single direction. If one is inclined to be cynical, one might conclude that man's history seems to be characterized not so much by consistent periods of peace, occasionally punctuated by warfare; but rather by persistent outbreaks of warfare, wearily put aside from time to time by periods of exhaustion and recovery\u00ad that parade under the name of peace. I do not view man's history with tha,t de\u00ad gree of cynicism, but I do believe that man's wisdom in avoiding war is often surpassed by his folly in promoting it. However foolish unlimited war may have been in the past, it is now no longer merely foolish, but suicidal as well. It is said that nothing can prevent a man from suicide, if he is sufficiently determined to commit it. The question is what is our determination in an era when unlimited war will mean the death of hundreds of mill1ons-and the pos\u00ad sible genetic impairment of a million genera\u00ad tions to follow? Man is clearly a compound of folly and wisdom-and history is clearly a consequence of the admixture of those two contradictory traits. History has placed our particular lives in an era when the consequences of human folly are waxing more and more catastrophic in the matters of war and peace. In the end, the root of man's security does not lie in his weaponry. In the end, the root of man's security lies in his mind. What the world requires in its 22nd Year of the Atomic Age is not a new race towards armament. What the world requires in its 22nd Year of the Atomic Age is a new race towards reasonableness. We had better all run that race. Not merely we the administrators. But we the people. Thank you, and good afternoon. ABM AND ARMS CONTROL (By Mason Willrich) The Johnson Administration's decision to produce and deploy in the United States a \"light\" or \"thin\" anti-ballistic missile de\u00ad fence system (or ABM) marks a significant, perhaps decisive, turning point in the nu\u00ad clear anns race and efforts to bring that race under control. How long will prevention of the further spread of nuclear weapons con\u00ad tinue to be a viable policy objective? Will CXV--269-Part 4 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS the possibility of stability in the nuclear weapons balance between the United States and the Soviet Union be swept away? What is the future role of China in the nuclear club? These are the major questions which have been brought sharply into focus. Of major importance in the context of these issues is the fact that the ABM system the Johnson Administration has decided to deploy is, for the time being at least, limited. The United States ABM system will be lim\u00ad ited in cost to an estimated five thousand million dollars, and limited in effectiveness to interception of a comparatively few nu\u00ad clear warheads. The system being deployed will consist of two kinds of missiles and asso\u00ad ciated radar and computer systems: the longer-range Spartan to provide limited area defence of population centres; and the short\u00ad range Sprint to provide \"hard point\" or ter\u00ad minal defence for ABM radars and Minute\u00ad man silos. The basic purpose of the ABM deployment is to provide protection to the United States against the kind of intercontinental nuclear capability which China will possess in the mid-1970s. The deployment will not protect the United States population or industry against the quality and quantity of nuclear attack which the Soviet Union is now, or will in the future be capable of launching. It will, however, provide a measure of ter\u00ad minal defence of United States Minuteman silos, and also some capability to deal with an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon delivery system. In analysing the United States ABM de\u00ad ployment decision, we will first consider the salient features of the strategic nuclear con\u00ad text in which the decision is imbedded. Thereafter, we will turn toward an assess\u00ad ment of the future, focusing on three sets of complex nuclear interactions: first, the nuclear Powers and the non-nuclear Powers; second, the two nuclear super-Powers, the United States and the Soviet Union; and, third, the United States and China. Throughout a continuing process of re\u00ad search, development and innovation in nu\u00ad clear weapons and delivery systems since World War II, the technology of the offence has maintained a commanding lead over the defence. This gap has not persisted because there has been no chance of intercepting an offensive nuclear warhead. Rather, the large numbers of warheads available, and the great destructive capability of ea.ch, require a de\u00ad gree of effectiveness for a defence that, until recently, was clearly unattainable. From the technological imbalance of of\u00ad fence over defence the basic strategic princi\u00ad ple has been derived---deterrence. In the ab\u00ad sence of a sufficiently effective defence, it has become accepted doctrine that the largest measure of protection against nuclear attack can be found in the threat of retaliation in kind. From a strategy of deterrence the re\u00ad quirements for the present United States strategic posture have been developed. These requtrements are summed up in former Sec\u00ad retary of Defense McNamara's phrase, \"as\u00ad sured destruction capability,\" which he de\u00ad fined as the maintenance of \"a highly reliable ability to inflict an unacceptable degree of damage upon any single aggressor, or com\u00ad bination of aggressors, at any time during the course of a strategic nuclear exchange--even after our absorbing a surprise first strike.\" The requtrements of such an \"assured de\u00ad struction ca.pabillty\" are survivability, re\u00ad Ua.bllity and penetration capability. United States nuclear forces must, first of all, be capable of surviving a Soviet first strike. Sur\u00ad vival insurance costing thousands of millions of dollars has been purchased for bomber aircraft by airborne and strip alert proce\u00ad dures, and for missiles by installation under\u00ad ground in silos or under the sea in subma\u00ad rines. The benefits of survivability are two\u00ad fold: the United States ls placed in a strategic posture from which it wm never be essential 4249 to pre-empt with a nuclear first strike rather than deter with the threat of a second strike in retaliation; and the time for decision in a crisis will be lengthened. Thereafter, we must be assured that a sufficient number of deliv\u00ad ery systems, if launched after surviving a nuclear attack, will arrive over their assigned targets with their nuclear warheads opera\u00ad tional. Reliability can be acquired through technological excellence, systems redundancy and large quantities. Finally, an assured destruction capability requires the ability of United States nuclear forces to penetrate any defensive systems transversed between the place of launch and impact on target. Here the ABM problem en\u00ad ters the picture. The problem should be vlewed from the standpoint of an offence-de\u00ad fence interaction . Modifications in technology and tactics on the offensive side affect, and are affected by, defensive modifications in a dynamic relationship. There are a variety of aids for an offence in penetrating a defence. A warhead /re-entry vehicle can carry with it large numbers of decoys and chaff which will overload the defensive radar tracking system with in\u00ad coming signals. Early detonation of an offen\u00ad sive nuclear warhead oan be used to create radar blackout through which following war\u00ad heads can pass undetected . An offensive nu\u00ad clear warhead can be shielded so that it will be destroyed only if a defensive warhead is detonated at close range. Finally, as an al\u00ad ternative to penetrating an ABM system de\u00ad ployed around a city, offensive warheads can be detonated upwind and outside the de\u00ad fensive envelope in a way which will maxi\u00ad mise fallout on the target. On the defensive side, a variety of coun\u00ad ter-measures are also possible. Defensive mis\u00ad siles can be developed with extremely rapid rates of acceleration. This will permit inter\u00ad ception of incoming nuclear warheads at relatively low altitudes after atmopsheric drag has filtered out the lighter decoys and chaff. Radar tracking systems can be de\u00ad ployed in configurations which will mini\u00ad mise potential black-out problems from de\u00ad tonation of either offensive or defensive war\u00ad heads. Furthermore, defensive missiles can be developed with longer ranges so that avoidance of the ABM envelope will be ruled out. Beyond these primarily qualitative aspects of the offence-defence interaction lie impor\u00ad tant quantitative dimensions. Of particular relevance ls the possibility of saturation. If there are more offensive than defensive war\u00ad heads associated with a particular target, then a destruction capability of that target is assured--even if the defensive system functions perfectly. Weighing the possibil\u00ad ities for penetrating, a.voiding and over\u00ad whelming the defence against the possibil\u00ad ities for technical improvements in defensive systems has led most analysts to pessimistic conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of a large-scale ABM deployment against a sophisticated nuclear attack. A basic premise which underlies the pres\u00ad ent Soviet-American nuclear balance is that deterrence consists essentially of a strategic posture---a nuclear capability in being and credible to any potential adversary. If deter\u00ad rence fails, nuclear war must be fought with existing forces. Unlike mobillsatlon for con\u00ad ventional war, mobilisation for nuclear war is a continuous process which occurs, if at all, before hostllities break out. Nuclear power politics, then, may be viewed as the evolution and interaction of a series of pos\u00ad tures by the various participants. Given the high stakes and large uncertain\u00ad tie5 involved, strategic nuclear planning tends to be conservative. Planning factors for developing a nuclear posture are an adver\u00ad sary's capabilttles and the 'worst plausible case'. A potential adversary's intentions are largely ignored. When such conservative planning is applied on both sides of a con-4250 filct relationship it is easy to see how an arms race is unavoidable. The net result to date in the evolution of the Soviet-American nuclear relationship 1s that each has achieved an assured destruc\u00ad tion capability against the other. Deterrence is mutual and the level of strategic arma\u00ad ment on both sides is very high. It is esti\u00ad mated that the United States could place about 4,000 nuclear warheads on Soviet tar\u00ad gets, while the Soviet Union could hLt the United States with 1,000 nuclear warheads of somewhat larger average yield. One might assume that in such a posture the two sides might declare that enough is enough. Grant\u00ad ing the desirability of some measure of 'over\u00ad kill', each s1de now has it. However, the fundamental processes of science and technology are inherently dyn.a.mic. AB diminishing returns set in on the offensive side, increased attention has been devoted to the possibilities of defense. The Soviet Union has already deployed a limited ABM system around Moscow. For several years the United States has conducted an ABM research and development pro\u00ad gramme costing approximately five hundred million dollars annually. Before proceeding further with its own ABM programme, the United states made several attempts to start discussions with the Soviet Union on Umitations on furthe\u00b7r deployment of the both offensive and defen\u00ad sive nuclear systems. In view of the failure of these attempts and the growing nuclear capability of Communist China, the United States then decided to produce and deploy a light ABM system of its own. WLth this background in mind, let us turn towards the future, focusing first on the prospects for preventive the further spread of nuclear weapons in light of limited ABM deployment. Recently, substantial progress has been achieved in non-proliferation negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference in Geneva the two super-Powers reached agreement on January 18, 1968 on a complete draft treaty. This will be the subject of discussion at a resumed sess\u00b7ion of the United Nations General Assembly which will convene in April after this article has been published. Non-proliferation is an inherently discrim\u00ad inatory concept It seeks to perpetuate the status quo of a world with five nations pos\u00ad sessing nuclear weapons and the rest with\u00ad out. Certain non-nuclear nations may be re\u00ad luctant to relinquish their nuclear options, especially if they believe they may require nuclear weapons in the future to offset a nuclear threat from one of the five, as with India and Japan. What options other than nuclear weapons exist, or can be provided, for Asian nations such as India or Japan in the face of China's growing 'modest intercontinental nuclear force China will have by the mid-1970's with an initial five thousand m1111on dollar ABM system, how should India or Japan respond to the medium range ballistic missile capa\u00ad bility China will have within a year or so? Following China's nuclear test explosions, assurances have been reiterated by high United States officials that nations without nuclear weapons can be sure that 'if they need our strong support against some threat of nuclear blackmail, then they will have it'. Will these assurances be enough in the fu\u00ad ture? The idea that the nuclear super-Powers could guarantee the security of non-nuclear nations against nuclear attack has been sug\u00ad gested as a possible quid pro quo for signa\u00ad ture of a non-proliferation treaty. However, such commitments by either the United States or the Soviet Union alone would largely compromise the position of any non\u00ad aligned nation, while a joint United States\u00ad Soviet guarantee would require a degree of East-West co-operation that is below the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS horizon of political reality today. While some form of nuclear assurance may emanate from the United Nations, it would seem doubtful that such a dilution of responsibllity on the guarantor side would be satisfying in the long run. Finally, as a practical matter, it is doubtful whether at this time the U.S. Sen\u00ad ate would give its consent to United States ratification of a non-proliferation treaty if it included provisions which could result in a sweeping and yet uncertain extension of United States security commitments. In view of these considerations it is not surprising that the nonproliferation treaty draft, as it emerged from super-Power nego\u00ad tiations, was silent on the subject of nuclear guarantees to non-nuclear nations. Yet the problem remains, and it will have to be dealt with on a continuing basis.1 W111, in fa.ct, United States ABM deploy\u00ad ment provide, as Mr. McNamara has argued, \"an additional indication to Asians that we intend to deter China from nuclear black\u00ad mail, and thus contribute towards our goal of discouraging nuclear weapon proliferation ... \"? Or, might the construction of such a nuclear shield be interpreted in Asia as the beginning of an American shelter under which we will withdraw-a \"Fortress Ameri\u00ad ca\" for the nuclear age? Another suggestion for alleviating the continuing security problems of non-nuclear nations in general would be to provide them with ABM defenses of their own. This sug\u00ad gestion does not appear to be either wise or feasible in the near future, for several rea\u00ad sons. The cost of even a limited ABM defense is too high-too high either for the United States to give away, or for whatever countries might be involved to be w1111ng, and in some cases able, to pay for themselves. While cost sharing might be considered, past experience in NATO would indicate that discussion along these lines would probably produce more dis\u00ad sension than co-operation. In Western Eu\u00ad rope especially, where the Chinese nuclear threat does not appear relevant in the near future, the magnitude of the Soviet offensive nuclear capability seems to foreclose any possibHity of a limited ABM from achieving even marginal effectiveness. Moreover, deploying a. United States ABM system in other countries would raise a. num\u00ad ber of intractable problems of operational control and ownership. These problems would be intrinsically difficult to resolve. But also the most probable solutions would appear to be irreconcilable with existing United States legislation, as well as a. non\u00ad proliferation treaty. While, therefore, the possib11ity of transfer of ABM systems to for\u00ad eign countries should not be dismissed for\u00ad ever, consideration of this alternative should be postponed at least until the nonprolifera\u00ad tion issue is resolved one way or the other. Having examined the prospects for contain\u00ad ment of the horizontal dimension of the nuclear arms race in light of the United States ABM decision, let us now turn to the vertical dimension and consider the future course of the nuclear relationship between the two super-Powers. In the wake of United States deployment of a. limited ABM defence the Soviets have four basic options: first, they can do noth\u00ad ing, second, they can offset the thin United States defence by increases in their offence; third, they can thicken their own existing defence; and, fourth, they can increase both defence and offence. We may hope that the Soviets will do nothing. However, is such a response in Moscow likely? Have the Soviet leaders already ma.de allowance in their plans for the possibility of a limited United States ABM deployment so that no further offensive or defensive increase on their side will be 1 The author discussed this problem more fully in \"Guarantees to Non-Nuclear Na\u00ad tions\", Foreign Affairs, Vol. 44, No. 4, p. 683 (July, 1966}. February 24, 1969 necessary? Such foresight would be rare in\u00ad deed. Which of the remaining three options the Soviets exercise would depend on the exten't to which they share with us the assumption that an assured destruction capabillty is the cornerstone of national security, and whether they agree with the McNamara calculus of cost-effectiveness of increments of offence versus increments of defence. The Soviets have a tradition backed by strong emotion, if not pure logic, which emphasises defence of the homeland. Therefore , further thick\u00ad ening of Soviet ABM defences, either alone or in conjunction with offensive production, may not be ruled out. Looking one step further in the inter\u00ad a;otton process, whiile '1lhe Umted States may be able to tolerate marginal extension of Soviet offensive procurement without further response, Mr. McNamara has stated that the United States would respond to Soviet thick\u00ad ening of its present defences with offensive increases o! its own. This plan for an as\u00ad symetric response may prevent a vicious up\u00ad ward spiral from developing on the defensive side, if it holds. Over time, such a plan is, however, likely to yield to other pressures. The overall process to research, development and innovation in the context of competing societies seems to acquire an internal dy\u00ad namism and logic of its own which lead toward full exploitation of technical possi\u00ad bllities. New developments achieve a mo\u00ad mentum o! their own which are difficult to resist, particularly in the national secu\u00ad rity area. With respect to offensive nuclear delivel\".'7 systems, a plateau in United States procure\u00ad ment had been reached before the ABM d~ cision. Present Soviet production may be viewed largely as a reaction to the large missile production runs of the United States during the mid-1960s. Therefore, ABM a.side, it ls possible that missile levels on both sides would have levelled off. The deployment of limited ABM systems on both sides will exert substantial pressure to turn this :flattened curve upwards again. The number o! warheads which the United States can place on Soviet targets is being increased within existing levels of missiles and launchers through replacement of single with multiple warheads-the so-called Mul\u00ad tiple Independent Re-entry Vehicles or \"MIRV's\". Therefore, some Soviet ABM de\u00ad ployment can be offset by the United States without resuming large scale production o! delivery systems. However, if the Soviet ABM defence is thickened the outer limit of this kind of offset capabiUty will soon be reached. Penetration will come to depend on satura\u00ad tion, and saturation will require resumed production of offensive delivery systems. The 'worst plausible case' here would be a gradual spiral upwards into all-out production o! both offensive and defensive systems on both sides of the balance of terror. The fa.ct that the United States could, at tremendous cost and no gain in its security, lead such a pro\u00ad duction race should counsel restraint to the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Fractional Orbital Bombardment System, or \"FOBS\", is indica\u00ad tive of an increased tempo in the interac\u00ad tions occurring among the technological variables in the Soviet-American nuclear equation. To intercept an income FOBS, which will probably approach the United States from the South rather than the North, would require adjustments in ABM system deployment. The lower trajectory of the FOBS will place a. premium of \"over the horizon\" radar detection systems. However, the Soviet FOBS wm probably be less ac\u00ad curate and carry less nuclear payload due to the de-boosting requirement. Therefore, it may well be a less efficient system for de\u00ad livering nuclear destruction than an equiva\u00ad lent number of ICBM's. In any event, if the Soviet Union does proceed to deploy Frac\u00ad tional Orbital Bombardment vehicles 1n February 24, 1969 substantial numbers it will not be the first time that the Kremlin will have violated the Pentagon's rules of cost-effectiveness. While, therefore, the Soviet FOBS should not be traced to the United States ABM de\u00ad ployment, it is clear that ABM systems in general will exert strong pressures in the direction of a resumption of the Soviet\u00ad American nuclear arms race in all its as\u00ad pects. If pressed further than limited de\u00ad ployments, ABM systems could also erase much of what little progress has been achieved in the direction of nuclear arms control. Under the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions in the atmosphere, outer space and underwater, it will be impossible to conduct an opera\u00ad tional test of an ABM system. The live inter\u00ad ception end nuclear destruction of an in\u00ad coming offensive warhead with a defensive warhead is prohibited by the Treaty. Many of the uncertainties involving nu\u00ad clear aspects of the interception problem can be narrowed by simulation techniques and static nuclear tests underground. More\u00ad over, the major uncertainties in an ABM defence are not nuclear, but rather pertain to radar and fire control systems. The mar\u00ad gins of uncertainty in the electronic aspects of an ABM defence can be measured, and either reduced or engineered around, with\u00ad out nuclear testing. Nevertheless, as the scale of ABM defence increases, pressure will also increase to test the system as nearly as pos\u00ad sible in an operational nuclear environment. While the United States will spend five thou\u00ad sand mill1on dollars, would it spend 40 thou\u00ad sand million dollars on an ABM defense with\u00ad out an operational system tests? In addition to de-stabilising the balance between Soviet and American strategic pos\u00ad tures, the deployment of ABM systems may well reverse a major trend in nuclear strategy itself. The doctrine of \"massive retaliation\", enunciated by Secretary of State Dulles, in 1954, to a large extent governed our strategic thinking until the Kennedy Administration in 1961. Then it was supplanted by the doc\u00ad trine of \"controlled and flexible response\" de\u00ad veloped by the new breed of Pentagon strategist under Secretary McNamara's tute\u00ad lage. Implementation of this strategy mainly required substantial increases in conven\u00ad tional non-nuclear forces. But the new strategic concept also served as a basis for \"thinking about the unthinkable\", for war gaming and planning a variety of possible ways of using nuclear forces short of an all\u00ad out exchange, and for terminating a \"con\u00ad trolled\" nuclear war with something less than total destruction on both sides. The abllity to implement such refinements in the prac\u00ad tical tangle and emotional confusion of a global crisis may be questioned. Nevertheless, the doctrine of controlled and flexible re\u00ad sponse has had the virtue of inducing more rationality in thinking about strategy, and, more importantly, in planning strategic nu\u00ad clear force structure. Does the technology of ABM systems lead us inevitably back to massive retaliation at the nuclear end of the weapons spectrum? If an ABM system is credited with effective\u00ad ness, any launch of offensive nuclear missiles against defended targets will have to be sum\u00ad cient in numbers to saturate the defence. Can anything short of a massive attack, whether a first or second strike, provide the required amount of certainty that the adversary's defenses will be saturated? The more effective ABM systems become, the more both sides would seem to be placed in an all-or-nothing strategic deterrence posture. It is widely recognised that the mutuality of nuclear destructive capability on both sides of the Soviet-American equation \"nar\u00ad rows the range of Soviet aggression which our nuclear forces can effectively deter\". De\u00ad ployment of ABM systems will reinforce this trend. Nuclear forces will, in the context of the Soviet-American relationship, become in\u00ad creasingly blunt and unwieldy instruments. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS We complete our appraisal of the United States ABM deployment decision by specifi\u00ad cally relating it to the future course of the United States nuclear relationship with China. Mr. McNamara has stated that \"we possess now, and will continue to possess for as far ahead as we can foresee, an overwhelming first-strike capabllity against China\". With\u00ad out a United States ABM defence, China would also soon be capable of inflicting grave damage on the United States if its nuclear forces were launched first. As previously in\u00ad dicated, it is estimated that China will have medium-range ballistic missiles within a year or so, an initial intercontinental missile capability in the early 1970s, and a \"moder\u00ad ate\" intercontinental force in the mid-1970s. Our decision to deploy a light ABM defence has been justified primarily on the grounds of precluding the possibility of China in\u00ad flicting damage on the United States in a first strike. It is difficult to imagine a ra\u00ad tional ground for a Chinese nuclear attack on the United States in view of the immense retaliatory capabllity of the United States. Thus, the light ABM defence in the United States is intended mainly to constitute a shield against Chinese irrationality. However, another and equally important argument exists in favour of deployment of a China-oriented system. Should a direct and major confrontation occur with China in the future and the United States possessed no effective defence against a Chinese first strike, the incentives operating in the United States to use its nuclear forces in a pre\u00ad emptive first strike would be greatly in\u00ad creased. The deployment of a light ABM defence may, therefore, insure not only against irrational conduct in Peking, but also that rationality will continue to govern in time of crisis in Washington. We must, however, recognise that Peking will probably view the United States ABM defence as insurance, not against irration\u00ad ality in a crisis, but against whatever Chi\u00ad nese nuclear forces might survive a United States first strike. Moreover, the extent to which an ABM defence would actually reduce first strike incentives for the United States against China would largely depend on the degree of confidence American decision\u00ad makers had in the effectiveness of their de\u00ad fence system. In addition to direct pressure on the United States, China's expanding nuclear capabllity will generate increasing pressure in two other directions, First, as we have seen, China's nuclear posture and intentions are key factors conditioning the future course of nuclear proliferation in Asia. Second, China possesses substantial influence over the future course of the Soviet-American nuclear relationship. In this respect the dynamics of a technological race are working against both the Soviet Union and the United States. Im\u00ad provement in relative position will be less difficult for China to achieve than for the nuclear super-Powers which a.re both already pressing against existing technological boundaries . Therefore, China's growing nuclear capab111ty could be the catalyst for a major new round in the Soviet-American nuclear arms race. This would be especially true if continuing technological pressure from China's strategic nuclear posture in\u00ad duces the United States to thicken its own ABM defense. What can we conclude from this appraisal of the United States limited ABM decision and of its impact on the future prospects for arms control? First, China is moving into a position of pivotal importance. This trend is not new. But China's nuclear capability provides both the political cutting edge and an important strategic underpinning for her future role in world power politics. The United States ABM deployment will not cancel out the political power China derives from its nuclear capabillty. The United States ABM decision 4251 in fact recognises China as a major nuclear Power. Second, China's nuclear power creates a range of difficult and delicate security prob\u00ad lems for its own leadership as well as for world leaders elsewhere . Until China itself achieves a secure second-strike capability the incentives for a first strike against China in a crisis cannot be ignored in Peking, whether or not her adversaries possess an ABM defense. However, if China sets as a primary objective the achievement of an assured destruction capability against the United States, this could trigger a renewal of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union which would leave China even further behind. Moreover, if China does not pursue a policy of restraint in the build-up of its own nuclear forces it seems inevitable that either or both Japan and India will eventually have to respond with the acquisition of nuclear forces of their own. Such a response in Asia would, in turn, effect a net reduction in China's own secu\u00ad rity. Therefore, it will be difficult for China to use her long-term advantage the political leverage resulting from her nuclear weapons programme. Third, the United States may well be in the most difficult position of all. Recognis\u00ad ing China's technological power of position, how best can the United States hope to deal with it? China's leverage will be maximum if the United States continues to base its response to China on her nuclear capabilities coupled to the worst plausible case. China will eventually achieve an assured destruction capab111ty against the United States. Will China be more 'rational' then than at present? It is time now for the United States to face squarely the issue of an accommodation with China based not upon a first-strike capability on one side, but upon nuclear deterrence on both sides. Article VI of the non-proliferation treaty would place an obligation on all parties, in\u00ad cluding the two super-Powers, \"to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective meas\u00ad ures regarding cessation of the nuclear arms race ... \". Present trends in the reality of nuclear weapons capabilities fly in the face of these words on paper. China will not ad\u00ad here to the non-proliferation treaty. But is it too much to expect the United States and the Soviet Union to review and agree to re\u00ad verse or freeze their ABM deployment deci\u00ad sions in light of their prospective obligations? Otherwise, how can we expect nations with\u00ad out nuclear weapons which adhere to the treaty to take seriously the pledge of absti\u00ad nence? The path of arms control is difficult. Yet it is the only path which leads toward what must be a paramount goal in the nuclear age--avoidance of nuclear war in a world where diverse value systems co-exist. [From the Adelphi Papers, No. 47, April 1968] THE CASE AGAINST MISSILE DEFENCES (By Jeremy J. Stone) (NoTE.-Dr. Stone is currently on the faculty of Pomona College, California.: dur\u00ad ing 1968-69, he will be engaged in post\u00ad doctoral work in economics at Stanford Uni\u00ad versity. He was a member of the Hudson In\u00ad stitute from 1962 to 1964, and a Research Associate at Harvard Center for International Affairs from 1964 to 1966. He has written widely on problems of national security and arms oontrol, and is the author of Containing the Arms Race: Some Specific Proposals (MIT Press, 1966) and Strategic Persuasion: Arms Limitation Through Dialogue (Columbia University Press, 1967). (Additional copies of this paper may be or\u00ad dered from the Institute at the cost of 5s (75 cents), post free.) THE BACKGROUND On 18 September 1967, Mr. Robert S. Mc\u00ad Namara, then US Secretary of Defense, an-4252 nounced plans to deploy a. limited ballistic missile defence system (called Sentinel) against the possibility of an attack by Chi\u00ad nese ballistic missiles. He acted under consid\u00ad erable political pressure, and called the case for the weapon system \"marginal\". This pollt\u00ad ica.l pressure was generated very largely by the belief-now thought to be mistaken\u00ad that the Soviet Union was deploying ballls\u00ad tic missile defences around far more than Moscow. The Soviet Government had ex\u00ad pressed willingness in principle to discuss limits on the arms race, but had delayed in setting a date for talks to begin. Many drew the conclusion that the Russians were 'steal\u00ad ing a march' on the United States. Because this pressure combined with the problem of missile defence against China, and because China. became the rationale for the decision taken, it is a decision almost impossible to reverse on the grounds of faulty American estimates of Soviet intentions. Indeed, the new US Secretary of Defense , Mr. Clark Clifford, has advised the Senate Armed Serv\u00ad ices Committee that he is for maintaining a 'clear-cut nuclear supremacy' over the Soviet Union; this approach, distinctly more fa\u00ad vourable to missile defence procurement than that of Mr. McNamara, suggests an increase in the likelihood that the United States will press on to build a larger system. Nevertheless, this paper rejects the argu\u00ad ment that at least some missile defences should be accepted as inevitable. Since these defences have a. tendency to rapid obsoles\u00ad cence, conceding their desirability would con\u00ad cede the correctness continuing expendi\u00ad tures. The case against additional expendi\u00ad tures for missile defences is, for the most part, a case against building any-thus a case for letting whatever has been done be\u00ad come obsolete as soon as possible. In any event, this paper attacks the idea that the existing thin defence against Chinese mis\u00ad siles should be used a.s a \"building block\" for a larger defence designed to neutralize So\u00ad viet offensive weapons. For eight years preceding the September 1967 decision to deploy a \"thin\" ballistic mis\u00ad sile defence, United States Administrations considered and rejected suggestions that on\u00ad going development programmes for missile defence be followed by procurement of one system or another. At first it was a primitive Nike-Zeus missile---<:onsidered successful if it could make an 'intercept\" for a. single incom\u00ad ing warhead . Such a system could have been built by 1963-64 but would, according to estimates made by the Defense Department in 1962, have been obsolete by the time it be\u00ad came operational. A more advanced system, Nike-X, could have been ordered in 1963 and built by 1968, but--rela.tive to projected Soviet improvements-would have been ob\u00ad solete by 1966. These systems depended upon tracking in\u00ad coming objects despite clouds of \"chaff\", then distinguishing between decoys and weapons, afid then launching anti-missiles a.t located warheads. Since observations of atmospheric drag on incoming objects were critical to dis\u00ad tinguishing them, the defence was required to wait until the attacking warhead had en\u00ad tered well into the atmosphere and to inter\u00ad cept perhaps 5,000 to 100,000 feet off the ground; hence it had to rely upon inter\u00ad ceptors that could climb thousands of feet in a few seconds. For this reason also, it had to anticipate low-level detonation of adver\u00ad sary warheads, and thence it had to comple\u00ad ment the system with fallout shelters. Fi\u00ad nally, the defence was local in character covering ranges of only 15 to 25 miles, and all but the largest 25 or 50 urban areas would have been undefended. Although the systems under development were quite obviously improving throughout the 1959-65 period, they seemed, paradoxi\u00ad cally, ever less likely to be built. The prob\u00ad lem of civil defence, the partial coverage pro\u00ad vided by the defence, the rising cost of build\u00ad ing an ever more complicated system, a grow-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ing willlngness to rely upon the balance of terror, the prospect of suitable Soviet pene\u00ad tration devices, a widespread desire not to stir up the arms race, and Mr. McNamara's emphasis on cost-effectiveness-all combined to limit the prospects for missile defence procurement. In 1964, Comrrnnist China exploded her first bomb, and American strategists saw a threat that might be neutralized with greater confidence than could that of the Soviet Union. Not long thereafter, the range of the American interceptor missiles was greatly ex\u00ad panded. At the same time, new techniques were developed to perm! t the destruction of incoming missiles with X-rays while they were still outside the atmosphere. (Earlier systems had relied on blast effects in the atmosphere, and hence such systems were ineffective at air-less altitudes.) The in\u00ad creased range of the interceptor, in conjunc\u00ad tion with the new X-ray method of \"kill\", enormously improved paper-and-pencil cal\u00ad culations of effectiveness. Incoming missiles could be attacked several hundred miles up. Each interceptor battery could cover a ground radius of about 400 miles.' When these results were considered with respect to the new (and weaker) prospective Chinese threat, some began to talk of the possibility of preventing any Chinese missiles from penetrat ing until the 1980s-even of dis\u00ad couraging China. from building long-range missiles at all. In this supersaturated situation, in 1966, some evidence was uncovered that the Soviet Union had begun to build a ballistic missile defence. Earlier sporadic Soviet efforts to build a single battery around Leningrad ln 1962 had created only a stir. Now it seemed certain that a defensive system had been installed around Moscow. Elsewhere, unques\u00ad tionably, something was being built rapidly. This more comprehensive installation (called the \"Tallinn\" system, after the Estonian City that housed part of it) was thought by some to be a defence against missiles. Gen\u00ad eral Earle G. Wheeler testified that it would violate \"military logic\" if it were not. But despite an earlier news conference, in which Mr. McNamara announced \"considerable evi\u00ad dence\" that the Soviet Union was deploying an antimissile system, he testified in 1967 that existing evidence could be explained by the hypothesis of an extensive new air de\u00ad fence system. Presumably such a system would have been started in anticipation of a high-flying B-70 aircraft or the flights of some U-3 spy plane. More generally, it might have reflected compulsive vested interest in air defence. By 1968, a. \"majority\" of De\u00ad partment of Defense analysts subscribed to Mr. McNamara's \"air defence\" view, and the situation was seen as follows in the fiscal 1969 defence budget: Now, I can tell you that the majority of our intelligence community no longer be\u00ad lieves that this so-called \"Tallinn\" system (which is being deployed across the north\u00ad western approaches to the Soviet Union and ln several other places) has any significant ABM capability. This system is apparently designed for use within the atmosphere, most likely against an aero-dynamic rather than a. ballistic missile threat. Although construction of the Galosh ABM system around Moscow ls proceeding a.t a moderate pace, no effort has been made dur\u00ad ing the last year to expand that system or extend it to other cities. It is the consensus of the intelligence community that this sys\u00ad tem could provide a limited defence of the Moscow area but that it could be seriously degraded by sophisticated penetration aids.5 Notwithstanding this new appraisal of So\u00ad viet plans, the Defense Department has not changed its own plans, asserting: \"Neverthe\u00ad less, knowing what we do about past Soviet predilections for defensive systems, we must, Footnotes at end of article. February 24, 1969 for the time being, plan our forces on the assumption that they wlll have deployed some sort of an ABM system around their major cities by the early 1970s\".8 The phrase \"for the time being\" presumably refers to the posslb11ity of American-Soviet discussions and may suggest American wllUngness to compromise in the presence of talks. THE CENTRAL ISSUES Will Soviet missiles be launched against us? A large-scale Soviet attack a.gs.inst Ameri\u00ad can cities ls plainly and simply not rational, since the American response ls primed to destroy the Soviet Union ln return. The So\u00ad viet leadership is aware of this. That nuclear war is mutual suicide has attained the status of a cliche with both super-powers. Wide\u00ad scale nuclear attacks on American forces are so unlikely to succeed, and so dangerous in any case, that lt ls very hard to imagine a Soviet leader, or Soviet committee, attempt\u00ad ing them. One can talk of war occurring through es\u00ad calation . But lt still requires, at some stage, that one major power launch nuclear weap\u00ad ons against the other. This wlll be, and can be expected to be perceived as, a self-destruc\u00ad tive act. For the foreseeable future, war cal\u00ad culations will not seem promising; more\u00ad over, leaders are unlikely to believe them if they do seem so. And there is ample evi\u00ad dence in the three decades since World War II of great-power caution in treating events that might risk general nuclear war. For these reasons, among others, nuclear war between the United States and the So\u00ad viet Union has become a low-probability event--posslble and well worth worrying about because of its enormous consequences, but stlll unlikely. Because lt has this char\u00ad acter, concern with \"getting through the next few years\" has gradually been trans\u00ad muted into concern with maintaining nu\u00ad clear peace and national security over the next decades. In short, the world situation now warrants paying attention to the me\u00ad dium-and long-term problems attendant upon proposed policies relating to nucle<L war. Would missile defences work against a major power? There are four questions. First, wlll missile defences work more or less as planned in the absence of adversary counter-measures? Sec\u00ad ond, would the defences be vulnerable to American or Soviet counter-measures? Third, would these counter-measures be taken? And, fourth, would the defences simply be\u00ad come obsolete as a result of unrelated de\u00ad velopments in offensive weaponry? Because most observers take their cue from the official estimates of the effectiveness of missile defence, little attention is normally paid to the posslblllty that these estimates might themselves be only \"best guesses\". The US Defense Department asserted in 1967, for example, that a. massive American missile defence, costing $20 to $40 blllion, would hold immediate fatalities down to 20 or 30 million if the Soviets did not take corres\u00ad ponding offensive adjustments in their stra\u00ad tegic forces. These and related figures, ad\u00ad mitted by the Defense Department to be illustrative and \"highly sensitive\" to small changes in targeting, are in fact stlll more questionable. They a.re technological specula\u00ad tions derived by systematically excluding all that does not lend itself to quantitative analysis, and by estimating with unreal pre\u00ad cision parameters little understood and with wide variance. These estimates are associated with his\u00ad torically unprecedented maintenance , elec\u00ad tronic reliability, and computer program\u00ad ming standards. They then assume that the defence will work as planned in a nuclear environment that is, to put lt mildly, un\u00ad precedented. Highly complicated computer programmes, sensitive radars and missiles filled with electronic equipment are supposed February 24, 1969 to be regularly shooting down hundreds of incoming missiles in an environment with radar-blinding fire-balls, electronic-disrupt\u00ad ing blast and X-ray effects, and earth-shak\u00ad ing detonations. Moreover, these figures as\u00ad sume that no unexpected Achilles heel will present itself during, or soon after, the few to several years required to build the system. It is worth remembering the American air defence system which was built at a total cost of perhaps $30 billion during the late 1950s. This was a system of which its build\u00ad ers admitted no realistic test could ever be given. In On Thermonuclear War, Herman Kahn remarked that a strategic analyst could not make his reputation by finding holes in the air defence system-it was known to have so many. It ls no accident that many of the scientists who were intimately involved in building the SAGE air defence system in the United States are persuaded that a comparable effort now to defend against ballistic missiles is a boon\u00ad doggle. Thus Dr. Jerome B. Weisner, former science adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, asserted in a recent article in Look Magazine that \"few competent people expect the extremely complex ABM system to work the first time; yet it must to have any ef\u00ad fect\". And he noted that it must work per\u00ad fectly, since a single warhead can destroy a city. It should also be mentioned that the construction of ballistic missile defences in the United States is the single most compli\u00ad cated engineering feat ever attempted in the world. Even assuring that the defence would work, would it work against counter\u00ad measures? Is it useful here to examine Amer\u00ad ican counter-measures to the prospect of a Soviet ballistic missile defence, since these could presumably be adopted by the Soviet Union. The most important recent change in American offensive capab111ty is the incorpo\u00ad ration in each missile launcher of Multiple Independently Targetable Re-entry Vehicles (MIRVs): in short, the placing of several separately aimed warheads in a single \"mis\u00ad sile\". Thus one possible American missile could carry ten separately aimed 50-klloton warheads instead of, for example, one 10-megaton warhead, and the trend ls for each launcher to have several.7 This requires the defence to use ten times as many inter\u00ad ceptors. American land-and sea-based mis\u00ad slle \"launchers\" have stabilized about 1,700. If each came to have \"several\" war\u00ad heads capable of reaching the Soviet Union, there would be approximately 10,000. Soviet ICBMs are now approaching 750, and their generally larger payloads can presumably reproduce the American multiple warhead capability if the Soviet Union should choose to try. Multiple warheads are the penetration aid that lends itself best to computations. But the United States is also preparing, and pre\u00ad sumably the Soviet Union could prepare, electronic counter-measures: knock out or confuse a radar, and all warheads might get through to a target; send one warhead through the trajectory of another, and the radar may be blinded by the blast of its own interceptor; try to have your missiles arrive simultaneously so that the defence ls over\u00ad loaded; seek out vulnerable parts of the sys\u00ad tem to attack, and then attack the city.8 Ob\u00ad viously there ls room here for ingenuity and surprise (factors which are hardly susceptible to calculation). Would the Soviet Union attempt to nullify an American system, and how strongly would the United States react to a Soviet defence? Those in favour of ballistic missile defences have sometimes put stress on the possibility that the Soviet Government would not make those corresponding adjustments in its of\u00ad fensive weapons that prevent the United States from holding immediate fatalities down to 20 or 30 million. Perhaps out of lack Footnotes at end of article. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS of interest, ineptitude, or scarcity of re\u00ad sources, the Soviet Union might not respond effectively; but that she would in fa.ct make corresponding adjustments in her offensive weapons seems-as has been put by Mr. McNamara-to be \"virtually certain\". She has already built an enormous strategic force that is growing more, not less, rapidly than it did in the past. She becomes, as does the United States, more skilled in making these arms race projections with each passing year. (She has only to follow the American lead in any case.) And she grows richer. In both the United States and the Soviet Union, internal political considerations join with legitimate security concerns to make the credibility of the deterrent the single most important military consideration. In the United States, the opposition political party is not alone in being the guardian of the certainty with which the United States can invoke her deterrent. Inside the Penta\u00ad gon, as Secretary McNamara put it in March 1967, \"I do not think there is a senior civilian or military official in the Defense Depart\u00ad ment that does not believe that (1) we should react to the [Soviet] ABM deploy\u00ad ment by expanding our offensive force, and (2) we have the technical capability to re\u00ad act in such a way as to assure our continued capability to penetrate that ABM defence. None of us are in any doubt about that\".9 It is a measure of the height of feeling on this issue in the United States that it was not considered ridiculous when Mr. McNamara asserted that he would spend \"$50 billion, the entire military budget'', on maintaining the ability of American missiles to penetrate if necessary. When the Secretary of Defense announced that the Soviet Union had built a ballistic missile defence around a single city (Mos\u00ad cow) and suggested that another system (the Tallinn system) might be designed against missiles, the US Defense Department acted as follows. It chose to produce and deploy the Poseidon submarine-launched missile, which it said would make the effectiveness of the Polaris submarine \"several times greater\". It produced and deployed \"improved mtssile penetration aids\". It initiated the \"development of new re-entry vehicles spe\u00ad cifically designed for use against targets heavy defended with ABM's.\" And it decided to \"increase the proportion of Minuteman III in the planned force and provided it with an improved third stage\". This would give it greater payload and, at a cost of $400 million, would require of the Soviet Union \"many times more in ABM defences if they try to offset it\" .10 Thus, in the face of an equivocal and still building Soviet defence, the United States ordered the capability to defeat any plausible Soviet defence of the mid-1970s. We can\u00ad not so easily connect the rapid Soviet build\u00ad up in missiles with the American debate over misslle defences-a debate that the Soviet analysts must have expected would eventu\u00ad ally lead to deployment. But we should at least observe that the very long lead-time involved from ordering a system to having it operational-at least a few years---causes each power to overreact to still potential threats. The Soviet Union, which less than a gen\u00ad eration ago suffered from the most devastat\u00ad ing destruction in modern warfare, is no less keyed to the importance of deterring the enemy from attack. And in her internal poli\u00ad tics, as in the United States, the defence issue can presumably be used by one faction against another. As likely as not, for a So\u00ad viet leadership to permit the United States to build, if not later to boast about, an un\u00ad answered defence against missiles is to make itself vulnerable to potential rivals. Even if neither super-power were interested in counter-measures to ballistic missile de\u00ad fences, but assuming that the arm.s race con\u00ad tinued, it is entirely possible that the defences would be outmoded by unrelated 4253 advances in weaponry. For example, as soon 8.3 the first inter-continental missiles were deployed-which was about the same year the American air defence system was com\u00ad pleted-it became obvious that missiles could attack and \"roll back\" the air defence to make corridors through which planes could then fly without opposition. Who ls to say that a nonballistic missile, orbiting bomb, or new radar-disrupting weapons eft\"ect will not do the same thing to an even more expensive missile defence? The missile was not devel\u00ad oped to defeat the air defence system, but it certainly outflanked it. Virtually any new strategic weapon, or major modification of existing strategic weapons, will raise a host of new problems for missile defences. As with the air defence system, the designers of the missile defence system expect that system to defend itself while it defends the country. Weapons against which it cannot defend itself will be weapons against which it cannot defend the country. Not many of such weapons will be necessary, therefore, to re-establish the cred\u00ad ibility of the large Soviet investment in mis\u00ad siles. For reasons like these, Dr. John S. Foster, who as Director of Defence Research and En\u00ad gineering is the chief engineer in the U.S. Defense Department, asserted that: \"Because of the enormous quantities of equipment in\u00ad volved, and the near rapid rate at which the technology changes, to maintain an effective system one would essentially have to turn over the whole system, the whole $20 billion system, every few years.\" 11 In summary, missile defences are too com\u00ad plicated, and inevitably too untested, to gen\u00ad erate much confidence that they will work as planned. Worse, both major powers can be expected to take appropriate counter-meas\u00ad ures to neutralize them-even to overreact in the measures ta.ken. Even in the absence of counter-measures, the arms race and ad\u00ad vancing technology are likely to defeat the effectiveness of the system. One may ask why advancing technology will not produce an even better defense. And this can only be answered by saying that a single bomb can destroy a city, and no imaginable defense will be perfect. It is an axiom of life, as one strategic analyst put it, that it is easier to destroy than pro\u00ad tect. The offense can try any one of many methods; the defense must protect against each. The offence can lose many times and stm succeed in its goal of destruction; the defense must be 100 per cent perfect. Each major power is reaching a stage at which it has literally thousands of warheads to launch in any one of several ways that tech\u00ad nology can or will provide. An attempt to defend a country against. the effects of nuclear war, an attempt des\u00ad tined to cost several tens of billions of dol\u00ad lars and take years to construct, is not some\u00ad thing to be done on the basis of short-range \u00b7 expectations. Nor, as was noted, do the im\u00ad mediate risks of war in the early 1970s war\u00ad rant it. It seems that one must attempt t<> estimate the chances that the defence will be able to have any significant attritional effect on the offense over time, despite a con\u00ad tinuing arms race and a determined at\u00ad tempt to neutralize the defence. These chances seem slim. At best, there is no per\u00ad manent victory for the defence, but only continued and expensive struggle. More likely~ most of the time, the defences will not serve to protect significant fractions of the population against super-power offence. Effect of missile defences on the arms race It is clear that missile defences tend to encourage expenditures on systems aimed at penetrating missile defences. Since these can involve the retrofitting of entire missile forces with improved missiles, and the multiplica\u00ad tion of missiles or warheads, this fact 1s a. major economic and political argument ii.gainst the deplo~ent of defences. 4254 Still worse, however, the MIRV method of ensuring penetration, in conjunction with missile defences, creates certain strategic fears. From the Soviet point of view, for example, the United States may come to have several thousand separately deliverable war\u00ad heads. The Soviet Government controls about 750 ICBMs and about 800 IRBMs and MRBMs. What if each of these could be suc\u00ad cessfully attacked by American missiles? In response to a newspaper report suggest\u00ad ing that the accuracy of the MIRVs might be insufficient to threaten hardened weapons, the US Defense Department issued a denial saying: \"Each new MIRV warhead will be aimed individually and will be far more accurate than any previous or existing war\u00ad head. They will be far better suited for de\u00ad struction of hardened enemy missile sites than any existing missile warheads.\" 12 In\u00ad deed, no other assumption than steadily im\u00ad proving accuracy could be made with even medium probability by a cautious Soviet strategic analyst. A measure of the improve\u00ad ment to date was provided by the Deputy secretary of Defense, Mr. Nitze, in a table which showed that a missile carrying ten 50-kiloton warheads could destroy ten sep\u00ad arate airfields, from 1.2 to 1.7 hard missile silos, or 3.5 cities\u00b7 of 100,000 population. (In these respects it was anywhere from 1.2 to ten times more efficient than a single 10- megaton warhead .) is Although the United States ls far ahead of the Soviet Union in the development of multiple warheads, has numerical superiority in missiles, and has a far more secure sub\u00ad marine foroe, she ls nevertheless already wor\u00ad ried about Soviet attacks on her land-based missiles. According to the U.S. Defense De\u00ad partment, \"A large Soviet ICBM force with a. substialnitlal !h.a.lrd-targelt kill ca.pabillrty might be able to destroy a large number of our Minuteman missiles in their silos. An extensive effective Soviet ABM defence might then be able to intercept and destroy a large part of our residual missile warheads, in\u00ad cluding those carried by submarine-launched missiles.\" H Admttting that such a threat is \"quantitatively far greater than those pro\u00ad jected in the latest intelligence estimates\", Mr. McNamara asserted that \"prudenoe\" dic\u00ad tated that the United States put herself in a position to strengthen her offensive capa\u00ad bility. Of course, the Russians have far more rea\u00ad son to feel concerned. Defense Department testimony revealed what the Soviet must do to neutralize various American defensive postures. In illustrative computations about the mid-1970s against a hypothetical Amer\u00ad ican defensive system now estimated at $22 to $40 billion, the Soviet retaliatory force of the mid-1970s would hold only 10 million Americans hostage to a surprise attack un\u00ad less cou:uter-measures were adopted. Soviet adoption of penetration aids, and of Multi\u00ad ple Independently Target.able Reentry Ve\u00ad hicles (MffiVs), would raise this figure to 40 million. But to get it back to 90 million, where it would stand if the United States built only Sentinel, would require 550 mo\u00ad bile ICBMs. The fact that the Defense De\u00ad partment refers to mobile ICBMs reveals the antlclpa.ted capacity Of MIRVs to atta.ck lo\u00ad catable ICBMs. In short MIRVs plus ABM spell trouble, at least on paper, if the centre of gravity of Soviet decision-making ls stlll worrying about surprise attack from the United States.115 As Mr. McNamara's current statement put it. \"We have come to the conclusion that both sides would be far bet\u00ad ter off if we can reach an agreement on the Umitatlon of all strategic nuclear forces, in\u00ad cluding ABMs\" .J.e Missile defences are Ukely to encourage not only offensive weapons that may neutralize them but more defences as well. Although Mr. McNamara may have argued, as he did in his announcement, that the case for a \"Chi\u00ad nese defense\" 1a only \"marg1nal\", and the case EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS against a more massive defence clear, time tends to turn whatever exists into a military necessity in the logic and psychology of de\u00ad fence bureaucr acies. We have seen this hap\u00ad pen before. The case for 1,000 land-based American Minutemen was questionable, and Mr. McNamara's 18 sept.ember speech an\u00ad nouncing his recent decision admitted that they were excessive, blaming the decision on Soviet secrecy. Had the United States fol\u00ad lowed a different logic, it ls possible that she might have contented herself with Po\u00ad laris submarines and few 1f any land-based missiles. She might have relied on the threart to attack a few cities and disavowed any intention to strike Soviet missiles (the pollcy called finite deterrence). But having made the choice she has, American policymakers are led seriously to oonslder attempts to extend or protect what they have built. Something should be said, in passing, of the arms-race implications of the different solutions proposed to the projected vulner\u00ad ablllty of Minuteman. First of all, almost all of the arms-race problems oould be resolved at one swoop if the Defense Department would dismantle the land-based missiles when they become vulnerable, and rely in\u00ad stead on existing or increased numbers of Polaris submarines. This massive reduction of American offensive power would undercut !ears on the part of the Soviet Union of at\u00ad tack on her forces. The invulnerability of Polaris would prevent attack upon the sea\u00ad based missiles, and whatever was necessary to penetrate future Soviet defenses could be in\u00ad stalled in the submarine-launched missiles. Instead, the Defense Department ls con\u00ad sidering: (a) converting the entire force to Minuteman III, i.e., completing its moderni\u00ad zation, and hence improving its offensive capablUty, so that whatever missiles survive will be more powerful; (b) increasing the number of warheads each Minuteman mis\u00ad sile could carry, Le. doing more of the same as in (a); (c) emplaclng the entire Minute\u00ad man III force in super-hard silos, i.e. pro\u00ad tecting it against attack by requiring of the Soviet Union more accuracy, more missiles, or larger ones for the same amount of destruc\u00ad tion; or (d) protecting the Minuteman force with an ABM defense, i.e. employing what ls called hard-point defense. Solutions (a) and (b) would further threaten the Soviet force, pushing the spiral still further. Solution (c) buys time, but re\u00ad solves the problem in no definitive way if the Russians seek protection in numbers---num\u00ad bers that will eventually seem to threaten the new silos. Solution (d) will tend to en\u00ad large the Sentinel missile defense, represent\u00ad ing a step forward politically, psychologically, and perhaps even technically, to a full\u00ad fledged city defense. This will have an unfor\u00ad tunate effect on Soviet planners. And if Dr. Wiesner is right when he says he ls \"certain that the system we are now planning will be regarded as ineffective before it ls installed,\" it is equally plausible that the hard-point defense will be considered inadequate protec\u00ad tion by the time it 1s built. The only possible basis for stablUty ls to switch the main part of strategic offensive capability to submarines and to do it in both super-powers. Unfortunately, the trend in relative offensive power seems quite in the opposite direction, and strong political and bureaucratic pressures seem likely to keep it that way. In any case, these difficulties reveal the problems that are associated with a single bad decision-to many Minutemen. Similarly, if it should become accepted that attempts to protect the country are in order, a variety of other expenditures will follow in time. These will include expenditures on bomber defenses and anti-submarine warfare, as well as ex\u00ad penditures to prevent existing missile de\u00ad fenses from becoming obsolete. There is, of course, the further posslbil1ty that defenses against new weaopns, cruise missiles or some\u00ad thing else might be encouraged as well. February 24, 1969 The possible future costs in arms pro\u00ad curement of accepting the legitimacy, fea\u00ad sibility, and desirab111ty defence again&t nuclear weapons unllmited. Sys\u00ad tems of oftlcially consid\u00ad ered outlandishly expensive, involving, as they may, large number of satellites. But present missile defence considerations were, when begun in the laite 1940s and early 1950s, even more outrageous, anticipating, as they had to, the parallel future develop\u00ad ment of the missiles themselves. And the logic and potential efficiency of attempts to intercept missiles early in their course w1ll keep such defences under serious study. By the same token the strategic fears aroused by these possibilities could easny grow over time since, conceptually, they could con\u00ad ceivably promise higher reliab111ty of attri\u00ad tion. In general, over a period of decades, the possib111ty that the defence might throw a substantial scare into the offense ls an im\u00ad portant argument against the deployment of defences. It 1s not, as some would argue, a good reason for encouraging defences be\u00ad cause, in the face of the strenuous pres\u00ad sures for their neutralization, we can hardly expect the \"effective\" defence to be more than a transl tory phenomenon in a dynamic contest. (If at some future time some really super and more perm.anent defence emerged, it would be time enough then to take ita particular characteristics of cost and per\u00ad manency into consideration, along with the nature of the political climate.) Wh1le these long-run dangers seem specu\u00ad laitl.ve, they may be related to this first de\u00ad cision to build a Umited missile defense much as the present commitment of 500,000 troops in Vietnam is related to the national decision to commit 15,000 combat troops. Inspired by Soviet efforts, by occasional new ideas in missile defence, by improvements 1n Chinese weapons, by compeUtion among the political parties, by pressures from American industry and the defence establlshment, by changes 1n Defense Depa.rtment leadership, and, conceivably, by stresses and strains 1n American-Soviet relationships, missile de\u00ad fence ls not going to be easy to stop. All this costs money, but it has other un\u00ad fortun.aJte effecrts as well. The preoccupation wtth arms gaps or the implications of new weapons takes the time of government and preempts the focus of public debates It forces negotiaitlons to concentrate on a series of new problems (like bombs in orbit), creates alarms that undermine better Amer\u00ad ican-Soviet relations, and tends to produce ever more destructive weapons. Does China warrant a missile defense? Virtually all China experts deny the image of a Communist China that seeks nu\u00ad clear war. They suggested instead the Ukell\u00ad hood that Peking will seek low-risk strategies of political intervention, assistance to insur\u00ad gents, propaganda, and so on. More general\u00ad ly, the Chinese leadership can hardly remain oblivious to the stark nuclear realities that have persuaded everyone else. A Chinese at\u00ad tack upon the United States ls Chinese na\u00ad tional suicide, and Chinese leaders, or com\u00ad mittees of them, can be expected to see it this way. Attack from China ls very well deterred. Many American supporters of a defense against Chinese missiles quite openly want to retain the ab111ty to attack China pre\u00ad emptively or the threat to do so. Thus one American analyst asserted: \"American leaders prooobly would develop different attitudes towards the Chinese according as the United States did or did not have BMD.\" However, American Presidents are not llkely to put as much confidence in these very involved com\u00ad putations of the Defense Depa.rtmen.t as all that, and even these computations always leave open the poss1b1Uty of losing a city or two. President.a know tha.t Defense Depart\u00ad ments---indeed government agencies general- -February 1969 ly---a.re capable of making mistakes. This par\u00ad ticular estimate concerns a system that is especially complicated and untestable--as we noted. In short, the President is likely to be deterred from pre-emptive attack of China. But would the Chinese know it? Might they not be sobered by an American defense? Again, their most likely strategies a.re ones to which nuclear conflict and the threat of it are irrelevant. In any case, can they be ex\u00ad pected to believe in the defence? Whoever heard of a defence that was airtight? Chinese planners will not have to be optimistic to be skeptical of the optimism of American plan\u00ad ners; they need only share the attitudes of almost everyone but strategic analysts. In addition, this posture of seeming to threaten pre-emptive attack is not desirable. The temptation to carry on the threat gives rise to risks of general nuclear war. To the extent that the threat of attack is successful, it might only induce in the Chinese a policy of holding Asians hostage. It would also in\u00ad duce them to develop weapons less desirable than missiles. In any case, the very effort to defend against Chinese missiles is likely to enhance China's status in Asia. And if Chi\u00ad nese missiles are worth such an effort on the part of the United States, it may be that Asians will be pressed by parties in opposi\u00ad tion to take the Chinese threat more seri\u00ad ously than they might have otherwise. The pre-emption possib111ty itself might be con\u00ad sidered very undesirable by friendly Asians and very dangerous. War with China, like war with North Vietnam, will be much more de\u00ad structive in the theatre Of con:filct than it ts to the United States, and this possib111ty will not be be lost upon Asians. In general, to base Western steadfastness in Asia upon the ability of the United States to reduce American casualties is to make the same mistake just made in Europe. There the United States has recently avoided basing her commitment on her ability to cut her own losses in a nuclear exchange--that posture has totally lost credib11ity. An analogous policy would lose that same credibility in Asia fast enough. The United States should there\u00ad fore develop a rationale for Asian guarantees with greater staying power. As in Europe, she should avoid playing into the hands of those who doubt her commitment by basing it on ever more dubious calculations of casualties. Notwithstanding all this, would the sys\u00ad tem work against China? No one really knows because the type and sophistication of future Chinese missiles cannot be known. The most effective counter-measures of the 1970s are not known either (nor whether they will be expensive or cheap). Whatever they are, they will be openly discussed in the American press, and the Chinese will learn them. The Defense Department estimates that attacks which might otherwise kill 7 million people could be held to 1 million or less. And it believes that as the Chinese ICBM force grows, \"for relatively modest outlays\" Sen\u00ad tinel could be improved to lim1t Chinese damage into the 1980's. But 1985 is as far in advance as 1950 is behind, and since the first Soviet atom and hydrogen bombs were deton\u00ad ated in 1949 and 1952, it has become clear that an awful lot of technical advance is possible in time spans of this order. Can the Chinese-oriented system be dis\u00ad sociated from a larger Soviet-oriented one? The Chinese force is likely to require im\u00ad provement in Sentinel earlier than the United States expects, and these improve\u00ad ments may blur the difference. More im\u00ad mediately, many in the United States see Sentinel as a suitable beginning for an at\u00ad tempt to maintain or increase American nuclear \"superiority\"; Secretary Clifford might be in that category. Certainly Sentinel could be a building-block to a larger system. (It is also what the Defense Department calls Footnotes at end of article. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS a \"foundation\" for a future defence of Min\u00ad uteman forces.) Most relevant, the Soviet leaders are likely to see this system a,s a first step to a defence against their missiles, because that is the problem they worry about and because they need lead-time to take the appropriate pre\u00ad ventive measures. Certainly, Sentinel is far more effective in neutralizing overall Soviet capabilities than the primitive Soviet efforts around Moscow are in reducing those of the United States. And consider how much the latter overreacted to the Soviet efforts. Mr. McNamara called the American deci\u00ad sion to build Sentinel \"marginal\". But in terms of the American-Soviet arms race, the balance seems quite in the other direction. Sentinel seems likely to cost the United States a great deal in time. MISSILE DEFENCES AND ARMS CONTROL For some time the dominant American view has been that missile defences would have the exacerbating effect on the arms race just described, and that the pressures they would generate could not be contained in a comprehensive formal agreement. For this reason, for example, the American proposal to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Con\u00ad ference that it explore a freeze on offensive and defensive strategic nuclear delivery ve\u00ad hicles included as an essential part limita\u00ad tions on anti-ball1stic missiles.11 In the recent past there have been isolated defections from this view, encouraged by the seeming inevitab111ty of Soviet missile de\u00ad fence deployment-an inevitab1llty now largely based on American actions, if indeed missile defences are inevitable at all. One advocate of missile defences has suggested that ballistic missile defences could reduce potential casualties (an arms-control goal) and then be controlled by a comprehensive American-Soviet agreement. Such a possi\u00ad b111ty cannot be ruled out entirely, since for example, the missile defences might be as ineffective and irrelevant as existing air de\u00ad fences. But, assuming that the deployment contest between missiles and anti-missiles was reasonably balanced-so that the de\u00ad fensive missiles were, or were thought to be, competitive with the offensive ones-then the competition between offence and defence becomes very complicated and hard to freeze. Indeed, in practice, it is probably only neces\u00ad sary that the defense seem to be improvable to effectiveness in coming years for it to cast a pall over the prospects of the treaty. And this is !or strategic analysts! Politicians may find it sufficient to know that the treaty and the problem are complicated, that tech\u00ad nology changes fast, and that deterrence is important. Note that even with an enormous political, strategic, and economic consensus favouring ending the arms race on the basis of overkill and nuclear plenty, not more than a handful of American senators argued for an agreement with the Russians. If deter\u00ad rence seemed erodable, under the treaty, even this handful would be further reduced. As for the technical complications induced by missile defences, they are enormous. Each side is comm! tted to ongoing research and development in every faintly plausible di\u00ad rection out of which an effective defence might come. It is quite impossible to design a treaty that would cope with ideas not yet formulated-such ideas would, of course, have to be covered by a right of withdrawal. But there are also those ideas which, while not sufficiently novel to spark a withdrawal from the treaty, may nevertheless arouse the most serious concern. What if a treaty had been negotiated in the early 1960s that lim\u00ad ited the number of defensive missiles and froze only it.he exrt;emalily observable ch&\"\u00ad acteristics--a common assumption. The American improvements in range of inter\u00ad ception and kill mechanism of warhead could have turned the point-defense, \"frozen by the treaty, into a defence of large areas. 4255 Similarly, the recent shift from individual warheads to smaller independently guided re-entry vehicles very substantially changes the effl.ciency of each offensive missile. In effect each missile is turned into several. Yet, with regard to external characteristics. the missiles can be designed to look the same. It is possible to hope that defensive improvements like these mentioned might be exactly nullified by offensive improvements like these also mentioned. But surely there ts no certainty about it. At least one analyst has argued that the problem would be solved if the United States did not put such emphasis on overwhelming deterrence, and has proposed that this em\u00ad phasis be changed. But in view of the pollt\u00ad ical obstacles, the lead-time uncertainties, and the tremendous sensitivity of all con\u00ad cerned, it seems unrealistic to think that important changes might be effected. It 18 relatively easy to persuade a Congress or an American Administration to do something like buy a ball1stic missile defence. But to persuade it that it ought not respond to Soviet defences is to strike at the funda\u00ad mental premise of post-war strategic weapon policy--overwhelming deterrence. More often, it has been argued that the Russians will never agree to holding down expenditures on missile defences, and hence that agreements must be designed to permit them. (Again, it should be pointed out that, on available evidence, the Soviet Union is not planning to spend very much.) But in con\u00ad sidering what the Russians will accept, one must also keep in mind what they cannot refuse. The idea that the Russians should not build a missile defence effective against the United States is not just part of a pro\u00ad posal which the United States would like the Soviet Union to accept; it is an integral part of American policy with which the United States would like to have the Russians co\u00ad operate. The United States can, and unques\u00ad tionably will, 'negotiate' the ineffectiveness of a Soviet defence unilaterally. That is what Mr. McNamara meant when he testified in the spring of 1967: \"I do not think they have a defence, Mr. Sikes, that ls exactly my point. We will get more weapons through to the Soviet Union as a result of their deploying an ABM than we would if they had not. We presented to you a programme that with a high degree of probab111ty Will more than o1f\u00ad set their ABM .... \" Therefore, I say they do not have a defence'.18 In this light, any ex\u00ad penditures by the Russians on a missile de\u00ad fence designed against the United States would be errors in cost-effectiveness. ones which they would eventually correct. Re\u00ad member, the Soviet Union is not standing still; a Kosygin or his successor may veto expenditures that a. Khrushchev might not know how to oppose, or a Stalin want to. It has been suggested that the United States should match Soviet expenditures on missile defence, on the assumption that sim\u00ad ilar forces on both sides Will make arms\u00ad control agreements easier. Why this should be so is unclear; in any case the argument puts too much stress on the relatively more formal-and less likely-methods of ending the arms race. It is noteworthy that no one seems to think that the United States need match the Russians in numbers of subma\u00ad rines or they match us in kinds of naval forces-as a precondition of plausible agree\u00ad ments. In any event, the argument was made on the now questionable assumption that the Soviet Union was buying more missile de\u00ad fence than the United States. In some cases, analysts who emphasize the importance of symmetry in matching the Russians' (supposed) missile defence pur\u00ad chases--elther to deter them or to secure an agreement with them-Will insist that the agreement also preserve \"historical asym\u00ad metries between the capabillties of Ameri\u00ad can and Soviet strategic forces. In short. some will argue for symmetry when it comes to matching the Russians, and against it when it comes to their matching us. Indeed, the notion of \"historical asymmetries\" is al\u00ad together quetsionable, in that the post-war periods have seen very different ratios of megatons deliverable (ranging from many\u00ad to-zero at one extreme to one-to-one at an\u00ad other, depending upon the period and type of measurement). EUROPE The single most important consideration in the attitude of Europeans to American missile defence decisions concerns the con\u00ad fidence of European central bankers in Amer\u00ad ican fl.seal responsibility. Faced with rising unrest at home, an expensive war abroad, inflation, and a balance-of-payments deficit, the United States is finding it ever harder to persuade European bankers and European institutions to hold US dollars rather than gold. The issue will turn on European confi\u00ad dence in the ability of the United States to set her house in order-to stop inflation and stem the balance-of-payments deficit. But more immediately, the issue is the credib11ity of the government's determination, as meas\u00ad ured by its willingness to take unpalatable measures. In this connection, a decision to spend resources on missile defences is likely to be the worst possible step. It will seem to reflect the Administra.tion's unwillingness to make hard decisions: a government unwill\u00ad ing to disengage from a war abroad, obli\u00ad gated to right urban wrongs at home, and financially pressed abroad is willing to open an open-ended new front in the arms race. While some European national security ana\u00ad lysts may see merit in the missile defence, European financial circles are likely to see only inflation and equivocation. These at\u00ad titudes will be enforced by the general un\u00ad popularity of the Vietnam war, which pre\u00ad cludes a certain amount of sympathy for the American predicament, and for her requests for special consideration in the name of com\u00ad mon defence against Communism or aggres\u00ad sion. This issue is of enormous consequence.10 To return to more standard strategic con\u00ad siderations, in view of the thousands of tac\u00ad tical nuclear weapons in Europe, and the general low level of apprehension in West\u00ad ern Europe over the Soviet threat, Europeans do not seem to feel the need for enhanced American strategic superiority that one might have predicted some years ago. In short, there is no direct European doctrinal requirement for an American missile defence. Nor are Europeans unduly concerned about Soviet defences, assuming, as they can, that the United States will be making energetic efforts to neutralize them. In the long run, it is possible that Euro\u00ad peans will come to regard missile defences as desirable for themselves. This does not seem very plausible at present, in view of British cuts in defence expenditure and French strains in producing even strategic offensive weapons. But a growing European armaments industry might become interested in missile defence for export to countries that might feel threatened by Chinese mis\u00ad siles-Australia, Japan, India, Formosa-as well as to West European countries that might be involved in some future European war. And both these impulses might be strengthened by advances in missile defence effectiveness. Existing experience in missile defence development teaches us to antici\u00ad pate periods in which missile defences may look especially promising; during one such period, it is possible that Europeans might try to buy whatever the major powers had already bought. It ought to be mentioned also that mis\u00ad sile defences lend themselves conceptually to the different rationales used by supporters of the multilateral force; indeed, missile defences fit these arguments better than the multilateral force itself.20 At some point, ef\u00ad forts may be made to use this fact to intro\u00ad duce co-operative missile defences in Europe. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS PROLIFERATION It has been argued that American and Soviet missile defences will increase the tech\u00ad nological gap between the major powers and other powers and, in this way, somehow re\u00ad duce the risk of proliferation. However, one is hard put to find a potential nuclear power which is likely to forgo nuclear weapons sim\u00ad ply because, a decade or so hence when it has missiles to mount them on, these missiles might be unable to penetrate the defences of the United States or the Soviet Union. Many potential nuclear powers, among them the most plausible (e.g. Egypt, Israel, India, Pak\u00ad istan, and Japan), are not directly inter\u00ad ested in their ability to penetrate American or Soviet defences. In many potential nuclear powers, aZZ strategic questions are secondary to other motivations. No one is going to believe, in any case, that a nuclear bomb in hand cannot in time be made credible enough in one fashion or an\u00ad other. It is a revea.ling reductio ad absurdum that gaps in this argument have sometimes been filed in the following bizarre fashion: if America has a missile defence, the Egyptians, though not interested directly in threatening the United States, will have to anticipate an American guarantee of Israel, backed by an American missile defence. If they anticipate being unable to penetrate the American de\u00ad fence, they would anticipate finding nuclear weapons useless for threatening Israel and hence would be significantly less likely to buy them in the first place. This obviously, re\u00ad quires single-minded Egyptian attention to a single long-run scenario. It requires un\u00ad precedented confidence in American defences of the future-more confidence than most American analysts have. And it requires an absence of other motivations for having the bomb. Evidently proliferation provides no motive for still greater missile defence expenditures. And by way of contrast it is worth mention\u00ad ing that the political councils of at least some potential nuclear powers may be in\u00ad fluenced adversely if the United States and the Soviet Union find themselves unable to prevent a new round of the arms race. Cer\u00ad tainly the Indians have made this point re\u00ad peatedly. Speaking generally, missile defences will add to the world-wide fixation on nuclear weapons and make it more dimcult to dispel the desire for them. It may lead the Japanese to review the development of a regional ABM system for them, and to stimulate discus\u00ad sions of the distinction between offensive and defensive weapons .21 All of this can be harmful to the non-proliferation effort. CRISIS BARGAINING It has been suggested that one-sided Soviet development of ball1stic missile de\u00ad fences would lead Soviet generals to believe that the United States could be pushed around. One spokesman-again under the impression that the Soviet Union was doing more than the United States--even went so far as to call this the single most important reason for American procurement. Perhaps this fear has been allayed by the recent de\u00ad cision of the Secretary of Defense to build at least some ballistic missile defence. But it is symptomatic of the character of the debate over missile defence that an argu\u00ad ment of this kind should be put forward. To maintain it one is forced to assume that the Russians' interest in defences stemmed from the high valuation they put on them, which, in turn, would suggest their con\u00ad tempt for anyone who did not have them. The argument overlooks the possibility that defences might have been purchased for reasons of vested interests-reason unrelated to strategy . Or that they might have been bought because of compulsions to buy de\u00ad fensive weapons arising from the psychology of Soviet suffering in World War II-again reasons unrelated to strategy. Or simply that February 24, 1969 they were bought in anticipation of an American purchase, or because the Soviet bureaucratic system still thinks Russia might be attacked. Some argue for an American ballistic mis\u00ad sile defence on grounds that it will improve the strategic balance. A few years ago, it would have been argued that such a defence would persuade the Soviet Union that the United States might be willing, under ex\u00ad treme provocation, to strike first and suffer the consequences of retaliation. This same point of view now claims only that the United States would gain escalation assurance-a willingness to bargain harder in crises. The difference between these positions is largely semantic and certainly is not one that can be communicated with assurance to the Rus\u00ad sians. A variety of news reports have already suggested that the Russians regard the American decision to build a 'Chinese' bal\u00ad listic missile defence as threatening. Some writers have quoted the figures pro\u00ad vided by the Secretary of Defense in support of the idea that only \"escalation assurance\", and not greater strategic advantage, will be secured. These figures show immediate Amer\u00ad ican fatalities being reduced only from 30 million to 20 million. But, as has been pointed out, the figures are mustrative. I! any president is ever induced by some enor\u00ad mous provocation or mental imbalance to launch his strategic force, it will be because he is persuaded that some highly sensitive trick or tactic will destroy virtually all Soviet weapons locatable, and that an improved missile defence, in conjunction with anti\u00ad submarine warfare, will be highly effective in destroying a disjointed and sporadic at\u00ad tack. With a vast missile defence, but not without it, one can perhaps imagine a presi\u00ad dent imagining a successful nuclear attack on Russia. This is one way of describing the difference a missile defence makes, and it gives one pause. It has also been argued that ballistic mis\u00ad sile defences would make an American presi\u00ad dent and a Soviet premier less willing to use demonstration missile attacks as shows of force, thus making the actual initiation of a central war much more difilcult. But the plausib111ty of demonstration missile attacks is itself controversial, at best. The argument's underlying premise, that these attacks con\u00ad stitute a sizable fraction of the only avenues by which a war can be started, is a further very questionable speculation. And even the idea that the ballistic missile defences will make demonstrations much less likely\u00ad rather than, for example, only adding some\u00ad thing new to demonstrate, namely penetra\u00ad tion capability-superimposes a third order of uncertainty. CONCLUSION A decision has been taken to build a small missile defence against the possibility of Chi\u00ad nese attack-what 'small' will mean relative to a growing Chinese force is hard to say. Indeed, it is possible that the Chinese will not build intercontinental ball1stic missiles at all. At the moment, the most appropriate question seems to be: should the United States press on and build a still bigger mis\u00ad sile defence at a cost of tens rather than several billions? Many of the arguments given for doing so by strategic analysts were set forth under the impression that the Rus\u00ad sians were building a wide-scale missile de\u00ad fence over and above that around Moscow. These arguments, e.g. that the Russians will feel contempt for us if we don't have what they do, or that an agreement with them will become more feasible if we do have what they do, were always speculative, marginal, and controversial. Now their very premise seems doubtful. \"Matching the Russians\" does not seem to be at issue-according to the majority of the intell1gence community quoted earlier by Mr. McNamara. February 24, 1969 In any case, the only important reasons for a heavy missile defence have always been sufficient expectation of nuclear war, and sufficient expectation that the defence would work, to override the obvious economic and political arguments against it. Ever greater effectiveness is required of the defensive sys\u00ad tems, and men of experience in these matters, have learned to be skeptical of the possibllity of achieving it. Just as estimates of cost for big systems are always uncertain (virtually always too low, estimates of effectiveness can be no more reliable. Indeed, with re\u00ad spect to cost, the factors are relatively well determined; but effectiveness involves an intelligent adversary who will be seeking counter-measures. Expectations that the defences will work can hardly be very high. The 'offence' is not being left behind, and if the Soviet Govern\u00ad ment wants to make the necessary expendi\u00ad tures, it can defeat the Western system even on paper. (Because defence is a harder and more unreliable game than offence, the Rus\u00ad sian offence is still more likely to defeat the defence in an actual war.) Depending upon how the war started and many other fac\u00ad tors, a massive defence might or might not protect when and if war came. No one will ever be sure. And very possLbly the system will be considered obsolete--like its two pred\u00ad ecessors-before its date of completion. Nevertheless, the United States seems likely to press on with missile defences in the absence of talks with the Soviet Union simply because she is unable to restrain her\u00ad self from doing so. Mr. McNamara's appeals to the Russians to talk were really appeals for help--help in ending the arms race. Com\u00ad bined with fears on both sides of increasingly vulnerable land-based missiles, missile de\u00ad fences have the potential to project the United States and the Soviet Union very firmly into a next round~n which the United States and possibly the Soviet Union build missile defences and both try to build offensive weapons in response to future de\u00ad fence. In my view, the important question for the West is whether the national interest of the United States demands that she try to pro\u00ad tect against the low-probability threat of nuclear war, even if the chance of effective protection is itself small over the long run. Perhaps any amount of money and any en\u00ad couragement to the arms race are worth a small chance of protecting American society, and perhaps nothing in the resultant arms race can make the United States much more vulnerable than she is now. This point of view, whioh also discounts the political im\u00ad plications of a continuing arms race, must be answered on a still different plane. It raises the question of how long, and at what cost, America will continue to bemuse herself with low-probability threats to her \"na\u00ad tional security\" in a world where others uni\u00ad formly have less security and, almost uni\u00ad formly, look to her for some kind of moral and financial leadership. The United States must learn, just as people must learn, to distinguish between a legitimate interest in insurance and an obsessive, neurotic con\u00ad cern for an unachievable nuclear security.

Thus if ten 50- kiloton warheads will destroy 1.7 hard mis\u00ad sile silos, and if this computation assumes that missiles are assigned to target so that no more than 2 per cent to 5 per cent of targets are undestroyed (a natural assump\u00ad tion), then the single-shot kill probability of each warhead must be 0.45 to 0.5 (see, for example, the table provided in Herman Kahn's On Thermonuclear War, p. 468, en\u00ad titled \"Missile Required to Attack a 50-Point Target System\"). Assuming that the Soviet target system of hard missile silos grows to, say, 1,000 by the mid-1970s period under dis\u00ad cussion, then 7,000 to 8,000 warheads with this single-shot kill probably could attack them in such a way that only about ten would remain. (See On Thermonuclear War, p. 481, for this estimate.) If each of the 1,000 American land-based missiles came to have the \"several\" warheads referred to ear\u00ad lier, this might be feasible on paper. Incidentally, if the range from 1.2 to 1.7 provided earlier refers to ranges of \"hard\u00ad ness\" from, say, 100 psi to something higher (\"hard\" means at least 100 psi in common parlance) , then the CEP under considera\u00ad tion can be read from the table on page 469 of Qn Thermonuclear War (using the well\u00ad known fact that the efficiency of missiles varies as yield % CEP2 or from the standard Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer Slide Rule.

The fundamental problem seems now to be one of persuading others to join with the United States in the final establishment of a new monetary system-rather than only to hold American dollars. But this is at least as 4257 difficult, and militates against missile de\u00ad fenses on the same economic and psychologi\u00ad cal grounds. 20 For this argument, see my article \"ABM\u00ad The Next, MLF?\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, September 1966. 21 These points have been made by Mrs. Alice Hsieh in testimony before the Joint Atomic Energy Commission, Scope, p. 86. [From Foreign Affairs, April 1968} THE ABM, PROLIFERATION AND INTERNATIONAL STABILITY (By Robert L. Rothstein) The contemporary strategic era, dominated by ballistic missiles, has appeared to possess a curious kind of stability. Despite its un\u00ad certainties and dangers, two factors were ap\u00ad parently beyond dispute. On the one hand, neither the Soviet Union nor the United States could eliminate the other's missile forces in a first strike or effectively defend against a retaliatory missile strike. The offense seemed to have made a quantum jump against the defense: the old pattern of oscillation between defensive and offensive superiority had apparently been superseded by a period in which, for the foreseeable future, defense would be definitely inferior and incapable of matching offensive gains. On the other hand, missiles were so ex\u00ad pensive and required so much technical so\u00ad phistication that very few countries could either afford them or build them. The vex\u00ad ing problem of nuclear proliferation thus appeared in a new light. Even if a state could develop a nuclear bomb, it was assumed that it could not be a truly \"effective\" member of the nuclear club unless it also developed a missile to deliver it somewhere. The double \u00b7task of building a bomb and a sophisticated delivery system inevitably seemed so difficult that the problem of preventing a thoroughly destabilizing nuclear proliferation appeared relatively simple. At worst, the process could be \"managed.\" We may, however, be entering a strategic era in which neither factor holds true. Whether ballistic missile defense ever achieves the level of effectiveness (near per\u00ad fect) some of its proponents foresee in the next decade, and whether the costs and dif\u00ad ficulties of developing rocket vehicles are as sharply reduced as others contend (so that the ability to deliver the bomb in high style spreads rapidly) are obviously uncer\u00ad tain. But to the degree that these prophecies are accurate, or believed, the stability of the missile era may prove to have been very transl tory. At any rate, one point deserves emphasis. Deployment of an ABM system and the be\u00ad ginning of a process of nuclear diffusion (which may be directly related to the ABM decision), irrespective of whether they occur because of political or technological reasons, may thrust us into a new strategic environ\u00ad ment in which even the tenuous stability of the present will evoke nostalgia. In the cir\u00ad cumstances, policies which would have ap\u00ad peared dangerous or unnecessarily provoca\u00ad tive yesterday may perhaps begin to appear more prudential and realistic today or to\u00ad morrow. II The recent announcement of the decision to begin installing a \"thin\" ABM system elicited a great deal of negative comment in the American and European press. This is hardly surprising for, on the basis of pub\u00ad licly available information, the arguments against the ABM seemed much more per\u00ad suasive than those for it. In fact, anyone who troubled to read Mr. McNamara's state\u00ad ment on the budget in January 1967 would come away quite convinced that the argu\u00ad ments justifying early installation of an ABM system were at best premature and at worst spurious . Yet within the year Mr. Mc\u00ad Namara had apparently changed his mind 4258 and committed the United States to early deployment of a partial ABM system. The San Francisco speech in which he announced the decision may, perhaps, be read as an ambiguous and even anguished justification for the ABM; but it still may have com\u00ad mitted us decisively. It is possible, of course, that there were objective military and political reasons for Mr. McNamara's about-face. A new tech\u00ad nological breakthrough might have occurred or intelligence might have yielded firmer and more dangerous information about So\u00ad viet or Chinese capabilities or intentions. To a certain extent this indeed appears to have happened. Soviet development of a \"frac\u00ad tional orbital bombardment system\" (FOBS), reports of heavy Soviet investment in both offensive and defensive missile systems, new predictions about Chinese capabilities and significant advances in our own ballistic missile defense research (especially with X-ray warheads) all tended to point in the same direction; prompt deployment of a \"thin\" ABM system. Now, it is a mistake to argue as if the installation of an ABM system would have only negative consequences and that a delay would have only positive consequences. De\u00ad cisions such as these are a wager about the future and they are made---or ought to be made--\"on balance,\" and with full realiza\u00ad tion that the possibility of unanticipated consequences or mistaken consequences is very high. In the circumstances, there is great temptation to buy insurance by developing everything that can be developed, and to do everything possible to reestablish or main\u00ad tain a situation which seems to be advan\u00ad tageous. The virtues which the Joint Chiefs of Staff have seen in immediate deployment of the ABM system may be regarded in this light. Their arguments, in isolation, seem persuasive: more effective deterrance, a re\u00ad duction in the number of lives lost should deterrence fail at reduction in the possibility of accidental or \"catalytic\" wars, a halt to nuclear proliferation and, above all, a stabil\u00ad ization of the existing strategic balance (i.e. one in which the United States possesses \"dominance\"). ABM deployment, according to the Chiefs, would \"continue the Cuba power environment in the world .... At the time of Cuba, the strategic nuclear balance was such that the Soviets did not have an exploitable capabllity because of our vastly superior nuclear strength.\" None of these arguments ls as clear and uncontroversial as the Joint Chiefs of Staff appear to assume. Mr. McNamara himself ap\u00ad parently found them unconvincing as re\u00ad cently as a year ago. Under some circum\u00ad stances, and ln certain future contexts, an ABM system promised several limited ad\u00ad vantages; on balance, however, they were apparently outweighed by the disadvantages. Under the best of circumstances, the ABM seemed prone to obsolescence (as new of\u00ad fensive missiles appeared), uncertainly ef\u00ad fective,1 enormously expensive and politically inexpedient. The obvious question is whether various technological developments in the past year, as well as new uncertainties about Soviet and Chinese behavior, justified a re\u00ad shu1Hing of priorities and a definite decision to plunge into a new strategic environment. Even for thase with access to all the available 1 As one Department of Defense expert has noted: \"Any defensive system can really do no more than to raise the entrance price which an attacker must pay in order to de\u00ad stroy a target.\" Charles M. Herzfeld, \"BMD and National Security,\" Annals of the New York Academv of Sciences, 1965, reprinted in Survival, March, 1966, p. 74. The best analysis of the ABM problem which I have found is J. I. Coffey, \"The ABM Debate,\" Foreign Affairs, April 1967. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS information it must have been an agonizing choice: the stakes are frightening high. It ought to be said, however, that there are a number of very knowledgeable people in Washington who maintain that the fore\u00ad going considerations were irrelevant. They contend that the decision was almost com\u00ad pletely a response to domestic political pressures. While the argument is not very subtle, it is also not entirely implausible. With the political costs of the Vietnamese war ac\u00ad celerating, the Johnson Administration may well have felt that it could not risk provid\u00ad ing the right wing (both Democratic and Republican) with another security issue in the forthcoming elections. It may be, as some have said, that the Administration overesti\u00ad mated the degree of Congressional pressure for an ABM system. However, it was quality not quantity which was probably decisive: the Congressmen who were most vociferous on this issue were also among those who could harm Mr. Johnson most in the next year. In addition, the Joint Chiefs, whose discontent is frequently noted, had to be pacified; their leverage on the President and the Secretary of Defense went up as their threats to resign became increasingly dan\u00ad gerous in political terms. That the decision to begin deployment of a \"thin\" ABM system was not the result of a considered evaluation of all the military and polltical evidence may perhaps be inferred from the confused manner in which it was publlcly justified. While it was said to be aimed solely at the emerging dangers of a Chinese nuclear strike against the United States, and not at the Soviet Union, against which it was patently ineffective, both Mr. McNarama and various military officers indi\u00ad cated that it would indeed have an indirect effect on the Soviet-American strategic bal\u00ad ance. By providing point defense for our Minutemen it clearly would cut down the effectiveness of a Soviet strike against them. However, since the Administration was in the throes of a publlc and private effort to con\u00ad vince the Soviets that the ABM deployment was not aimed at them, and that discussions to curtail ABM deployment were necessary and possible, \"clarification\" was needed. A public speech by Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul C. Warnke attempted to provide it. Mr. Warnke argued \"that our Chinese\u00ad oriented ABM deployment should make it easier, and not harder, for countries in Asia to sign the NPT [nonproliferation treaty].\" The ABM, he maintained, would make the American commitment to defend Asia credi\u00ad ble, since henceforth Detro! t or Los Angeles, etc., would be safe from Chinese retaliation. He also maintained that it would emphasize the \"unique disparity\" between the United States and China, and thus make it \"even clearer\" to the Asians that they could safely sign the nonproliferation treaty. He con\u00ad cluded by declaring that the Soviets \"knew\" that the system was not designed for use against them, and therefore need not respond to lt---surely one of the more naive imputa\u00ad tions of faith in recent years, especially given the contradictory testimony from other offi\u00ad cials of his own Department. Mr. Warnke's analysis of the possible ef\u00ad fects of the ABM is peculiar in that he ap\u00ad parently presumes that it can be deployed while everything else in the strategic and political environment remains static. The Russians will not respond, or will respond by agreeing to arms-control measures, because they believe in our good intentions. The Asians will agree to forego nuclear weapons because their faith in our good intentions will rise. The Chinese, who have no faith in our good intentions, will \"finally\" realize that we can destroy them and will behave more rationally. And our European allies wlll, February 24, 1969 of course, realize that, as we have from time to time maintained, our efforts to improve our own defense have nothing to do with our commitment to come to their aid; and it is merely a nMty impertinence to insinuate in Gaullist style that we are leaving them ex\u00ad posed and ignored. Many of our strategic analysts have tended to view strategic problems from a systemic point of view, almost to the exclusion of other vantage points. As a result, particular events or developments have been assessed primarily from the global perspective of the superpowers. Since the strategic configura\u00ad tion which has existed over the last twenty years has, for the most part, reflected con\u00ad ditions of American dominance and relative stability, new developments have inevitably been foreseen as destabilizing unless they were controlled by, or symmetrically limited to, the superpowers. The response to the problem of prolifera\u00ad tion ls a case in point. Granted it is poten\u00ad tially very destabilizing, how does one pre\u00ad vent it? The usual answer has been by per\u00ad suading poten tlal nuclear powers that their efforts will be extremely costly and that, anyway, they will be useless if not counter\u00ad productive against the United States or the Soviet Union. That ls, the systemic perspec\u00ad tive has been maintained: the behavior of small and middle powers has been evaluated almost wholly in terms of its possible im\u00ad pact on the whole system. Since we have favored the status quo, our efforts have been llmi ted to trying to convince others not to rock the boat. The whole syndrome can be perceived in the arguments designed to con\u00ad vince France not to join the nuclear club; they were perfectly logical but also irrele\u00ad vant. To Paris, and perhaps to many potential nuclear powers, the problem appeared in a wholly different perspective when evaluated in terms of national (i.e. sub-systemic) in\u00ad terests. Mr. Warnke's speech may be read in this light. Again, it is assumed that other states will perceive the situation in the same way as we do and will be as concerned with international stability as we are. There 1s no attempt to examine the problem from other points of view. If we do attempt to interpret the impact of the ABM decision from local perspectives, the picture which emerges is not nearly as optimistic as the one drawn by Mr. Warnke. m We can begin by discussing China's pos\u00ad sible reactions. It ls doubtful that anyone seriously believes that the ABM, as currently described, ls aimed at China. However, since public justifications have insisted that the essential aim of the ABM system ls deterrence or defense against Chinese threats, the argument must be examined. It should be clear that the political and psychological advantages of China's nuclear weapons are not directly related to Ame.rtcan defensive capabilities. There is thus no sense in the simplistic argument that an ABM system will actually induce the Chinese to forego missile development. In addition, the assumption that the Chinese will react to an increase in our defensive capabilities by decreasing their offensive capabilities is not psychologically convincing: the opposite re\u00ad action may be more likely. The usual contention, however, is not that the Chinese will give up their missile pro\u00ad gram but tha.t a \"thin\" ABM system will substantially lessen the impact of a Chinese nuclear attack. What is the probablllty of such an attack? To some, the likelihood is high; the Chinese are more aggressive and less rational than the Soviets and will strike rather than accept humlllatlon. In effect, a Cuban missile crisis with the Chinese is destined to have a different scenario. To others, the behavior of the Chinese has been as cautious and nonprovocative as that of the Soviets and the probablllty that they February 24, 1969 would strike the United States seems very low. Acceptance of the latter point of view has to be tempered by several considerations. The first, obviously, is the current internal instability of China, which might lead to ex\u00ad treme or irrational behavior in a crisis. An\u00ad other point is that China has not yet reached the stage where war-as the fashionable ar\u00ad gument goes--becomes increasingly unpalat\u00ad able and unlikely as energies are concentrated on the accomplishment of domestic tasks. Finally, the Chinese tradition is different from our own, we have miscalculated their response before, their standards of rationality may diverge as much from ours as Japan's did in 1941-<and so on. In short, it is not altogether unreasonable to worry about aggressive and irrational behavior by the Chinese. The critical question concerns the relationship between that assumption and the installation of an ABM system. Reports on Chinese missile capab111ties sug\u00ad gest that they might have a small but op\u00ad eMtional ICBM force in the early 1970s. What damage that force could inflict upon the United States depends on a range of factors which defy simple summation. The \"thin\" ABM system promises area coverage of the whole mass of this country against a light attack. Thus even if the Chinese were willing to trade payload for range (and reach cities considerably east of the Mississippi), it would do them little good since those cities would be as protected by the ABM as our west-coast cities. They could, in theory, saturate one or a few areas with all their missile strength, but the effectiveness of that tactic would de\u00ad pend on the capability of our ABM system and the actual number of ICBMs the Chinese could launch. It is diflicult to take these calculations very seriously. It ls hard to imagine a set of circumstances in which the Chinese would actually strike first with their small ICBM foree, and one is inevitably obliged to create scenarios of ever increasing degrees of im\u00ad probability. They could, in some Gotterdiim\u00ad merung fashion, launch all of their force against Sa-n Francisco; or they could spread it out in belief that our ballistic missile defense was a \"paper wall;\" or they could gamble on odd forms of delivery (the pro\u00ad verbial bomb in the cargo hold, or nuclear torpedoes against coastal cities, or small planes launched from ships and carrying small bombs, etc.). But the probability of their doing so is surely very low. And since we cannot prepare for all potential dangers, regardless of plausibility, and since even reasonably prudential calculations suggest that a Chinese ICBM attack on the United States is highly improbable, an ABM system justified by reference to Chinese threats to ourselves does not make much sense. This 1s the more true because lead times are such that we could still meet the threat if it became less improbable at a later date. The case seems even stronger if we try to foresee the response Peking might make to our ABM system. It is very unclear at the moment, especially to anyone not privy to whatever information we are collecting about the mainland, just what the Chinese are attempting to develop. They will probably produce some ICBMs, if only to prove that they can do so. However, they are most likely to concentrate on medium-range missiles in order to threaten neighboring states in Asia. This would allow them to delay investing heavily in an ICBM until they are capable of producing an improved second-generation weapon. The Chinese could, in a sense, hope to duplicate the efforts of the Soviets in the late 1940s and 1950s, when, being clearly in\u00ad ferior to the United States in strategic power, they deployed their ground forces and short\u00ad range missiles to threaten Western Europe. The message was clear. If we attacked Mos\u00ad cow, confident that we would not be hurt\u00b7 badly, we were warned that Europe would be devastated in the process. An asymmetric balance seemed to exist, and the weaker side EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS appeared to deter the stronger by threaten\u00ad ing an area which the stronger valued but could not easily protect. Though the analogy is obviously imprecise, the odds definitely favor a Chinese strategy designed to threaten us only indirectly, at least until that day, probably in the late 1970s or 1980s, when the Chinese are able to produce a force capable of achieving nuclear parity or stalemate with ours (and the so\u00ad viets'). In the meantime, the ABM system we are committed to install will rapidly be\u00ad come obsolescent. In sum, against the Chi\u00ad nese, our ABM system promises advantages only if the Chinese are foolish enough to launch an attack on us with their first gen\u00ad eration ICBMs. Presumably, then, the ABM system must serve other purposes. The one most fre\u00ad quently cited is the possib1llty that it wm enhance the credib1llty of any commitment we offer to a nonnuclear country (e.g., India or Japan) threatened by a nuclear power. The idea has a certain plausib1llty in that, 1n a world in which all calculations were ra\u00ad tional, the possib111ty of limiting destruction to ourselves ought to convince our friends that we are more likely to live up to our commitments to them. If true, they will not need to develop their own nuclear weapons and can then sign the nonproliferation treaty, for they will be assured that we will counter mortal threats to their existence. It is difficult to speculate on this point, for the evidence is both slight and ambiguous. The Suez episode of 1956 provides one illus\u00ad tration of a nuclear threat against a non\u00ad nuclear state (France), but it 1s probably not a reliable analogy. At any rate, it did nothing to convince the French that they were better off without nuclear weapons of their own. India's reaction to the Chinese bomb is also ambiguous: at the least, India has begun to consider seriously the possib1llty of becoming a nuclear power. Unfortunately, one is left with the im\u00ad pression that the contention that our ABM system will fac111tate nonprollferation refiects profound hopes and desires, but not a very realistic judgment about how other states will view their own interests. Improvement in our defenses is Ukely to be of only marginal significance in affecting Asian calculations. Given the inherently low credibility of our nuclear guarantees outside Western Europe (and it has not been spectacularly high there either), the critical question ls not our \"damage llmiting\" capab111ty, but that of the Asians. Japan or India, threatened by a Chinese nuclear attack, will undoubtedly prefer an American guarantee to nothing at all. But it is possible (even probable?) that they will view it as only a temporary um\u00ad brella while launching a crash program to develop their own nuclear weapons. The only way to short-circuit the process may be to provide threatened states with an effective ABM-defense of their own. If we really want them to forgo developing nu\u00ad clear weapons, we must provide a direct de\u00ad fense of their territories. This could be ac\u00ad complished in several ways, but some com\u00ad bination of an explicit American guarantee, the provision of a reasonably effective area ABM system (preferably at least initially under our control), and perhaps even the promise of a small, offensive nuclear force if a threat of a specified nature arises--all these may be necessary to make our guaran\u00ad tee credible and thus inhibit the process of proliferation.2 It is an extreme policy, and 2 The worst danger of a guarantee policy 1s that it might commit us to involvements we would prefer to avoid; the decisive question, which cannot be discussed here, is the extent to which we really have a viable option of noninvolvement open to us. The idea of a seaborne ABM force under our control may be worth investigating and might even be reasonably effective against a relatively small and unsophisticated Chinese missile force. 4259 can be justflied only in terms of the kind of environment it may be forced to contend with. The costs would be very high, not least in the sense that promising or providing a nation with an ABM system may be the first step toward its acquiring offensive nuclear weapons--on the uncertain but not implau\u00ad sible presumption that an ABM system with\u00ad out a complementary offensive capab1llty is as unsatisfactory as entering a battle with a shield but without a sword. Moreover, the problem of defending against an MRBM is al\u00ad most insuperable, given their limited flight time, and especially if they are dellvered in number. Hence, the pressure for offensive weapons as a deterrent wm be heavy. This suggests that the possib111ty of sign\u00ad ing an effective nonprollferation treaty is bound to decline rather sharply in the near future; that many states will be seeking their own nuclear defenses; and that we shall have to consider new nuclear arrange\u00ad ments if we want to do more than wring our hands piously as the environment becomes more and more dangerous. IV What effect may our ABM system have on our relations with the Soviet Union and our European ames? The argument that an: ABM system would \"continue the Cuba. power environment in the world,\" and thus reinforce our ab1llty to deter the Soviet Union, is superficially plausible until it 1s placed in context. The assumption that the installation of an ABM system will enhance our ability to deter the Soviets depends on what kind of system we build and how the Soviets respond to it. Some systems and the responses they evoke would decrease our ability and increase the chance of an even more destructive war. All the denials notwithstanding, our ABM system is primarily designed to counter an apparently growing Soviet threat. In the past, we have tended to assume that the way in which we developed or deployed our weapons systems signaled something to our enemies about our mmtary intentions. It has never been very clear that the Soviets actually read these signals in the desired fashion. They may simply have been follow\u00ad ing their own technological genie wherever it led them: that is, they may have de\u00ad veloped and deployed weapons not 1n re\u00ad sponse to what we did but simply as a response to their own technological capa\u00ad b1lities. At any rate, it is difficult to resist some such reasoning in the light of the Soviet decision to begin installing their own ABM system. After all, if they were \"reading\" us accurately, they should have known that we would respond by building our own ABM system and by increasing our offensive mis\u00ad sile capab111ty to penetrate their defenses. They would then be in an even more in\u00ad ferior strategic position and would have expended scarce rubles for very little return in security. Our rearmament 1n 1950-53 and our reaction to the \"missile gap\" are only the most obvious 1llustrations of our unwill\u00ad ingness to remain behind. Yet the Soviets have apparently rebuffed all efforts to reach an agreement prohibiting ABM deployment---almost as if our response left them indifferent. The normal explana\u00ad tion offered by Western analysts ls the ex\u00ad treme defense-mindedness of the Soviet Gov\u00ad ernment and people. Marxist theory, a history of invasions and fears of encirclement ap\u00ad parently justify what seems to be an exces\u00ad sive concentration on defense-a phenome\u00ad non the Anglo-Saxon powers have always found, for obvious reasons, difficult to com\u00ad prehend. Nevertheless, defense-mindedness alone does not seem a sufficient explanation :for Soviet behavior. Another rationale ls that, as a relatively weaker power, the Soviets may feel consider\u00ad ably more threatened by the proliferation of small nuclear forces than we do. The French and Chinese nuclear forces, and the possi-4260 billty of a West German force, not only have the potential of infilcting considerable dam\u00ad age on the Soviet Union but also--given So\u00ad Viet history and predilections-might appear more likely to be actually used than we presume. To a weaker state, weaker nuclear forces appear more dangerous: the attacking smaller state could no doubt be destroyed in retaliation, but in the meanwhile it might have hurt the Soviets grievously and exposed them to American retaliation. If one pre\u00ad sumes that they have reordered their hier\u00ad archy of threats and have upgraded the dan\u00ad gers of living in a \"world of nuclear powers,\" the installation of a primitive ABM system does not look quite so \"irrational.\" That it simultaneously worsens relations with the United States could be accepted as a reason\u00ad able price to pay. Still, this argument could be completely wrong. The Soviets may still see us as the prime threat, and the ABM system may be designed to deter us and to limit damage in the event of a major war. The geographical placement of their ABM sites would seem to confirm this. In that case, the rationale for the Soviet decision remains very unclear, and the disagreements on this issue among SoViet leadership groups very understand\u00ad able. To many Western observers, however, the Soviet decision seems to be a manifesta\u00ad tion of a kind of intellectual lag in strategic thinking which has persisted for two decades. The Soviets have seemed to be sev\u00ad eral years behind us not only in weaponry but also in drawing the political, psychologi\u00b7 cal and military implications of various technological developments. Current ABM systems thus seem more effective when com\u00ad pared with the capabilities of an earlier generation of missiles. The Soviets may in fact have much greater faith in the techno\u00b7 logical capacities of their ABM than we tend to credit them with-a circumstance which could be dangerous. What effect will the mutual emplacement of ABM systems have on the strategic bal\u00ad ance between the United States and the Soviet Undon? There is no cleair ia.nd una.in\u00ad biguous answer. It will obviously depend on the kind and extent of the systems installed, and, perhaps even more, on each side's sub\u00ad jective estimates of the likelihood of war or probable behavior of its antagonist in major crises. It can be said, though, that ABM defense-\u00ad at least a less than perfect defense-ls of more relative utility to the aggressor than to the defender, whose retaliatory force must strike back in a weakened condition against a fully alterted defensive force. And since there is no situation in which striking first is not of some relative advantage, defensive forces can have a very destabilizing impact on any strategic balance to the degree that they make it appear as if striking first is be\u00ad coming a more and more \"attractive\" possi\u00ad b111ty to either or both sides. This is espe\u00ad cially true if one side is aware that it holds the weaker cards in any strategic exchange and is less than firmly convinced of the peaceful intentions of its adversary. Its pro\u00ad pensity to gamble on striking first in a crisis may then be fairly high. This is a familiar syndrome and it suggests why many analysts argue that installation of an ABM system will force a return to the dangerous and un\u00ad stable years in which we were troubled by the \"consequences of expecting surprise attack.\" The way in which each side deploys its ABM system is thus of great significance. But as long as the Soviets remain the weaker side, their decisions are somewhat less im\u00ad portant than ours. That is, we possess a larger margin of error and therefore can be more flexible. If our system ls designed only or primarily to protect our retaliatory mis\u00ad siles, the decision may not be too destabilz-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ing; the Soviets will still retain the capabil\u00ad ity to destroy our cities in retaliation, just as we would theirs. However, the area system we are on the point of installing is, for the moment anyway, designed to protect cities from weak missile attacks. It is not intended to protect our Minutemen. It looks as if it is designed to handle a Chinese attack or some sort of accidental firing by virtually anyone. But it may not be read that way by Soviet leaders. Unfortunately, many hints and sugges\u00ad tions are already appearing that the system ought to be expanded. We cannot have it both ways: if it is to deter the Chinese, ex\u00ad tension of the system is unnecessary, for they do not have a technological capabilty to endanger our missile sites. If it is against the Soviet Union, official spokesmen are not only lying about our true intentions but also have begun installation from the wrong di\u00ad rection: obviously protection of missile sites is the first task. These circumstances suggest that it is a fair presumption that our \"thin\" system will shortly begin to put on weight. Whether it is in reaction to Soviet offensive or defensive moves, or whether it is done in response to other considerations (e.g., domestic political pressures), is not especially important. In either case we will have begun a major new phase of arms competition with the Soviet Union. Whatever else one can say about the resulting situation, it is unlikely that it will be very stable or that it will actually reduce damages in a war. In effect, an ABM system guarantees decreased casualties only if both sides refrain from simultaneously increasing their offensive capabilities, or if the system achieves virtual perfection. Both are un\u00ad likely. Moreover, by another familiar dy\u00ad namic-the \"self-fulfilling prophecy\"-we may actually increase the likelihood of war by acting as if it is more and more possible. Our ability to deter the Soviets may decline as we begin to threaten them in a more dangerous fashion, and our ability to defend more successfully (to lower casualties) may also decline as offensive force levels increase. The decision to expand the \"thin\" ABM system may not be inevitable. The burden of the foregoing argument is that it ought to be resisted as long as this remains feasible. The point is not that installation of a larger ABM system is wrong in all circumstances; rather, that, on balance, it seems wrong in the set of circumstances determining strate\u00ad gic calculations at the moment and for the next few years. Compared to us, the Soviet Union is clearly the weaker power. The choices before it on the ABM issue are not only fewer but also starker. They have to respond to our actions, whatever the cost, unless they willingly accept an acknowledged state of conspicuous inferiority. We are not so narrowly constrained (except domesti\u00ad cally); as the stronger power we need not meet every Soviet increase in S'trength with a symmetrical increase in our own force structure. The underlying rationale for restraint on our part is twofold. On the one hand, given our current superiority and given our lead\u00ad time advantages, we do have some time in which we can safely delay expansion of the ABM sytsem-at least until we believe that the Soviet ABM system represents a signif\u00ad icant threat to our retaliatory force. On the other hand, restraint now represents what may be our last significant opportunity to delay the emergence of an environment in which stab111ty is increasingly tenuous. In\u00ad sofar as possible, we should not only refrain from expanding our ABM system but should also limit the expansion of our offensive forces to whatever minimum seems safe. A too extensive expansion of our offensive force, so that it appeared capable of a credible first\u00b7 strike attack, could be as destabilizing as the February 24, 1969 installation of the wrong kind of defensive system.3 It is still much easier to increase the strik\u00ad ing power of offensive forces than the dam\u00b7 age-limiting capabilities of defensive forces. It is possible, therefore, to limit our response to increasing our offensive capability to penetrate the Soviet ABM system; our cities would still be hostage to a Soviet strike and the Russians would not necessarily have to increase their own retaliatory force sub\u00b7 stantially. We could still penetrate their de\u00ad fenses and they could still penetrate ours, defense expenditures would not be extrava\u00b7 gant, and some element of stability-albeit the uncertain stability of a nuclear balance\u00ad might still persist. v Something ought to be said about the presumed impact of our ABM system on our European allies. Official spokesmen have been very quiet in this aspect of the decision. When pressed, they have contented them\u00ad selves with platitudes about common inter\u00ad ests and the like: anything we do to improve our defenses must, by definition, improve Europe's defensive situation also. The Europeans do not see it this way. Many of them, and not only Gaull1sts, see the ABM as increasing their vulnerability. They stand wholly exposed between our missiles and Soviet missiles. Moreover, the British and French nuclear forces are inevitably down\u00ad graded as deterrents, for the ABM systems have a much higher probab111ty of success against small strikes. Some of our commenta\u00ad tors have seen this as a virtue, since it presumably would inhibit potential nuclear powers from joining the club and perhaps even induce the French to bring their force under our umbrella.' Unfortunately, this is likely to be true only if the French and other potential nuclear states have developed or will develop their nuclear forces to garner military advantages vis-a-vis the super\u00ad powers. That is not the case: their nuclear forces have been, and will be, designed to ex\u00ad tract political and psychological advantages from the superpowers and to serve a military purpose only on the local level. Great Britain and France are not going to dispense with their nuclear forces, or turn 3 After this article was written, Secretary McNamara, in his farewell report, announced that the Soviets are apparently not install\u00ad ing a full-scale ABM system (though they have substantially increased the size of their ICBM force). He said that the Galosh system around Moscow had not been expanded or extended to other cities and that the Tallinn system across the Soviets' northwestern ap\u00ad proaches is no longer believed to have \"any significant ABM capability.\" It is difficult to take a charitable view of why a different im\u00ad pression had been given earlier, for serious doubts about the reliability of the evidence concerning Soviet ABM installations have been justified from the beginning. At any rate the arguments in this article are rein\u00ad forced -by the Secretary's admission; there is even stronger reason to slow down (if not halt) our own installation of an ABM sys\u00ad tem; thus far no move has been made to do so. 'Thus one writer argues that \"possession of ABM systems by the great powers could deter non-nuclear countries from obtaining nuclear weapons while at the same time in\u00ad creasing the deterrent value of the great powers' nuclear forces.\" (Lewis A. Frank, \"ABM and Nonproliferation: Related Issues,'' Orbis, Spring 1967.) This piece seems to me a classic example of the tendency to over\u00ad emphasize the degree to which decisions by the United States and the Soviet Union about their forces will affect the decisions of non\u00ad nuclear states. February 24, 1969 them over to our control, solely because of developments in ABM technology. On the contrary, our defensive efforts will probably succeed only in exacerbating present dis\u00ad agreements. Our minimal effort to consult our allies before making decisions is not con\u00ad ducive to good relations. Worse yet, they may respond by seeking their own ABM systems. This would probably signal the end of the nonproliferation treaty, for signing it would preclude independent development of the necessary technology. While the Europeans may not rate the probability of Soviet mili\u00ad tary action very high, they will not be able wholly to ignore the military significance of a new arms race between Washington and Moscow. Moreover, the task may be so diffi\u00ad cult (since the direct threat against Europe consists of a large number of medium and short-range missiles against which the de\u00ad fensive problem is fantastically difficult and expensive) that they will prefer to decrease their ties with the United States. It may appear that this is the only way in which they can reduce their chances of being an exposed pawn in a resurgent cold war. This article has suggested that the deploy\u00ad ment of ABM systems may have a number of unfortunate consequences, none of which have been sufficiently stressed-and, perhaps, understood-by official spokesmen. There are undoubtedly ways in which these develop\u00ad ments can be avoided or at least mitigated. If they do come about, it will not be because we are prisoners of some inexorable techno\u00ad logical process or because the demands of security can be met only by policies which are ultimately self-defeating, but because of very human errors of will and foresight. Finally, if this writer has not been mis\u00ad guided, two propositions must be empha\u00ad sized: first, in our own security interests we should under-respond to Soviet ABM deploy\u00ad ments, at least in the immediate future; and second, our friends and allies have every right, not to say obligation, to place what we (and they) can do for their security-not what we can do to limit damage to our\u00ad selve&--in the center of their calculations. ESCALATING RENTS IN THE CITIES HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I have often spoken on the floor of the House on the need to provide more and improved hous\u00ad ing in our cities. These problems were discussed in an article by David K. Ship\u00ad ler, which appeared in the New York Times on February 23. The exodus of middle-class families from the cities that characterizes pres\u00ad ent \"solutions\" to the housing shortage is resulting in further strains on city revenue bases which are already badly depleted. The situation for the poor is even more critical. Rental expenses now account for an average 35 percent of the income of those earning between $2,000 and $3,000 per year. This has prevented many low-income families from provid\u00ad ing many of the other needs which their families require and deserve. Until we reexamine our current budg\u00ad etary priorities--which allot billions to arms and whatever remains for domestic needs--the shortage in housing will con\u00ad tinue to grow. I urge my colleagues to keep these needs in mind as we estab-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS liSh ithe priorities of the fiscal year 19'70 budget over the next few months. The above-mentioned article follows: FOR MIDDLE CLASS: No VACANCY-MANY FAM\u00ad ll.IES FIND THEY MUST LEAVE CITY FOR HOUSING (By David K. Shipler) A young man sits comfortably in his living room in New Jersey and looks through his picture window at one of the most spectacu\u00ad lar views in the world: the skyline of Man\u00ad hattan, across the Hudson River. But he would rather forgo the view and live in Manhattan, because \"that's where it's happening.\" The young man, his wife and their new baby are a family that is typical of many that have been driven out of New York City by the shortage of housing. Six months ago the couple lived in a $135- a-month studio apartment at 85th Street and Lexington Avenue, on Manhattan's fash\u00ad ionable East Side. With a baby on the way, they began look\u00ad ing for a larger place ln the city, renting up to $230. ROOMS WEST OF THE HUDSON \"We looked for about two months,\" the young man said, \"in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Yonkers and Manhattan. We couldn't find anything.\" Now they pay $268 for a spacious, one-bed\u00ad room apartment in one of the modern towers on the west bank of the Hudson. They have a terrace, wall-to-wall carpeting in the halls, a doorman, central air-conditioning and a swimming pool. And with quick bus service through the Lincoln Tunnel it takes them five minutes less to get to Times Square than it did when they lived on the East Side. The apartment squeeze produces much cocktail-party conversation among New Yorkers these days. It causes long lines of people to wait by newsstands throughout the city for newspapers with classified listings of precious apartments. And it has permitted landlords to raise rents in uncontrolled apartments, producing one of the major political issues in this mayoral election year. ONLY 1.23 PERCENT RENTAL VACANCIES The Census Bureau expressed the problem statistically when it found, as of last spring, that only 1.23 per cent of rental apartments were vacant, the lowest figure since the years following World War II. The vacancy rate of new apartments never under rent control had dropped from 4.37 per cent in 1965 to 0.73 per cent in 1968. In the face of rising demand, rents have risen sharply in many of the 600,000 apart\u00ad ments not under rent control. A study or\u00ad dered by Mayor Lindsay in response to tenant complaints showed the median increase to be 26.5 per cent with each l;lew lease. The Mayor then ordered the real-estate industry to regu\u00ad late itself or face regulation by law. Rising rents, however, do not appear to be the only force that is driving the middle class from the city. The question of value received also plays a part. Many families refusing to pay city rent increases in the city are willing to pay them in the suburbs, because there they get larger apartments, lawns, trees and good schools and they are less fearful of crime. One man, for example, paid the same rent in Yonkers that he had refused to pay in the Bronx. When his $211 apartment over\u00ad looking the Hudson in Riverdale was raised to $240 a month, he searched the city for something less expensive. He ended up two months ago in a $240 apartment in Yonkers, with no view of the river. There is no statistical evidence that the city, on balance, is losing more of the mid\u00ad dle class than it ls gaining. The city's Eco\u00ad nomic Development Administration, which 4261 keeps track of such things, says it just does not know. Realty men report that middle-income families are buying brownstones in some city neighborhoods, renovating them and moving in. Some agents who rent to middle-class people estimate that 15 to 20 percent of their leases are signed by those who once lived in the city and are coming back. One theory about this return ls that ex\u00ad penses in the suburbs are rising so quickly that the exodus is tapering off, and perhaps even being reversed. Another is that many of those returning are couples whose children have grown up and moved away, making the suburban house feel empty, and enhancing the attraction of a city apartment. In any event, for the sizable middle class in New York, rents are rising faster than wages, but most families earning $10,000 to $15,000 a year still pay less than 15 per cent of their income for rent, and 93.8 per cent pay less than one-fourth their income, cus\u00ad tomarily regarded as a reasonable level. These are figures from studies by the Census Bureau, based on a sample of 36,000 families (one-third of whom refused to re\u00ad port income). They indicate that, because of rent control, middle-income families can afford the rents almost anywhere in the city, except in some parts of Manhattan-but very few apartments are vacant. Consequently, the strongholds of the city's middle-income families are not in Manhat\u00ad tan, but in the outlying semisuburbs of Queens and Brooklyn. The number of families earning $10,000 to $15,000 a year, according to census figures, has shrunk slightly in Manhattan-from 41,000 in 1965 to 39,500 in 1968-while it has risen substantially in Brooklyn and Queens. The number grew from 39,000 to 49,000 in Brooklyn and from 41,000 to 47,000 in Queens between 1965 and 1968. It also rose slightly in the Bronx. Some New Yorkers feel that Manhattan ls just a place to work-that Brooklyn or Queens or the Bronx ls the place to live. Others try to get as close to the heart of things as they can, and that, they feel, ls Manhattan. \"If I'm going to move to Queens, I might as well move to Westchester,\" one young husband said. \"Outer Brooklyn has the disadvantages of both the suburbs and the city,\" said a man who prefers the city. He has bought a brown\u00ad stone in downtown Brooklyn and has moved his family in. \"Living in Scarsdale does not attract me,\" he said. Manhattan ls an expensive place for peo\u00ad ple with children. Rents have been rising more quickly in Manhattan and the Bronx than in the other boroughs and it ls prob\u00ad ably as a result of this that three-fourths of the households in Manhattan consist of only one or two people. In Staten Island, by contrast, just under half of the families are that small, census figures show. PRESSURE ON THE POOR Those who are gouged by rents, according to the census statistics, are the poor. Two\u00ad thlrds of the families earning $2,000 to $3,000 a year pay more than 35 per cent of their incomes for rent. The term \"middle class\" ls difficult to define by income, because it connotes not just earning power, but also a style of life, a set by values and tastes, a level of education and a class of occupation. For the purposes of elig1b11ity in publicly assisted housing, middle income ls usually considered to be between $5,000 and $10,000. But the city's housing administration broad\u00ad ened its definition for a study last summer, and called families earning between $6,000 and $25,000 \"middle income.\" The key bracket seems to be the $10,000-to\u00ad $15,000 range, since fam111es at that level are usually not able to afford luxury apartments 42.62 in the city, but can afford a move to the suburbs. Many in that bracket are going into coop\u00ad eratives here, and a large number of rental buildings in Manhattan have been converted recently to cooperatives. Unfortunately for the middle class, almost all new construction, especially in Manhat\u00ad tan, costs so much that it rents for about $100 or more a room a month, and is classi\u00ad fied as \"luxury.\" This means that new middle-<ilass housing must have public assistance-usually low\u00ad intereat, long-term mortgage loans, tax abatement--a.s provided, for example, by the Mitchell-Lama state law-and some discount on the cost of land. Even with such support, the housing now being planned will rent for about $50 a room a month, beyond the reach of some middle-income fam111es with several children. Despite what Mayor Lindsay has called a \"record-breaking year\" in starting construc\u00ad tion of Mitchell-Lama 1968, the number of new apartments- 6,206--seems small to critics of the Lindsay administration when they compare it with the total of 2,096,058 rented apartments in the city. About one-fifth of the 6,206 will be set aside for low-income families, leaving 4,966 middle-income units. Other programs began construction of 2,346 middle-income apart\u00ad ments, making a total of 7,312. The Mayor, confronted with disgruntled and sometimes hostile middle-class voters this election year, has interpreted the num\u00ad bers as signifying a major breakthrough. But more than half the Mitchell-Lama units were planned during the administration of his predecessor, Mayor Robert F. Wagner, and have taken more than four years to build. Many of them are going up in urban re\u00ad newal areas next to low-income housing in a move to integrate and stabilize neighbor\u00ad hoods that the middle class is now fieeing. Housing officials do not believe that housing alone can keep the middle class here, but they feel it 1s a necessary start. What will really keep the middle class in the city, they believe, ls the kind of thing that influenced the young man who bought the brownstone in Brooklyn. \"I'm much more alive as a human being here,\" he said. SUPERINTENDENT FOLEY RETIRES HON. JOHN S. MONAGAN OF CONNECTICUT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MONAGAN. Mr. Speaker, all who know the school su'perintendent of Naugatuck, Conn., realize how much the proper functioning of the schools there has owed to the determination and lead\u00ad ership of Superintendent Raymond K. Foley. It is, therefore, with the deepest regret that friends of this system have learned of Mr. Foley's plans to retire in June. Through the years Ray Foley has con\u00ad tributed lavishly of his abilities and tal\u00ad ents not only to the Naugatuck school system, but to the community in general. In so doing he has carried on in the tra\u00ad dition of his noted father, the famous Pete Foley. In these times when the de\u00ad mands upon our public administrators are so great and the threat to the con\u00ad tinuation of our system is so serious, the departure of Superintendent Foley from active administration is a substantial EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS loss. However, it cannot be denied that he is entitled to rest and repose and al\u00ad though we see him leave with regret, we must wish him well and hope that he will have satisfaction and peace of mind in the years which lie ahead. CARNAGE AT THE WORKPLACE HON. JAMES G. O'HARA OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. O'HARA. Mr. Speaker, in a recent edition of the United Steelworkers of America publication, Steel Labor, there appeared an excellent article on the problem of occupational safety and health. Emphasizing the continuing \"Carnage at the Workplace,\" as the article was entitled. I insert this hard-hitting article at this point in the RECORD: CARNAGE AT THE WORKPLACE \"While we sit here talking this morning, from now until noon, 17 people in this coun\u00ad try are going to be killed whlle they are working on their jobs.\" The words were those of Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz; the time, shortly after 9 :30 a..m. on Thursday, Feb. 15, 1968. In room 4232 of the Senate Office Building in Washington, the Senate's Subcommittee on Labor was holding hearings on the proposed Occupa\u00ad tional Safety and Health Act of 1968. The on-the-job carnage in the United Sta.tes-55 workers k1lled every working day, 8,500 others permanently disabled, 27,200 more being less seriously injured~ontlnues for only one reason, according to the Secre\u00ad tary of Labor. \"That is,\" said Wirtz, \"because the people in this country don't realize what ls involved. They can't see the blood on the food that they eat, on the things that they buy, and on the services they get.\" In reporting the grim statistics prepared by the Labor Department and quoting from sample letters referred to his office from accident victims, Sec. Wirtz noted with re\u00ad gret that he found himself testifying before only two members of a subcommittee that presumably included those Senators with the strongest beliefs on the subject at hand. The apprehension then expressed by the Labor Secretary was well founded. In the year that has passed since his testimony, Congress has failed to act. During that time, calculated from the average daily on-the-job fatallties and injuries cited in Wirtz' testimony, 14,000 to 15,000 American workers well may have died from occupational injury a.lone. In that year's time, over two million probably have been disabled and another seven million hurt--a great many needlessly. The Occupational Safety and Health Act died last year in the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. While a watered down version of the bill was reported out by the House Committee, it was never acted upon on the House floor. Sen. Ralph Yarborough (D-Texas), one of the Sena.tors in attendance during last year's hearings on the measure, has vowed, as the new chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, to give the bill top pri\u00ad ority on the committee's agenda for 1968. Yet, the proposal's chances in the 91st Con\u00ad gress are highly uncertain. Originated by the Johnson Administration, the bill, even if adopted, also requires the approval of Presi\u00ad dent Nixon. A Presidential veto would cer\u00ad tainly kill the measure. The prospects for success, nevertheless, as February 24, 1969 several witnesses noted in the 1968 hearings, can be materially improved if the real facts of today's on-the-job slaughter can be im\u00ad pressed upon the American people. Special interest opponents of the measure, at the same time, can again be expected to mount a concerted propaganda. campaign designed to confuse the true picture of on-the-job injury and death. While cold statistics cannot convey the depth of the persona.I suffering stemming from inadequate safety on the job, they can point up the vast and not generally realized magnitude of the problem. Consider the following figures and facts: Accidents in 1966 cost 255 million man\u00ad days of productivity, more than 10 times the 25.4 milllon days off the job becaus~ of strikes that year. More persons are injured each year in the workplace than on the nation's highways. During the past decade, the injury fre\u00ad quency rate for manUfa.cturing in the U.S. (number of disabling work injuries per Inil\u00ad Uon employe-hours of exposure) has been increasing rather than showing improve\u00ad ment. Safety breakdowns on the job cost Ameri\u00ad can workers some $1.5 bUlion in lost wages each year and cost the national economy $6.8 billion a year in lost production. In addi.tion to the annual accident toll, more than half a million workers a.re dis\u00ad abled yearly by occupational diseases from the effects of asbestos, beryllium, carbon monoxide, coal dust, cotton dust, cancer\u00ad producing chemicals, dyes, pesticides, radia\u00ad tion, and other occupational hazards such as heat, noise, and. vibration. The rate of death and injuries among workers on the job is 50 per cent higher than the rate away from work-and \"a.way from work\" includes the hazards of com\u00ad muting to and from the place of employ\u00ad ment. Almost 85 per cent of the total labor force is currently exposed to the risks of incur\u00ad ring one or more disabling injuries during a working lifetime; three to five per cent will actually experience some form of seri\u00ad ously disabling work injury, including the loss of limb or life. Over the years, Congress has enacted leg\u00ad islation, often inadequate, designed to meet specific hazards in certain industries, such as those encountered in coal and nonferrous metals mining and in longshoring. Not until last year, however, has any President asked the Congress to consider legislation to pro\u00ad vide a comprehensive nationwide system of occupational safety and health standards covering all industries. Because of the typical objections to safety measures-the alleged inconveniences to em\u00ad ployers, the alleged costs involved--such pro\u00ad posals are never easily enacted. A public clamor for federal action and broad national publicity has generally been required to get Congress to move. Such publicity attended the Nov. 20 Farm\u00ad ington, W. Va., coal mine disaster that en\u00ad tombed 78 men, giving much-needed impetus to proposals for strengthening the mine safety law that Interior Secretary Stewart L. Udall had submitted to Congress early in September. Despite Udall's contention then that the U.S. Bureau of Mines had abun\u00ad dant evidence that many of the nation's coal mines were unsafe, Congress adjourned with\u00ad out acting on his suggestions. Said one de\u00ad partment source, \"It takes a major mine dis\u00ad aster to get things moving on coal safety.\" While airplane crashes and spectacular auto accidents, too, make the headlines in newspapers across the country, occupational accidents and diseases all too often are buried in the company files. Only because the magnitude of on-the-job death and dis\u00ad ab111ty is so little realized did Congressmen last year escape massive public pressure for action on the broad safety standards bill. February 24, 1969 Heavy special interest pressure, on the other hand, was mounted in 1968 against passage of the Administration's Occupational Safety and Health Act. \"The spokesmen for American business, the U.S. Chamber of Com\u00ad merce and the National Association of Manu\u00ad facturers,\" declared Esther Peterson, then Assistant Secretary of Labor, In a hard-hit\u00ad ting address before the Labor Section of the National Safety Council, \"marshaled their forces for one of the biggest battles against legislation in behalf of the people since Medi\u00ad care was proposed.\" Moreover, she charged that big business \"dominates the National Safety Council,\" which failed to appear to testify on the bill, as scheduled, during hearings before the House Education and Labor Select Subcom\u00ad mittee last year. Calling upon the labor representatives in attendance to \"speak out loud and clear on your own,\" Mrs. Peterson said that the NSC Executive Committee overruled the conclu\u00ad sions of a special labor-management com\u00ad mittee which were highly favorable to the Administration's safety proposals and adopted instead \"a compendium of weak and qualified phrases,\" skirting the issue of the need for immediate federal action in the establishment of standards. The original Administration safety bill, in addition to establishing government pro\u00ad grams for safety research, training, and edu\u00ad cation, would have allowed the Secretary of Labor to promulgate safety standards, en\u00ad forceable through federal inspection and penalties, to cover businesses involved in interstate commerce, which employ about two-thirds of America's 75 million workers. The proposal also called for federal grants to the states for research and development in the field of safety and health hazards. Much of the debate during the Congressional hear\u00ad ings on the measure centered on the standard-setting procedure and the issue of federal-vs.-state jurisdiction in the safety field. The bill that emerged from the House Committee was a greatly rewritten version that would establish safety standards \"under a consensus method by a nationally recog\u00ad nized standards producing organization\" or through advisory bodies composed of repre\u00ad sentatives from business, labor, state health and safety agencies, professional organiza\u00ad tions of technicians, and standards produc\u00ad ing organizations. Additionally, states would have the opportunity to retain occupational safety responsibility by developing plans of their own with standards \"relating to one or more safety or health issues\" that \"are or will be substantially as effective in providing safe and healthful employment\" as the federal standards. Ralph Nader, who blew the whistle on the auto industry's disregard for safety and has represented the interest of the American con\u00ad sumer on a variety of other matters, com\u00ad mented on the weakening of the original safety bill when he testified before the Senate Subcommittee on June 28 and July 2. \"I am quite aware,\" he said, \"of the misuse of states rights assertions to cover up special inter\u00ad ests, to cover up neglect and to cover up cal\u00ad lousness.\" Pointing out that an average of only 40 cents per worker per year is spent for industrial safety and health by the states (Texas and Oklahoma spend about two cents per worker annually} , he maintained that state \"standards are most often written by the people that are supposed to observe them; namely, industry.\" \"I am concerned,\" Nader continued, \"about the prospect of legislation being enacted with the standards-setting mechanism large\u00ad ly taken over by industry groups such as the U.S. Standards Institute of America.\" Strongly backing the provision of the original bill which would give the Secretary of Labor authority to establish safety standards on his own, without first obtaining \"consensus\" EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS on those standards, he stated that such in\u00ad dependence in standard-setting was needed \"so that all viewpoints can be considered not on the degree of political power behind them, but on the degree of scientific and humane merit.\" While urging organized labor to become a stronger and more forceful sentinel for worker safety, Nader centered most of his fire on American industry, which he accused of consciously underreporting occupational accidents. Noting the opposition to the pro\u00ad posed federal legislation from such groups as the American Iron & Steel Institute, which testified at both the House and Senate hear\u00ad ings, he declared, \"I think it would be very interesting to look into the opposition here, and see before how many state legislatures those same groups have proposed state safety laws.\" The AI&SI, the trade association of the steel industry, in fact, was one of the major opponents of the proposed blll, despite its own contention of high safety consciousness. Praising the safety record of the industry, Leo Teplow, vice president of industrial rela\u00ad tions for the institute, argued that such leg\u00ad islation was unnecessary and would be abused. \"In connection with a wide variety of grievances stemming from a change in Job, change in temperature, or change in crew size,'' he stated, \"safety or health issues are frequently alleged merely to build up a case.\" Passage of the proposed legislation, he con\u00ad tinued, \"would tempt many an employe rep\u00ad resentative to boost his stock by calling on the federal government, since the very pres\u00ad ence of a federal inspector could be used to demonstrate his importance and infiuence.\" Teplow also tried to relate the bill to strike situations in \"many industries in this country,\" noting that management person\u00ad nel after \"are called upon to continue the plant in operation, at least until materials in the pipe line have been processed .... Such emergency operations might very well be prevented,\" he went on, \"on the plea that a reduced crew makes the operation un\u00ad safe.\" Legislative Representative Clinton M. Fair, who testified before the Senate Subcommit\u00ad tee on June 28 in support of the original safety bill on behalf of the AFL-CIO, pointed to the recent death of four construction workers in an accident in Virginia, just across the Potomac from the nation's Capital. Noting that Virginia, like 39 other states, had no safety standard at all with respect to concrete construction, he declared, \"I submit the record is clear that to continue to leave to the states sole jurisdiction over the occupational health and safety of 75 million workers would perpetuate an intol\u00ad erable injustice.\" The fact that certain states show better safety records than others strengthens rather than detracts from such a statement, points up testimony presented by Sec. Wirtz. \"In those states which spend substantial amounts of money in regulatory and promo\u00ad tional programs in the field of occupational safety and health,'' he said, \"the Injury rate is about one-fifth of what it is in those other states in which there has been no substan\u00ad tial attention given to the problem.\" The comparison \"shows what can be done if we just care enough about it to live up to our own humanity,\" stressed the Labor Secretary. The Congress, in 1968, apparently did not care enough. It certainly did not live up to its responsibility to deal with this problem of vast importance to 75 million American workers. With the 91st Congress now in ses\u00ad sion, however, Sen. Yarborough and others have pledged to renew the fight. Congress\u00ad man James G. O'Hara (D-Mich.}, joined by 33 co-sponsors, already has introduced a safety bill, H.R. 3809, tougher than that which last year emerged from the House Education and Labor Committee. 4263 In 1968, the Legislative Department of the United Steelworkers sent a letter to every USWA local union in the country urging communication with its Congressman and Senators on the safety measure--one of the few Issues about which such a request was made. The department, which can be helped immeasurably by a rising tide of public pres\u00ad sure on the subject of occupational safety, again this year will put forth every effort in lobbying for the strongest possible bill. At the same time, a four-man committee, recently appointed by USWA President I. W. Abel, will soon report on a study concerning the possible revision of the union's structure in the related fields of safety and workmen's compensation. Chaired by District Director Charles Younglove and including District Directors Harry 0. Dougherty, Bertram Mc\u00ad Namara, and Lawrence F. Sefton, the group will submit to the International Executive Board its recommendations for strengthen\u00ad ing the union's capacity to meet the current challenges in these crucial areas. THE :MEDICAL DEVICE SAFETY ACT OF 1969 HON. THOMAS S. FOLEY OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, the gentle\u00ad man from Washington (Mr. ADAMS) and I last Thursday introduced legislation\u00ad H.R. 7315-entitled \"The Medical Device Safety Act of 1969,\" which would require premarketing clearance of certain medi\u00ad cal devices which are not generally rec\u00ad ognized as safe and effective by qualified experts, such as organ substitutes and certain contact lenses, and the establish\u00ad ment of standards to insure the safety and performance of certain classes of de\u00ad vices--such as bone pins, catheters, and diathermy machines. For those devices requiring premarket\u00ad ing clearance, manufacturers would be required to submit data to establish safety and reliability. This evidence would be evaluated by a team of experts within the Department of Health, Edu\u00ad cation, and Welfare, with necessary ad\u00ad vice from nongovernmental consultants. For those devices requiring conformity to standards, the standards would be adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare after consulta\u00ad tion with nongovernmental experts and existing standardmaking organizations. It is expected that such standards would be modified periodically with advances in scientific and clinical knowledge. Administrative review, including the right of a hearing, would be available to anyone adversely affected by such a ruling. The proposed premarketing clearance procedures would not generally apply to devices which are ordinary and simple patient care items; which have with\u00ad stood the test of time on the market and are generally recognized as safe and re\u00ad liable; which are made to the specifica\u00ad tions of a physician's prescription; which are custom made for use by an individual specialist, or which are in the process of scientific development. The law would be administered by the Department of Health, Education. and Welfare, with the advice and guidance of other governmental agencies and of qualified nongovernmental groups and individuals. The need for this legislation derives from the revolutionary advances in the development of medical devices, which have taken place since the original en\u00ad actment of regulatory legislation in this field over 30 years ago. These achieve\u00ad ments in medical technology have intro\u00ad duced a broad array of devices that are new, not only in purpose and usefulness, but often in the very materials used in the manufacture. Surgical implants, con\u00ad tact lenses, artificial kidneys, and syn\u00ad thetic arteries are examples of the sig\u00ad nificant advances that have been taken place in recent years. The current prog\u00ad ress in the development of artificial hearts is still another momentous for\u00ad ward step. Th.dis research and dnnovation must insU!r'e ithe further devel\u00ad opment o! livesaving devices. Art the same time, the consuming public as well as the physician is entitled to the as\u00ad surance th.alt a particu!SJr device has been adequately tested and proved safe and reliaible. In the case of devices, such as\u00ad surance cannot be given under existing law. Presently, Federal law permits the Government rto itake action only after the device has reached the market, and fre\u00ad quently only after injury has occurred. Appropriate legislation, with sufficient safeguards to protect research, innova\u00ad tion, and development, should be ap\u00ad proved now to close this gap. Mr. Speaker, I include the full text of a letter-exhibit 1-I received from the Food and Drug Administration on June 11 last year at this point in the RECORD. This letter illustrates some examples of injuries caused by improper design, mal\u00ad functions, and poor or inadequately made medical devices. Mr. Speaker, I also include articles en\u00ad titled \"Designers of Medical Instruments Face Serious Questions on Safety,\" from the February 17, 1969, issue of Electron\u00ad ics, exhibit 2; \"Accidental Electrocutions Claim 1,200 Patients a Year,\" from the January 27, 1969, issue of Electronic News, exhibit 3, and \"Electrical Risk in Hospitals Is Held Rising,\" from the Feb\u00ad ruary 17, 1969, issue of The Washington Evening Star, exhibit 4, at the conclu\u00ad sion of my remarks along with a brief section-by-section analysis of our pro\u00ad posal-exhibit 5. We are particularly concerned to add diagnostic devices to the subject matter of our proposal because a large number of hospital patients are accidentally elec\u00ad trocuted every year while receiving rou\u00ad tine diagnostic tests, a.J Mr. Ralph Nader disclosed last Wednesday before the Na\u00ad tional Commission on Product Safety. In this regard, I also include an excerpt from an article entitled \"l,200 Patients Get Electrocuted Yearly, Hearing Told,\" from the Washington Post of February 20, 1969-exhibit 6-at this point in the RECORD. Mr. Speaker, the President's consumer message of 1967 recommended legisla\u00ad tion of this general nature. I surely hope that the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce will examine this matter in public hearings at their earliest opportunity. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS EXHmIT 1 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCA\u00ad TION, AND WELFARE, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, Washington, D.C., June 11, 1968. Hon. THOMAS s. FOLEY, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. FOLEY: Both Dr. Lewis of our Bureau of Medicine and I were pleased to receive your letter of April 8, 1968. Flor a.pproxl..malt!ely two yewrs, deslgins, malfunctions, smd pOOQ.\" or inadequate tested devices. Some of the more serious occurrences are as follows: In one report from a Midwest hospital three patients died during electrocardio\u00ad graphic tracings. Afterwards, the technician, when questioned, recalled receiving a shock when plugging in the machine. Examination of the machine indicated that the wiring was faulty resulting in the direct application of the line current to the patients. This may have been responsible for electrocution. As a result, some physicians have their own electronics technicians or engineers check all wiring before these machines are used. One particular make of anesthesia ma\u00ad chine has caused deaths because of poor de\u00ad sign. This type machine utilizes a liquid anesthetic which is vaporized prior to in\u00ad halation by the patient. The model in ques\u00ad tion was so designed that it was possible for the container to be overfilled. This resulted in the patient breathing in a lethal concen\u00ad tration of the liquid anesthetic. This hap\u00ad pened several times, and the machine has since been modified. We have received reports that artificial heart valves have been manufactured with surface defects. These defects resulted in ex\u00ad cessive clot production and propagation, and in some instances the outcomes were fatal. As a result, the manufacturer improved qual\u00ad ity control, but unfortunately for some, too late. Another report involves a hemodialysis, or artificial kidney machine. If the pump on this machine did not function properly it triggered an alarm. This alarm mechanism automatically threw the particular pump out of the circuitry. However, the technician in charge pressed an override switch which he had seen demonstrated previously by the in\u00ad staller of the machine. This resulted in the pump going back into action. Three out of four patients on the machine died after re\u00ad ceiving distilled water intravenously. This could be construed as an indication of inade\u00ad quate instruction, poor labeling, or perhaps poor engineering. other examples include certain types of hip prostheses which sustained severe me\u00ad chanical disruption and caused tissue re\u00ad action. This necessitated correction by addi\u00ad tional surgery. There are also numerous in\u00ad stances of metal implants of various types which broke or became corroded. I hope that these examples are of the type in which you express interest. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Sincerely yours, MORTON M. ScHNEIDER, Office of Legislative ancl Governmental Sennces. EXHIBIT 2 [From Electronics, Feb. 17, 1969] DESIGNERS OF MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS FACE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ON SAFETY (By OWen Doyle) (NoTE.-Many engineers and physicians say hospital electrocutions are increasing; the Government may step in if action isn't taken soon to improve control of leakage cur\u00ad renJts and other sources of diange1\". February 24, 1969 Hospital electrocutions are on the rise, ac\u00ad cording to many engineers, doctors, and others. Statistics aren't available, but the safety of electronic medical instrumenta\u00ad tion is being questioned more and more. And instrument designers are getting part of the blame. The out-and-out dangerous instru\u00ad ment ls rare, though not extinct. But some devices rely too much on operator skill. Others lack fail-safe protection or aren't de\u00ad signed to work safely with other instru\u00ad ments. The problem has already reached Congress. The Medical Device Safety Act, which died in committee last session, will be introduced again this year. And if Congressmen don't see results from the efforts of instrument companies and hospitals to reduce the risks, one headline-making tragedy may be enough to get a safety act passed and bring the Food and Drug Administration into the act. Of course, the danger of electrical shock has always been present in hospitals. But the chance of electrocution has gone up ra\u00ad pidly in the past decade. Ironically, the risks have risen for the same reason that the quality of some types of medical care has im\u00ad proved: the insertion into the body of cathe\u00ad ters that transmit data on physiological parameters is becoming routine. And the heart, the organ most sensitive to small elec\u00ad trical currents, has been the organ most probed. The catheters bring vital informa\u00ad tion from the body, but they can also bring current into the body. Before the appearance of the cardiac catheter, dangerous currents were measured in milliamps. But when there's an open road to the heart, as little as 20 microamps can be lethal. The problem facing physicians and engineers is to close the road to leakage but keep it open to data. Inserting a catheter into a heart chamber is simple and painless. Usually, the physician inserts a long hollow needle into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, then feeds the catheter through the needle until the tip reaches the section of the heart where meas\u00ad urements are to be made. The most common parameter measured is total pressure of the blood at a specific heart site, but other types of catheters are becoming available for meas\u00ad urements of parameters other than pressure, such as blood pH, concentration of oxygen or carbon dioxide in the blood, and metabolic rate. After the thin plastic tube is inserted, it's filled with a saline solution and connected to the cham\u00b7ber of a pressure transducer. A strain giage lies at the bottom of the chamber, so the fluid directly transmits the body pres\u00ad sure to the strain gage. The salt, required to make the fluid compatible with blood, also makes it an excellent conductor. A few stray millivolts between the fluid and ground can send lethal currents flowing into the heart wall. The lack of statistics can be attributed mainly to two factors: hospitals, naturally enough, are reluctant to talk about the sub\u00ad ject, and in many cases the evidence that death is due to shock from leakage currents is circumstantial. Patients with catheters in or probes on their bodies are often very ill. Unless the current is high enough to burn or produce sudden rigidity there is no way to prove electrocution. A small current flow\u00ad ing in the body does nothing that shows up in an autopsy. Dr. John Bruner, a Massachu\u00ad setts General Hospital anesthesiologist, points out that death from fibrillation in\u00ad duced by current from a catheter is indis\u00ad tinguisblable from death by \"natural causes.\" Based on how currents get into the body, electrical shock can be broken down into gross and microamp types. Gross shock occurs when the current passes through the skin. Skin resistance can run as high as 1 megohm, depending on the amount of dirt, sweat, body oil, and other substances. A patient's body is clean, however, and when elect4\"odes are rto be ait.taohed ;t.o a paitdent the February 24, 1969 physician usually scrapes away the layer of dead cells on the skin's surface. As a result, skin resistance under an electrode, such as the type used with electrocardiographs, is typically less than 1,000 ohms. A current of around 20 milliamps flowing through this resistance can cause fibrillation. In a common type of ECG setup, two elec\u00ad trodes are placed on the patient's chest and a third, attached to the ECG's ground termi\u00ad nal, is placed on his leg. If a patient with electrodes attached were to touch something above ground potential, a dangerous level of current could fl.ow through him. Although it usually causes fibrillation, gross shock can be lethal in two other ways. If the current comes in through the skUll, it may attack the brain's respiratory control center. Elsewhere, it can paralyze the muscles used in breathing. The lethal current that gets into a catheter is usually leakage, generated because of poor grounding. But currents can also be pro\u00ad duced if electronic instruments are poorly designed or wrongly used, or if a component in an instrument fails. Also, some instru\u00ad ments, perfectly safe when operated by them\u00ad selves, generate dangerous currents when used with other equipment. In some hospitals the power ground is used as the instrument ground, says Paul Stanley, a physicist at Purdue University and an in\u00ad strumentation-safety activist. Stanley points out that a power ground is often just a thin\u00ad walled conduit whose resistance may be as high as 0.006 ohm per foot. If, for example, 100 milliamps were to flow through this ground, the instrument end of the ground could easily be 100 millivolts above the other end. Another reason it's dangerous to use a power ground as an instrument ground is that when there's a break in the cable's ground lead or when the ground pin snaps off the plug, the instrument continues to work, even though it can now be a source of leakage. And says Dr. Bruner: \"The plugs and cords we get on instruments now are totally inadequate.\" J. A. Hopps, a senior research officer in Canada's National Research Council, explains the problem this way: \"Accidental current is normally controlled by grounding the equipment chassis .... In many hospitals the existence of any sort of ground system is suspect. Older hospitals may have no ground wires at all.\" The voltage that drives the leakage current can come from various sources. The electrical appliances found in hospital rooms-televi\u00ad sion sets, radios, lights, motorized beds\u00ad could be faulty. The beds seems to be the worst offenders. Many investigators have spot-checked beds in their hospitals and re\u00ad ported that 70 % to 90 % of them were poorly grounded. Says Dr. Harold Laufman, director of ithe make th.em tin make them in ool.onml, \u00b7burt; tihey don'.t seem to be able to make them safe.\" TRANSIENT TROUBLE Joseph Neuland, poil.nt.s two other siJtua.td.ons that could be hazardous. There 1.s too much EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS 60-hertz J.eak!a\u00aee fl\"om the power lines rto some instruments in their normal operating state. This, he says, could be solved by prop\u00ad erly shielding transformers. And, according to Neuland, many of the amplifiers connected between a probe and an instrument have capacitors to cancel out the effect of large electrode-offset potentials. These potentials can go as high as 500 milli\u00ad volts, says NeUland, so there's often a lot of energy stored by the capacitors. Under cer\u00ad tain conditions, he says, this energy can be discharged through the patient to ground. So anyone designing blocking capacitors into an instrument, says Neuland, must make sure that the discharge current is carefully con\u00ad trolled. The blame for these hazardous conditions, however, can't be placed entirely on one group. Says Hopps: \"The responsibility must be shared by the equipment manufacturer, the hospital designer, and the medical user. The manufacturer's culpab111ty generally derives from an inadequate comprehension of medical procedures and physiological fac\u00ad tors .... In his desire to achieve versat111ty, he may unwittingly sacrifice protective fea\u00ad tures. He may assume that the user ha.s tech\u00ad nical competence to operate the instrument safely, and this is the most erroneous as\u00ad sumption . . . and a manufacturer usually considers his product a discrete unit rather than part of a patient treatment system.\" Others are not so understanding about the manufacturers' efforts. Says Dr. La.ufman: \"There's been a lot of gimmickry and mis\u00ad representation in this instrumentation busi\u00ad ness.\" Harve Hanish, president of Biocom Inc., a medical instrumentation house, is no more sympathetic. He feels that there hasn't been nearly enough improvement in medical instrumentation, and not just in the safety area, over the past few years. He charges that the instrument industry is suffering from the \"Detroit syndrome.\" Manufacturers appear compelled to bring out new models every year, not changing the electronics, just mak\u00ad ing the cases fancier,\" he says. David Lubin, administrative engineer at Baltimore's Sinai hospital, also finds fault with the instrument makers: \"Most electrical equipment purchased today is factory\u00ad equipped with grounding facilities in the power cord and attachment plug. The catch lies in the fact that too often the devices furnished with electrical equipment to pro\u00ad vide grounding for safety are weak, easily broken, and poorly designed for rough handling. They aren't proper because they're not foolproof, not fail-safe, not reliable.\" But others also come in for criticism from Lubin: \"The blame cannot be placed entirely on the manufacturer or entirely on any one condition. The situation as it exists today is the resUlt of a combination of factors that involve the newness and subtlety of the hazard, the complacency and apathy of hos\u00ad pitals, an almost total lack of standards relat\u00ad ing to specific devices for specific hospital ap\u00ad plications, confusion in some codes, and the unfortunate fact that connection devices that will work on light-duty, generally non\u00ad hazardous items such as electric clocks will also work on critical medical instrumenta\u00ad tion.\" Richard Lloyd, assistant to the president of Underwriters Laboratories Inc., proposes some immediate changes in the design of in\u00ad strumentation systems. Lloyd would: Require a ground-fault detector. Require that isolating transformers serve one patient area only and be provided with a grounding shield between primary and secondary windings. Restrict the size of the isolating trans\u00ad former, the length of the circuit, and the type of insulation used on the conductor to keep leaking down. Require surge or overvoltage protection on all circuits entering or leaving the patient area. 4265 Require the use of double-insulated equip\u00ad ment where grounding doesn't provide the necessary protection. Consider the use of ground-fault circuit in\u00ad terrupters on medically nonessential cir\u00ad cuits. A LONG LOOK Stanley, while naturally urging immediate changes where they can be made, feels that now is the time for a sweeping attack on the problem of shock in hospitals. Says Stanley: \"Committees formed by Federal agencies, professional societies, safety organizations, and industry are scrambling to establish standards aimed at making cardiac monitors, pacemakers, defibrillators, and all kinds of still-uninvented devices safe for use in the hospital and clinic. The effort is commend\u00ad able, but the word scrambling is used ad\u00ad visedly. Decisions reached and rules codified without careful analysis could stifle the de\u00ad velopment of new concepts if the decisions and the rules are too strict; if standards are too liberal, they provide little of the safety they are intended to ensure. And whether too strict or too lenient, codes once printed are difficult to change.\" The program Stanley proposes would first involve defining the problem. \"There should,\" he says, \"be careful study to deter\u00ad mine how real the dangers are. Are electrical fatalities caused by medical instrumenta\u00ad tion on the increase? Is the rate of increase as large as some fear?\" Once these questions are answered, says Stanley, it would be pos\u00ad sible to make sure that safety is designed into systems, to establish adequate controls over existing problems, and to begin review pro\u00ad grams so equipment design could be con\u00ad tinuously brought up to date. He also suggests re-evaluation of the body's sensitivity to electric shock, particularly in regard to maximum safe currents, and studies to determine whether the pathological heart is more susceptible to electric shock than the healthy heart and how various medications affect fibrillation thresholds. A CONGRESSMAN'S WIFE Stanley isn't specific about who should un\u00ad dertake or pay for such a program, but there's a good chance the Government will enter the area of medical-instrumentation safety. The Medical Device Safety Act would au\u00ad thorize the FDA to pass on the safety and efficacy of medical instrumentation and to set standards for devices that are implanted in body cavities, placed in contact with mu\u00ad cous membranes, or delivering energy to the body. Exempted would be devices that have been around long enough to have proved themselves, such as fluoroscopes; instruments under clinical investigation, and those cus\u00ad tom-made for a licensed practitioner. Whatever the chances of the bill this year, it seems likely that some kind of legislation will be adopted in the next few years. \"I don't like to see the Government get involved in this,\" says one physician, \"but I'm afraid it's going to have to happen. Hospitals and manufacturers have had their chance and just don't seem to be able or willing to do anything about the safety problem. Congress isn't under that much pressure now to pass any kind of bill. But let one congressman's wife get burnt while she's in the hospital, and we'll have our standards the next day.'' EXHIBIT 3 [From Electronic News, Jan. 27, 1969) ACCIDENTAL ELECTROCUTIONS CLAIM 1,200 PATIENTS A YEAR At least three patients in United States hospitals are accidentally electrocuted each day. The total number of electrocutions an\u00ad nually is about 1200. According to Dr. Carl W. Walter, a surgeon at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston, who 4266 supplied the figures, most of the patients killed were not in terminal condition but were undergoing \"routine diagnostic tests,\" or \"routine treatment.\" Dr. Walter's figure of 1200 accidental elec\u00ad trocutions annually was quoted last week at the Reliability Symposium held in Chicago. Speaking at a session on \"Reliability of Med\u00ad ical Instrumentation,\" John A. Hopps, Radio & Electrical Engineering Division, National Research council, Canada, said: \"Internal electric shock is a subtle hazard that has often escaped recognition. As a re\u00ad sult, many patient deaths were \u00b7attributed to other causes. Even with an increasing aware\u00ad ness of the problem, it ts not surprising that many of the accidents which lead to fatalities are not reported. It has been estimated that about 1200 patients a year are electrocuted during hospital treatment in the U.S.A.\" In a telephone interview last week, Dr. Walter said he received the figures from an actuary for a national United States insur\u00ad ance company which made a computer study of the st tua tion. ''It raised quite a stink when the firm realized I had the figures,\" Dr. Walter said. Dr. Walter said many hospitals are un\u00ad aware of the cause of death in the electrocu\u00ad tion cases. He said it was this fact that prompted the insurance company to do the study. There are a variety of reasons for the deaths, according to Dr. Walter and Harold Greenberg, operating manager, Orlon Re\u00ad search, Inc., Cambridge, Mass., who chaired the session at the Chicago symposium. Mr. Greenberg said most of the deaths can be attributed to hospitals linking incom\u00ad patible types of equipment together. Dr. Walter added that was only one of the causes. He said another cause was the high leakage current from equipment and poor circuit design. \"There are two prominent United States manufacturing firms that are presently sell\u00ad ing machines that are highly dangerous,\" Dr. Walter said. Another cause of accidental electrocution, according to Dr. Walker, is hooking the pa\u00ad tient to medical instrumentation for long pe\u00ad riods of time, such as in an intensive care unit. \"The patient frequently ts in the ground loop,\" Dr. Walter said. \"All he has to do ts touch a metal faucet or another piece of equipment and that's it,\" he added. Dr. Walter said another cause of electro\u00ad cution is errors by hospital personnel who, as a rule, have no training in electronics. Dr. Walter added the average hospital has absolutely nobody qualified to operate elec\u00ad tronic equipment. \"Sometimes the firms who supply the equipment are careful about training person\u00ad nel to operate the gear and follow the main\u00ad tenance of the equipment very closely. How\u00ad ever, most firms are not that careful,\" he added. There are very few hospitals throughout the United States that maintain experts in electronics to operate complicated instru\u00ad mentation, Dr. Walter said. Mr. Greenberg said there might be three or four who maintain experts but as a whole hospitals don't hire experts. He said most hospitals will look for a doctor with some experience in electronics and assign him the task of looking after electronic equipment. INCREASING PROBLEM Leon Pordy, M.D., assistant cllnical pro\u00ad fessor of medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said the problem of accidents oc\u00ad curring through the use of electronic equip\u00ad ment ts \"an increasing one.\" Reason: \"We're using more and more electronic equipment. In the past this equipment wasn't available, but now patients in an operating room are wired up for 16 different things.\" He noted, however, that as the problem increased, so EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS did everyone's awareness. \"Every precaution is now taken to avoid accidents. In our own work, the first consideration ts that the patient is not grounded.\" Dr. Pordy said that \"suppliers of electronic equipment have the first responsibility to make sure their equipment ts safe. And doc\u00ad tors have the second responsib111ty to make sure the equipment ts used properly. Dr. George Myers, professor of electrical engineering, New York University, agreed the use of electronic equipment presented problems but said he had \"no personal knowledge of the extent of the problem.\" He did note however, that one potential cause of accidents is poor wiring in some of the older hospitals. There is no common ground for the vari\u00ad ous electrical outlets in these hospital rooms, which could cause leakage currents to fiow through the patient's heart. This can cause fibrillation, uncoordinated beating of the heart, which leads to death in a matter of minutes. The heart feels like \"a handful of worms, just squirmy.\" Dr. Bertram Spector, vice-president of re\u00ad search, New York Institute of Technology, noted that slipups and accidents can always occur in the use of electronic equipment. What is needed, he added, ts a \"commitment by hospital administrations to educating their staffs on the proper use of the equip\u00ad ment.\" CONFIRMED DEATHS A faculty member of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, who de\u00ad clined to be identified, confirmed that deaths have been caused by electronic equipment. But the extent to which electronic equip\u00ad ment is directly responsible is difficult to as\u00ad sess. He said that he had heard the figure of 1200 accidental electrocutions a year, but has not seen the medical data on which the figure ts based. Electronic equipment, he stressed, must be designed to prevent injury to patients-and to doctors. There have been cases, he added, where doctors received shocks from equip\u00ad ment and were hospita.Iized. Manufacturers are improving their equipment to some de\u00ad gree. In addition, hospitals need to test equipment on arrival and then maintain it regularly. And hospitals must also design the building's wiring to prevent accidental grounding of patients. Some hospitals are already doing this, he noted. The National Fire Protection Association and the Underwriters Laboratory, among oth\u00ad er organizations in the United States, have committees which are drawing up a list of requirements to make medical equipment safer, he said. \"We have documented that 40 per cent of incoming equipment is defective.\" So said Seymour Ben-Zvi, director of scientific and medical instrumentation at Downstate Med\u00ad ical Center, State University of New York. Mr. Ben-Zvi said Downstate has an elab\u00ad orate testing program and has found \"many instances\" where problems of electronical safety has been overlooked. He described a defibrillator which through a vacuum relay problem was capable of dis\u00ad charging high voltage into a heart patient before the physician had signaled for it. SCARCE STATISTICS Martin Friedlander, an engineer at Colum\u00ad bia Presbyterian Medical Center, said he didn't like \"scare statistics. I'd much rather approach things calmly and try to do some\u00ad thing about it.\" \"You have to compare any kind of shock hazard with the incidence of the same sort of thing in the home. I understand that most of th:e people !in th:Ls country who die 1n the home,\" said Mr. F1ried\u00ad lander. \"I don't think it's a major hazard to the Amertca.n hospital pa'tlient; I woUJldn't say 'tlb.a.t alt ialll.\" February 24, 1969 He went on to describe equipment tech\u00ad niques being developed at the hospital to increase patient safety. Richard Merrls, sales manager for Dallons Instrument, a division of International Rec\u00ad tifier Corp., El Segundo, Calif., said the 1200 figure sounded \"about right\" but pointed out that these cases are caused by ac current leakage from \"all types of electrical equip\u00ad ment,\" not just medical electronic instru\u00ad mentation. The ac current reacts more on some pa\u00ad tients than others and causes fibrillation of the heart muscles. Mr. Merrts said the problem has become a factor in selllng instrumentation to hospi\u00ad tals and Dallons has solved the problem by having its monitoring equipment which is directly connected to the patient all ap\u00ad proved by Underwriters Laboratory. \"Unfortunately, there is no requirement at present for UL approval on such equipment and many smaller companies are not going to the trouble or expense of seeking ap\u00ad proval,\" he said. He added that a uniform requirement for approval would be one method of fighting the problem. Mr. Merris said deaths from ac current leakage rarely happen in intensive care units, where electronic monitoring equipment is most frequently used. If fibrillation were to occur in a patient under intensive care, an alarm would immediately be sounded tell\u00ad ing the hospital staff that his heart action was abnormal. The problem, he said, ts more with \"the poor guy in a room with a stomach pump\" or other standard electrical equipment. If accidental electrocution occurs in such cases, \"he may lay there for an hour before anyone notices.\" Richard Cramer, president of Ivac COrp., manufacturers of electronic mointors for in\u00ad travenous feeding control, said one of the most acute dangers is the use of separate instruments for diagnostic procedure on the same patient at the same time. He said that in such cases, where physiological diagnosis ts being made by introduction of an electric current into the patient's body, the addi\u00ad tion of another current from another in\u00b7 strument could create a lethal electrical loop. With most instruments, especially moni\u00ad tors, the only danger is that common to any appliance, he said. That is the possiblllty that patient or nurse may touch the ma\u00ad chine at a time when there is some leakage of power. Precautions used by Ivac are the use of isolation transformers and of self\u00ad destruct fusing devices which cannot be re\u00ad placed except at the factory. Hewlett-Packard Co. says many accidents a.re due to poor isolation between the instru\u00ad ment and the patient's body. The company recognized the problem several years a.go, and built isolation into its heart pacemaker 1n 1966. The first measuring instrument to be isolated was the 1600 Serles electrocardio\u00ad graph in 1967. The company is now in the process of iso\u00ad lating its entire medical instrumentation line, but conversion has not been completed. An H-P spokesman pointed out the ex\u00ad treme necessity of good grounding, with all equipment returning to the same ground point. All H-P instruments use 3-wire power cables, with separate grounds. The spokesman also pointed out that the most dangerous voltage to human life is in the 700-BOOV range. This is the voltage which sets the heart into uncontrolled difibrilla.\u00ad tion, while higher voltages ca.use tensing only, with the heart frequently returning quickly to its normal rate after voltage is removed. A spokesman for the American Hospital Association in Chicago, which represents about 96 per cent of all United States hos\u00ad pitals, said the group had no independent data of its own on such deaths. He said the group could not comment on Dr. Walter's fig:w-e. -I February 24, 1969 Throughout the survey, no one denied the figure of 1200 deaths or offered a lower estimate. EXBIBIT4 [From the Washington (D.C.) Evening Star, Feb.17, 1969] ELECTRICAL RISK IN HOSPITALS Is HELD RISING (By Judith Randal) NEW YoRK.-Electrical hazards are ex\u00ad ceeded only by the misadministration of drugs and falling out of bed as the leading cause of hospital accidents, according to three experts who say the risk continues rising with the increasing use of sophisticated de\u00ad vices by hospitals. Speaking here at a weekend conference on medical electronics, the three--Dr. Carl Wal\u00ad ters, a surgeon at Peter Bent Brigham Hos\u00ad pital in Boston; David Lubin, administrative engineer of Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, and Paul E. Stanley of Purdue University School of Engineering-said hospitals tend to be a.pathetic about the problem and equipment manufacturers indifferent. They called for stiff quality standards and the machinery for enforcement. Stanley, who is a professor of aeronautics and astronautics as well as an expert on hos\u00ad pitals, said part of the trouble is that med1- cal instrument manufacturers believe their responsibility ends when someone plugs a de\u00ad vice into the wall. Among the dangers, the experts said, are cheap molded plastic plugs for even the most delicaite and expensive machines, crudely put together wall outlets, shoddy cables and equipment of all kinds that is not properly grounded. Even low voltages can be dangerous-it's the amperes that kill. For this reason, they said, hospital electrocutions are on the rise. If a very sick patient is linked by electrodes to a monitoring system, it's often difficult if not impossible, to tell whether he died of his disease or of a shock from the equip\u00ad ment. The dangers are particularly acute in sur\u00ad gical recovery rooms and coronary care units, the panel told reporters at a news briefing. In the Boston area alone, said Walters, there were three recovery room fires traceable to electrical accidents last year. In one, 12 un\u00ad conscious patients had to be hurriedly evacu\u00ad ated. The experts also agreed that many physi\u00ad cian specialists know how to use equipment, but are not familiar with its workings should something go wrong. \"A salesman comes in and the specialist trusts the salesman,\" Lubin said. \"But no circuit diagram or manual comes with the machine.\" Lubin also said physicians and hospitals a.re often poorly informed about when elec\u00ad trical equipment should be cleaned because manufacturers are reluctant to admit that poor design permits it to become dangerously dirty in the first place. Walters agreed. He had, he said, just been asked to look at some devices at New York Hospital and culture the bacteria he might find in them. What they needed, he said, was \"not a culture, but a shovel.\" Another danger, he said, ls the protruding dials and knobs on electronic devices. These fall off all too easily, he explained, and in a crisis, when everyone's attention is focused on the patient mistakes are easily made. EXHIBIT 5 BRIEF SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS TITLE I-AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS Section 101 amends Chapter V of the Fed\u00ad eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adding a new sectJ.on relating to the standards for medical devices. Section 513(a) authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to establish EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS standards for devices when such action will protect public health and sa!ety. Section 513 (b) requires that the Secre\u00ad tary, in developing standards, shall consult with and give appropriate weight to stand\u00ad ards published by other Federal agencies and National or international standrard-set\u00ad ting agencies, and shall invite participation of others representative of scientific, profes\u00ad sional, industry, and consumer orga.ndza.\u00ad tions. Section 513(c) establishes the procedure for issuance, amendment, or repeal of stand\u00ad ards related to those now incorporated in the Federal food and drug law (announce\u00ad ment and hearings on proposed rule mak\u00ad ing), but authorizes also the use of a re\u00ad ferral to an independent advisory committee, outlined in Section 513 ( d) below. Section 513(d) authorizes those who would be affected by a standard to request a review of a proposed standard, or any mat\u00ad ter involved in such a proposal, to an in\u00ad dependent advisory committee for considera\u00ad tion. Section 102 makes conforming amend\u00ad ments in section 501 of the present food and drug law by amending the section defin\u00ad ing \"adulterated drugs and devices\" to in\u00ad clude devices which do not meet a standard set forth in accordance with Section 513 above, where such a standard exists. TITLE II-PREMARKET CLEARANCE OF CERTAIN THERAPEUTIC DEVICES Section 201 (a) amends section 501 of the present food and drug law by deeming a device \"adulterated\" if it is unsafe, unre\u00ad liable, or ineffective with respect to its use or intended use. Section 201 (b) amends the present food and drug law by adding a new Section 514 \"Premarket Clearance for Certain Therapeu~ tic Devices.\" Section 514(a) sets forth cond1tions for when a premarketing clearance is required. States that a device ls to be deemed unsa!e, unreliable, or ineffective for purposes of aip\u00ad plying section 501 (f) above when- ( 1) The device is not generally recognized by experts, qualified by scientific training or experience, to be safe, reliable, or effective for use under the conditions prescribed, sug\u00ad gested or recommended; and, (2) The device is intended for or ls used within the human body, intended to be used for subjecting the human body to some proc\u00ad ess, or after investigation is found to be in\u00ad effective, unsafe, or unreliable. Unless ( 1) a new device application has been filed, or an approved application exists; (2) is exempted as outlined in 514 (j), (k), or (1) below, or (3) ls used solely in animals other than man. This section also requires that the Secre\u00ad tary shall maintain and publish \u00b7a list of de\u00ad vices which are generally recognized as safe and effective for their uses. Section 514(b) describes the contents and procedure for new device applications to com\u00ad ply with the clearance procedure set forth in 514(a) above. These applications must con\u00adtain- (1) Information and data to show the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of the device, (2) Composition, properties, and prtnclples of operation, (3) Methods and controls used in manu\u00ad facture, (4) Identification of the applicable stand\u00ad ard and information to show that the device meets the standard, ( 5) Samples of the device, (6) Specimens of labeling, and (7) Other requirements the Secretary may require. Section 514(c) requires the Secretary to a.ct on application within 180 days after fl.l\u00ad ing by approving, denying and affording an opportunity for hearing, or suspending the time limit pending the report of an advisory committee. 4267 Section 514(d) establishes the bases for approval or disapproval. Disapproval would be ma.de where-- ( 1) The device is not safe or reliable under conditions prescribed, (2) Manufacturing or processing controls do not meet good manufaeturing practices, (3) Lack of substantial evidence that the device has the effect it purports, ( 4) Has false or misleading labeling. Also defines substantial evidence to mean evidence from adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investiga\u00ad tions. Section 514(e) authorizes the Secretary to Withdraw approval of an application where-\u00ad ( 1) Other data, or later evidence, indi\u00ad cates that the device is unsafe or unreliable, (2) New information shows the device to be ineffective, (3) The application contains untrue state\u00ad ments of material fact, ( 4) There is a failure to maintain records, as required elsewhere in the bill (see new section 515). (5) Good manufacturing practices are not employed as required elsewhere in the bill (see new section 501 (g)). (6) On the basis of new information, the labeling is false or misleading. Where an imminent health or sa!ety ha\u00ad zard ls involved, the Secretary is authorized to suspend approval immediately and to pro\u00ad vide for an expedited hearing into the mat\u00ad ter. Section 514(f) provides the Secretary with authority to revoke adverse orders when the facts so require. Section 514(g) requires that the Secre\u00ad tary's order be served in person or by regis\u00ad tered or certified mall. Section 514(h) authorizes the use of a re\u00ad ferral committee for an opportunity for a hearing on an application or the Secretary's action to obtain the committee's report and recommendations. This procedure may be employed when filing an application or at any time prior to the expiration of the time for the Secretary to make a determination on an application. The committee would be appointed by the Secretary. This procedure also applies to Section 513(d) relating to standards as outlined above. Section 514(1) provides applicants with the right of appeal and to obtain judicial review. Section 514(j) establishes exemption for devices used solely for investlgationa.l pur\u00ad poses by persons qualified to conduct such investigation. The exemption would be con\u00ad ditioned upon- ( 1) The existence of an adequate plan of investigation (2) A written agreement that the use of the device will be under the supervision of the investigator in cases where the device 1s for human use (3) That records and data obtained from the investigation are kept and available (4) Other conditions determined by the Secretary to assure public health and safety. The exemption is conditioned also upon notification to those who use such a device that its use is for investiga.tional purposes, and that consent be obtained. Section 514(k) also exempts from the ap\u00ad plication procedure under section 514 any device which fully conforms to an applicable standard established under section 512, or meets standards about to be announced or implemented, devices made upon order by a practitioner, where such a device is not gen\u00ad erally available in finished form or in exist\u00ad ing commercial channels, or where the de\u00ad vice is for the use of a named patient, or for the sole use of a practitioner in the course of his professional practice. Section 514(1) provides exemptions for de\u00ad vices licensed by the Atomic Energy Com\u00ad mission, or for devices where the application of the procedure in this section ls not neces\u00ad sary for the protection of the public health. 4268 Section 202 makes conforming changes in existing law to include under the section on \"prohibited acts\" certain aspects of the new section 514. TITLE III-REQUIREMENT OF GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE Section 301 a.mends present law to provide that a device is \"adulterated\" if the methods and controls used to manufacture the device do not conform with good manufacturing practice to assure that such a. device is safe and reliable and that it has the character\u00ad istics it purports to have. TITLE IV-RECORDS AND REPORTS: INSPECTION AND REGISTRATION OF ESTABLISHMENTS Section 401 amends present law by add\u00ad ing a new section 515 requiring that man\u00ad ufacturers, processors, and distributors of devices subject to standards keep records and make reports to the Secretary relating clinical experience and other data which bears on the safety, reliability, and effective\u00ad ness of such devices. The Secretary is also authorized to have access to such records. Section 515(a) sets forth the above re\u00ad quirements . from these following: ( 1) Pharmacies operating in conformance with applicable local laws, (2) Practitioners, licensed by law, who manufacture devices solely for use in the course of their professional practice, (3) Persons who manufacture devices solely for use in research or teaching, and not for sale, (4) Persons, with respect to any device, no part of which has been in interstate com\u00ad merce and which is not intended for inter\u00ad state commerce, ('5) Other classes, as determined by the Secretary. Section 402 amends varied parts of exist\u00ad ing law to provide the inspection provisions now relating to drugs to devices covered under the act. Section 403 amends various sections of existing law relating to the registration of drug manufacturers to include the manu\u00ad facturers, processors, and distributors of de\u00ad vices covered under the act. TITLE V-GENERAL PROVISIONS Section 501 establishes a new section 707 which provides for the creation of an Ad\u00ad visory Council on Devices within the De\u00ad partment of Health, Education , and Welfare to advise the Secretary on policy matters in carrying out the provisions of the b111. The members would be selected with a view to\u00ad ward their special knowledge of the problems involved in regulating various kinds of de\u00ad vices. Section 502 makes the provisions of the bill effective upon the date of enactment with the exception as shown in 502(b), (c), and (d): Section 502 (b) makes the effective date (except as provided in 502(c) below) of the definition of an \"adulterated device\" on the 1st day of the 13th month following enact\u00ad ment (one year from enactment), or sooner if, upon application, the Secretary issues an order with respect to such application. The effective date in latter case would be the date of the order. This effective date is the date on which the \"safety, reliability, and effectiveness\" requirement is imposed. Section 502(c) relates to devices already in existence. The safety, reliab111ty, and effec\u00ad tiveness requirements shall become effective on a \"closing date,\" the 1st day of the 31st month after enactment (2Y:z years after en\u00ad actment), unless an application is filed sooner. If an application is filed sooner, the effective date is the date of an order with respect to such application. Under certain conditions, this date may be extended by the Secretary to the end of the 60th month following enactment ( 5 years after enact\u00ad ment), or to any date between the 31st and end of the 60th month. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS section 502{d) requires registration of manufacturers, processors, and distributors prior to the 1st day of the 7th month (6 months after enactment). ExHmIT 6 (From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Feb. 20, 1969) ABOUT 1,200 PATIENTS GET ELECTROCUTED YEARLY, HEARING TOLD (By Morton Mintz and Nate Haseltine) About 1200 hospital patients are acciden\u00ad tally electrocuted annually while receiving \"routine diagnostic tests\" or treatment be\u00ad cause of faulty equipment, safety investiga\u00ad tors were to\u00b7ld yesterday. The source of the informrution was Dr. Carl W. Walter, clinical professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and a surgeon at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston. The disclosures were ma<le by consumer advocate Ralph Nader in testimony before the National Commission on Product Safety. Dr Walter said in a telephone interview that many of the electrocutions happen dur\u00ad ing diagnostic procedures in which the pa\u00ad tient is hooked up to electronic systems. Al\u00ad most invariably, he said, the deaths are listed as cardiac arrests--,and \"who's to prove elec\u00ad tricity did not cause the heart stoppages?\" For that reason, he said, there have been few law suits over the deaths, and the hazards have been little publicized. The Boston doctor said that most hospital electrocutions happen when untrained hos\u00ad pital employees link together incompa tible electronic units. But other such deaths, he said, are caused by surges of high voltage leaking from equipment, poor circuit design and connecting patients to electronic equip\u00ad ment for long periods of time--as in intensive care units. Dr. Walter said he obtained the figure on electrocutions from an actuary for a national insurance company who he would not name. The number, he said, is close to his own estimates. But Nader said that Dr. Seymour Ben-Zvi, director of scientific and medical instru\u00ad mentation at Downstate Medical Center in New York City, has documented evidence of defects in 40 per cent of the equipment com\u00ad ing into the Center. Nader criticized the insurance firm whose actuary supplied Dr. Walter with the infor\u00ad mation. \"Unfortunately,\" he said, \"this com\u00ad pany has followed the ghoulish practice of the insurance industry in not publicly releas\u00ad ing this data so as to promote remedial meas\u00ad ures.\" THE GRAPE BOYCOTI': PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE HON. BOB WILSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BOB WILSON. Mr. Speaker, with all the emotional furor that has been raised over the condition of California farmworkers, and California grape pick\u00ad ers in particular, the following balanced article from the January 18 issue of Cal\u00ad ifornia Farmer helps put the California grape dispute into sharper, clearer focus: THE GRAPE BOYCOTT: PAST, PRESENT, Fu'TuRE On October 30, 1968, the California State Chamber of Commerce office received a phone call from a Chicago food firm. The firm wanted facts and figures to fight the grape boycott. This was not an unusual call. The food firm reported boycott sympathizers had in\u00ad dicated overt action because the store would not agree to remove California grapes. What February 24, 1969 was unusual was that the boycott sympa\u00ad thizers wanted the no-sale agreement for 1969. This call emphasizes an important point, according to an editorial report in the Chamber's magazine, Pacific. The nationwide boycott of California table grapes is not go\u00ad ing to fade away. The Chamber's report brings out some other points of interest. A UFWOC leaflet claims \"tens of thousands of grape workers have gone out on strike.\" But the Division of Labor Service, California Department of Employment, reports there were no new bona fide labor disputes in 1968 on California's 70,000 farms. In fact, there were only two bona fide disputes in 1967, involving not tens of thousands, but 275 workers. There were eight disputes in 1966 involving 427 workers. This was for all agriculture, and not just grapes. While UFWOC makes wild claims of tens of thousands of members out on strike, their own reports filed with the U.S. Department of Labor indicate dues income of $84,424 in 1967. With dues of members at $3.50 per month, a membership of about 2000 is indi\u00ad cated. This is less than 2 per cent of farm workers in the State. California farms averaged 170,000 workers in 1967 with a peak in September of 246,000. There are 3 million farm workers in the U.S., so the potential at $3.50 per month is $10Y2 million or $126 million per year, an amount worth the effort. UFWOC leaflets distributed in the East depict a starving child and charge that farm laborers \"suffer want and deprivation.\" State Senator John Harmer said he would resign from the State Senate if the UFWOO would produce \"starving children\" as pictured in union fliers. The Chamber notes it is the retailer who is caught in the middle. This is not new to the grocer. Ten years ago there were efforts to get grocers to stop handling apples from Sebastopol and there were demands to dis\u00ad continue the S&W product line. One Sacramento grocer this year had three unions at one time demanding product re\u00ad moval. The farm workers' union wanted grapes removed, the cannery workers wanted Campbell soups removed and the confec\u00ad tionery union wanted one supplier's bag candy removed. The position taken by the California Grocers Association is: \"The decision of buy\u00ad ing or not buying merchandise for sale must be left to the consumer and markets will continue to handle all products until such time as customers no longer buy the item.\" Turning to another source of boycott ma\u00ad terial, the South Central Farmers Committee reports that 90 per cent of the 5,000 workers who have regularly picked the entire grape crop in the Delano area are residents of the area and not homeless migrants as often pictured. A check of the records will show that 70 per cent of the growers' employees in 1967 lived in Delano, 13 per cent in McFarland, 6 per cent in Bakersfield, 1 per cent in Rich\u00ad grove and 10 per cent had addresses outside the immediate community. The harvest sea\u00ad son lasts September through December and many of the workers are housewives, students and casual workers who only work part time to supplement income and are not solely re\u00ad sponsible for family support. Between harvests Delano growers employ 2,500 workers to prune, irrigate, cultivate, fertilize, strip, tie vines, erect or replace trellises, weed, spray, girdle or thin. For many, mostly family heads, Delano vineyards provide almost year-round employment. Time magazine (March 22, 1968) reports that UFWOC is receiving $10,000 per month from the AFL-CIO and $7500 per month from the United Auto Workers. With contribu\u00ad tions from other locals, church groups and student organizations the UFWOC spends February 24, 1969 about $500,000 a year on its efforts. This heavily financed propaganda would have the Nation believe the Delano grape picker is the lowest paid; that they are poor, forgotten, homeless migrants. Growers feel Delano was selected for precisely opposite reasons. Delano grape pickers are among the highest paid farm workers in the United States. Therefore it appeared to organizers that they would best be able to pay dues. The so-called \"union,\" which ls actually only an organizing committee with the task of determining 1f there is enough interest to form a farm workers' union, needed a well settled, non-migrant work force. Migrants do not stay in one place long enough for con\u00ad venient recruiting or dues collection. Delano fitted the union requirement because 90 per cent of the harvest crews come from the area and 50 per cent of these find year-round employment. Growers find themselves in a tight financial spot. Their costs have doubled while prices stay the same. The Federal-State Market News Service records reveal that table grapes averaged $60 per ton 10 years ago. Last year the average price was $61.90 and the 10-year average was $56 per ton. Over this same period a tractor, most com\u00ad monly used in the vineyard, has jumped in price from $10,000 to $17,000. Property taxes which averaged $16 per acre 10 years ago now average $30. Shipping cartons which cost 35 cents 10 years ago now cost 45 cents. The story ls the same with all other costs involved. Growers will continue to oppose unioniza\u00ad tion as long as they are threatened with strikes, a weapon which makes collective bargaining over a perishable commodity a one-way street for unions. Is this a false fear? Check with the pineapple growers in Hawall who lost $7 million as their crop rotted in the field during a 61-day strike. While UFWOC claims workers are on strike, the 70 table grape growers in the Delano area had no difficulty recrul ting the 5000 workers who have regularly picked the crop over the years. Picketing activities have been conducted primarily by paid professionals and volun\u00ad teers from student groups, campus m1litants, social reform organizations and cooperating clergymen, many of whom were recruited by the Migrant Ministry. Having failed repeatedly to \"sell\" grape pickers on the value of union membership, leaders of UFWOC, now in desperation, are threatening naked force to accomplish their ends. UFWOC is telling growers their grapes will be boycotted unless they sign contracts on behalf of their workers, whether the workers want to join or not. Having failed to recruit workers on the merits of the union effort, UFWOC is seeking to compel workers to join through coercion. Who is behind Cesar Chavez? He makes no secret that he received most of his or\u00ad ganizational training under Saul Alinsky, the activist. The California State Senate Fact Finding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities in 1967 did not say that the strike was directed by Communists. But it did say It was turned into a civil rights movement and operated as a cause and not a labor dispute. The report notes this view ls amply sup\u00ad ported by the activities of known members of the Communist Party who were on the scene and siding with the strike almost from its inception; by favorable accounts that consistently appeared in the Communist press; by participation in strike demonstra\u00ad tions by such organizations as the DuBois Clubs of America, Students for a Democratic Society, Progressive Labor Party, Vietnam Day Committee, Trotskylte groups and other organizations moved by similar objectives and by the reports of all law enforcement agencl~ connected with the project. D.R. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS DO NOT FORGET THE OLD LEFT HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, the February issue of Nation's Business put forth in its editorial some observations on the New Left and Old Left which are worth remembering. The editorial begins by stating that We're so preoccupied with the threats of the New Left these days, some people have forgotten there's an Old Left-the USSR. When we remember that it was the Old Left or the U.S.S.R. and not the New Left which invaded Czechoslovakia last August, the editorial's advice should be well taken. When we consider that it is the Old Left which has been supplying vast amounts of armaments to Ho Chi Minh to be used against American servicemen and the South Vietnamese, we would forget the Old Left at our peril. The :point would seem to be self evi\u00ad dent, yet there are those who would ac\u00ad cuse the United States of every excess in Vietnam but conveniently forget the 50-year record of the U.S.S.R.'s inhu\u00ad manity to man. For this reason I think the Nation's Business editorial provides what should be a basic tenet of foreign policy considerations-the totalitarian nature of the Soviet regime-and I in\u00ad clude the editorial in the RECORD at this point: DON'T FORGET THE OLD LEFT We're so preoccupied with the threats of the New Left these days, some people have forgotten there's an Old Left-the USSR. Just because we've coexisted with the So\u00ad viet for years and we're seeking treaties and peace negotiations with them now doesn't mean they've become our kind. If you think the Soviet communist system is getting pretty much like ours, consider some comparable rights: We have free speech, !ree press, freedom of worship. Not so in Russia. We have the right of assembly. Not the Russians. We have trial by jury and are innocent until proved guilty. In Russia, it's trial by judge, and presumption of innocence does not exist We can own private property. The Soviets have no real property rights. We can bargain for goods and services in our free markets. Not so in Russia. We can get into business and compete for a profit. It's denied to Soviets. We have free elections. In Russia only one name per omce is listed. In America you can not only worry about the New Left, you can even be one of the New Left if you want. The Old Left doesn't even allow a New Left. SOMEWHERE A STAND MUST BE MADE AGAINST DISRUPTERS ON THE CAMPUS HON. WILLIAM A. STEIGER OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. STEIGER of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my re-4269 marks in the RECORD, I include the fol\u00ad lowing: [From the 15-Minute Report for College and University Trustees, Peb. 21, 1969) DISRUPTERS ON THE CAMPUS: NEW RULES AT NOTRE DAME \"Must universities be subjected, willy\u00ad nilly, to intimidation and victimization, whatever their goodw111 . . . ? Somewhere a stand must be made,\" declares the president of Notre Dame. \"Anyone or any group that substitutes force for rational persuasion\" at the U of Notre Dame w111 henceforth be subject to suspension, expulsion, court action, or a combination thereof. That was the message last week from the Rev. Theodore M. Hes\u00ad burgh, president of the university. In a letter to faculty members, students, and parents, Father Hesburgh reiterated his belief in the right of legitimate protest. But he added that \"the last thing a shaken so\u00ad ciety needs is more shaking. The last thing a noisy, turbulent, and disintegrating commu\u00ad nity needs ls more noise, turbulence, and disintegration .... Complicated social mech\u00ad anisms, out of joint, are not adjusted with sledge hammers.\" Father Hesburgh said he had consulted with all segments of the university commu\u00ad nity and concluded that he had a \"clear mandate\" to see: That \"our lines of communication be\u00ad tween all segments of the community are kept as open as possible, with all legitimate means of communicating dissent assured, ex\u00ad panded, and protected\"; That \"civil1ty and rationality are main\u00ad tained as the most reasonable means of dis\u00ad sent within the academic community\"; and That \"violation of others' rights or ob\u00ad struction of the life of the university are outlawed as 1llegit1mate means of dissent in this kind of open society.\" He then outlined what will happen if those principles are violated: Disrupters will be given \"15 minutes of meditation to cease and desist their activities. If they do not comply, those with university identity cards will be suspended, and those who fail to produce them will be charged with 1llegal trespass.\" Those who refuse to cease their disruptions will then be given another five minutes, after which students will be expelled and \"the law will deal with them as non-students.\" \"I truly believe,'' said Father Hesburgh, \"that we are about to witness a revulsion on the part of legislatures, state and national, benefactors, parents, alumni, and the general public for much that is happening in higher education today. \"If I read the signs of the times correctly, this may well lead to a suppression of the liberty and autonomy that are the lifeblood of a university community. It may well lead to a rebirth of facism, unless we our.selves are ready to take a stand for what ls right for us. History ls not consoling in this regard. We rule ourselves or others rule us, in a way that destroys the university as we have known and loved it.\" [From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Feb. 24, 1969) F'IF:rEEN MINuTEs OF MEDITATION The other day, after outlining the policy of Notre Dame University on student disorders, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh told an in\u00ad terviewer, \"All I tried to say is that we wel\u00ad come and protect orderly dissent, but we're not going to let anybody destroy the place.\" His message to the students at the Univer\u00ad sity over which he presides and his an\u00ad nounced tactics for handling any disruptions of University functions ought to be con\u00ad sidered carefully by the rest of the Nation's universities and drummed into the heads of those students who seem more intent upon disruption than on orderly change. The policy Father Hesburgh spelled out ls 4270 quite simple. \"Anyone or any group that sub\u00ad stitutes force for rational persuasion, be it violent or nonviolent,\" he said, \"will be given 15 minutes of meditation to cease and de\u00ad sist.\" If, after 15 minutes, the disruption goes on, students will be suspended on the spot and nonstudents will be subject to arrest as trespassers. After another five minutes of further meditation, students continuing to disrupt things will be expelled. The Notre Dame policy ls tough, no ques\u00ad tion about it. But it is a time to get tough. Nothing ls more inimical to the traditions on which academic freedom is based or, indeed, to the principles of a free society than the use of illegal force to impose some indi\u00ad vidual's or some group's views on others. And that 1s precisely what the latest round of student disorders ls all about, whether they have occurred at Harvard, Wisconsin, Duke, San Francisco State, or the Howard Univer\u00ad sity Law School. It may be that a university which adopts a tough policy will find itself with fewer students but, if it does, they will be students who want to learn as well as re\u00b7 form. There is, of course, much to be said on behalf of many of the complaints that stu\u00ad dents are trying to air. Some universities have been notoriously slow to change their operating procedures or their policies to keep up with the just needs and wants of a new generation of students. The dramatic over\u00ad haul of many of the policies of Columbia University in the last year underlines the validity of many of the questions that stu\u00ad dents are raising. But the fact that there are pollcies that need changing, personnel who need awaken\u00ad ing, and issues that need dramatizing does not justify the forcible disruption of a uni\u00ad versity's functions. There is nothing wrong and there is much right with students pro\u00ad tests that take the form of public meetings, picket lines, handblll distributions, confer\u00ad ences with university or government omclals, and a whole host of other nonforceable tactics. But the use of force to break up a class, to seize a building, or to bar access to offices cannot be tolerated. These acts, whether participated in by a minority or by a majority of students, not only impinge on fundamental principles of conduct but frus\u00ad trate the right of other students to pursue peacefully, if they want to, the education they went to the university to obtain. Speaking of those among his students and faculty who have participated in or tolerated the disruption of classes, Harvard's President Pusey said the other day, \"Each time we thoughtlessly or emotionally allow ourselves to chip away at the painfully erected struc\u00ad ture of academic freedom for which time and time again in our role as leaders we have had to man the barricades we not only do our\u00ad selves but also our country an irreparable disservice . . . I shall do everything in my power to see that the freedom of this uni\u00ad versity continues unabated, proof against attacks however well-intentioned or from whatever quarter they may come.\" THE BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH POVERTY HON. RICHARD L. OTTINGER OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. OTTINGER. Mr. Speaker, a year ago, Mr. Hershel Sarbin, senior vice pres\u00ad ident of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., and publishing director of Popular Pho\u00ad tography magazine, was invited by Vice President Humphrey to serve as nation-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS al coordinator on the President's Coun\u00ad cil on Youth Opportunity. Mr. Sarbin worked in liaison with all national task forces of the President's Council, communicating through the photographic medium the efforts and re\u00ad sults of the varied programs that were being carried on in deprived neighbor\u00ad hoods. Last fall, Mr. Sarbin reported on the progress of this program in an address before the race relations section of Town Hall of California. He illustrated his talk, \"The Business of Dealing With Poverty,\" with an NBC documentary film entitled \"Child's Eye View,\" which demonstrated the use of photography in aiding ghetto youngsters. The children, aged 7 to 12, were participants in the New York City Bank Street College Early Childhood Center program. I believe that Mr. Sarbin's report will be of interest to my colleagues: THE BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH POVERTY (An address by Hershel Sarbin, October 31, 1968) The film you have just seen is merely one lllustration of how photography has been used by one creative, resourceful teacher to open an avenue of communication with ghet\u00ad to youngsters who had literally not been able to express themselves and their feellngs about their lives and their environment. This past summer 5,000 youngsters in more than 40 cities throughout this country were involved in photographic projects as a part of a national Youth Opportunity Program. Many of these young people were school drop\u00ad outs, with 4th or 5th grade reading capabil\u00ad ities. Most were inarticulate. Some had never wandered outside the ghettos in which they lived. We learned this summer that film and the camera could make unique contributions in the effort to help the youngsters of the In\u00ad ner City. The camera itself has capabllities far beyond the recording of an image, and in some strange and wonderful way it creates a climate for observation and communication which did not previously exist for many young people. For the older youngsters, the teenagers and the school dropouts, the summer's achieve\u00ad ments were very significant. The camera helped to show these highly inarticulate youngsters, with low levels of reading capa\u00ad bility, that they could control a complicated mechanism as they could control no other part of their lives. They dominated the camera. It recorded what they saw, did what they wanted it to do. What was seemingly the end product, the recorded image which they produced themselves in the darkroom, was not the end product at all. The end prod\u00ad uct was a sense of pride and accomplishment, and knowing they could learn even when they couldn't read. Many of the young men we worked with this summ.er are going back to school. Several are seriously considering college, and many are prepared to step into a new world as responsible, employable citizens. Ghetto children traditionally have a poor self-image. In and out of their environment they have been stigmatized, and there has been little in their lives to give them cause to hold their heads high, to feel a justifiable sense of pride in themselves. Participation in our photography programs gave some of these children this opportunity. They acquired skills which set them apart from their peers, both in their environment and without their environment. The young people in this summer's pho\u00ad tography programs are products of a world in which they have no voice-no control-no motivation. We are finding that photography February 24, 1969 ls providing them with that voice; helping them to cope with their situations; giving them the initiative to want to do something\u00ad to be something, to become a constructive part of society. What was most sd.gmtioant 181bout thJ1s sum\u00ad mer's learned. is an necessary rtio deal with the reaJlltles of ,the problem. In my own work wlith disa.dv,anrt;aged youngsters, I have heard :bhe ltlhe needs of ithese young people. Yet it often seems to me that our first and most important task might well be the motivation and education of the busi\u00ad ness community itself. Most businessmen and most volunteers from the private sector are simply not pre\u00ad pared for the frustrations, the disappoint\u00ad ments, the rea.llties of working with the dis\u00ad advantaged. There are some fairly basic rules which recognize the realities of working with the disadvantaged, and which must be ob\u00ad served if we are to succeed: First, if you extend a helping hand, do not ask for thanks. What we do-we do for our\u00ad selves and the survival of our society. Re\u00b7 member that the Negro does not want a handout for which he must express his grati\u00ad tude. He simply wants a piece of the action. Second, anticipate and adjust to attitudes of suspicion, distrust and hostllity from those you seek to help. Most of the black com\u00ad munity still thinks what we are doing ls only \"whitey's game.\" The burden of proof is on us to show that this is not the case. Third, contribute in any way you can. Don't look for prestige or recognition in pov\u00b7 erty. And be prepared for frustrations that you have never experienced before. The most significant contributions are those made on a one-to-one, man-to-man basis. Beyond all this must be an overriding, ever\u00b7 present awareness that to climb out of the ghetto takes a super-human effort. Inex\u00ad haustible patience, perseverance and dedica\u00ad tion are qualities we must have, but we may not expect these qualities from people whose lives have been filled with despair. Let's turn for a few moments to motiva\u00ad tlon--our motivation-as well as the motiva\u00ad tion of the ghetto youngster. It should be motivation enough to recognize that what we have in our urban communities ls a vast disaster area, inhabited by people whose con\u00ad dition is so desperate that the nation itself wm not survive if we do not supply the re\u00b7 sources and energy necessary to change it. But the kind of motivation I'm talking about comes from seeing something good and decent happen to hundreds of young people in just one small part of one program orig\u00ad inally designed to provide one summer of en\u00b7 joyment and enrichment. I do not think that any of us who worked with these young people wlll ever get over the discovery that so many of them had un\u00b7 tapped abilities and talents, and that inside them was strength, a resourcefulness and a kind of creativity that needed only encour\u00ad agement and direction. I do not know of a single businessman or professional volunteer who was not deeply and permanently affected by what happened. Not one of us could ever again turn his back on these young people, for we have been there and have watched it work. It worked in spite of hostility, in spite of distrust, in spite of suspicion, and in spite of many failures. This is our motivation. It comes from par\u00ad ticipation, from being there, from working hand in hand and experiencing even a single success with a single youngster. That is the kind of motivation America needs, and it can only result from a much February 24, 1969 broader involvement of the business com\u00ad munity, and the community at large, than we have today. The success achieved 1n many cities, and specifically here in Los Angeles, was attribut\u00ad able to the talents and the tireless efforts of such people as Blll Frederickson, Martha Cushnie, Clarence Inman, William Elkins, David Saunders, Joe Maldanado and Mike Beltram<>-to Max Ponder and John Best of Ponder and Best--to Freestyle Camera., East\u00ad man-Kodak, Bell & Howell and Polaroid and Minolta and other companies who contrib\u00ad uted generously of time and photo equip\u00ad ment. Many of these people were in the arena. long before us, and we were able to build on what they had developed. We learned, among other things, that if photography was to have real meaning for ghetto youngsters, it could not be treated merely as a diversion during the summer months. Fortunately, the entire photographic industry recognized that to place cameras in the hands of deprived youngsters during the summer, provide them with a stimulating ex\u00ad perience, and then to withdraw the opportu\u00ad nity would lead only to disillusionment for the very people we were trying to help. Accordingly, right here in Los Angeles, 1n Chicago, Detroit, Seattle, New York and Mi\u00ad ami and in a number of other cities, what was begun so promisingly this summer is being continued with the support of the photographic industry and with the assist\u00ad ance of city administrators. The National As\u00ad sociation of Photographic Manufacturers, the Master Photo Dealers & Finishers Association, and the importers of cameras from Germ.any, Japan and many other countries have re\u00ad sponded in the most positive terms. As I said before, we have barely begun, and it is premature to say exactly where we a.re going. We know only that an entire industry has been stimulated by what the camera has managed to do to create self-expression, self\u00ad awareness, self-pride and even to train many disadvantaged for useful employment in our industry. Photography ls a small corner of the world. But our experience cannot be different than the experience of others. Everything we do in meeting the problems of the ghett<>-educating the inner city youngsters in a more enlightened matter, training hard-core unemployed to assume more responsible roles in our society, provid\u00ad ing educational and cultural opportunities\u00ad all these things create an awareness of the ugliness of the ghetto environment and make the informed Negro ever more determined to change it. The hope and rising expectations we generate serve to intensify the problem and make the solution more urgent. We are still novices-real beginners--en\u00ad gaged in the greatest experiment in history. To reverse an ugly phrase I have often heard applied to the black community, we must learn to crawl before we walk. The Negro is ready to walk, but we have barely begun to learn how to deal effectively with the en\u00ad vironment into which he, and all our urban disadvantaged, have been cast. Not long ago Newsweek described an ex\u00ad periment in which white men assumed the role of blacks by donning masks and acting out parts. Well, if it helps white man to put on black masks in order to simulate condi\u00ad tions under which they must deal with the underprivileged, then let us put on the masks. Let us try anything-everything that will generate understanding and a capability which we do not yet have for dealing with the business of poverty as we deal with the business of making money. Probably no pat formula. will ever evolve. The material and spiritual poverty which pervades the ghettos of our urban areas will not respond to stand\u00ad ard prescriptions. What is required ls full commitment and intense personal dedlcation---e. dedication not yet discernible on the American business EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS scene. By and large, American business merely pays lip service to full commitment in this area. It is a simple fact of corporat.e life that while the chairman of the board. or the president and some corporat.e officers may be in the arena, the message has not been passed down the corporate line, not even as far as middle management; certainly not to the junior executive. I have yet to hear of a. corporate recruiter who has said to the promising college graduate, \"I! you come with our company you will be obliged, as part of company policy, to devote some part of your time on and off the job to helping the less fortunate.\" OUr commitment in meeting the great economic and social prob\u00ad lems of the disadvantaged is not so great that we include persona.I involvement--on some level-in the dialogue which precedes or follows the employment contract. The few guidelines I have suggested are in no sense complete, or even well-defined. They are merely a. product of my own experi\u00ad ence. We must feel our way, probing, learn\u00ad ing as we go along. But these guidelines do move in the right direction-away from Up service, away from tokenism, and toward the kind Of under\u00ad standing which is necessary if we are to reach across the gulf of fear and anger and despair-to build a better future for black and white alike. FRANK J. MYERS TO RETffiE AS INDIANA AMERICAN LEGION AD\u00ad JUTANT HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, on May 1, 1969, Frank J. Myers, adjutant of the In\u00ad diana department of the American Legion, will retire and end 18 years of service in that post. Born in Worthington, Ind., Frank My\u00ad ers served in the Army during World War I and was Indiana eighth district commander of the Legion before he came to Indiana State headquarters 22 years ago. His long and faithful service to his State and his country will be forever re\u00ad membered by all of us who have had the pleasure of knowing him and calling him \"friend.\" We wish him a happy and pleasant retirement, and we salute him as he closes his truly distinguished and outstanding career. PERSIP BROTHERS HONORED HON. SILVIO 0. CONTE OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. CONTE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute today to three out\u00ad standing Americans from Pittsfield, Mass., John, Charles, and Alfred Persip. In doing so, I am joining with the 350 friends and neighbors who held a testi\u00ad monial dinner honoring the Persip brothers on February 15. The Persips are lifelong residents of western Massachusetts who have given freely of their time and efforts on behalf 4271 of a multitude of civic organizations, in\u00ad cluding the NAACP and the American Legion. The testimonial, organized by a group of grateful private citizens, recognized the many years of dedicated public serv\u00ad ice by John, Charles, and Alfred Persip. Under the leave to extend my remarks, I would like to include the February 17 article from the Berkshire Eagle on the Persip testimonial: THREE PERSIP BROTHERS HONORED BY CROWD OF 350 A crowd of 350 jammed Breezy Knoll-Itam Lodge Saturday night for a Brotherhood Week testimonial dinner honoring John, Charles A. and Alfred K. Persip. They heard a roster of well-wishers liter\u00ad ally as well as figuratively sing the praises of the three brothers during a program en\u00ad compassing speeches, skits, songs and comic turns. The evening ended with dancing. Mayor Donald Butler told the assemblage he grew up across the street from the Per\u00ad sips, and second to his own mother, used to think of \"Grandma Persip\" as the maternal authority of the neighborhood. \"I hope the day will come when I'm held in a fraction of the respect that the Persip brothers and Grandma Persip have been held in,\" he said. Individualized tributes were paid the three brothers by David Gunn, physical education director of Cornwall Academy, who noted, among other things, that each had been active in NAACP. He concluded with the aphorism, \"It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game,\" adding, \"and you've played the game fairly and squarely.\" CREDIT TO HUMAN RACE Lawrence K. Miller, editor of the Eagle, ob\u00ad served that almost everyone in the area has some kind of relationship with the Persips, \"an almost legendary family.\" He said that while the customary comment is that a Ne\u00ad gro is a credit to his race, the Persips are \"a credit to the human race, and the human race needs all the credit it can get.\" More family background was supplied by Atty. Rudolph A. Sacco, toastmaster, who said th.at the Persips had lived in the Berk\u00ad shires since around 1820, settling first in Lanesboro, then moving to Hinsdale and finally, to Pittsfield. They have been mem\u00ad bers of the Baptist church here since 1851. Toastmaster Sacco gave brief biographi\u00ad cal sketches of the brothers: John, 81, who went to work at 14 and established the rep\u00ad utation of the Persips as \"the best caterers in Berkshire County\"; Charles, an American Legion leader who has not missed a parade in 47 years; and Alfred, the \"baby\" at 73 years of age, also a Legionnaire and a well\u00ad known gardener. EARLY DAYS RECALLED Frank T. Walker, president of the Berk\u00ad shire County NAACP, presented a purse to the guests of honor and paid tribute to the committee in charge of the dinner: Mrs. Frances Duval, Mrs. Helen Hamilton, Mrs. Grace Hunt, Clifford H. Potter, Stokes Hall and Lafayette Walker. Mrs. Duval, eldest daughter of John Persip, presented flowers to her father and two uncles. Her brother, Elliott, reminisced about early days and with his father performed an old skit entitled \"Sweet William and Bad Bill.\" Noting that the locale of today's Bousquet Ski Center used to be known as Persipville, Elliott said John \"was born down that way because he wanted to be near his mother.\" To the tune of \"Hello Dolly,\" Mrs. John W. Talbot sang personalized lyrics for the guests of honor. Mrs. Mabel Hamilton sang \"Peo\u00ad ple.'' The Rev. George L. Middleton of the First Baptist Church gave the invocation; and Carlton Edmonds, the benediction. 4272 ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. JAMESJ. HOWARD OF NEW JERSEY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. HOW ARD. Mr. Speaker, today we are once again reminded of the bravery and hope of the people of Estonia as we celebrate the 51st anniversary of Es\u00ad tonian independence. This small nation, which covers an area of about 18,000 square miles, and has approximately 1 million people, should be a monument to all of us who cherish our right to free\u00ad dom and independence. Since the 15th century Estonians have suffered under foreign domination al\u00ad most continuously. During all that time, however, these brave people held their heads high and continued to hope for the day when they would be a free and independent nation, directing their own course in world history. The fact that their conquerors were much larger and more powerful than they has never daunted the Estonians. Frequently they were persecuted for their hopes and be\u00ad liefs, but their spirit of nationalism has persisted, their language and customs are still their own. Finally, in 1918, when the end of the First World War and the Russian revo\u00ad lution appeared to make their chances better, the Estonians declared their in\u00ad dependence. Thereafter, for a brief pe\u00ad riod of two decades, these people were permitted the freedoms we feel are the basic rights of every man and nation. This was a time of great social, economic, and cultural progress in Estonia. They formed a democratic government, duly elected by the people, and the spirit of freedom was to be found at every level of life in the country. This freedom was destined to be tem\u00ad porary, however, and in 1939, when war once again engulfed Europe, the Estonian people were forced into a mutual assist\u00ad ance pact with the Soviet Union. This was the beginning of the Soviet recon\u00ad quest of this small, freedom-loving na\u00ad tion. In 1940, the country was occupied by the Red army forces and became a Soviet Socialist Republic. During the war, they were occupied by both Russian and German troops alternately-suffer\u00ad ing equally under both. Toward the end of the war, the Soviets returned to con\u00ad trol with more force and fury than ever, and there they remain to this day. Since that time, the Estonians have lived a rather isolated life, without con\u00ad tact from the free world. More recently, some tourists have been allowed to visit the country, thus permitting them a glimpse of the freedom they so wish to enjoy themselves. I think it appropriate on this day that we who enjoy that freedom pay tribute to those who are still fighting to regain the independence they felt so briefly, and which cannot even be celebrated in their home country. We salute them and re\u00ad dedicate ourselves to the achievement of peace on earth and freedom of all such nations, and of all men. EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS ESTONIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. JOHN D. DINGELL OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. ~INGELL. Mr. Speaker, the year 1918 witnessed the end of the bloodiest and costliest war known to man until then. Belligerents and neutrals alike were glad to see the human carnage stop, and they all welcomed the return of peac~. To many peoples the peace ush\u00ad ered ma new era; it brought them a prize for which they had been struggling for generations and centuries. In that year they regained their independence and the Estonians were among these p~ple. These rugged peasants had settled in their historic homeland on the north\u00ad eastern shore of the Baltic Sea be! ore the beginning of our era. There they led a strenuous and hardy life. They were one of the smallest ethnic groups in ~urope, and they succeeded in maintain\u00ad mg th~ir national identity and freedom. Early m the 18th century their country became part of the Russian empire and they were subjected to the reg~e of Russia's oppressive czars. For more than tw~ centuries they endured that detested r~grme. Then toward the end of the First World War they regained their ~reedom and proclaimed their national mdependence on February 24, 1918. That was 51 years ago, but independent Estonia was again crushed by a Russian :egime in 1940. After the happy and Joyful two decades of inter-war years the co1:1ntry became one of the early casualties of the last war. Since then the Estonian people have been suffering under alien regimes imposed upon them by their detested foes, the Communists. They wo~k, live, pray, and struggle for the. attamment of their supreme goal, their freedom. In observing their in\u00ad dependence day we join them in their prayer, hoping that soon they will be rewarded with their cherished national goal, national freedom. THE SEC AND SOME CURRENT REGULATORY PROBLEMS HON. W. S. (BILL) STUCKEY OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. STUCKEY. Mr. Speaker, the Hon\u00ad orable Hugh F. Owens, Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commis\u00ad sion, delivered an address on current reg\u00ad ulatory problems concerning the SEC before the Connecticut Investment Bank\u00ad ers Association on December 10, 1968. There was a number of bills before the 90th Congress related to the SEC and several have already been introduced in the 91st Congress, thus this subject is very timely. The address is enlightening and worthy to be included in the CON\u00ad GRESSIONAL RECORD and I would like for February 24, 1969 my colleagues to have the benefit, of his comments: THE SEC AND SOME CURRENT REGULATORY PROBLEMS (Address by Hugh F. Owens, Commissioner, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C., before Connecticut In\u00ad vestment Bankers Association, Hartford, Conn., December 10, 1968) I am honored to be included in this eve\u00ad ning's function, commemorating as it does in the State of Oonnectlcut the 65th anniver\u00ad sary of the signing of the first laws pertain\u00ad ing to the supervision of the securities indus\u00ad try. This is an auspicious occasion indeed. Tonight I would like to discuss several reg\u00ad uLaitory problems :ltn whilch ,the SEC, es well as the various self-regulatory organizations, is vitally concerned. As you are all aware, our securities markets are currently expand\u00ad ing and changing at an unprecedented ra.te. More than 24 million stockholders now di\u00ad rectly own shares in American industry, with another estimated 100 million shareholders indirectly investing in the securities markets through various financial institutions such as mutual funds, insurance companies, bank trusts, pension funds and others. The average daily dollar value of securities traded on all markets now is $825 million, accounting for an average of 22 million shares exchanging hands every day. This volume has created a strain on the securities markets and has raised important policy questions which re\u00ad quire resolution. One of the major problem areas is how to handle effectively the undesirable aspects of the super-heated speculative fever now exist\u00ad ting in our markets without diluting the vitality so necessary to the continued growth and progress of our economy. As a matter of policy, the Commission does not, absent fraud and manipulative practices, view spec\u00ad ulation per se as either illegal, unethical or opprobrious. The Congress, however, when enacting the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, recognized that excessive speculation was detrimental to the national interest, and pro\u00ad vided, there.fore, va.rious regulatory collltrols such as margin restrictions, prohibition and limitations on short sales, and other devices to contain such speculation. I believe that the Federal regulatory agencies responsible for the enforcement of such controls have attempted to use them judiciously to main\u00ad tain public confidence in the securities mar\u00ad kets, and without reservation I can state tha:t it has been the SEC's position to exercise the minimum amount of regulation of the secu\u00ad rities m.arkets consistent with the public in\u00ad terest, and the interest of investors and the securities industry alike. While my talk is entitled \"The SEC and Some Current Regula\u00ad tory Problems,\" I wish to give recognition to the valuable services performed by the self\u00ad regulatory organizations, and to say that while our cooperative efforts have accom\u00ad plished many of their objectives, nevertheless, much needs yet to be done, particularly in the area of the back office problem, which I will discuss more fully later in my talk. Although speculation in the securities markets has long attracted the attention of the Commission, until more recently our ac\u00ad tivities in this respect have primarily been directed toward uncovering situations in which fraud and manipulation a.re present or, due generally to the absence of adequate information, situations where serious mar\u00ad ket problems involving a particular stock have occurred. Currently, however, we also view with considerable concern certain new developments which are progressing to a. point of \"institutionalizing\" our securities markets. In our Report of Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth we called attention to certain facts which, when now supplemented with information obtained from more recent surveys conducted February 24, 1969 by the New York Stock Exchange, a.re even more significant than when the Report was first published in late 1966. Illustratively, some of these facts show that: 1. the percentage of all outstanding stock held in institutional portfolios ls rising at a rapid rate (25% in 1957, 30% in 1965 and 33% in 1967); 2. the increases in the stockholdings of all institutions have been striking (from a total of $66\u00a52 billion in 1957, to $200 billion in 1965, and finally to $230 billion in 1967, an increase of about three and a half times over 1957); 3. institutions and institutional interme\u00ad diaries account for a much larger proportion of trading volume in securities than the above holdings indicate (a recent survey indicates as much as 50% of all non-mem\u00ad bers' volume on the New York Stock Ex\u00ad ~hange in 1968 was due to trading activity by such group as compared to 35 % in 1967) ; 4. the combined value of common stock transactions in 1967 for four principal classes of financial institutions-non-insured pension funds, mutual funds, life insurance companies, and property and casualty insur\u00ad ance companies-exceeded $47 billion, an in\u00ad crease of 46 % over 1966; by comparison, the dollar volume of all stock transactions on the New York Stock Exchange in 1967 showed only a 26 % increase over 1966; 5. mutual funds have, by far, the highest portfolio turnover rates of all institutional investors. The latest data available indi\u00ad cates that mutual funds as a group were turning over their portfolios at an annual rate of al.most 40 % in 1967 as compared to less than 35% in 1966 and an estimated 14% in 1957; also, compare this 40 % figure to the fact that the average turnover rate for all equity securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange wa,s only about 20% in 1967. Mutual funds, moreover, tend to engage in larger size transactions than other institu\u00ad tional investors, and account for a large portion of negotiated crosses and block dis\u00ad tributions of securities. Our Report noted further that, despite the fact that the assets of mutual funds have grown at a rapid rate in recent years, many of the large funds have reduced the number of different stocks in their portfolios. This ooncentration of power has led to the in\u00ad creased probability that a few fund managers by their investment decisions will affect dra\u00ad matically the stability of the market in par\u00ad ticular securities in which they trade, re\u00ad gardless of any intent to do so. Further, as the irregular and relatively infrequent trans\u00ad actions of individual institutions in sizable blocks of securities become relatively more significant and the comparative importance of round lot orders by small investors de\u00ad creases, the auction markets may find it in\u00ad creasingly difficult to maintain the liquidity, depth and continuity which they tradition\u00ad ally have sought to achieve. The figures and facts which I have just mentioned still primarily reflect the market activities of the more numerous traditional capital appreciation and income funds. Nev\u00ad ertheless, recent emphasis on short-term movements by funds and other more con\u00ad servative institutions has had, and will in\u00ad creasingly have, an important impact on the markets. It is not yet known to what extent the original purpose of providing safety through diversification has now been \"rephiloso\u00ad phized\" or how much of the additional insti\u00ad tutional activity is a result of the emergence of the \"cult of performance,\" with its em\u00ad phasis on new market techniques to develop short-term profits. Although there are re\u00ad strictions on their use, these techniques in\u00ad clude use of leverage, short-selling, purchase of puts and calls, option contracts and war\u00ad rants, and investing in \"special situations\" and restricted unregistered stock. CXV--270--Part 4 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS As you know, in July of this year, Congress authorized an economic study to explore the effect of financial institutions on the overall securities markets, the securities industry, issuers of securities and the general public. This will, of course, not only be a very im\u00ad portant undertaking, but a complex one as well, and we will need the cooperation and assistance of the entire industry. Most of us connected in one way or an\u00ad other with the securities industry are op\u00ad timists, which I believe is a desirable and even necessary trait. On the other hand, we surely cannot afford to ignore the fact that just six years ago Wall Street was, as it is now, almost at a point of being overcome with the enthusiastic embrace shown it by the investing public. After the 1962 market break, however, not only the investor suf\u00ad fered from severe withdrawal pains, but the industry saw the expiration of a number of its members, both large and small, and con\u00ad solidations among others. May 1962 also brings to mind a practice, existing then and now, in which much of the general investing public (at least for a time) happily participated-gambling on \"hot issues.\" For comparative purposes, I find it not dissimilar to the \"pyramid club\" crazes which stem from the oldest of man's aspirations-something for nothing. Many of you may be fam111ar with a sur\u00ad vey given some publicity a short while back, summarizing the financial fate of a number of offerings made during the previous so\u00ad called \"hot issue\" period. In any event, I be\u00ad lieve the figures merit repeating, as has been done by some brokerage firms who I under\u00ad stand distributed copies of the survey re\u00ad sults to their customers. The survey, en\u00ad compassing some 504 companies going pub\u00ad lic for the first time during the period 1952 to 1962, indicated that: 1. almost 12 % of such companies had van\u00ad ished without a trace; 2. another 43 % were known to have liqui\u00ad dated, dissolved or gone into receivership; 3. 26 % , while still in business, had reported a loss on their most recent income state\u00ad ment; and 4. if my mathematics are correct, only ap\u00ad proximately 19 % , or about one out of every five, of such new issues could be measured in terms of some success. Recognizing, how\u00ad ever, the importance of assuring the unhin\u00ad dered passage of venture capital into new enterprises, while at the same time attempt\u00ad ing to contain excessive speculation, not only the SEC, but the self-regulatory bodies, associations \u00b7and state authorities are faced with a dilemma for which there seems to be no easy or ready solution. It is with this in mind that I am appeal\u00ad ing to you as individuals with an obvious interest in the outcome of this matter to assist your regulatory organizations in de\u00ad termining and implementing meaningful steps which can appropriately be taken to avoid another serious market break. Your comments and suggestions in this area are not only welcome at the Commission, but I assure you that we earnestly solicit them. Closely aligned, and quite likely as a di\u00ad rect result of today's excessive speculation boom, ls the current back office problem. A collateral aspect of that situation which I want to touch upon first is the failure of a great number of firms to carry out properly their supervisory functions regarding the handling of customer accounts. The Com\u00ad mission, in its opinions, has repeatedly em\u00ad phasized the importance of a broker-dealer's duty to carry out its responsiblllty to super\u00ad vise adequately and has taken appropriate action against both the member and its su\u00ad pervisory personnel for the neglect of such responsibility. In a recent release (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8404, dated Sep\u00ad tember 11, 1968) , the Commission cautioned that effective regulatory action w1ll be con-4273 tinued against firms and individuals who fall to comply with proper supervisory proce\u00ad dures. Sadly enough, the Commission has found in a great number of instances that, if procedures established by brokerage firms designed to deal with this problem had been properly implemented, there would not have been an opportunity for the violations found to have occurred. As you know, the mini\u00ad mum requirements of adequate supervision are set forth in rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Deal\u00ad ers, Inc. The New York Stock Exchange and the NASD have also published guidelines de\u00ad scribing procedures widely accepted as rep\u00ad resenting sound supervisory practices. Passing now to the subject of back office problems, I must begin by saying that it is, indeed, difficult to find words which will adequately convey my concern. Warnings are received at the Commission almost dally from knowledgeable people in the industry expressing their concern and the need to take immediate and appropriate steps. Many see the \"falls\" situation crippling market liquidity and, coupled with some political or economic event, pre<!lpitating a run on brokerage firms by customers for cash or certificates. If, as a result, any major firm is then forced to suspend or liquidate, they fear a general chain reaction among other firms will follow, which could seriously threaten our whole economy. Au analysis of the situation discloses that the current back office problem, resulting primarily from the unpreparedness of firms to handle the sales volume long sought, stems from one or more of the following contributory factors: 1. inefficient or inadequate back office pro\u00ad cedures; 2. insufficient number of back office per\u00ad sonnel; 3. failures of delivery from other broker\u00ad dealers; 4. delays in transfers by the issuer, regis\u00ad trar or transfer agent; and/or 5. obsolete or inadequate central clearing facilities. The foregoing not only exposes a brokerage firm to possible substantial losses in the event of a sharp break in market prices, but, among other things, hampers the prompt determination of net capital compltance and, in the absence of accurate and current books and records, may result in improper exten\u00ad sions of credit. Part of the difficulty in attempting to deal with the back office problem has been the mental attitude of some managements and \"front office personnel.\" In many instances the back office operation is merely consid\u00ad ered a non-profit-making appendage whicn must somehow be tolerated. Far too often brokerage firms attempt to economize on capital items and/or personnel for this as\u00ad pect of their business, while increasing ex\u00ad penditures in those areas which directly relate to sales promotion, thereby aggravat\u00ad ing what may already be a serious problem. The irony is that, while the securities in\u00ad dustry today is experiencing a prosperity it has seldom before enjoyed, some sizable brokerage firms have found it necessary to curtail business and even suspend or liqui\u00ad date operations simply because of their un\u00ad preparedness to handle this prosperity. This ls, indeed, a unique situation. Assuming that the regulatory organiza\u00ad tions have been able to pinpoint the major problem areas, it then becomes a question as to whether appropriate solutions can be developed. At the expense of other important enforcement activities, the Commission, 1n conjunction with the exchanges and the NASD, has directed its sta1f to conduct spe\u00ad cial Inspections of brokerage firms 1n order to ascertain the extent to which such ftrms are carrying out their responsibllttles in the 4274 area of back office compliance. In conneetlon therewith, the Commission has stated that it would continue to take prompt enforcement action against individual firms and per\u00ad sons where there had not been full compli\u00ad ance with our applicable rules and regula\u00ad tions. Cooperative enforcement in areas of concern, such as examinations for possible violations of net capiltal rules or delin\u00ad quencies in properly maintaining books and records, has been improved. Information\u00ad gathertng has been ctepped up to cope with present problems, as well as to assist 1n future planning. Recenrt; self-regulatory measures which have been implemented by the major ex\u00ad changes include: 1. amendment of the mandatory buy-in rule to provide for the closing out of con\u00ad tracts which are still open 30 days after settlement date; 2. adoption of mandatory monthly \"fall\" reports for the purpose of ta.king corrective action; 3. shortening of weekly tra.d1ng hours by Wesdnesday closings; 4. revision of handling procedures with re\u00ad spect to questioned trades to expedite their resolution; and 5. prohibition from ma.king long sales for a customer unless assurance can be obtained that the securities being sold will be de\u00ad livered promptly. In addition, automation programs in the area of exchange clearance and delivery sys\u00ad tems are apparently beginning to show re\u00ad sults. The Central Certificate Service, inau\u00ad gurated in late June, is currently providing computerized delivery for 362 stocks. Re\u00ad cently, member firms doing an over-the\u00ad counter business in the New York City area have been directed to join the National Over\u00ad the-Counter Clearing Corporation, or to clear their over-the-counter transactions with an NOTC member. It is expected that further automation of procedures will lead to addi\u00ad tional efficiencies in both internal transac\u00ad tions within firms and among the exchanges and such entities. Other regulatory measures which have either been put into effect or have at one time or another been discussed by the ex\u00ad changes, the NASD and other self-regulatory organizations are: 1. cutbacks or a freeze on the number of daily customer orders that restricted firms can accept, or similar restrictions on new salesmen or branch offices, until their back office problem subsides; 2. cutbacks or a freeze on advertising or sales promotion by firms, which tend to in\u00ad crease sales volume while their back office problems multiply; 3. restriction of trading for fl.rm accounts, with appropriate exceptions; 4. further curtailment of trading hours in addition to Wednesday closings; and/or 5. the hiring of additional personnel by the self-regulatory bodies to assist firms with unusually serious back office problems. In some isolated instances, when restric\u00ad tions have been placed on firms as a tem\u00ad porary measure until their back office prob\u00ad lem has been alleviated, registered representatives have resigned to work for other firms. such restricted firms simply re\u00ad fuse to realize that it is less expensive to establish adequate and appropriate back office procedures, and hire necessary personnel to carry them out, than it is to suffer the loss of sales personnel, loss of customers' confidence and invite problems with the regulatory bodies. The Commission has also recently affirmed its position that it is a violation of the appli\u00ad cable anti-fraud rules for a broker-dealer to sell a security as principal for his own ac\u00ad count, or to purchase it as broker for any other person, if he ( 1) knows, or has reason to believe, that there will be difficulties in obtaining deliveries with respect to a par\u00ad ticular security because of delays in transfer or (2) because, in order to obtain the security EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS either for his own account or for a customer, it wm be necessary to purchase the security from another broker-dealer whose deliveries to him have not been prompt in accordance with traditional customs and usage of the trade. The Commission at the same time warned that it is a violation of the anti-fraud pro\u00ad visions for a broker-dealer to accept or execute any order for the purchase or sale of a security, or to induce or attempt to induce such purchase or sale if he does not have the personnel and facilities to enable him to ex\u00ad ecute promptly and consummate all of his securities transactions. To handle the other side of these problems, the Commission has now received comments with respect to proposed Exchange Act Rule lOb-14, which would make it unlawful for any issuer publicly offering any security, or which has any class of security outstanding, to offer or sell such security without provid\u00ad ing for adequate registrar and transfer fa\u00ad cilities. Notwithstanding the importance of the above measures, the rule as adopted by the major exchanges and as proposed by the Commission, which hopefully promises to be the most effective for minimizing the back office problem, is the modification of the \"fails to deliver rule.\" This amended rule now provides for deductions from a firm's net worth of from 10% to 30% on contract prices of \"fails to deliver,\" and combined with strict enforcement of the net capital rule and books and records requirements, it is anticipated that such action will have a highly salutary and significant effect on the present discouraging fails situation. Corresponding to the fails situation, com\u00ad plaints involving investor grievances commu\u00ad nicated to the Commission indicate a contin\u00ad uing substantial increase of problems ex\u00ad perienced by investors with respect to delays in receiving stock certificates, dividend checks, payments due from sale of securities, and others. Such complaints received during the year 1967 numbered between 720 and 786 per quarter. In 1968, however, complaint let\u00ad ters increased from 789 in the first quarter to 1,147 during the second quarter, and reached a record high of 1,401 during the third quarter of 1968. Gentlemen, that is more than 100 investor grievances a week. This does not, of course, represent those com\u00ad plaints never reported to the Commission. A very important element in all this, not even hinted at by the statistics, is the consump\u00ad tion of man hours at the Commission and in the industry by the mere processing of the complaints. In closing, I would like to say that I think we can all agree that it takes years to build investor confidence in our securities markets, and only months, or even days, to destroy it. Unquestionably, the securities business is one of the great and vita.I industries of our country, and is respected throughout the entire world. It would most certainly, there\u00ad faire, be one of the bitterest ironies if that industry strangled on the effects of its own affluence. You gentlemen and your colleagues must see to it that this catastrophe does not occur. MRS. MARGARET MOORE, MISS MYRTIE BARKER, AND MR.

Mr. Speaker, on this occasion when we are celebrating the 125th anniversary of the birth of Michael Munkacsy, 1844-1900, Hungary's most prominent painter in the 19th cen\u00ad tury, whose personal contacts with nu\u00ad merous art collectors, cultural and civic leaders in this country made him, at that time, the most respected and most pop\u00ad ular foreign artist known to the Amer\u00ad ican public, we are glad to recall these memories of the past and to revive our dedication to those values which were served by Munkacsy all of his life. Because he was not only a great master of his artistic craft, but also a man of high principles and warm humanitarian feelings toward the poor, the humble, and the underprivileged. This example of Michael Munkacsy who in the course of three decades managed to establish him\u00ad self not only as one of the most out\u00ad standing representatives of the arts in the last century, but also as one of the most inspiring talents of his period whose company and friendship were treasured by many of the leading per\u00ad sonalities in all walks of life in Europe, should give for many among us a yard\u00ad stick in our own times when we try so hard to find the proper balance between power and compassion, wealth and social responsibility, religious faith and the realities of a modern world order. Before he reached the shores of the New World for a visit in November 1886, where, by that time already scores of his wonderful works adorned the public and private collections, Munkacsy's career included his phenomenal rise from the lowly status of a carpent;er's apprentice to the celebrated artist of Paris where he won two gold medals at the Salon in Paris-in 1870 and 1878. His greatest achievements were reached, however, through the tremendous success of his Biblical canvases, \"Christ Before Pilate,\" 1881, and \"Christ on Calvary,\" 1884. These works about which thousands of essays and articles were published in the European press before they became the property of John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, were viewed by millions of Americans while on tour in the United States and ever since. The message of these unique works of art is still the same as in those times-compassion toward the human being in his own misery. It appears to be :fitting t.o recall the impressions of the foremost art critics and correspondents of those times who convey to us the reception of Munkacsy's works in Europe. The London Times wrote on Janu\u00ad ary 24, 1884, concerning \"Christ on Calvary\": This picture ls certainly one of the most perfect which have been produced for many a year, combinlng all the majesty of the classic schools With the modern and per\u00ad sonal stamp that marks it of the 19th cen\u00ad tury. When one gazes on this picture and 4275 hears MunkAcsy speak, one reallzes the feel\u00ad ings which the contemporaries of Rubens, Murillo or Veronese must have experienced when they conversed With those grea.t masters who were destined to be handed down to the admiration of posterity. This \"unbelievable\" attitude of the contemporary English-and general European-society toward Munkacsy's powerful art was tellingly commented upon in our own New York Times on March 16, 1885: The \"Calvary\" of today over which not only the world of art but the world of fashion, of thought, and of religion ts at present wondering, is indeed a marvelous picture. Taking all things into consideration, it 1s a strange subject to offer 1n this century of unbelief, of skepticism, and of scoffing. Who has time now to think of the Man of Sorrows? What artist living in Christian England ever dares to offer such scenes to the critical public, and who could imagine such a subject coming from a Paris studio, where even the last rags and shreds of re\u00ad ligion are cast scornfully to the winds? This high degree of personal integrity and \"daring\" made Munkacsy one of the guiding stars in the artists' world of the 19th century, aiding also the man of our own times to decipher the true message of those complex and meaningful periods of human history. It is a source of satisfaction for the citizens of Chicago that three valuable works by Michael Munkacsy were added to the collections of P. C. Hanford and Potter Palmer, two art collectors of last\u00ad ing memory, underlining the validity of the statement about the great Hungarian painter, according to which \"Munkacsy was born and raised in Hungary, became famous in France, and his works found their first homeland in the United states.'' NEW BUILDING HONORS \"l\\tffi,. KAISER EMPLOYEE\" HON. GEORGE P. MILLER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, a half century ago, Alonzo Ben\u00ad ton Ordway and Henry J. Kaiser were just a couple of \"construction sti:tfs\" run\u00ad ning around the West looking for proj\u00ad ects. I have personally known A. B. Ordway for many years. He was the first em\u00ad ployee hired by Henry J. Kaiser and today, 57 years later, he is still active as vice president of Kaiser Industries Corp. He is 81 years old. Early in February, Edgar F. Kaiser an\u00ad nounced that a new 28-story office build\u00ad ing, now under construction at the Oak\u00ad land, Calif., headquarters of the world\u00ad wide Kaiser family of industries, will be known as the Ordway Building. The present high-rise headquarters building becomes Kaiser Building, and the name Kaiser Center will be applied to the whole Kaiser complex. In remarks made at a banquet honoring Ordway, Edgar Kaiser pointed out that \"Ord\" is a living monument to the excit\u00ad ing history of the Kaiser organization. The late Mr. Henry J. Kaiser once paid 4276 a rather endearing though unusual trib\u00ad ute to \"Ord\" when he said of him- He never agrees with me on anything. He's invaluable. Let each of us- Mr. Kaiser said in his address to some 300 Kaiser executives and their wives\u00ad dedica te ourselves to being the kind of org;\u00ad niza tion that wlll attract and hold the Ord\u00ad ways of the future. Let us remember that if we do not attract vigorous, sometimes con\u00ad troversial, youth into our offices and plants then everything that A. B. Ordway stands for is in jeopardy. \"Ord\" typifies the pioneering charac\u00ad teristics that helped build this country, but equally important, as with Kaiser employees, he possesses that rare quality of human understanding and deep in\u00ad terest in helping people. This tribute to a Kaiser employee who helped build the modern West was re\u00ad ported in the Oakland Tribune. I feel it altogether fitting and proper that this man and his work be recognized by the Congress. Under unanimous consent I submit this article for inclusion in the CONGRES\u00ad SIONAL RECORD, as follows: {From the Oakland Tribune, Feb. 16, 1969) (By Gene Ayres) One day about 40 years ago, the late Henry J. Ka.Iser and A. B. Ordway were fighting each other in the back seat of a car speeding across Cuba. Saturday night, Ordway stood amid a host -Of friends and well-wishers at a Kaiser Cen\u00ad ter banquet, an event oftlcially observing the naming of a new Kaiser project, a 28-story building. It will be called the Ordway building and-along with the present towering struc\u00ad ture-will house the world headquarters of the far-flung Kaiser industrial empire. Due to a slight swell in the ground the Ordway building will be 13 feet taller than the 390-foot height of the present Kaiser building. This is no cause for joy to Ordway because the old building is his baby. He was project manager on it at an age when many men spend their time huddled under a shawl. \"Mr. Kaiser Employee\" ls the way Ordway ls described by Edgar, present chief of Kaiser\u00ad dom and son of the late patriarch. It was Edgar who was driving the car that day in Cuba, while his father and Ordway wrestled. That fight began, Ordway recalled the other day because \"H.J. had said some\u00ad thing that reflected on my loyalty.\" Kaiser made short work of him, Ordway remembers. But their teamwork apparently was unimpaired and Kaiser's firm finished a $20 million, 200-mile Cuba paving project with typical dispatch. Ordway, having settled any doubts about his loyalty, went on in subsequent years to head 8 or 10 of \"H.J.'s\" burgeoning compa\u00ad nies and serve as a director of that many more. However, since he now is only the vice president of the parent Kaiser Industries Corp. and a director of the Kaiser Founda\u00ad tion Health Plan and hospitals, it is appar\u00ad ent that he considers himself practically re\u00ad tired although he won't admit it. Asked when he intends to formally retire, he snaps back, \"Never!\" When the mammoth Kaiser complex filed its written policy of compulsory retirement at 65 with the U.S. Treasury Department a few years ago, it speclftcally exempted Henry J. Kaiser and A. B. Ordway. Ordway will be 82 in August and is the senior Kaiser employe, rounding out his 57th year. On a sunny day, he has the blue, ce1Ung-EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS length drapes of his 28th floor oftlce close out the sun-and the stunning Lake Merritt view-because he has eye trouble. Impeccably dressed, white hair thinning, Ordway is an institution within an institu\u00ad tion. His conversation is to the point, some\u00ad times blunt With some of those short words learned when he and H.J. were \"construc\u00ad tion stiffs\" years a.go. He uses the initials A.B., because \"Alonzo Benton Ordway is too long if you write a check and I must have written a million of ,em.\" He still cares about appearance and shoos photographers away from his profile \"Jimmy Durante and I a.re having a contest,\" he ex\u00ad plains. In the oftlcially sanctioned Kaiser lore, he is known as \"Ord.\" But nine-tenths of the people he meets on his jaunty tours of the building call him \"Mr. Ordway.\" A native Iowan, Ordway joined Kaiser as foreman of a road-paving project in British Columbia. in 1912, shortly r..fter he graduated with a degree in civil engineering from the -\u00ad University of Wisconsin. What was once just Kaiser and Ordway has grown into a colossus with $2 billion in as\u00ad sets. In those early days, \"We traveled together, slept in the same room and our arguments knocked down the walls,\" Ordway recalls. Shortly before Kaiser's death on Aug. 25, 1967, in Hawaii, Ordway had a premonition and flew over for three days of hashing over old times with the boss. \"I told him, 'I won't talk one word of busi\u00ad ness.' I got a few belly laughs out of him.\" \"Mr. Kaiser Employee\" admits it was not only fun to work for Kaiser but also was prof\u00ad itable. He once bought Kaiser stock for 6 cents a share. Kaiser bigwigs a few years back gave Ord\u00ad way a gold key to Kaiser Center \"which 1s supposed to open every door in the place.\" As he goes through the building, he can show a visitor the different colors of ceilings and recall how the architect tried to convince the elder Kaiser that they all should be eggshell white. Ordway likes to point to Kaiser products used in the construction of Kaiser Center, wherever possible. This was done at the in\u00ad sistence of the elder Kaiser. Once, in planning the 393-seat auditor\u00ad ium, the architect noted a tricky reverse twist in the handra111ng and strongly argued that wood should be used. Only one outfit makes wood, as the poet Joyce Kilmer pointed out, and it isn't Kaiser. The handrails, reverse twist and all, are of Kaiser aluminum. Edgar Kaiser observed Saturday night: \"We are blessed to have an Ord for whom we can name our new building. It would have been pretty cold to name it Kaiser Cen\u00ad ter No. 2, or Kaiser Center Annex.\" There may even be another gold key that will open \"every door\" in the new Ordway Building. With that enticing hole in the ground just across 21st Street, and all that concrete to be poured and steel to be hung, would you retire, if you were A. B. Ordway? Neither will he. THE LATE SENATORE. L. BARTLETT MADE HONORARY CITIZEN OF WASHINGTON STATE HON. THOMAS M. PELLY OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. PELLY. Mr. Speaker, last Decem\u00ad ber I received a great shock when I read that Senator Bob Bartlett had passed February 24, 1969 away after a heart operation. This sad item of news was a matter of personal regret and sorrow after my 16 years of association with Bob here in the Con\u00ad gress. I admired and appreciated his lovable character. And, too, I respected his unusual legislative ability. Indeed, I have never known any Member of the House or Senate who was more able in this respect. Based on my own experience and close observation it was his tenacity, team\u00ad work, and persuasive talent that over\u00ad came the substantial reservations in Con\u00ad gress to Alaska statehood. Likewise, after statehood, it was Bob's work which, in a large measure, justified the arguments he had used in favor or statehood. He played a major role in assuring the suc\u00ad cess of the infant, struggling State he had helped create. Mr. Speaker, Bob Bartlett will be re\u00ad membered as the guiding genius in pas\u00ad sage of the enabling act under which Alaska became a State. On the other hand his interests and accomplishments were never limited to his own State. We in my home State of Washington and in Seattle recognized him as a friend and he was nationally recognized espe\u00ad cially for his legislative contributions-\u00ad especially, of course, to the maritime ancl fishing industries which came under the jurisdiction of his congressional commit\u00ad tees. The Nation as a whole benefited from his efforts and he will be sorely missed for in many ways he was a unique figure in the political life of his country. Mr. Speaker, in tribute to the life and service of Bob Bartlett and because of the widespread respect and admiration in which he was held in Alaska's sister State of Washington at my suggestion posthumously he has been named an honorary citizen of my State. Mr. Speaker, I join with my col\u00ad leagues in paying tribute to the life and service of Bob Bartlett--a great Ameri\u00ad can, and now posthumously an honorary citizen of Washington State. LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY HON. WILLIAM T. MURPHY OF ILLINOIS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, February 19, 1969 Mr. MURPHY of Dlinois. Mr. Speaker. toward the end of World War I and soon after the overthrow of the czarist regime in Russia, Lithuanians were among the first of innumerable nationality groups to proclaim their national independence. That historic event of 51 years ago marked the culmination of their long\u00ad cherished dream, the regaining of their freedom, ushering ln a new era for them. The Lithuanian people had lost their independence in the 18th century and were brought under Russia's autocratic czarist regime, but their real suffering under that regime daites late in that cen\u00ad tury when Lithuania became part of Rus\u00ad sia's vast empire. Under such foreign domination they suffered much both ma\u00ad terially and physically, but all their misery and misfortunes left them splrlt\u00ad ually unscathed. February 24, 1969 The unwieldly and callous government of the czars could not stamp out Lith\u00ad uanian national feelings; foreign auto\u00ad crats could not eliminate the Lithuanian spirit of freedom and independence. Oourageously and stoutly these few mil\u00ad lion people held their own against the overwhelming power of the czars, and repeatedly defied Russian authorities whenever attempts were made to Rus\u00ad sianize them. The people were ready to sacri:flce their all wordly possessions and, if necessary, submit to exile and imprisonment, but they were unwilling to give up their be\u00ad liefs and their national ideals. They clung to these tenaciously and steadfastly, and when the time came in 1918 to as\u00ad sert their freedom, they seized upon the occasion and proclaimed the birth of the Lithuanian Republic on February 24 of that year. Thenceforth for several anxious years the people went through great difficulties. The war-ravaged country had to be re\u00ad built, the hungry had to be fed, the needy had to be cared for, and the govern\u00ad mental machinery just instituted had to be put into efficient working order. Per\u00ad haps the most important and crucial of all was the organization of the country's defense forces for the maintenance of its newly won independence. In time, how\u00ad ever, these difficulties were overcome, many problems were solved, and Lithu\u00ad ania's independence safeguarded. In due time Lithuania become a member of the League of Nations, and played her part admirably well in that world organiza\u00ad tion. In the course of two decades, during the interwar years, Lithuania was re\u00ad garded a prosperous and progressive state. Unfortunately this happy situation did not last long; Lithuania's powerful, greedy, and aggressive neighbors did not want it to last. Then Lithuania's deadliest foe, the Soviet Government, saw to it that democratic Lithuania did not re\u00ad main free and independent. Catastrophic events that led to the last war fore\u00ad shadowed Lithuania's doom. Early in 1940, under an outrageously flimsy pre\u00ad text, Stalin's forces invaded and oc\u00ad cupied the country, and in July of that year it was annexed to the Soviet Union. During the war the Lithuanian people suffered under both the Soviet regime and under the Nazis. When the Soviets were in occupation of the country hun\u00ad dreds of thousands of Lithuanians were uprooted from their homes and exiled to distant parts of the Soviet Union, while those allowed to remain home were forced to work as slaves for their Com\u00ad munist overlords. Then the country was taken over by the Nazis, but this change of masters did not change the lot of the Lithuanian people. Finally, toward the end of war the Communists returned once more, this time with more fury and ferocity. Since then the fate of Lithuania has been in the hands of the men in the Kremlin. Today's Lithuania is one of the Soviet Union's constituent republics where some 3,000,000 live and work under their Com\u00ad munist taskmasters. All their worldly possessions are owned and operated by the state. There they are deprived of nearly all forms of freedom, and since they are practically sealed off from the EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS free world, we hear little of their un\u00ad enviable lot. However, even under such unbearable conditions the Luthuanian people have not given up their traditional and national ideals for freedom; they cherish the hope that someday they will cast off the Communist tyranny and re\u00ad gain their freedom. On the occasion of observance of their independence day I join them and fervently hope that they attain their national goal and be allowed to live in peace in their historic homeland AMERICANS OF ESTONIAN DESCENT MARK ANNIVERSARY OF INDE\u00ad PENDENCE HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM OF NEBRASKA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, Americans of Estonian descent are today marking the 5lst anniversary of inde\u00ad pendence of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia and the other Baltic States, Latvia and Lithuania, lost their inde\u00ad pendence after the outbreak of World War II. The Baltic States became victims of the conspiracy of the totalitarian im\u00ad perialistic powers, Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. Estonia and the other nations were forcibly incorporated into the U .S.S.R. The Soviet Union's assault against its Baltic neighbors was the first step west\u00ad ward in a ruthless march against Europe. The beginning of today's international tensions and threats to peace may thus be found in the Soviet aggression against Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1940. Mr. Speaker, we cannot rest well until Estonia and all other nations which have been dominated by the Communist con\u00ad spiracy, are again free. FOR CONSOLIDATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT HON. BERTRAM L. PODELL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. PODELL. Mr. Speaker, on Satur\u00ad day, December 14, 1968, the President's National Commission on Urban Problems made public a report in which the Com\u00ad mission urged a program of Federal fiscal action to encourage consolidation of local governments. I want to commend this report to the special attention of our colleagues because its recommendations present an effective and constructive approach that is necessary to revitalize our forms of local government. Public interest in local government consolidation has become more intense in recent years. Before I was elected to the House in February 1968, I served as chairman of the New York State Assem\u00ad bly Committee on Local Finance. In that capacity I initiated a series of studies into the operations of local government 4277 in the State of New York. Based on those studies, I reached a conclusion similar to that advanced by the President's Na\u00ad tional Commission on Urban Problems\u00ad that consolidation of local governments was imperative in order to provide our people with decent, effective, and efficient public services. Parallel studies have been going for\u00ad ward in other States. At the Federal level the National Committee on Intergovern\u00ad n1ental Relations has done a monumental job in exploring and in pointing to areas f-Or constructive intergovernmental co\u00ad operation at the local level. In many instances local governments themselves have initiated avenues for joint and cooperative activities to provide improved services at lower costs to their residents and to their commercial and industrial enterprises. Across the border in Canada a metro form of government has been established in the Toronto area to coordinate the planning and administrative activities of a region, where the multiplicity of local government units had heretofore made impossible the performance of such functions in a constructive and efficient manner. In 1966 the Committee on Economic Development completed a study of local governments and reported that spending by local governments exceeded the total Federal budget except for national de\u00ad fense expenditures. This committee con\u00ad cluded that the costs, operations, and performance of local governments have become the most significant national do\u00ad mestic problem. The archaic structure of local governments amply justifies this conclusion of the committee. The President's National Commission on Urban Problems found- The problems of local government are greatly magnified because each political sub\u00ad division Within the fragmented metropolis relying primarily on the local property tax tends to lean inordinately on this splintered zoning power to boost its tax base. As a result, the Commission concluded that the present indiscriminate distribu\u00ad tion of zoning authority leads to incom\u00ad patible uses along municipal borders, duplication of public facilit~es and at\u00ad tempted exclusion of regional facilities. The :findings of the Commission with respect to zoning, housing, and land use apply with equal force to other local serv\u00ad ices. For example, within a single county, police protection is frequently proceeded by a welter of police forces, lacking crime laboratories, modern communications systems and other equipment and facil\u00ad ities essential to modern, scientific crime detection. Seepage of sewage, detergents, and other contaminants from cesspools and septic tanks jeopardize the water re\u00ad sources of an adjoining area. Garbage disposal districts compete with each for dumping areas in an era of shrinking land availability. The most obvious thing about the pat\u00ad tern of local government is simply that it doesn't make sense. In New York State, for example, we have approximately 9,- 000 units of local government: counties, towns, villages, and specials districts for water, garbage disposal, fire protection, and for a host of other local public serv\u00ad ices. 4278 Concern with the forms of local gov\u00ad ernment in our State is not of recent origin. In 1930, Gov. Franklin D. Roose\u00ad velt asserted the local governments in New York State were blessed with more tax collectors than warriors engaged in the Battle of Marathon. Since then a number of legislative committees and State commissions con\u00ad ducted studies and surveys of local gov\u00ad ernment functions and performance and have uniformly concluded that the need for overhauling, modernizing, and streamlining local governments was in\u00ad deed a pressing one. Despite these persuasive appeals for restructuring our forms of local govern\u00ad ment, relatively little has been accom\u00ad plished. County, city, town, and village boundaries and organizations remain substantially unchanged from the man\u00ad ner in which they were originally laid out more than 150 years ago. Resistance to change is inevitable. Un\u00ad derstandably, many fear that the curse of bigness may prove worse than the price of smallness. Many regard small units of government with nostalgic af\u00ad fection and look upon the right to elect a highway supervisor as a continuation of the democratic spirit of town govern\u00ad ment as it existed during the colonial period. Others see in the small govern\u00ad ment units a bulwark against the evils of a big-city political machine. Nonetheless, there is change in the wind. The stimulus for change was gen\u00ad erated principally by the historic and unending population movement since World War II from our cities into our villages and towns, a movement which upset the balance wheels of local gov\u00ad ernment. Competition developed for tap\u00ad ping limited water resources to meet the needs not only of the increased popula\u00ad tion but also of commerce and industry which necessarily followed the people. Subdivision and construction of split\u00ad level ranch homes on acreage previously used as a garbage dump sent local officials scurrying for new acreage for garbage disposal purposes and, as land disap\u00ad peared, they inevitably turned to the public incinerator with concomitant problems of a bond issue for construc\u00ad tion of the incinerator, and taxes for interest and principal on the bonds and for maintenance and operation of a facility. To meet the emerging needs. special\u00ad use districts were created-water dis\u00ad tricts, sewer districts, fire districts and fire protection districts, street lighting districts, park districts, and in Na.5sau County an elevator district. As a result, New York State has today almost 9,000 units of local government, selling bonds, levying taxes, hiring personnel, pur\u00ad chasing supplies, and performing various governmental functions. Under the circumstances it was inevi\u00ad table that the cost of local government should mount, as it has, to astronomical figures, and a search for improved meth\u00ad ods of performing the local government function was stimulated. The recommendation of the Presi\u00ad dent's National Commission on Urban Affairs for Federal fiscal aid to encourage EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS consolidation of local government is a step in the right direction. I trust that the reports of the Commission will serve a function more useful than gathering dust on library shelves. There is an ur\u00ad gent need to meet the challenge of cre\u00ad ating rational forms of local govern\u00ad ment-a challenge that we dare not long forget. ALLISON DIVISION OF GENERAL MOTORS, HOOSIER-BASED INDUS\u00ad TRY, MAKES MAJOR, SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO APOLLO 8 FLIGHT HON. WILLIAM G. BRAY OF INDIANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BRAY. Mr. Speaker, Allison Divi\u00ad sion of General Motors is making a sig\u00ad nificant contribution to the Apollo moon mission program. High-strength tita\u00ad nium tanks made by Hoosiers contain the propellant for the service module that carries astronauts into moon orbit, and for the lunar module that later this year will take two astronauts from lunar orbit down to the surface of the moon. Allison tanks were aboard the recent successful Apollo 8 flight to the moon. They carried the propellant that kept the spacecraft on course to the moon, put it into lunar orbit and boosted it free of orbit for re\u00ad turn to earth. Similar tanks were aboard the earlier and equally successful Apollo 7 earth-orbiting flight. Allison tanks will be aboard the Apollo 9 service module when it is launched February 28 on an earth-orbiting flight to test the func\u00ad tioning of the lunar landing module that will descend to the moon surface on a later flight. ELEMENTARY LESSON ON THE ARMED FORCES HON. BENJAMIN S. ROSENTHAL OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. ROSENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, Ed\u00ad ward P. Morgan's article \"Elementary Lesson on the Armed Forces\" vividly documents the ever-escalating demands of the military for increased o'UUays\u00ad and its incredible capability to devour funds. The Defense Establishment regards it\u00ad self as omniscient, and is constantly try\u00ad ing to make itself omnipresent. The de\u00ad mands of the military for new funding can never be met, for af1ter one program is funded, two more appear declared by its sponsors to be equally urgent. Mr. Morgan is asking the right ques\u00ad tions----do we need a military \"presence\" in 68 foreign countries? Do we need 30,- 000 military men in Latin America? Can we afford half our national budget de\u00ad voted to military items while children starve and cities burn at home? His article follows: February 24, 1969 [From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Feb. 15, 1969] ELEMENTARY LESSON ON THE ARMED FORCES (By Edward P. Morgan) While Senator Symington tools up his new ad hoc subcommittee to examine what in\u00ad fluence our international military commit\u00ad ments may have on U.S. foreign policy, there is time for the rest of us to do some cram\u00ad ming on the subject. Attention class! Q. How big are the U.S. armed forces? A. 3,407,557 men (and some women) by official mid-January Pentagon figures. Q. Where are they? A. Nearly half, or 1% million, are serving abroad. Q. Mainly involved, one way or another, in Vietnam? A. Heavens no! Less than half. We've only 532,500 troops in Vietnam, plus, of course, support from 35,700 Seventh Fleet personnel offshore; 45,000 on Thailand bases; 40,000 on Okinawa. Q. Does that about do it for Asia? A. By no means. We still have 55,000 Gis patrolling the truce in Korea. And 40,000 in Japan proper. And 30,000 in the Philippines. Part of the latter two totals, of course, re\u00ad flects a rear-guard involvement in Vietnam. Q. Could we possibly be overmanned somewhere? A. You took the words right out of some influential legislators' mouths. We still maintain in Japan, by official count, 48 \"major military installations,\"-30 for AJ:m.y, 11 for Navy, 7 for Air Force. One im\u00ad portant House member argues we can safely reduce U.S. personnel there by one-third, maybe even two-thirds. Q. What about the Philippines? A. One survey, never released, reportedly recommends a cutback to one island base. We now operate a dozen installations there, including Clark Field, a huge base. Q. But World War II is a quarter of a cen\u00ad tury behind us. Don't tell me the fickle winds of the Cold War still have us scattered from hell to breakfast over the rest of the globe. A. The U.S. today maintains a \"military presence\" in at least 68 foreign countries. These range from MAAGS--mili tary assist\u00ad ance advisory groups (four men in Tunisia, 116 in Brazil)-to fullblown bases. Q. Speaking of bases, how many do we have abroad? A. In Pentagonese, \"major military instal\u00ad lations or activities outside the U.S.\" total 400. One Senator, who should know, says the exact figure is 432. Q. Great Scott! What have we missed? A. Fasten your seatbelt for just a sample globe-girdling rollcall: Ethiopia ( 1) ; Libya (1); Greece (2); Spain (8); Iceland (1); Brit\u00ad ish West Indies, Bermuda and the Bahamas (7); Cuba (5) au embraced by Guantanamo naval base; Panama Canal Zone (13); Tai\u00ad wan (3); Pakistan (1); Turkey (3); Berlin and West Germany (146); United Kingdom (12). Q. Wow! A. Some offir.ial figures are deceptive or classified. We have 320,000 men in western Europe and Britain, some 21,000 aboard the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. But many of the land-based military have wives and children with them, on a three-year hitch. One Capitol source, for example, reckons that dependents bring the total American presence in Japan to 83,000. For \"the Middle East and Africa\" the Pen\u00ad tagon's force list is 10,000. Actually we may have at least 30,000 men in alld. out of uni\u00ad form in Ethiopia, Turkey and Iran, some on what might be called dainty assignments. The latest official count of U.S. military in Latin America is 30,000, though that in\u00ad cludes nearly a score of MAAGS. And about 15,000 Axmy men in Panama. Q. Still, all that manpower must be a February 24, 1969 bargain; it's the fancy weapons that really cost, right? A. Not so fast. Depending on how you fig\u00ad ure, the care and feeding of nearly 3~ mil\u00ad lion men (not to mention certain allowances for dependents on foreign station) may eat up nearly half the $81.5 billion national de\u00ad fense budget estimate for fiscal 1970. Actually for a truer cost of national defense, throw in nearly $6 billion as the estimated Veterans' Administration 1970 outlay for insurance, pensions, hospitalization, etc. And don't for\u00ad get the CIA, whose budget is secret but which at last reports was above half 9 bil\u00ad lion and presumably climbing. Then if you've a sliderule handy figure the appropriate share of all these items in the interest on the national debt. Q. But isn't protecting our national se\u00ad curity cheap at any price? A. How much of a bargain did the Pueblo incident buy us? Is paying higher prices for poorer weapons, as The Washington Post re\u00ad vealed the other day, a sound investment? Are we getting our military money's worth in Japan and Okinawa where recent anti\u00ad American demonstrations signal flashpoints of possibly worse trouble to come? \"Yank Go Home\" is rising with nationalism 1n Turkey and the Philippines too. Q. Gee, the Symington committee has its work cut out for it, right? A. Right. Our next assignment w1ll be to evaluate the ABM, if any. Class dismissed. MORE AID FOR THE HUNGRY IS NEEDED HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, in an edi\u00ad torial of February 24, the New York Times calls for an agricultural policy that is resPonsive to the needs of the poor. That the present Policy has failed in aiding the Poor has been established in the testimony before Senator Mc\u00ad GovERN's Select Senate Committee on Nutritional and Human Needs. It is en\u00ad couraging that this testimony has led the Secretary of Agriculture to provide free food stamps for those near starva\u00ad tion in South Carolina. But efforts can\u00ad not end there. The central problem is our entire agri\u00ad cultural policy. Eight times more money goes to subsidizing large farm operations than to improving the diets of the Poor. Furthermore, the refusal of the Agricul\u00ad tural Department to spend the money available for commodity distribution program lacks potential help for the poor. Such policies cannot be continued. The Agriculture Department must join other departments in their attempts to eliminate poverty. The new Secretary of Agriculture must recognize the true di\u00ad mensions of hunger in the United States and use his power to see that adequate resPQnses are formulated. The editorial follows: [From the New York Times, Feb. 24, 1969) THE HUNGRY ARE HEARD It is proving a bitter harvest. The effects of this nation's wrong-way agricultural poll\u00ad cies on millions of poor continue to be etched in testimony before Senator George McGovern's Select Committee on Nutritional and Human Needs. Medical experts report that nutritional diseases long though:t EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS abolished have reappeared. They have linked Irreversible mental retardation dietary de\u00ad ficiencies in the very young. The impact of this testimony has produced a few encouraging changes, but not nearly enough. The Senate has overridden its own Rules Committee to assure the investigating com\u00ad mittee adequate funding. The Secretary of Agriculture, Cll:fford M. Hardin, has worked out plans to provide free food stamps for those near starvation in Beaufort and Jasper Counties, S.C. Distressing aspects of the problem, how\u00ad ever, almost overshadow these positive de\u00ad velopments. The Agriculture Department remains virtually in contempt of court for not providing food or food stamps to the hungry in California. An examination of Its departmental budget for the current fiscal year reveals the cruel extent of the nation's twisted policies. The total outlay for farm Income stabili\u00ad zation programs comes to about $4.5 billion. whlle the total for surplus commodities and food stamps, the programs aiding the poor, comes to only $564 mllilon. Thus the na\u00ad tion spends about eight times as much propping up farm prices as it does helping the poor to receive adequate diets. Addi\u00ad tional funds go into the school lunch pro\u00ad gram, but surveys show this program often excludes the very poor, who need it most. Large farm operations receive fantastic subsidies, particularly in California. The J. G. Boswell Company in Kings County, Calif., for example, received more than $4 milllon in diversion payments In 1967. The Rancho San Antonio in Fresco County, Calif., re\u00ad ceived nearly $3 mlliion. Senator James East\u00ad land's plantation in Mississippi received well over $100,000. The Agriculture Department, while lavish\u00ad ing subsidies on large operators, refuses to spend the money made available for com\u00ad modity distribution programs. It turned $227 m1llion back to the Treasury last year. It even refuses, despite a court injunction, to pro\u00ad vide food or food stamps to the poor in sev\u00ad eral California counties. With assistance from the Office of Economic Opportunity, the poor in these counties have had to sue to win the benefits of programs designed for them. Similar suits have been brought in other states. Secretary Hardin, new to office, is hardly to blame for these wrong-way policies or for the widespread hunger in America. None\u00ad theless the responslb111ty ls on him to move vigorously to meet a problem that has now been so clearly exposed. The conscience of the country, having heard the voice of the hungry, demands action to answer that cry. AIRLINE YOUTH FARES HON. ARNOLD OLSEN OF MONTANA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. OLSEN. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to have more than 30 of our colleagues join last week in the introduction of a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that current child, youth, and military reduced air fares are consistent with the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. I am hopeful many more will join in support of this resolution, House Con\u00ad current Resolution 144. Several editors across the Nation have spoken out in support of continuing the youth fare on our airlines. As I con\u00ad tinue to receive editorial statements in 4279 this regard, I will insert them in the RECORD. Today I place the resolution and the following editorials and articles in the RECORD: Kent State, Ohio: \"Grounded.\" Kent State, Ohio: \"Standby Air May Be 'Up, Up and Away.'\" Villanova University: \"You Gonna Get Shot Down, Baby.'' CAB.\" St. Paul Pioneer Press: \"Keep Student Fares.'' H. CON. RES. 144 Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the current regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Board under which air carriers are permitted to grant reduced air fares to children, youth, and members of the armed forces of the United States are consistent with the intent and purposes of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and tends to promote adequate, economical, and effi\u00ad cient service by air carriers at reasonable charges, without unjust discriminations, un\u00ad due preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices. (From the Kent Stater, Feb. 20, 1969] GROUNDED? All half-fare stand-by airline tickets were scheduled to become null and void today. All special youth fare I.D. cards were to become worthless today. None of this has happened\u00ad YET. If Transcontinental Bus Systems, Inc., op\u00ad erators of Trailways, has its way, the skies may be just as friendly as before, except that they will be twice as expensive for the col\u00ad lege student. Several students at Princeton University have banded together to fight the threatened discontinuance of youth fares. They spoke with Arthur Present, examiner for the Civil Aeronautics Board (C.A.B.), who told them that he had ruled against the fares earlier this year because they violate section 404 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The act prohibits \"unreasonable\" discrimination in fares. He said that for discrimination In fares to exist, air passengers must get \"substan\u00ad tially similar\" service, yet be charged d11Ier\u00ad ent fares. The Stater disagrees with the examiner. We believe that students flying on half-fare tickets get \"substantially d11Ierent\" service, and in most cases that treatment is far below that received by full-fare coach passengers. Frequently, a student is \"bumped\" off a flight at one of the stops on a multi-stop flight. He is faced with hours of waiting for a flight during peak travel times, and some\u00ad times he never gets ia filghlt. Once up m the air, the half-fare passenger is told by the stewardess, \"I'm sorry, we don't have any extra meals on board for you, but you can have a Coke if you would like one.\" So the student sits closest to the roaring jet engine sipping his Coke. At least he is fly\u00ad ing. That ls what he paid for. The youth fare passenger can not fly dur\u00ad ing holiday periods. He is definitely re\u00ad garded as a \"lower caste\" passenger by the airlines. If this is not substantially different service, The Stater does not know what is. The Princeton committee has written, \"It is obvious to us that the charges of dis\u00ad crimination have been trumped up by the bus companies in an attempt to discourage young people from flying and to force them to travel by bus. This blatantly profit-mo\u00ad tivated act which totally disregards the gen\u00ad eral welfare of millions of young people can\u00ad not be permitted.\" The Stater agrees. If the bus companies really think half-fare, 4280 stand-by tickets attract students to the air\u00ad lines, why don't they institute a similar pro\u00ad gram on the long-haul city-to-city bus routes? The ultimate statement criticizing the dis\u00ad crimination ruling was made by U.S. Repre\u00ad sentative, Arnold Olsen (D. Mont.) recently. He said, \"I fail to see how permitting a young person to fly half-fare on a seat that would otherwise go empty discriminates against regular passengers.\" The C.A.B. will again be discussing the youth fares on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The board must be convinced that youth fares should be continued. They must be made aware that youth fare passengers do not receive the same service as full fare passengers. They must be shown that students across the nation are upset. [From the Kent Stater, Feb. 13, 1969] STANDBY Am FARES MAY BE \"UP, UP AND AWAY\" (By Saul Daniels) Stand-by half-fare and reserved seat two\u00ad third fare airline tickets for the 12 to 21 age bracket may soon go the way of the Ford Trimotor aircraft if the Civil Aeronautics Board upholds its own decision banning them. Thomas V. Sheehan, representative of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) told The Stater that the original decision to cancel the fares, used extensively by college stu\u00ad dents, was made by the Board on January 21. \"The Board, six days later, on its own motion, which was rather unusual, decided that it would grant review,\" he said and ordered the Board examiners' previous de\u00ad cision suspended indefinitely. The major long distance bus company maintained that the special youth fares were \"unjustly discriminatory.\" The Board ex\u00ad aminer ruled in favor of Trailways but later the CAB decided to reconsider. The date of the new hearing has not yet been set. According to Sheehan, the entire situation began two years ago when Trailways filed its first complaint . The CAB sustained the youth fares and rejected the complaints. However, Trailways appealed the decision to the Fifth Federal Circuit Court of Ap\u00ad peals which reversed the Board's decision. The Court \"remanded the question of youth fares to the Board for further pro\u00ad ceedings,\" Sheehan told The Stater. \"At that time Trailways also challenged the military furlough fares, but the Court found that the furlough fares were properly handled by the Board,'' he continued. Upon re-examination the Board hearing examiner found the youth fares unjustly discriminatory, Sheehan said. The decision for review came six days later, and execution of the Boards' cancellation ruling, which was to go into effect within 30 days, was up\u00ad held indefinitely. Rep. Arnold Olsen (D. Mont.) said that if the Board should uphold the cancellation order, it would \"encourage thousands of young people to resume the 11legal and dangerous practice of hitch hiking or to attempt long, exhausting automobile trips, frequently in unsafe vehicles.\" The congressman, in a letter to CAB Chair\u00ad man John H. Crooker said, \"I fail to see how permitting a young person to fly half fare on a seat that would otherwise go empty discriminates against regular passengers.\" He continued to say, \"The revenue loss result\u00ad ing from elimination of the existing regula\u00ad tions could mean increased fare for all pas\u00ad sengers, and that present youth fares con\u00ad tribute substantially to the cause of educa\u00ad tion. Continuing on subject of education Olsen said that the youth fare was \"an important factor in easing the travel burden of thou\u00ad sands of college students. Travel alone is a form of education. Thousands of young EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Americans-students and non-students\u00ad have been enabled by the youth fare to see much of their country. They have benefited from the current youth fare arrangement, and it has not been at the expense of full\u00ad fare passengers because space available seats are empty.\" CAB spokesman Sheehan said that it ls too late for students to present evidence to the Board or to appear before it, but if they wished, they could write letters to the Civil Aeronautics Board, 125 Connecticut Ave\u00ad nue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 2009. However, he warned, the Board has been so swamped with letters that it is virtually impossible to answer them. [From the Villanovan, Feb. 19, 1969) You GONNA GET SHOT DowN, BABY Another \"crumb\" from capitalism's cornu\u00ad copia. will be yanked from students' mouths without even a small hassle. Airline officials are being pressured to change the special student rates policy on the grounds that it discriminates against adults and non-students. Those who are applying the pressure (we wouldn't be sur\u00ad prised if they liked to play with buses) are charging the airlines with unequal practices. We feel that the word \"equal\" is seman\u00ad tically problematic in this case. Equality must be also viewed from the student's posi\u00ad tion. A student's yearly income is not equal to that of a full time employee. The airlines' standby requirement for student discounts obviously does not display equal treatment among customers. The student discount helps bath airline and student. Its desuetude will result in empty seats and loss of profit for the air\u00ad lines. For the student this will not only mean an unnecessary hardship, but a real example of discriminatory treatment. [From the Cornell Daily Sun, Feb. 17, 1969) CALL A CAB We'll all be paying full fares for our air\u00ad plane trips if a decision by a Civil Aero\u00ad nautics Board examiner is not overturned by the full board. The examiner has ruled that airline youth fares constitute discrimination against adult, full-fare passengers and ought therefore to be abolished. As veterans of interminable airport vigils and last-second runway dashes, we value our mobility and object to the implication that an empty seat is somehow fairer to other passengers than is a college student. Others who feel the same way should con\u00ad tact the CAB or Rep. Arnold Olsen (D., Mont.), who is fighting the measure, or be prepared to cancel that impending spring vacation jaunt. [From the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press, Feb.13, 1969) KEEP STUDENT FARES Many American families will receive an unwarranted jolt in the pocketbook if the Civil Aeronautics Board upholds a finding by one of its examiners. CAB examiner Arthur Present has found that youth and family airline fares are \"un\u00ad justly discriminatory and should be can\u00ad celled.\" Public hearings on the question wlll be held within the next two months. Since 1966, chlldren aged 12 through 21 have been able to travel anywhere in the U.S. by plane, on a stand-by basis, at a 50 per cent reduction of fares, except at peak tramc times and seasons. Other special rates allow famlly reductions for husbands and. wives or children traveling together. The program has been a great boon to American youth and families and has resulted in in\u00ad creased business for the airlines, thus creat\u00ad ing a mutually happy situation. Youth fare traffic increased from 2,100,100 passengers in 1966 to 5,760,000 in 1968. Col-February 24, 1969 lege students and vacationing families have been the chief users of the special rate plans. The damper has come from a complaint filed with the CAB by a major group of bus companies. Instead of attempting to meet the airlines' competition, they demanded that such fare reductions be discontinued and alleged that the rates were \"unjustly discriminatory, unjust, unreasonable, un\u00ad fair competitive practices and otherwise un\u00ad lawful.\" The CAB refused to consider the complaint in 1966 but the bus companies went to court and their appeal finally reached the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Re\u00ad newal legal actions in the lower courts forced the CAB to review youth and family fares early this year and Present announced his findings after nine days of hearings. It would be most unseemly of the CAB to rule in the bus companies' favor and stifle legitimate competition. If the bargain rates are no longer allowed, a lot of American families will be robbed of the special work, study and travel privileges now granted by the airlines. DRAFT DEFERMENTS FOR POLICE HON. FRANK HORTON OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, police agencies and fire companies across the Nation, particularly those in the major metropolitan areas, are faced with a critical shortage of prospective man\u00ad power. In dealing with the law-enforcement personnel shortage problem, the Na\u00ad tional Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders made the following recom\u00ad mendation in its report: Because a basic problem in furnishing protection to the ghetto is the shortage of manpower, police departments should re\u00ad view existing deployment of field personnel to ensure the most efficient use of manpower ... communit ies may have to pay more for the entire community, as well as for the ghetto. There is no question that communi\u00ad ties will have to face this problem realis\u00ad tically. But we in Congress must face the need to help where we can. I am offering legislation today which would amend the Selective Service Act of 1967 to give full-time policemen, fire\u00ad men, and men in training for such jobs deferments from the military draft. Almost every major metropolitan police and :fire department in our land suffers from a. shortage of trained per\u00ad sonnel. A study of municipal police depart\u00ad ments conducted by the National League of Cities in the summer of 1965 indicated that 65.5 percent of the 284 responding departments were operating below authorized strength. Of the 98 departments operating at authorized strength, 79 indicated they really needed more men. If we oontinue to draft men away from police departments that are already understaffed we are undermining the ability of communities to afford protec\u00ad tion to their citizens at a time when this is most crucial. In the 90th Congress we acted to pro-February 24, 1969 vide substantial Federal funds for State and local law-enforcement assistance. This long overdue measure must be sup\u00ad plemented by legislation guaranteeing that the Federal Government will not dip into the already inadequate man\u00ad power pool available to law enforcement and fire protection. Police agencies and fire departments are finding recruiting increasingly dif\u00ad ficult. Both are thankless jobs, involving great danger and little compensation. To further complicate matters, a large number of police and firemen who joined immediately after World War II are now reaching retirement age. It has been estimated that large cities will soon experience a loss of one-third of their experienced police personnel through retirement. This experienced leadership must be replaced. Mr. Speaker, the cities most under\u00ad stafied are those which need police and fire protection most. I urge your help in furthering the fight for greater safety in our cities by adopting the national policy that law enforcement and fire fighting careers are critical skills which should be exempt from the draft. The war against crime, as the protec\u00ad tion of human life and property, is vital to our national interests. We cannot con\u00ad tinue to draft men who are so essential to maintaining the public safety. EDITORIAL BOOSTS SEAT BELTS FOR SCHOOL BUSES HON. GLENN CUNNINGHAM OF NEBRASKA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, 011 March 7, 1968, 19 of 30 passengers aboard an interstate bus died when the bus col\u00ad lided with an automobile near Baker, Calif. One of the conclusions presented by the National Transportation Board in its re\u00ad port of December 18, 1968, is as follows: The absence of restraining devices for the driver and bus passengers made possible the increase in severity of injuries and resulted in confusion and disorientation (i.e., to the passengers on the right side of the bus). Had restraining devices such as lap-type safety belts been available and in use by occupants, it is probable that a great number of persons would have been able to escape from the bus before the fire. Under the heading \"Probable Cause,\" this report also states: The injuries to the bus occupants were caused by the forces of impact and subse\u00ad quent bus overturn in the absence of crash injury prevention facilities such as occupant safety belts. I have learned today that the Federal Highway Administration does intend, under the authority of the Interstate Commerce Act, to require the installation and use of lap belts for drivers of buses operated in interstate commerce to any extent beyond the limits of commercial zones. Such operation includes the bulk of high-speed, intercity bus operations. The purpose is to insure that the driver CXV--271-Part 4 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS will be retained in his seat in extremely evasive maneuvers as well as in crashes that do occur. On the first day of the 9 lst Congress, I introduced H.R. 162 which would re\u00ad quire that motorbuses involved in inter\u00ad state commerce be equipped with seat belts. This bill provides that any vehicle used on the highways for the interstate trans\u00ad portation of 10 or more passengers be equipped with seat belts. It would become effective 1 year after enactment. Mr. Speaker, I call to your attention an editorial, \"Belts for Buses?\" which appeared in the Saturday, February 15 issue of the Washington Daily News. The editorial reads as follows: BELTS FOR BUSES? Traditionally, few occurrences--short of a declaration of war-are so designed to galva\u00ad nize a newspaper's city room as a report that a school bus has been in a major accident. In an age when custom begins to harden us to disasters, we remain completely vulnerable to those in which children are involved. The collision last week of a car and a bus bound for Earl B. Wood Junior High in Rockville, which sent both vehicles into a drainage ditch at Sunflower Drive and Bitter\u00ad root Way in Montgomery County's Flower Valley subdivision, was a lucky one. Thirty\u00ad one children were reported shaken up and slightly injured. No one seriously. But the accident raised the question: Why don't school buses hrave seat belts? In fact, why don't all buses have them? A bus is a large container in which to rattle small children about. According to the Amer\u00ad ican Automobile Association, tests were done by the University of California using school buses in crack-ups in which dummies were substituted for children without seat belts \"and the kids flew over the place like bullets.\" The National Education Association says the matter of seat belts is a controversial one, but it is \"under study\" (some jurisdictions may already be using them). The NEA points out that, statistically, the school bus \"is the safes.t mode of transportation in the world.\" Well, okay, but from our personal observa\u00ad tion of these buses over the years, we've yet to be convinced. With the ever increasing hazards of traveling the roads hereabouts, we would feel a lot safer knowing that junior was snugly belted in. A DAY WITH ALEXANDER STEPHENS HON. G. ELLIOTT HAGAN OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. HAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I recently came across a story in the Atlanta Jour\u00ad nal and Constitution magazine section which relates some highlights in the life of Alexander Stephens-Congressman, Vice President of the Confederacy, and Governor of Georgia-who died in 1883. Alexander H. Stephens is a great-great\u00ad uncle of my good friend and colleague, the Honorable ROBERT G. STEPHENS, JR., of Athens, Ga. The story tells of Stephens' association with Abraham Lincoln in Congress and during the Civil War. Be\u00ad cause I found the article of historic in\u00ad terest with some little-known facts about Lincoln and that historic era, I am 4281 bringing it to the attention of my col\u00ad leagues: A DAY WITH ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Two NEPHEWS WHO CALL HIM UNCLE ALEX REMEMBER DELIGHTFUL STORIES ABOUT AL\u00ad EXANDER STEPHENS (By Andrew Sparks) Alexander Stephens--congressman, vice president of the Confederacy, governor of Georgia-died in 1883. Yet when you walk through his old home at Crawfordville, Ga.-white-painted Liberty Hall in the Alexander H. Stephens State Park-you almost imagine he may be waiting in the next room. His books lie on the tables his pictures hang on the walls, and much of his own furniture stands where it did during his lifetime. But \"Little Alex\" seems even more real if you're lucky enough to spend a day in the country talking to men who call this great Georgian Uncle Alex. -\"I! I had a dollar for every time I've been to Crawfordville, I wouldn't ever have to work again,\" says Judge Frank A. Holden of Atlanta, Stephens' great-great nephew, who is almost 75 and vows he is working harder than he ever did before. As United States Commissioner in Georgia's Northern District, his job is to hold preliminary hearings on U.S. government cases, and he is also a prac\u00ad ticing attorney. Judge Holden invited us to go with him to two places where Alexander Stephens is best remembered today, Craw\u00ad fordville and Washington-Wilkes. Stephens, who was a friend of Lincoln and a foe of secession but a supporter of his state after the fateful decision to secede was made, has a birthday this week. He was born Feb. 11, 1812. Abraham Lincoln's birthday is the next day, Feb. 12, which, by an odd historic coincidence, happens to be Georgia Day, birthday of the state, founded Feb. 12, 1733, when Oglethorpe and his English settlers landed on a Savannah River bluff. It's a great week for history. But history heard firsthand does not seem like history in a book. \"Uncle Alex called my grandmother Little Honey,\" Judge Holden said, chewing on an unlighted cigar as we rode down I-20 east through a dun-colored winter landscape and back into memory. \"After grandmother's husband died, Stephens took grandmother, who was his niece, and her four little chil\u00ad dren, including my mother, over to live at Liberty Hall.\" Stephens knew what it meant to help those in need. His own mother died when he was a month old, leaving such a frail child people said it was a miracle he lived. Stephens grew to average height but never weighed more than a hundred p<>unds, hence his nick\u00ad name \"Little Alex,\" which has been spelled Alex, Alec, Aleck and Ellick. When he was only 14 his father and his stepmother died within a week of each other and the children went to live with relatives. Alex, like Abra\u00ad ham Lincoln, studied by the light of pine knots and read everything he could find. He had had only about two years of formal school, in \"old field schools,\" when he and his brother Aaron were sent to live with their mother's brother, Gen. Aaron Grier, near Raytown. Alex studied there at Locust Grove Academy and later in Washington before going to the University of Georgia, where he said he spent his happiest days. After a year of teaching, which he didn't like, he went to Crawfordville to study law and boarded with his stepmother's brother-in\u00ad law, the Rev. William Bird, in the house that is now Liberty Hall. Stephens bought the house in 1845 at Mr. Bird's death. He gave more than 100 boys financial help to get an education. \"As a boy Stephens' family was so poor they didn't have money to buy kerosene,\" Judge Holden said. \"That's why he read by lirght'ard knots. He was the first-honor grad-4282 uate at the University or Georgia but didn't have money to pay $1.50 !or his diploma. Long afterwards, the year my sister Queen Elizabeth Holden graduated at the university, the Board o! Regents awarded Alexander Stephens' diploma, and she received it for him. \"When Gutzon Borglum's statue of Steph\u00ad ens was unveiled in Statuary Hall at the Na\u00ad tional Capitol, my mother placed a wreath on it for the Georgia UDC. Years before, as a young bride, she had unveiled the marble statue of him at Liberty Hall in 1893. \"When I was a boy, Will Sanford was play\u00ad ing baseball in the yard and knocked a ball that broke a finger off the statue. It's stlll off I think. Will's mother taught school at Crawfordville and they were living at Liberty Hall. A lot of families have lived there. I never did myself, but I hunted Easter eggs there many a time and ran from the old witch, dressed up to protect the golden egg.\" Judge Holden kept pulling memories out of his head, as well as photographs and clippings from a brown leather briefcase in his lap. \"Here's a picture of a sofa that belonged to Uncle Alex,\" he said. \"It was at our house in A thens when I was growing up and my sisters hated it. It was so uncomfortable they said boys who came to see them and sat on it wouldn't ask for a second date. I gave it to Liberty Hall and the parks department had it done over.\" Years earlier Judge Holden's mother, Mrs. Horace Holden, unable to part with the family antique, had a copy of the sofa made and presented that to Liberty Hall. The rep\u00ad lica, upholstered in black horsehair, stands now in the parlor beneath Louis Gregg's portrait of Mrs. Holden. She was largely re\u00ad sponsible for the restoration of Liberty Hall in the 1930s and rode hundred and hundreds of miles to see people and ask them to sell or donate original furniture back to the house. \"My mother talked about Uncle Alex all the time, ever since I was born,\" Judge Holden said. \"I feel guilty now I didn't pay more attention. I'm ashamed of myself be\u00ad cause I didn't listen. \"One story about Stephens is so old it has whiskers, but it has been misquoted about where it came from. Mother knew exactly where it happened-in Greensboro, Ga. \"Bob Toombs and Alex Stephens were great friends, although they differed on great is\u00ad sues and had many debates. One hot sum\u00ad mer day they were going to debate at the courthouse in Greensboro. Just before the speaking, Stephens was lying on a couch on the verandah of the courthouse when Bob Toombs came in. He pointed to Stephens and said, 'Look at that little fellow. If you'd grease him and pin his ears back, you could swallow him whole.' Stephens jumped up and said, 'Yes, and you'd have more brains in your stomach than you'd have in your head.' \"Mother said the next week when Stephens and Toombs were going to debate in Wash\u00ad ington, Ga., they were both walking down the street and met. Toombs mumbled to the man he was with, just as they were about to pass Stephens, 'We do not get out of the way for no d. fool.' Stephens jumped off the sidewalk and replied, 'But we do!' STEPI_il:NS' ORATORY ONCE MADE LINCOLN CRY \"Stephens was one of the greatest orators this country ever prodn<:ed. In Congress Abe Lincoln was so impressed he wrote his law partner about him. That letter is right here in a book, 'Recollections of Alexander H. Stephens,' that my mother found in Boston when she went up to see where Stephens was put in prison after the war. \"Here's what Lincoln wrote: 'I take up my pen to tell you that Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, a little slim pale-faced consumptive man, has just concluded the very best speech o! EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS an hour's length I ever heard. My old with\u00ad ered dry eyes are full of tears yet.' \"My mother knew more about Stephens than any other living person. She could talk 11.bout him for 10 hours. Now, Dr. Robb Stephens knows more about him than any\u00ad one else. Without him, all the kinfolks would oe lost--anything we want to know we write and ask Cousin Robb. He's just a walking encydopedia. \"There's a man at Emory-and I resent this very much-who said Stephens ' not cooperat\u00ad ing with Jefferson Davis lost the war for the South. I think he's wrong. If they had lis\u00ad tened to Stephens, they would have saved hundreds of thousands of the cream. of the South. Stephens worried Jefferson Davis so about a compromise that Davis finally ap\u00ad pointed him and a commission to meet with Lincoln and see if the war could be ended. He just appointed it to appease Stephens. \"Stephens had a nephew he wanted to get released from prison. Cousin Robb can tell you about that--that nephew was his daddy-and about his daddy going to the White House, scared to death. Cousin Robb has the letter from Lincoln, in his own handwriting, giving his daddy permission to come through the lines.\" Dr. Robert G. Stephens, who will be 88 in June, is stlll a busy practicing physician, seeing patients every day and even making house calls. He moved to Washington-Wilkes from Atlanta in 1939 after inheriting a house which has now been home for members of his tam1ly 97 years. He lives there now with hiq daughter. Mrs. Emma Wilson. His son Robert G. Stephens Jr., of Athens, is Geor\u00ad gia's 10th District congressman. Lincoln's letter, framed in walnut and gold leaf, hangs in the library. The ink, which has now turned brown, was blotted when the President folded the letter and gave it to the 24-year-old Georgia lieutenant, John Alexander Stephens. John's photograph is at the bottom of the frame facing a picture of Lincoln which the President autographed and gave him. \"My father had the letter framed and it's hung in our home as long as I can remem\u00ad ber,\" said Dr. Stephens, who has a phenom\u00ad enal memory and talks about Lincoln and Stephens almost as if he knew them. \"In Congress they were both Whigs and both 'Young Indians'-members of a club gotten together for the purpose of electing Taylor President of the United States,\" he continued. \"Lincoln didn't run for a second term and went back to Springfield, Ill. He and Stephens corresponded some, but they hadn't met again when the war came on. When they did meet, at Hampton Roads, they met as friends. \"Lincoln wrote on a piece of paper that the men could write their own terms if they'd come into the Union. The others wouldn't sign. When they got through with the meet\u00ad ing, Lincoln called Stephens and said he wanted to talk to him alone. He wanted to ask about old friends they had known in Congress. Finally Lincoln said, 'Well, Ste\u00ad phens, we haven't been able to do anything in behalf of our country'-he didn't say countries; he never accepted that the south had been out of the Union, but after the war ended they put the south under Recon\u00ad struction and said the states had been out of the Union-'is there anything I can do for you of a personal nature?' \"'Well,' Stephens said, 'I have a nephew and the last we heard of him he was im\u00ad prisoned at Johnson Island in Sandusky Bay. If you could find out something about him, we'd appreciate it.' Lincoln took out a note\u00ad book and wrote down the name, John A. Stephens. Then he and Stephens separated, never to meet again. \"John Stephens, my father, was in an omcers' prison on Johnson Island in Lake Erie, about four miles from Sandusky, Ohio. He was standing in the bunkroom by a stove February 24, 1969 trying to get warm-he had no overcoat and the temperature was 20 degrees below zero and he had been bringing in wood for the fire--when an orderly came to the d\u00b7oor and called for Lt. John A. Stephens. 'You are wanted at the commander's omce,' he said. \"The commanding omcer showed him a telegram: 'Parole Lt. John A. Stephens, pris\u00ad oner of war, to report to me here in person, and send him to me. It is in pursuance of an arrangement I made yesterday with his uncle, Hon. A. H. Stephens. Acknowledge re\u00ad ceipt. A. Lincoln.' \"They told him to get his things together. Other prisoners-among them were Gov. Mc\u00ad Daniel and Capt. Wright, comptroller general of Georgia-gathered about to hear what had happened. My father said he didn't know what had happened. He thought may\u00ad be because he was the nephew of the vice president of the Confederacy they were going to shoot him. The other men cried when he told them goodby. \"Ice on Sandusky Bay was 10 feet thick. They hitched two mules to a sled to take him away, wrapped up in buffalo robes. He caught a train bound for Washington City and rode all that night and all the next day. About dark, when he got there, he went at once to the Wh!te House and to Lincoln's omce. His reception was very friendly when he showed the telegram. The man at the desk said, 'Give me your card.' My father didn't have one. He wrote his name out on a piece of newspaper , John Alexander Stephens. \"In two minutes, the man came back and beckoned. When my father went in, he saw a man lying on a long omce table, talking to a second man who sat in a chair, Secre\u00ad tary of State Seward. My father said when the man on the table got up, he looked like a corkscrew unwinding, the tallest man he ever saw. Lincoln came toward him with both hands out. 'I met your uncle on Feb. 3,' he said. 'He said your mother and every\u00ad one else at home are all right and well. I told him I was going to send you to them. You can have the freedom of Washington City as long as you want to, under my pro\u00ad tection.' \"My father stayed a week. He had gone to the University of Virginia and he used to go to Washington often to see his uncle. Then he went back to see Lincoln, who this time was by himself. They sat down and Lincoln told him how much he thought of his uncle and talked about the association they had had together. He told him how much he re\u00ad gretted the war and wished it would end. \"Lincoln turned to his desk, took out a photogra,ph of himself and wrote A. Lincoln across the bottom of it. 'Put this in your pocket,' he said; 'it will prove a curiosity down South.' While he was in Washington, my father went to the Army of the Potomac and had his own picture taken by the Yankee photographer.\" The two photographs, of A. Lincoln and John A. Stephens, are still together in the frame along with this letter Lincoln wrote there at his desk: ExECUTIVE MANSION, Washington, February 10, 1865. HoN. A. H. STEPHENS: According to our agreement your nephew, Lieut. Stephens goes to you bearing this note. Please in return, to select and send to me that omcer of the same rank imprisoned at Richmond whose physical condition most urgently requires his release. Respectfully, A. LINCOLN. Dr. Stephens quoted the letter from memory, never hesitating for a word as he sat there in an upholstered Victorian chair with dog heads carved on the arms. In the bright spotlight !rom an iron bridge lamp, his hair looked very white, his skin smooth and pale, his figure lean and thin--almost, one imagined, Little Alex's size. ' I I February 24, 1969 \"My father went to City Point and they sent him across the river,\" Dr. Stephens said. \"He was a free man who could do what he wanted to. He joined the Army again and got on Gen. John Echols' staJf and became a major. He was in West Virginia when he heard of the surrender of Gen. Lee on April 9. He was at Christianburg, Va., when he heard about Lincoln's assassination. Gen. Breckin\u00ad ridge told him he was at liberty to go and gave him a horse--he named it Breckinridge and rode it all the way from Virginia to Talia\u00ad ferro County, Ga. \"On May 5 the family gathered at the old plantation and that was the first chance my father had to give Uncle Alex the letter from Lincoln. Father said Uncle Alex cried. 'The worst thing that ever happened,' Alex\u00ad ander Stephens said, 'was the assassination of Lincoln.' \"I don't know so much about Alexander Stephens. I was born in 1881 and he died in 1883. I don't remember him. But I lived with him at the governor's mansion after he was inaugurated in November, 1882. \"When he was mentioned for governor, he said he wanted my father to go with him to Atlanta. Uncle Alex asked my mother if she'd live at the mansion, but she didn't want to go. 'Well,' he said, 'if you won't come, I won't run for governor.' They didn't want to deprive him of being governor of Georgia, and decided they'd move With him. \"I had measles in the mansion, which stood where the Henry Grady Hotel is now. I remember once going to the end of the walk where a policeman spoke to me. I grabbed his billy away from him and ran to the house. \"Our family dog, Prince, bit the Atlanta chief of police and Uncle Alex said they'd have to give the dog away. Then Uncle Alex began worrying about him and said, 'Bring him back and put a muzzle on him.' They drew a newspaper cartoon of Prince in a muzzle. He's buried behind Allen's, at the corner of Cain and Ivy. \"I have one other memory. I remember seeing a dead face in a coffin. They held me up to see it. I'm sure that was Alexander Stephens.\" Among his family treasures is a letter Stephens wrote to Dr. Stephens' father, when John was a boy of 13. John was in La\u00ad Grange, working for a doctor who had just increased his wages. Stephens, hearing of the raise, wrote from Washington:\" ... you must feel that it is incumbent for you to in\u00ad crease your sense of responsibility, industry and energy. Be always at your place and al\u00ad ways attend to your business. Remember now is the time to apply yourself and now ts the time to form correct habits for life. You will soon be a man and you must learn to act as a man and to perform your part as a man among men. The first great rule to ob\u00ad serve in all your acts is to do right. Adm.ire virtue and scorn vice. Associate with the good and have as little to do as you can with those in whom you discover anything low or mean. Take care of your money\u00ad never spend a cent for a useless object. Al\u00ad ways be respectful to your superiors and never rude to those below you either in age or in condition of life.\" \"Uncle Alex always gave advice when he wrote a letter,\" Dr. Stephens said. No con\u00ad gressman today could give a young man better rules for a good life. At Crawfordville, Little Alex's house and its family of outbuildings are all newly painted and everything is neat and trim. In\u00ad side, the floor of the wide center hall upstairs and down is boldly painted with black and orange diamonds. Rooms opening off either side have bright floral carpets, woven to re\u00ad produce the old original patterns. The furni\u00ad ture, in ante-bellum plantation style, is Em\u00ad pire and Victorian, with enough earlier pieces to give the rooms a sense of continuity and enough homemade things of Georgia pine to show that 19th Century Georgians EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS couldn't buy everything they needed at a store. Mrs. Mabel Bird, the state park host\u00ad ess for Liberty Hall, says about 4,000 peo\u00ad ple a year come to see the house--school children, tourists from as far away as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City, tent campers from the 1,200-acre park behind the house. At Liberty Hall-so named by its owner because he wanted guests to do as they pleased there--Alexander Hamilton Stephens lives on in memory. OUTLOOK BAD EVEN IF INFLATION IS RF.sTRAINED HON. J. WILLIAM STANTON OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call the attenion of my colleagues to this article which appeared in the February 11, 1969, American Banker. This is a particularly timely subject and worthy of every Member's consideration: OUTLOOK BAD EVEN IF INFLATION Is RE\u00ad STRAINED, AND WORSE IF IT IS NOT, REIERSON DECLARES (By William Zimmerman) NEW YoRK.-The economic outlook \"is truly disturbing\" if effor~ to restrain infla\u00ad tion fail, Dr. Roy L. Reierson, senior vice\u00ad president and advisory committee cha.irm.an, Bankers Trust Co., warned Monday. Unless inflation is brought under control, he said in prepared remarks, \"Not only must interest rates be expected to continue up\u00ad ward, but the functioning of the bond and mortgage markets may be undermined, and the supply of capital needed to finance the large and growing dem.a.nds for goods and services in prospect for the 1970s may be seriously compromised.'' His remarks were prepared for the Ameri\u00ad can Bankers Association's 50th Midwinter Trust Conference that opened here Monday. Arthur Brickner, vice-president and econ\u00ad omist for Bankers Trust, read the speech for Mr. Reierson, who was unable to a.ppear at the meeting in the morning because of the city's snow problems. Even if inflation is brought under control, portfolio investment managers are not likely to turn their backs on common stocks and flock to the bond market in greater volume, his text noted. Their preference for equities, Mr. Reierson stated, \"is another reason against expecting bond yields for the years ahead to return to the levels that pre\u00ad vailed in the first half of the 1960s, before infiationary pressures became pronounced.\" If inflation can be controlled, \"the present will in retrospect appear as an exceptional opportunity to acquire bonds at historically low prices and secure an above-average re\u00ad turn for years to come,\" he noted. He stated that as long as investors believe consumer prices are destined to rise at rates close to the recent 4.75% or more, \"they will hardly be attracted even by the yields of 7%- 7.5% presently available on high-quality bonds or by the even higher yields offered on mortgages.'' \"Considering the strong influence of such expectations upon bond yields today, it might not require much in the way of good news\u00ad an easing in capital spending programs, a convincing drop in new orders, confirmed softness in retail trade, or substantive prog\u00ad ress toward peace in Vietnam-to set the stage for a market rally.\" In Mr. Relerson's opinion, \"it is dimcult to visualize interest rates as a whole declining to materially lower levels and remaining there for an extended period. Rather, if in\u00ad vestors do not see inflation being curbed, in\u00ad terest rates could rise to even greater heights.\" He also said there are reasons to expect the rate of personal savings to average substan\u00ad tially lower in the years ahead. \"There is evi\u00ad dence that the expectations of chronic infla\u00ad tion, which in recent years have affected in\u00ad stitutional investors and business manage\u00ad ments, have spread to the general public. Thus, the consumer may remain disposed to spend more, borrow more, and save less.\" Mr. Reierson's text said that meaningful progress in the fight against inflation prob\u00ad ably is not attainable without \"generating some slack in the economy, and this specifi\u00ad cally includes the elimination of hyperem\u00ad ployment.\" The \"most reasonable assumption is that both fiscal and credit policies will be em\u00ad ployed to moderate demands ln the economy and to bring about some lessening of the in\u00ad fiationary momentum, but not its complete removal from the economic picture.\" This would result in the expectation, he added, that costs and prices in the yields ahead would maintain their general uptrend, but at a pace materially slower than that of last year. Mr. Reierson said that the nation's fiscal policy since the step-up of military opera\u00ad tions in Vietnam in 1965 merits the \"label of mismanagement.'' The surpluses shown in the budget for this fiscal year and next are not adequate, he said, and larger surpluses will be required if credit market conditions are to ease appreciably. In his opinion, the surtax should not be permitted to expire, and the key to an ap\u00ad propriate fiscal policy lies in the Govern\u00ad ment's ability to control expenditures. \"Re\u00ad straint over Government spending will not be achieved unless a system of priorities ts adopted against which to evaluate competing claims for Government money, and unless this is coupled with an effective system of controlllng appropriations as well as expendi\u00ad tures.'' He also suggested two changes in the Fed\u00ad eral Reserve's approach to curbing inflation. \"The first objective should be to hold the in\u00ad crease in commercial bank credit to a pace more closely attuned to the rate of real growth in the American economy. This calls for the Fed, he said, \"to concentrate more heavily on the behavior of financial aggre\u00ad gates-such as the monetary base, the money supply, and the rate of bank credit expan\u00ad sion-and less on such market factors as the level of net borrowed reserves, the volume of member bank borrowings from the Fed\u00ad eral Reserve banks, and the rates on Federal funds and on Treasury bills.\" He added: \"Unless the Federal Reserve can resist the temptation to shift to an aggres\u00ad sively expansionary credit policy at the first sign of a slowing down in economic growth, credit policy will, on balance, inevitably strengthen, rather than moderate, inflation\u00ad ary forces.\" Another speaker at the conference, Charles D. Buek, president, United States Trust Co., New York, warned that statements made in a report issued last year by Rep. Wright Pat\u00ad man, D., Tex., chairman of the House Bank\u00ad ing and Currency Committee, on bank trust fund business \"do not bode well for the future confidentiality of our customers' per\u00ad sonal affairs.\" Mr. Buek, who ts president of the ABA's trust division, referred to a statement in the report that commented: \"Much infor\u00ad mation on the many relationships between bank trust departments and others has been hidden from the pwblic for many years through the device of confidentiality \"of trust information.\" \"It is now clear,\" the report said, \"that this has been used at least partly as a veil behind which banking in\u00ad stitutions have gained great influence, if not control, of many of the largest corporations in the United States.\" Bankers need to explain \"the real and prac\u00ad tical reasons for nominee registrations,\" a device used to simplify the delivery of secu\u00ad rities and the collection of dividends and representing heterogeneous groups of smaller holdings, he said. A Congressional group that in 1962 made a study of bank stock ownership \"encountered over a.nd over a.gain ... the mysterious names of bank nominees,\" he said. \"The trouble With suoh studies is that they sweep up the innocent with the guilty and expose the per\u00ad sona.I affairs of little people a.long with the rate instances of concentrated control.\" From the point of view of legislators, Mr. Buek said, \"these mysterious nominees must seem like the Stateside equivalent of num\u00ad bered accounts in Switzerland.\" ''We must try to understand people who have never heard of nominee registrations, and who accordingly have no ideas of the practical reasons for their use.\" From the legislators view, he added, \"Why shouldn't this little known practice among major banks seem to be an effort to hide concen\u00ad trations of wealth and to cloak the economic power of the banking industry in a veil of secrecy?\" Mr. Buek said it is important for banks to explain what nominee registrations are-\u00ad \"for nominees are apparently baffling and suspect in the absence of such understand\u00ad ing\"-.and \"we must a.gain insist that pub\u00ad licity be given only to holdings requiring such exposure in the public interest.\" At the same time, Mr. Buek said, \"We must be very careful to demonstrate that holdings of unquestioned interest to the gov\u00ad ernment are not concealed in this manner. \"In our effort to protect the confidential\u00ad ity of innocent holders, we must not make the mistake of appearing to protect from view the few concentrations which should unquestionably be subject to scrutiny.\" He further warned that \"if any Congressional committee directs its campaign for exposure of such affairs persistently and peculiarly against banks, such a situation may tend to drive business away from banks to other institutions free of the glare of unnecessary publicity.\" TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL MUNKACSY REMARKS OF HON. FRANK HORTON OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, February 20, 1969 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, on the 125th anniversary of the birth of Michael de Munkacsy, Hungary's greatest artist\u00ad painter, I am pleased to join in commem\u00ad orating the life and achievements of a man who was dedicated to expressing the beautiful and noble in man in paint on canvas. Michael de Munkacsy gave up the tools of an apprentice carpenter to become a painter. As a youth he showed so much promise that he won a scholarship to further develop his artistic abilities in Budapest. It was not long before Mun\u00ad kacsy's outstanding talent as a painter was discovered by the people of Buda\u00ad pest, who snapped up his portraits at higher and higher prices. Moving to Munich to paint and study, the young Munkacsy began what was later described by critics as a meteoric EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS rise to fame. While still studying in Mu\u00ad nich, he won fame in Budapest for win\u00ad ning first prize for his painting \"The Deluge.\" By the time that Munkacsy moved to Dtisseldorf to study under Knaus, con\u00ad temporary biographers have described him as more of a master than a pupil. When the work of this young genius came to the attention of a small group of Americans who were inspired by his talent, the financial patronage of J. Wil\u00ad stach of Philadelphia enabled him to concentrate on his first great panel, \"The Last Day of a Man Condemned to Death,\" for which he received the prize of the picture of the year at the Paris Salon in 1870. From that moment on, Munkacsy's European reputation was established. Re\u00ad turning to Hungary after being welcomed into the inner circles of the finest painters in France, Munkacsy began to tap the rich source of Hungarian folk\u00ad lore that was later to become the theme of many of his paintings. Although rich in the tradition of Hun\u00ad gary, Munkacsy was international in his message and style. He was at home de\u00ad picting Christ, or the simple life of Hun\u00ad garian peasants. Realism and grand simplicity were his trademarks. In 1872 Munkacsy again won two prizes from the Salon in Paris for his \"Pawn\u00ad broker Shop\" and \"Night Strollers.\" Leaping into opulence and fame, this modern realist won the Grand Medal of Honor at the 1878 World Exhibition at Paris for his painting \"Blind Milton Dic\u00ad tating 'Paradise Lost' to His Daughters.\" This famous picture now hangs in the Public Library of New York City, lend\u00ad ing a special glow and insight to the au\u00ad thor of one of our most famous works in English literature. In 1881and1884 Munkacsy completed his two best known works, \"Christ Be\u00ad fore Pilate\" and \"Christ on Calvary.\" Both paintings toured Europe and, in 1886, the east coast of the United States. Contemporary critic notices praised the paintings as worthy successors of canvases of the great masters of the past, and as the paintings of the century: New York Herald, November 18, 1886: It is an impressive and a dramatic scene, and one which grows on the beholder . . . The \"Christ Before Pilate\" is a work ... which will be ranked as one of the most remarkable of the century. New York World, November 18, 1886: The work 1s a grandly conceived one; 1s majestic ln its simplicity and tells its story through no tricks of art, but simply by the genius guiding the hand which created it. It satis\u00ad fies and moves the spectator ... The paint\u00ad ing should be visited by everyone. It will at\u00ad tract widespread and deserved notice and attention, and America viewing it will add her tribute and meed of praise to the great artist whose genius has produced it. Mun\u00ad kacsy, te sal ut amusl Today there are more than five Mun\u00ad kacsy paintings in public and private collections in New York alone. About 60 canvases are to be found in the United States, including \"Christ Before Pilate\" and \"Christ on Calvary\" which are in the possession of the John Wanamaker family in Philadelphia. They are regu\u00ad larly exhibited every year during Holy February 24, 1969 Week at the Grand Court of the Wana\u00ad maker store. This year the American Hungarian Federation is holding a commemorative program in Philadelphia on April 12, 1969, by honoring this great Hungarian painter. The message of Munkacsy is timeless. It transcends national bound\u00ad aries by representing the best in man and his discernment of beauty. Mun\u00ad kacsy properly belong to all mankind. THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION: VI\u00ad TAL FORCE IN THE EQUITY MAR\u00ad KETS HON. W. S. (BILL) STUCKEY OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. STUCKEY. Mr. Speaker, Mr. John C. Bogle, president of the Wellington Management Co., delivered an address on the financial institution before the In\u00ad vestment Company Institute on October 31, 1968. Mr. Bogle discusses many as\u00ad pects of the complex investment prob\u00ad lem that involves many of the people in our country. There were a number of bills before the Securities and Exchange Commission which regulates the invest\u00ad ment business and several have already been introduced in the 91st Congress, thus this subject is very timely. The ad\u00ad dress is enlightening and worthy to be included in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and I would like for my colleagues to have the benefit of his comments: THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION; VITAL FORCE IN THE EQurrY MARKETS (By John C. Bogle, president Well1ngton Management Co.) A Rip Van Winkle type investor fell into deep sleep, so the story goes, and awoke 100 years from now. He could scarcely wait to telephone an investment broker and check the \"long-term performance\" of the invest\u00ad ments he owned. With the help of an instan\u00ad taneous computer, he learned that his orig\u00ad inal shares of American Telephone were worth $5,684,360, his 100 shares of General Motors were worth $8,271,320, and his 100 shares of Xerox were worth $34,981,480. With each higher valuation, his delight became more ecstatic, and when the Xerox value came over the wire, he shouted: \"I'm rich!\" Suddenly, the telephone operator cut into the conversation with these sobering story, however exaggerated, helps us to focus on a central fact of American finan\u00ad cial life today: there ls no absolute safety in dollars. As a corollary, investors are turning increasingly to equities in an effort to maxi\u00ad mize total investment return and (hope\u00ad fully to a greater degree than the story above would indicate) to offset the ravages of in\u00ad flation. This trend is refiected in one of the major forces in the equity markets today: \"insti\u00ad tutionalization\"-the growing share of equity ownership by financial institutions-mutual funds, corporate pension funds, insurance companies, a.nd endowment funds-institu\u00ad tion whose primary function is to invest the monies entrusted to them by others. The trend toward institutionalization, in\u00ad deed, has become a political issue. The Con\u00ad gress has enacted into law a Bill calling for an exhaustive Securities and Exchange February 24, 1969 Commission study of the impact of institu\u00ad tional investing upon the securities markets and the economy. More recently, Presidential Candidate Richard M. Nixon called for \"an independent, comprehensive, economic study of the role of financial institutions in our economy, the relationship of financial insti\u00ad tutions to our nation's growth, the require\u00ad ments for investor protection, and the inter\u00ad relationship of all financial institutions.\" In his controversial statement, he appeared to challenge the SEC proposals for a new New York Stock Exchange commission rate sched\u00ad ule and a ban on commission sharing, made in advance of such an economic study. It ls not my purpose today, however, to tackle the political and regulatory issues involved in institutionalization, nor the is\u00ad sue of corporate infiuence and control-vital e.s they are in our industry and in our econ\u00ad omy. Rather, I would like to examine with you the economic side of these institutional trends, to appraise them with respect to the character and liquidity of the equity mar\u00ad kets, and to look to their future effects on our own mutual fund industry-both as an investor in securities as well as a marketer of securities. INSTrrUTIONAL OWNERSHIP TODAY Today, institutions own a. larger share of equity securities than \u00b7 ever before: their ownership of some $230 billion represents one-third of the $708 billion total (see Chart 1). In 1954, institutional ownership was $66 billion, and accounted for one-fourth of the total. The absolute figures are impressive, to be sure, but the relative increase in market share is clearly a major factor in our finan\u00ad cial economy today. The growth of institutional ownership of equities has been, in large measure, a. post\u00ad World War II phenomenon, with the respon\u00ad slb111ty vested in two major groups: 1. The 50-fold increase in total mutual fund assets, from $1 billion in 1945 to some $50 billion today. 2. The extraordinary growth of corporate pension funds--now $100 billion-and the increasingly equity-oriented Investment philosophy of these funds. Some 50% of their investments a.re now in equities versus 25% In 1955. These two institutions are the fastest grow\u00ad ing in terms of their equity participation, and, along with life Insurance companies, are the only Institutions whose equity own\u00ad ership was grown faster than equity securi\u00ad ties in total. However, they are by no means the largest owners of equity securities. Their equity holdings $51 billion for the pension funds, and $43 billion for the mutual funds\u00ad rank well below the $87 billion of equities held by bank-administered personal trust funds; although the bank total actually rep\u00ad resents a smaller share of the total equity market than In 1954. (Since banks manage not only these personal trusts, but also an overwhelming majority of the corporate pen\u00ad sion plans, their economic power as equity owners is clearly preeminent, as we shall later see.) The sharp rise In the value of total equi\u00ad ties-from $268 billion to $708 billion-ls accounted for almost entirely by rising equity markets during this period. Indeed, of the $440 billion increase In equity values since 1954, only a.bout $21 billion arose from net new issues of common stocks. On the other hand, corporate retained earnings were $235 billion for this period, adding sub\u00ad stantial underlying book value to corporate equity securities. In short, the rise in the dollar value of institutional equity holdings has come largely from rising stock prices. But the rise in market share has come about from the net purchases of an enormous volume of equity securities-some $48 billion in the past decade alone-in trend: $2.9 billlon in 1958; $10.5 billlon in 1967 (Chart 2). EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS Implicit in the rise of institutional owner\u00ad ship of equities is the relative decline in individual equity holdings. While individ\u00ad uals have, of course, participated broadly in the equity markets we have enjoyed, their relative participation has gradually de\u00ad creased. As shown in Chart 2, it has de\u00ad creased steadily and surely, year after year, and ls accelerating. Individuals have sold $34 billion of securities on balance during the past ten years, with net sales rising from $0.4 billion in 1958 to $8.8 billion in 1967. In nine of these years the dollar value of secu\u00ad rities sold has increased over the preceding year. These figures reflect only individual common and preferred stocks, and do not in\u00ad clude mutual fund net purchases. These mutual fund figures would modify, but not alter, the trend shown in Chart 2. For ex\u00ad ample, individual purchases of mutual fund shares, totaling $4.6 billion net in 1967, would have brought the \"true\" liquidation figure for all equity-type investments down to $4.2 billion last year. Why are individuals selling stocks on bal\u00ad ance? Little is known about the reasons. However, we do know that each year huge blocks of stock are sold by wealthy individ\u00ad uals and estates for tax or diversification purposes-Ford and Gulf 011 stock being two good examples. New investors of modest means-the number of individual sharehold\u00ad ers has risen from 9 million in 1956 to 24 million currently-could hardly be sUfficient to offset the sales of these blocks. And, at the same time, many individual investors have turned from common stocks to mutual funds. In particular, the exceptional record of investment performance developed by the mutual fund industry has surely drawn in\u00ad vestment dollars from people who have owned some of the widely held \"blue-chip\" com\u00ad panies which have lagged behind the general advance of securities prices in recent years. During the five years 1963-67 inclusive, for example, such earlier market bellwethers as American Telephone & Telegraph, General Motors, Standard 011 of New Jersey, and United States Steel, as a group, rose only 8%, compared to a 39 % gain for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. By way of comparison, a representative group of ten large growth-in\u00ad come mutual funds (excluding \"performance funds\") rose by 66% (all figures exclude investment income). To be sure, it is difficult to make fair comparisons in this area, but there is gen\u00ad eral agreement that the desire for better in\u00ad vestment performance-not only by the dis\u00ad satisfied \"do-it-yourself\" individual investor who wanted a better return, but also by what we like to think of as the more sophis\u00ad ticated in.stitution which wanted to remain competitive-has furthered the trend toward institutionalization. At the same time, this emphasis--or, as some believe, over-em\u00ad phasis--on performance has had an impor\u00ad tant side-effect: rapidly increasing portfolio turnover. INSTITUTIONAL TRADING TODAY If institutional ownership of equities ls a major force in our financial system, institu\u00ad tional participation in the equity marketplace is an even more important force. For, while institutions own one-third of all equities, they account for an even higher proportion of market activity. Recent estimates place institutional trading at more than 50% of public share volume on the New York Stock Exchange. This figure compares with 43 % in 1966 and some 33 % in the 1961-1963 period. This development comes about for a reason that ls simple enough to understand: the rate of institutional portfolio activity ls, in general, higher than individal portfolio ac\u00ad tivity. Portfolio turnover of the major insti\u00ad tutions (there are some gaps in these statis\u00ad tics-Le., no figures on personal trust funds) has risen sharply in response to the demand for improved investment performance. Chart 3 (not printed in RECORD) shows the 4285 growth in turnover--on the New York Stock Exchange and by major institutions-since 1963. The figures for 1963-1964 were relatively steady, and quite representative of the gen\u00ad eral stab111ty of these figures during the 1954-1963 decade. And then the push for performance by large pools of capital began in earnest. From 1964 to 1968 (first quarter), mutual fund turnover rose from 19% to 39%, pension funds from 11 % to 16 % , life insur\u00ad ance companies from 12 % to 19 % , and the NYSE from 13% to 21%. (The NYSE turn\u00ad over is materially overstated as it relates to public and institutional turnover, as it in\u00ad cludes transactions by NYSE members\u00ad traditionally about one-fourth of total share volume. Reduced by members' transactions, NYSE turnover might run In the area of 16 % currently.) Thus, most major institutions have higher turnover rates than individuals. And turn\u00ad over ls rising sharply, and doubtless will continue to rise, although, for perspective, we should realize the NYSE turnover was in the 100% area during the 1920's and 1930's. To be sure, it ls unlikely we will return to these extraordinarily high turnover levels, in pa.rt because the tax impact of successful invest\u00ad ment transactions is so much greater today. On the other hand, present turnover levels could easily move higher-perhaps to the 30 %-plus level for the NYSE--since so many institutions have the luxury of favored tax treatment. (The pension funds, as you know, have the freedom of complete tax-exemption. While mutual fund shareholders must, of course, bear the tax impact of a mutual fund's transactions, the fund can act without excessive restraint in its portfolio trans\u00ad actions, since even substantial capital gains, if distributed, involve no \"performance penalty.\") MUTUAL FUNDS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL SPECTRUM With these broad views of the institutional scene today, let us now turn to our own in\u00ad dustry. Despite our extraordinary record of growth and our high trading volume. the mutual fund industry still accounts for the ownership of only about 6% of ell stocks\u00ad thls figure has not changed materially since 1964-and about 10% of NYSE trading vol\u00ad ume. We are growing, but our infiuence 1s stlll quite limlted relative to other institu\u00ad tions. Let's look at the trust companies as one example. The recent Patman report notes that the major banks and trust companies control $253 billion of trust assets (excluding, of course, some $850 bill1on of bank financial assets). These trust assets alone, then, a.re some six times the assets of our entire ICI membership (Cha.rt 4). In fact. if one wishes to look for concentration of economic power, it ls interesting to note that the five largest trust institutions exceed the IOI total in terms of both assets ( $61 billion versus $42 billlon) and common stock holdings ( $40 bil\u00ad lion versus $36 billion). (See Chart 5.) It ls incredible that our National economic pol\u00ad icy-as conceived by the proposed SEC Mutual Fund legislation-might allow these and other similar institutions to form mutual funds to further concentrate their extraor\u00ad dinary economic power. If the banks-thanks to the foresight of the Glass-Stea.gall Act, the vigorous Invest\u00ad ment Company Institute litigation in the First National City Bank case, and the un\u00ad wilUngness of the House of Representatives to act on the SEC Blll-are precluded from entering the mutual fund industry, no sim\u00ad ilar restraint infiuences the life insurance industry. The life insurance companies are competitors today. They have colossal re\u00ad sources, and they are patiently and persist\u00ad ently developing the management and xnar\u00ad keting expertise to be far tougher compet\u00ad itors. The point ls not that life insurance com\u00ad pany common stockholdings-now $8 bll-4286 lion-should grow materially. (Though a 4\u00a52 % of resources, they are much lower than, for example, the English life insurance com\u00ad panies, which invest to 30% of assets in equi\u00ad ties.) Rather, the growth is likely to come from the fact that life insurance companies are forming, developing and acquiring mu\u00ad tual funds of their own, and indeed are be\u00ad coming an integral part of \"our\" industry. The reasons for this development are not hard to find. The division of the Mutual Fund/Insurance dollar (Chart 6) tells the story as well as anything. In 1955, net addi\u00ad tions to insurance assets (including both life insurance reserves and insured pension re\u00ad serves) totaled $5.5 b1llion, compared to $0.8 billion of net sales of investment company shares; by 1967, the insurance figure had risen to $7.6 billion ( +38%), while invest\u00ad ment companies $4.6 billion ( +475 % ) . As a result, the insurance indus\u00ad try, which in 1955 was taking in $7 for each dollar in mutual funds, in 1968 realized only about $1.60 per mutual fund dollar. Confronted by this trend, the life insur\u00ad ance industry has moved vigorously into the equity field-through both mutual funds and variable annuities. According to Fortune Magazine, \"this represents a violent break with tradition for the old-line life-insurance companies, which have long been dedicated, with an almost religious fervor, to the sale of a single prescription for fiancial security: a contract of guaranteed, fixed-dollar benefits supported, in turn, by investments in fixed\u00ad dollar securities. Now, in belated recognition of the eroding effects of inflation on simple savings and fixed incomes, the companies have decided to work both sides of the street and offer their customers, as a supplement to life insurance, an equity product that will serve as a hedge. For the faithful purveyors of life insurance, this is a momentous decision.\" Thus, it is the desire to compete-the de\u00ad sire to maintain their share of the savings/ investment dollar-that is moving banks and life inusrance companies into the mutual fund field-a process that should speed even more the trend toward institutionalization. This trend, clearly, wm be furthered by the growth of another major institutional holder of equities-potentially the largest of all\u00ad the corporate pension fund. The response of the corporate pension fund, however, is not a competitive one but an economic one-the desire of corporate management both to in\u00ad crease employee benefits and to reduce cor\u00ad porate costs by earning a higher return on its investment dollars. Corporate pension funds are, in total, huge-the value of non-insured funds is some $86 billion currently (see Chart 7). Their growth has been extraordinary-the more than fourfold increase from $20 billion in 1956 represents a 14% compound annual rate. Their investment policy has become in\u00ad creasingly aggressive-the total equity ratio has risen from 25 % of assets in 1956 to 59 % currently. And few are willing to look ahead toward anything but further growth and continued equity orientation. As mentioned earlier, most of the non\u00ad insured pension funds are bank-managed. The Patman report estimates that banks manage $73 bilUon of the corporate pension fund total. The remainder of the $253 bil\u00ad lion bank-managed total includes $126 bil\u00ad lion in personal trust funds and $54 billion in agency accounts. In total, corporate pen\u00ad sion fund resources (including the insured plans) are estimated at $100 billion cur\u00ad rently, and are expected to reach $285 billion 1n 1980. In any event, as competitive ardor and economic necessity continue to give institu\u00ad tional investors compelling reasons for in\u00ad creasing equity holdings, the appetite for equities should continue-from the trust companies, the insurance companies, the corporate pension funds, and several other important potential (if not past) sources of EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS institutional demand, including, most im\u00ad portantly, state and local retirement plans. Even the most down-to-earth estimates of the future equity purchasing power of these institutions project their total purchases to some $12 billion annually by 1972 (they were $8 billion last year). This total might con\u00ad sist of $1 billion for the fire and casualty companies, $1.5 billion for the state and local retirement plans, $2 billion for the life insurance companies, and $7.5 bilUon for the corporate pension funds. FUTURE GROWTH OF THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY A question of particular interest to us today, of course, is: what addition will the mutual fund industry make to this total demand? It is obviously far more difficult to project our industry's growth trend than the trends of those institutions noted above, for two important reasons: (1) the net cash fl.ow of our industry :fluctuates much more widely, than the others, and (2) our in dustry s relatively high equity position\u00ad some 88 % of resources--is unlikely to grow by any significant extent in the future. How\u00ad ever, it seems obligatory to look at past trends and make a few guesses. First, we must all face the fact that the growth of our industry has slowed appre\u00ad ciably. If we eliminate the action of the se\u00ad curities markets from our calculations, our net new money (including reinvestment of dividends) is currently running at a rate of only about 5 % of assets, compared with nearly 20 % fifteen years ago and 13 % as recently as a decade ago. How can this be, with the extraordinary rise we have seen in investors' purchases of mutual fund shares? The answer is the steady rise in share liqui\u00ad dations. The 5\u00a52 % redemption rate (redemp\u00ad tions as a percentage of net assets) typical of the 1950's is presently running at about 8% and, in my judgment, may well move toward the 10 % level in the next few years. So, as we look to the future, we might assume a 5% \"real\" (i.e., new money) growth rate. This would mean that the earlier\u00ad projected institutional appetite for $12 bil\u00ad lion in common stocks in 1972 would be swelled by an additional $3 billion from mu\u00ad tual funds. This could clearly be an impor\u00ad tant factor in the equity markets at that time, especia~ly if individual liquidation of equities does not accelerate, and if new issues of common stocks remain near the present level of $2 blliion per year. Appraising our industry's growth even fur\u00ad ther ahead, let's look to 1980: assume we (along with the other industries that will then be in the mutual fund business) can maintain a 5 % new-money growth rate, and a 5 % growth through stock market appre\u00ad ciation. These figures, if realized, would in\u00ad crease the assets of the mutual fund indus\u00ad try to an approximate total of $150 blllion. Translating this to your own management company, and assuming-which is most un\u00ad likely-that your share of the market re\u00ad mains unchanged, you would enjoy a three\u00ad fold increase in the assets you manage today. For example, if you manage $1 billion cur\u00ad rently, your assets in 1980 would be $3 bil\u00ad lion. Before you accept that figure and relax however, you might note that-assuming ~ 10% redemption rate-you would open your doors for business in 1981 knowing that, just to match your redemptions, your new sales would have to total $300 million. on this sobering note, let us turn from our role as marketers of equity securities to investors in equity securities. THE INVESTMENT MARKETS OF THE 1970'8 As investors, we must carefully consider what the current move toward institutional\u00ad ization may have on the investment markets of tomorrow. The conclusions, admittedly speculative, may hopefully be at least con\u00ad troversial enough to spark your own futuris\u00ad tic thinking. Basically, I believe, we must look for continued institutionalization of our February 24, 1969 equity ~rk~ts. By the mid-1970's, today's 33% inst1tut1onal ownership could well be 40%, and today's 50%-plus share of public trading volume could surge toward the 60 % level. If realized, these developments should have pronounced effects 1n six principal areas: 1. The Supply/Demand Equation: There should be increasing institutional demand for a limited supply of equities, as more and more savings dollars seek an inflation hedge. The effects on the equity markets should therefore, be positive, as equities continue~ produce a higher long-term return (income plus growth) than fixed-income securities. We can, however, look for a sharply increas\u00ad ing supply of \"equity-type\" securities----con\u00ad vertibles and warrants-as the fixed-dollar institution looks for \"a piece of the action.\" 2. Market Stabillty: The sharp swings in the broad market averages should tend to be smaller, assuming institutions can afford to take the long-term view of investing. Hope\u00ad fully, a little bull-market conservatism can prevent us, and the investors we serve, from getting carried away with the craze for super\u00ad performance; at the same ti.me, a little faith in the long-run should moderate the in\u00ad evitable declines. Caution: this projection as\u00ad sumes that the institution can act 1n a man\u00ad ner that is more rational, less emotional than the individual; as an industry, we have room to improve in this area. 3. Source of the Markets: The third market is likely to continue to grow. While it still represents only about 4% of total NYSE dol\u00ad lar volume, it runs close to 10% for most of the major issues. Both figures are likely to grow, and might double by the mid-1970's. In addition, computer services (such as AutEex) will play an increasing role in the markets, and I would not discount the likeli\u00ad hood of a thriving \"fourth market\" by 1975. 4. Size of Blocks: Though financial in\u00ad stitutions will grow substantially, the size of typical large blocks may well not only fail to rise, but even decline from today's levels. Why? Because of the marked trend-begun like most of the important recent investment trends, in the mutual fund industry-toward both (~) smaller-sized, limited offering poolS of capital and {b) fragmentation of large\u00ad sized capital pools into smaller units with separate and highly autonomous portfolio managers. In short, institutional money man\u00ad agement may be expected to become in\u00ad creasingly decentralized. 5. Turnover: A generally higher rate of turnover is most likely. Other institutions will follow the mutual fund trend again as in the past. The NYSE trading record f~r a given day, having recently crossed 20,000,000 shares for the first time, will doubtless top 30,000,000 shares relatively soon. (Most in\u00ad vestors will fail to recognize that the 16 ooo - 000 share total of 1929, unchallenged 'until 1968, represented a turnover of 1 Ya % of listed shares in a single day; a 30,000,000 share day currently would represent only % of 1 % of listed shares.) 4 6. Performance: The search for improved relative investment results will continue apace, and will help to foster the trends toward management decentralization and portfolio turnover noted a moment ago A highly-institutionalized market will mak~ it more difficult for the professionals to out\u00ad pace \"the averages,\" which should surprise no one who recognizes that, in any period, one-half of all equity dollars are destined to have a below-average performance. Perform\u00ad a?-ce measurement should become more ra\u00ad tional, however, as we learn how to measure investment risk (many investors will learn this the hard way), and as investors develop a healthy skepticism-frequently based upon costly experience-about the ability to pro\u00ad ject past performance into the future. My own ability to look to the future, too, should be viewed by you with a healthy skep\u00ad ticism. I am confident that few will wholly endorse the views presented above, but all February 24, 1969 should be aware that the greatest danger is the failure to consider the various possibili\u00ad ties for change that lie ahead. The mutual fund industry can thrive and grow in the competitive atmosphere that confronts us. We have been, in general, re\u00ad sponsible for much of the constructive change that the institutional investor has brought to the equity markets. Our indus\u00ad try's past is illustrious, and our future is bright. But only if we avoid the pitfalls our success may create; only if we continue to move forward with vitality; and only if we can retain those qualities that John W. Gardner tells us are too often transitory. He is warning us, as well as all institutions of every type, when he says: \"What is all too transitory is that fine moment when an in\u00ad stitution ls responding with vigor and rele\u00ad vance to the needs of its day, when its morale and vitality are high, when it holds itself to unsparing standards of perform\u00ad ance.\" CHART !.-INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP OF EQUITIES (Dollar amounts in billions) Percent 1954 1968 change Personal trust funds _______________ $37. 0 $87.0 +140 Corporate pension funds ___________ +1360 Mutual funds _______ -------------- 5.5 42.8 +680 Charitable trust funds _____________ 7.0 15. 0 +no Fire and casualty insurance 6.1 13.3 +120 companies _________ ------------ Life insurance companies _____ ;---- 3.0 10. 7 +260 Closed end investment companies __ 3.6 8.2 +130 Banks ___________ ----------------0.8 Institutional share 25 33 *~:: 1960 ------------------------------- 3. 6 1961 ------------------------------- 5. 2 1962 ------------------------------- 4.0 1963 ------------------------------- 3. 9 1964 ------------------------------- 4. 1 1965 ------------------------------- 4.8 i~~~ =============================== 1~:~ Individual sales: 1958 -------------------------- . 4 1959 ------------------------------- 1.0 1960 ------------------------------- 2. 0 1961 ------------------------------- 2. 6 1962 ------------------------------- 3. 4 1963 ------------------------------- 4.4 1964 ----------------------- 2.5 1965 ------------------------------- 4. 4 1966 ------------------------------- 4. 9 1967 ------------------------------- 8.8 CHART 4.-Bank trust assets versus mutual fund. assets, ApriZ 1968 [In billions] Trusts: Total assets ----------------------- $253 Stocks ---------------------------- 163 Mutual funds (ICI): Total assets ----------------------- 42 Stocks ---------------------------- 36 CHART 5.-Assets of 5 largest trust com\u00ad panies versus mutual fund industry, April 1968 [In billions] Trusts: Total assets ----------------------- $61 Stocks ---------------------------- 40 Mutual funds (ICI): Total assets ----------------------- 42 Stocks ---------------------------- 36 EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS CHART 6.-Savings in insurance reserves ver\u00ad sus investment campanies, 1955-67 I In billions] Insurance reserves: 1955 ------------------------------ $5.5 1960 ------------------------------ 4.9 1965 ------------------------------ 7.6 1967 ------------------------------ 7.6 Investment companies: 1955 ----------------------------- .8 1960 ------------------------------ 1.8 1965______________________________ 2.2 1967 ------------------------------ 4.6 CHART 7.-Private noninsured. pension funds, estimated. at market value, 1956-67 (In b1111ons 1 1956: Total assets------------------------- $20 Stocks ----------------------------- 5 1967: Total assets------------------------- 86 Stocks ----------------------------- 51 Equity ratio: 1956, 25 percent; 1967, 59 percent. ROBBING THE POOR-PART 3- CHICAGO HON. JOHN M. ASHBROOK OF OHIO IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, on January 28 I inserted in the CONGRES\u00ad SIONAL RECORD the second part of a New York Times article on the abuses of the antipoverty program in New York City. The scene now switches to Chicago where an investigation by the Chicago Tribune has unearthed further examples of how the disadvantaged are swindled out of benefits allocated on their behalf. The Tribune article by William Jones appears in the Sunday edition of the Tribune of February 23 and states in part: Acting in cooperation with the Better Gov\u00ad ernment association, the Tribune obtained statements from federal officials confirming reports that thousands of taxpayers' dollars remain unaccounted for even after three months of investigation by federal auditors. The Tribune quotes the acting execu\u00ad tive director of the Better Government Association, George Bliss, as describing the job training program as \"an insult to both those who seek employment train\u00ad ing and the taxpayers who are footing the bill.\" As Mr. Bliss points out, the losers in the case of this program are the intended beneficiaries in addition to the taxpayers who funded the program. As the filing deadline for our income taxes are not too far away, now is the appropriate time to consider how our tax dollars are being used, and cases such as the Chicago affair, as outlined in the Tribune, should make us determined to see that the end to such abuses is effected. A number of items have appeared in the press during the last few weeks con\u00ad cern.ing the discontent of taxpayers at the seemingly endless upswing in taxes. Just how their tax dollars have been mis\u00ad used, as in the case of Chicago, certainly is not going to make U.S. citizens happy. It is to be hoped that a goodly number of citizens will think about the recent abuses in the use of Federal funds as they send in their income tax statements and checks and demand corrective action from Federal officials. I insert in the RECORD at this point the article, \"Job Training Fiasco Told\u00ad Theft, Bad Management Disclosed,\" written by William Jones and appearing in the Chicago Tribwie of February 23, 1969: JOB TRAINING FIASCO TOLD--THEFT, BAD MAN\u00ad AGEMENT DISCLOSED--CLASSES TEACH BLACX POWER (By William Jones) A $387,000 federally-funded program to train Chicago's hard core unemployed has ended in a fiasco of theft, mismanagement, and forged checks, a Chicago Tribune investi\u00ad gation has disclosed. The disclosures have triggered investiga\u00ad tions by state and federal agencies into the program which earmarked hundreds of thou\u00ad sands of dollars for new trucks, autos, and administrative salaries of up to $18,000 a year, but \"graduated\" only nine persons. \"It was a fiasco,\" said one program official. \"Everybody thought everybody else was watching it [the program] .\" BLACK POWER SEMINARS Another said teaching sessions frequently became black power seminars which encour\u00ad aged students to strike and threatened of\u00ad ficials with beatings. Others conceded that total losses may never be known and estimated that more than $300,000 was funneled into the program before it ended abruptly in November. Acting in cooperation with the Better Gov\u00ad ernment association. The Tribune obtained sta.tements !rom federal officials confirmlng reports that thousands of taxpayers' dol\u00ad lars remain unaccounted for even after three months of investigation by federal audi\u00ad tors. INSULT TO BOTH George Bliss, acting executive director of the B.G.A., who personally handled his agency's role in the investigation, termed the program \"an insult to both those who seek employment training and the taxpayers who are footing the bill.\" The organization that received the funds is Renewal Enterprises Inc., 4700 Washington blvd., a combination private aluminum sid\u00ad ing installation firm and vocational school subsidized with federal funds. The firm was formed last February under a $387,000 con\u00ad tract from the manpower administration office of the labor department. Another agreement was reached with the small business administration to guarantee 90 per cent of all loans up to $250,000 thru a credit llne with a Harwood Heights bank. PROVIDE VOCATIONAL TRAINING Under the terms of the contract, Renewal Enterprises was to set up and administer a 23-week program that would provide voca\u00ad tional training and basic literacy and math courses for at least 200 persons. Students were to receive salaries of from $1.60 to $2.59 an hour during the training period. At the end of the course, the firm would be expected to employ all graduates as aluminum siding applicators. The short-lived program was funded Feb. 26, 1968, and closed its doors Nov. 15. Tho the three-month audit has thus far failed to explain how all the funds were used, this much has emerged: 1. Thousands of dollars worth of tools and aluminum siding installation equipment was left on job sites when the program closed or was stolen during its operation. A federal employe in charge of recovering the equip\u00ad ment said he has collected more than $6,000 worth of government purchased equipment in recent weeks scattered thruout the Chi\u00ad cago area. The employe said the equipment was recovered thru \"anonymous phone calls.\" 4288 2. Enoch G. Matthews, 39, of 2941 Michigan av., president of Renewal Enterprises, said classroom sessions frequently reached \"riot proportions\" when instructors, whose salaries were paid by the government, emphasized black power and urged the students to walk out of the program. \"We had some near riots down there a few times,'' Matthews said. \"They backed us up against the wall a couple of ti.mes and at the suggestion of the classroom teachers they [the students] went out on strike for more money.\" 3. Chicago manpower administration offi\u00ad cials said they had been asked to fund a combination private aluminum siding and training school, but were not convinced it would succeed. Following what one official described as \"some verbal discussion with Washington,\" the Chicago office was told the program had been funded directly by the office of Stanley Ruttenburg, former assistant secretary and manpower administrator in the labor department in the Johnson admin\u00ad istration. MAKE ONLY ONE INQUIRY 4. Chicago manpower administration om.\u00ad ciaJs subsequently made only one inquiry into the program, five months after it began, according to Frank Thomas, regional director of manpower's job training office. \"Things looked pretty good then,\" said Thomas. \"It was news to us Nov. 12, when we received a call that the program had closed.\" 5. Based on statements from program offi\u00ad cials that nine persons \"graduated\" and at least $300,000 was spent in the program, the government paid more than $33 ,000 to teach each man how to apply aluminum siding. 6. At the same time, the program was pay\u00ad ing $100 a month leasing fees for each of 33 trucks and two cars with only 5 or 6 crews on the job. One official said it was his under\u00ad standing that some trucks were used by em\u00ad ployes to get to and from work. INVESTS IN PROGRAM 7. Manpower Inc., a nationwide temporary employment service with headquarters in Milwaukee, invested $5,000 in the program and had a minority representation on Re\u00ad newal's board of directors. The firm received a contract in excess of $70,000 to provide teachers for the classroom training, but it claims it collected only $20,000. Michael Freeman, Manpower general coun\u00ad sel, said the company decided to pull out in November after learning that annual salaries for program administrators exceeded $92,000 and Renewal's expenses were running double the firm's income. Lewis F. Nicolini, director of the federal regional manpower administration, which includes the Chicago area, gave this response to inquiries about the program: GUESS IT'S A BUST \"I have more things to do than talk to the Chicago Tribune. This contract was let out of Washington , and they gave us the re\u00ad sponsibility of supervising it. I guess it's a bust. On paper the program looked pretty good, but we're in an auditing situation now. It's a defunct organization with no records. \"I, nor anyone else, can say at this point whether there has been any speculation em\u00ad bezzling of funds. I do know that when the audit ls completed we will be calling a spade a spade. Nicolini said he had \"never heard of New Berlin, Wis., a $12,000- a-year vice president in Renewal Enterprises who acted as a technical coordinator of the training program. Romasko ls a building con\u00ad tractor engaged in the sale of aluminum siding who invested in the fl.rm and became an officer. AUDIT IS COMPLlCATED Nicolini said the audit and investigation by the labor department and regional solici\u00ad tor's office has been complicated by missing EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS records and efforts to document reported purchases of all typewriters, tools, office equipment, and salaries. Paul Lange., a Manpower, Inc., executive who represented his firm as treasurer on Re\u00ad newal's board of directors, said he believes such an audit wlll only frustrate investi\u00ad gators. \"I'll bet every trainee that went thru that program has the finest workshop in the city of Chicago,'' said Langa. \"It was a fiasco. Everybody thought everybody else was watch\u00ad ing it (the program]. Several ti.mes we asked for information and didn't get it. We could tell them what to do, but we couldn't make them dolt.\" SENDS EMPLOYE HERE Langa said Manpower's $70,000 contract was to teach math and reading to the stu\u00ad dents. He said the firm sent one employe to Chicago who recruited teachers from among residents of the area. \"Our primary interest in screening for teachers is compassion and empathy,\" said Langa. \"The educational background and teaching experience of the person is not as important.\" PART OF THEO:R:Y In connection with charges that black power seminars frequently disrupted the pro\u00ad gram, Langa said: \"It's very conceivable that based on our approach to teaching, our teachers would use such a technique on specific persons who had expressed an interest in the black power movement. It's part of our theory that a student wlll respond better to something in which he ls interested.\" Matthews, president of Renewal and a re\u00ad tired air force officer receiving disability pay, said he was recruited for the post of president by Manpower, Inc., representatives. He said he had no background in vocational training but was told a \"black man\" with an administrative background was needed. Matthews ls a Negro. \"We had the scum of the west side in that program,\" said Matthews. \"You'd lay a pencil down, and it would be gone. I took my prob\u00ad lems to the labor department, but all I got was sympathy and a warning that I couldn't spend more than the $387 ,000 called for in the contract.\" TWO CHECKS STOLEN Matthews said he also had determined that at least two checks had been stolen from his desk during the program. He said they were cashed in the names of payees in the program. Matthews criticized the lack of qualified personnel to teach students and described some of the teachers as \"ex-housewives and high school dropouts themselves , almost as hard core as some of the students.\" \"It's very obvious that it fell apart because they were in desperate need of some help that we were unable to give them,\" said Daniel P. Harley, regional director of the bureau of work training in the manpower administra\u00ad tion office. Harley said his office covers a seven-state area and finds it impossible to properly monitor such programs and provide counseling. REBffiTH OF MERCHANT MARINE VITAL IN MODERN GOLD RUSH HON. BOB WILSON OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. BOB WILSON. Mr. Speaker, our national decline in maritime power be\u00ad comes increasingly critical. We must be\u00ad gin to plug the gap in our oceanic endeavors and to reassert our maritime February 24, 1969 prominence. The following editorial from the San Diego Evening Tribune and speech by Charles F. Duchein, national president of the Navy League of the United States, gives ample testimony to our present plight in maritime affairs and the need for forward-looking leader\u00ad ship and action in this vital field: [From the San Diego (Calif.) Tribune, Jan. 27, 1969] REBmTH OF MERCHANT MARINE VITAL IN MODERN GOLD RUSH The United States of America may miss the boat in the modern gold rush, challeng\u00ad ing the world's last frontier-the oceans-\u00ad according to the president of the Navy League of the United States. Charles F. Duchein told a San Francisco meeting of the Commonwealth Club of Cali\u00ad fornia, \"We are tampering with the long\u00ad term prosperity Of this nation through our vacillation and neglect of what can be the chief stimulator of the national economy\u00ad the foundation of our future prosperity\u00ad and this is to rebuild our maritime posture to a position of world preeminence.\" Duchein's concern is warranted. Statistics revealed in NATO's Fifteen Na\u00ad tions publication paint a picture of dwindling U.S. maritime strength that cannot be ig\u00ad nored. The situation is made particularly urgent by the fact that the United States depends more and more on foreign trade for survival. At the close of World War II, the United States had about 5,000 ships, totaling more than 50 mlllion tons, on the high seas. The fleet now stands at under 1,000 active ships-- 80 per cent more than 20 years old-totaling about 14 milllon tons. The Russian merchant fleet, on the other hand, has grown since 1950 from 432 ships to an impressive 1,400 ships of some 11 milllon tons. It is estimated that within three years, Russia will have outstripped the U.S. Al\u00ad ready the Soviet has begun a world trade offensive. To Russia, however, a powerful merchant fleet means more than economic power. It is also a major tool to promote Communist ideology and action. Soviet ships sustain Castro in Cuba. They carry Red policy as well as goods to the new nations of Africa. They keep North Viet\u00ad nam in the war. Our national leaders are well aware of changing pattern of naval balance. The mer\u00ad chant fleet was considered in a recent re\u00ad port of the House Armed Services Committee chaired by Mendel Rivers, D-S.C. The report, prepared by a 22-man special subcommittee of the National Security Council, dealt with the \"Changing Strategic Naval Balance, U.S.S.R. vs. U.S.A.\" The Soviet Merchant Marine, according to the committee study, has risen from 21st rank in 1950 to fifth in 1968. \"The free world countries grew strong and stayed free through control of the seas, in\u00ad cluding leadership in global conference,\" the report points out. \"The Soviet Union, how\u00ad ever, is being allowed to take the position of maritime supremacy that hitherto has be\u00ad longed to the seavoyaging free nations of the West.\" The conclusion of the study was that a major build-up of U.S. sea power is called for, both military and merchant fleet. The Navy League has also adopted that position. According to the naval balance report, \"If the United States proceeds at full speed to augment its naval forces, the Soviet Union will not be able to wrest the trident from America's grasp.\" The Navy League has proposed a five-point program to restore our merchant :fleet to a preeminent position: The United States must form a maritime policy providing incentive to gain a com\u00ad petitive maritime position on the oceans of the world. The failure of our government to February 24, 1969 formulate basic policy is the most critical element in cleaning up \"the mess in the merchant marine.\" Our nation must orient its national stra\u00ad tegy to the oceans of the world, just as the Kremlin has done in recent years. America must go after the merchant marine market by building at least 100 ships a year for the next 10 years. Oceanic education must be fostered in our schools to give our youth as good a subject grounding in the seas as they now receive on the land environment. A Sea Grant Col\u00ad lege program must be pursued to mobilize scientists, scholars and students in the search for oceanic solutions to the problems of state. A Maritime Manhattan Project must be created to stimulate maritime technological advances. The critical nature of the decline in Amer\u00ad ican seapower demands that the U.S. main\u00ad tain and increase its supremacy on the oceans by building a larger and more modern fleet. The freedom of the United States and its allies is anchored in control of the oceans. That is why we need a rebirth of the U.S. Merchant Marine. [From the Navy Magazine, February 1969) THE PRESIDENT 'S MESSAGE: NAVAL LEADERSHIP AND THE NATIONAL OCEANIC DESTINY \"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to for\u00ad tune-\" (Shakespeare) . Special significance attends the selection of the Governor of the maritime state of Rhode Island to the civilian leadership of the naval establishment. A brilliant oceanic mosaic is unfolding as John H. Chafee, a Marine, ascends the gangway, steps aboard and breaks his personal flag. The exciting American renaissance developing at sea augers well for the future ~ecurlty a~d eco\u00ad nomic prosperity of the nation. Maritime op\u00ad portunities are at an historic high. Vision, enlightenment and determination are called for to meet the mounting menace of burgeoning Soviet maritime strength. Ad\u00ad mittedly, regaining a preeminent American oceanic posture, to a marked degree, will de\u00ad pend on the leadership provided. But the key to capitalize upon this current trend of events is conviction. The crux of meeting this national challenge is maritime program. Certainly, an understanding of the oceans is the fundamental building block for the na\u00ad tional naval leadership to foster the mag\u00ad nitude of the program that ls now needed. Though the educational aspects are para\u00ad mount, the formulation of basic maritime doctrine for the guidance of our government is imperative in seeking seabased strategic ''sufficiency.\" NAVY SPARKS SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS Traditionally, the Navy has provided the oceanic motivation, the initiative and intel\u00ad lectual incentives needed by the Nation. Un\u00ad derstandably, both the Commander-in-Chief and the Congress have looked to the naval service and its civilian head for professional guidance and the scientific spark to foster national maritime progress. Interestingly, it was at Rhode Island Uni\u00ad versity, under Governor Cha.fee's steward\u00ad ship, that the Sea Grant College program was launched by Dr. Athelstan Spllhaus, as\u00ad sisted by Dean Knauss. With the university sparking an educational and oceanic re\u00ad search program of revolutionary implication, Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island spearheaded the Sea Grant College legisla\u00ad tion through Congress to create a counter\u00ad part to the rewarding Land Grant College program. Although in its infancy, the Sea Grant prograin has created an appreciable surge in ocean study. Unprecedented interest in ocean related disciplines and studies has been stimulated on college campuses EXTENSIONS OF REMARKS throughout the country. Already the re\u00ad sponse of American scientists, scholars and students has been electrifying. But the in\u00ad centives provided by enlightened leadership for the entire maritime program require re\u00ad inforcement. Oceanic purpose must flow from national maritime policy. The reori\u00ad entation of the American endeavor to the basic pursuit of the full range of oceanic activity and world trade, from a truly com\u00ad petitive, modern structure, Will require pub\u00ad lic understanding as well as intellectual de\u00ad velopment in depth. Consequently, at the in\u00ad stigation of the Chief of Naval Operations, the League has broadly encouraged this ocean-oriented intellectual endeavor. The Naval War College at Newport, R. I., the nation's center of intellectual leadership for the study and development of new con\u00ad cepts of naval and maritime power, is ideally suited to foster this understanding. At its global strategy seminar each year, leaders in all walks of life glean an insight into oceanic strategy and the import of the oceans relative to the national welfare. Highlighted at each seminar are the options afforded by the oceans toward solving the pressing prob\u00ad lems of state. SERVICE CHAMPION As civilian spokesman for the naval serv\u00ad ices, the Secretary of the Navy endeavors to interject the maritime view convincingly into the process of our government. With the pro\u00ad fessional support of the Chief of Naval Oper\u00ad ations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Secretary of the Navy is respected as the most knowledgeable civ111an leader on maritime matters within the government. Unfortunately with the passage of the Na\u00ad tional Security Act of 1947, the Secretary of the Navy was removed from the President's Cabinet. Since the Cabinet now ls deprived of a spokesman capable of the direct inter\u00ad jection of the maritime viewpoint into its deliberations, the crucially significant role of the civilian head of the naval services is accentuated. The pledges of the President to provide a Navy \"second to none\" and to revitalize the Merchant Marine, as a \"first priority eco\u00ad nomic task\", with emphasis on resolute oceanic research, are given marked credibility by his selection of the new Secretary. We are confident that Governor Chaffee brings to the Navy and the Marine Oorps the civllian lead\u00ad ership and the service championship dis\u00ad couraged in recent years in the defense de\u00ad cision making process. In welcoming the new Secretary aboard, the Navy League commends for his considera\u00ad tion the substance of our Declaration of Ob\u00ad jectives and Resolutions. With broad public support, this projected maritime program provides potential for the President to build the modern mobile posture required to meet his worldWide responsib111ties. Welcome aboard, Mr. Secretary! We look to you for positive leadership and a strong civil\u00ad ian championship of the Service. In turn, we pledge the fullest measure of our purposes to assist you in the challenging responsibil\u00ad ities you have assumed on behalf of this great maritime nation. CHARLES F. DUCHEIN, Natianal President, Navy League of the United States. SENTINEL POSES THREAT TO NON\u00ad PROLIFERATION PARTY HON. WILLIAM F. RYAN OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, February 24, 1969 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, the basic in\u00ad consistency of the proposed Sentinel 4289 anti-ballistic missile system was pointed out in a February 24 editorial which appeared in the New York Times. As that editorial points out, the Nuclear Non\u00ad Proliferation Treaty, which hopefully represents a first tentative step toward reducing the threat of nuclear war, could be seriously undermined if the admin\u00ad istration proceeds with plans to deploy a new antiballistic missile system. Non\u00ad nuclear Powers, which have approved the treaty, might question whether the United States indeed has a \"good faith\" interest in nuclear disarmament and Possibly reassess their own decision not to develop nuclear arms. This, in turn, could only result in an increase in the insecurity which is posed by existent nu\u00ad clear stockpiles. Instead of proceeding with the Sentinel system, the adminis\u00ad tration should enter into negotiations with the Soviet Union to limit-not en\u00ad large--reliance UPon offensive and de\u00ad fensive missile systems. The editorial follows: THE SENTINEL AND THE TREATY In his questioning of Secretary of State Rogers on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty Sena.tor Albert Gore has exposed a funda\u00ad mental inconsistency in the Administration's apparent resolve to push ahead With some sort of Sentinel antiballistic missile system\u00ad s. resolve made more explicit last week by Secretary of Defense Laird. Mr. Gore noted that under Article VI of the treaty the nu\u00ad clear powers undertake \"to pursue negotia\u00ad tions in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarma\u00ad ment.\" The Sentinel program provides a critical test of how seriously the United States views its obligations under that article. If there is a \"good faith\" interest in nuclear disarma\u00ad ment, then the logical step would be to post\u00ad pone deployment of the Sentinel system while the United States enters into negotia\u00ad tions With the Soviet Union to limit offen\u00ad sive and defensive strategic missiles. If, in\u00ad stead, the Administration decides to proceed With Sentinel deployment on the distorted logic that accelerating the atomic arms race somehow leads to nuclear disarmament , then it w111 be apparent that the United States regards Article VI as little more than a pious statement imposing no obligations upon the nuclear powers. Something far more important is at stake, however , than Just this country's interpre\u00ad tation of Article VI. At issue is the whole future of the treaty, a matter that is likely to come up in President Nixon's European discussions this week. So far as the non-nuclear states are con\u00ad cerned, the article was one of the more im\u00ad portant concessions made by the two major nuclear powers in drafting the treaty. If the United States and the Soviet Union now indicate that they do not feel bound in any way by the article, then some of the more important non-nuclear states, such as Japan, Israel and India, can ask With good reason why they should take the treaty now of com\u00ad plete nuclear abstinence. By proceeding With the Sentinel system, therefore, the United States can jeopardize the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Even if the military utility of the system were much less dubious than it is, this would be a bad risk to run. In the long run, the spread of nuclear weapons undoubtedly presents a far greater danger than the still non-existent nuclear missiles in Communist China or the unproved usefulness of Sentinel as a bargain\u00ad ing counter in arms talks with Moscow.
