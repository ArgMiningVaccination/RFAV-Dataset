Introduction On December 6, 1991, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Ad- ministration (OSHA) enacted regulations concerning occupationalexposure to bloodborne pathogens. On January 8, 1993, CAL/OSHA published final Bloodborne Pathogens Rule (Title 8 CCR GISO 5193). The primary goal of this regulation is to minimize occupational expo-sure to hepatitis B (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), andother potentially infectious bloodborne agents. While the regulation isdirected primarily toward hospital, clinical, and other patient care facilities, it also covers all occupations where exposure to human blood or other potentially infectious materials may occur. Past experience regarding the potential for transmission of HBV and HIV in health care settings has resulted in an approach to infection control termed Universal Precautions (MMWR, August 21, 1987), a safety concept that assumes all blood, blood products, and certain bodyfluids to be contaminated with HIV, HBV, or other bloodborne patho-gens, and requires that appropriate safety precautions be taken whenhandling or working with these materials. A description of Universal Precautions can be found in Appendix A. The Universal Precautions concept continues to be the fundamental premise of working with these materials. However, implementation ofthe new OSHA regulation also places additional requirements on Stanford University. These additional requirements include: specific identification of all employees who are \"occupationally exposed\" (Criteria for determining the risk of occupational expo-sure to Hepatitis B or other bloodborne pathogens can be foundin Appendix B); development of a written exposure control plan that requires specified work practices and personal protective equipment to beused; offering HBV vaccinations to any employee considered to be \"occupationally exposed\"; development of post-exposure follow-up procedures; mandatory training programs, initial and annual update; and recordkeeping to document compliance with the regulation. This manual, along with Stanford's bloodborne pathogen training program, is intended to help you learn more about preventing transmis- sion of bloodborne diseases in the workplace and the requirements ofthe OSHA standard.2Notes: B. Information and Training Requirements of the OSHA Standard The OSHA standard requires every employer to provide information and training to all employees who are occupationally exposed. Ingeneral, employers must ensure that all employees with occupational exposure participate in a training program, training must be provided at the time of employment and at least annually thereafter, and material appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educa- tional level, literacy, and language of employees must be used. OSHA also requires specific elements be covered in the training program. These include: ensuring a copy of the standard is accessible to all employees and explaining the contents of the standard to ensure employ- ees know their rights under the standard, providing information to employers regarding the epidemiol- ogy and symptoms of bloodborne diseases, discussion of the modes of transmission of bloodborne patho- gens, review of the contents of the employer's Exposure Control Plan, discussion of appropriate methods for recognizing activities that may involve exposure to blood and other potentiallyinfected materials, use and limitations of practices that will prevent or reduce exposure including appropriate engineering controls, workpractices, and personal protective equipment, types, proper use, location, removal, handling, decontamina- tion and/or disposal of personal protective equipment, basis for selection of personal protective equipment, information on the hepatitis B vaccination, including its effi- cacy, safety, and the benefits of being vaccinated, appropriate actions to take and persons to contact in an emer- gency involving human blood or other potentially infectious materials, procedures to follow if an exposure incident occurs, and explanation of the signs and labels and/or color coding re- quired by the standard. At Stanford, these provisions apply to anyone potentially exposed to blood or bloodborne pathogens, including students, visitors, volun-teers, etc.3Notes: II. BLOODBORNE PATHOGEN TRAINING PROGRAM A. Availability of the OSHA Standard and Overview of its Contents A copy of the OSHA Standard entitled Bloodborne Pathogens (Title 8 CCR GISO 5193), is available at Stanford's Department of EnvironmentalHealth and Safety (EH&S). A copy is also included as Appendix C. TheOSHA Bloodborne Pathogen standard includes the sections listed belowwith a brief description of the requirements or contents of each section. B. Sections of the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard 1. Scope and Application - specifies the workplaces that are covered by this standard. All workplaces where occupational exposure to blood orother potentially infectious materials, as defined in the next section, arecovered by the standard. 2. Definitions - includes 28 definitions, the most important being the definition of blood , other potentially infectious materials , and occupational exposure . Blood means human blood, human blood components, and products made from human blood. Other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) means (1) the following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid,synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amnioticfluid, saliva in dental procedures, any other body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood such as saliva or vomitus, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate betweenbody fluids such as emergency response; (2) any unfixed tissue or organ(other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and (3) HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV- or HBV- containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV. Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infec- tious materials that may result form the performance of an employee's duties. 3. Exposure control - has two primary requirements: the development of an Exposure Control Plan, designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposure; and the requirement to prepare an exposure determination, a description of how employees are designated as having an \"occupa-tional exposure\".4Notes: 4. Methods of compliance - describes the specific methods employers must use to comply with the OSHA standard. In general, UniversalPrecautions, found in Appendix C, are to be used when appropriate.In addition, the section describes, in detail, the engineering and work practice controls the employer must utilize to eliminate or minimize exposure. These are described in the Exposure Control Plan. 5. HIV and HBV research laboratories and production facilities - this section specifies additional requirements for research laboratories and production facilities engaged in the culture, production, concen- tration, experimentation, and manipulation of HIV and HBV. It doesnot apply to clinical or diagnostic laboratories engaged solely in theanalysis of blood, tissues, or organs. Laboratories falling in thisdesignation must adopt special practices and must have specific biosafety procedures written for the lab. 6. Hepatitis B vaccination and post-exposure evaluation and follow- up - describes the requirements for making HBV vaccine available to occupationally exposed employees and the requirements to provide for post-exposure medical evaluation and follow-up. 7. Communication of hazards to employees - describes the require- ments for labeling containers, and the types of identifying signs andlabels to be used to indicate the possible presence of a bloodborne pathogen. Also, this section contains the specific requirements for the information and training that must be provided to employees. 8. Recordkeeping - this section covers two areas related to documen- tation and maintenance of medical and training records. Occupa- tional medical records are maintained by Stanford University in accordance with applicable regulations regarding content and confi-dentiality. Training records will be maintained in accordance withapplicable regulations. 9. Dates of Implementation - The effective implementation dates for the components of the standard are: An exposure determination was completed by March 8, 1993. An Exposure Control Plan was completed on March 8, 1993. The provisions for information and training were in effect by April 8, 1993. The provision for recordkeeping was in effect by April 8, 1993. The schedule and implementation for Engineering and Work Practice Controls, Personal Protective Equipment, Housekeep- ing, HIV and HBV Research Laboratories and Production Facili-ties, Hepatitis B Vaccination and Post-Exposure Follow-up, andlabels and signs were completed by May 8, 1993.5Notes: 10. Appendix A: Hepatitis B vaccine declination - requires employees who decline to accept the hepatitis B vaccination offered by the em-ployer to sign a specified statement. A copy of the Stanford declinationstatement is may be found in Appendix B of this document. C. Infectious Diseases and Modes of Transmission A microorganism is a living organism which is usually visible only with a microscope. Disease producing microorganisms include viruses,bacteria, parasites, and fungi. A virus is a microorganism usually only visible with the aid of an elec- tron microscope. Viruses normally reside within other living (host) cells and cannot reproduce outside of a living cell. Thus, if a virus is presenton a surface or object, it cannot reproduce. Bacteria are types of living microorganisms that can produce disease in a suitable host. Bacteria can self-reproduce and some produce toxins that are harmful to their host. Since bacteria can multiply outside the cell, i.e., on surfaces or objects, the proper cleaning of equipment is critical. Items, such as bag-valvemasks, have been implicated in the spread of disease from one person toanother. Infection is the growth of pathogenic organisms in the tissues of a host, with or without detectable signs of injury. A pathogen is a microorgan-ism that can cause disease. Typically, infection occurs when the body isinvaded by a pathogenic organism, such as a virus or bacteria, whichreproduces, causing illness or disease. An antibody is a component of the immune system that eliminates or counteracts a foreign substance (antigen) in the body. Infection control efforts are designed to prevent infection from occur- ring in either persons who work with material that might be infectious or transmission of infectious agents to patients. Effective infection control procedures (such as the use of personal pro- tective equipment (PPE), proper cleaning/decontamination practices,immunizations, etc.) are the main focus of preventing the transmission of infectious agents, and are covered in detail under discussion of Uni- versal Precautions in Section F of this training guide. Infectious disease results from invasion of a host by disease-producing (pathogenic) organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.6Notes: Several infectious diseases are foodborne, i.e., transmitted by the ingestion of contaminated food. For example, mayonnaise can containstaph bacteria. Unrefrigerated food containing mayonnaise providesan effective growth medium for the bacteria, allowing them to multi-ply over time. When this occurs, those who eat the food may get ill. Similarly, eggs that are cracked or broken often contain salmonella bacteria which can be transmitted during ingestion. A communicable disease is a disease that can be transmitted from one person to another. It is also known as a contagious disease. Not all infectious diseases are communicable. As noted above, salmonella is a highly infectious disease, but it is not communicable \u2014 it is not nor-mally transmitted from one person to another. On the other hand,chicken pox is an infectious disease that is also communicable \u2014 it caneasily be transmitted from one person to another. A communicable disease can be spread two ways; by direct or indirect transmission. Direct transmission occurs when an organism passes directly from one person to another due to direct contact with infected blood orother body fluids. For example, you are trying to control bleeding in a person with a lacerated arm. The person's blood drips onto your hand and you have a cut on your palm. This direct contact with a person'sblood can result in the transmission of the organism that can causedisease. Indirect transmission occurs without direct person-to-person contact. The organism passes from one person to another indirectly, i.e., via some contaminated object. The infected person leaves blood or otherbody fluids on some object; another person gets the disease-causingorganism upon contact with the contaminated object. For example, alaboratory worker cuts his hand on a glass shard contaminated with an infected person's blood during clean-up operations and later devel- ops hepatitis B. The disease is indirectly transmitted to the lab workerthrough the glass shard contaminated with blood. Not All Pathogen Exposure Results in Infection. The body's immune system is designed to provide protection from disease. An antigen is a substance that the body recognizes as foreign, including many patho-gens. The immune system then creates protective antibodies to fightthe invading antigen. The presence of antibodies in the blood mayindicate exposure to a disease-causing organism. This is the basis of tests for HBV and HIV infection. A person who develops antibodies after an exposure is said to seroconvert. Seroconversion is a term used to describe a change in the status of7Notes: one's serum. It means that a test result for a specific component which was previously negative is now positive. For example, a person isexposed to the HIV virus. He is tested and the results are negative.Six weeks later, the person is again tested and the test is now positive. The person has seroconverted. Post-Exposure Terminology and ConceptsThe window phase is the time from exposure to the organism until one tests positive for the infection. This time will vary from one indi- vidual to another, depending on the response by the individual'simmune system. Someone in the window phase may test negative butactually be positive and able to spread the organism. For example,with HIV testing, the window phase is from one to twelve weeks. In other words, from the time the person is exposed to the virus, it may take twelve weeks from the blood test to show positive. If a person isexposed to HBV, the window phase or the time to positive test is oneto four weeks. Incubation is the time period from exposure to the organism until the first appearance of signs or symptoms of disease. This varies witheach disease. For example, the incubation period for HBV is up to 200days post-exposure, while for HIV the incubation period is up to tenyears post-exposure. Thus, simply testing personnel immediately after an exposure is not always enough. Follow-up testing \u2014 based on the incubation period and window phase of the specific disease \u2014 isalso required. The following figure illustrates this concept. X = Exposure Y = Positive TestZ = Signs, Symptoms of disease Incubation Period WindowPhase Disease X Z Y Time >Understanding the difference between Incubation Period and the Window Phase in testing X to Y = Window Phase X to Z = Incubation Period8Notes: Diseases and Their Transmission The transmission of communicable disease takes place primarily by direct or indirect contact with contaminated blood or other body fluids. Bloodborne transmitted diseases are spread by direct contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Bloodborne diseases include, but are not limited to: HIV/AIDS, HBV, hepatitis C, and syphilis. Bloodborne diseases may be spread by either virus orbacteria. For example, HIV, HBV and non-A and non-B hepatitis arecaused by viruses. However, syphilis is a sexually transmitted infec-tious disease that is caused by bacteria. Airborne transmitted diseases are spread by contact with droplets of the disease-producing organism that have been expelled into the airby a productive cough or sneeze. Direct contact with infected secre-tions may also play a role. Airborne diseases include, but are not limited to, tuberculosis (TB), meningitis, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox. For example, the disease-producing organism that causes tuber-culosis lives in the lungs. To spread the disease, the person maycough up aerosols containing the organism and another person mustbe close enough to inhale the aerosols. Health Effects Many communicable diseases have potential for causing serious long-term effects. For example, most childhood diseases acquired byadults result in more severe symptoms and often are accompanied by serious complications, such as pneumonia. Hepatitis B and C may result in chronic hepatitis, liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver or death.HIV currently has a very high mortality rate; however, new drugtherapies are resulting in a prolonged life span. TB is a treatabledisease and, historically, minimal long-term effects have been re- ported. However, in recent years health care workers have been infected with a strain of TB that is resistant to standard antibiotics.This may have some significant long-term effects. Assessing Risk of Infection Any exposure to a bloodborne pathogen carries a certain amount of risk. An exposure occurs whenever there is contact with blood orother body fluids through open wounds, mucous membranes, orparenteral routes. The degree of risk depends on the degree of expo- sure and evaluation of other risk. Four factors critical in assessing one's personal risk potential in an exposure situation are the organ-ism, dosage, virulence, and host resistance.9Notes: 1. Organism Identification - Identification of the causative agent is criti- cal. As noted previously, a virus cannot reproduce outside of a livingcell; on the other hand, bacteria can self-reproduce. Also, some organ- isms are more readily transmitted than others. 2. Dosage of the Organism - Dosage refers to the number of viable (live) organisms received during an exposure. Each illness requires a certainnumber of infectious agents to be present in order to cause disease/ illness. For example, 10 hepatitis B viruses in one milliliter of blood may be all that is needed to spread the infection, while 100,000 HIV viralparticles per milliliter may be needed. 3. Virulence of the Organism - Virulence is the disease-evoking power of the organism - the strength or ability of the bacteria or virus to infect or overcome bodily defenses. This will vary from one organism to an-other. 4. Host Resistance - Host resistance is the ability of the host to fight infection. Infection occurs as a result of an interruption in the body's normal defense mechanisms. Typically, the healthier you are, the lesslikely you will become ill. Nature of Exposure in Bloodborne Disease Risk of infection by bloodborne pathogens varies according to the type of exposure. The list below was published by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) to help evaluate risk levels. Risk levelincreases from top to bottom. Blood/body fluid contact to intact skin (low risk). Blood/body fluid contact to the mucous membrane surface of the eyes, nose, or mouth (low risk). Blood/body fluid contact with an open area of the skin (medium risk). Cuts with sharp objects covered with blood/body fluid (medium risk). Contaminated needle-stick injury (high risk). Laboratory workers handling and working with blood, body fluids, and tissue cultures of disease organisms will always face exposure risks.Although we can use measures to reduce risk, we cannot create a 100%risk-free environment. Supervisors need to review work-associated riskswith personnel, especially newly hired employees. Exposure Assessment Summary Exposure does not mean infection. However, avoiding exposure doesmean avoiding infection. Personnel can avoid exposure by practicingeffective infection control practices.10Notes: 1. Extracted from \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens\", FR Vol 56 No. 235, Dec. 6, 1991.The disease process has four components; the infectious agent, the means of transmission, the route of exposure, and the host carrier. All of these components must be present for disease to occur. Infectioncan be prevented by interrupting the disease process at any of thesepoints. This can be accomplished by following good infection controlpractices and having an understanding of diseases and their transmis- sion. This enables you to ensure that the risk of infection remains low. Infection Can Be Prevented By Interrupting the Disease Proces Means of Transmission Direct IndirectInfectious Agent Virulence Dosage Host Host resistance Protective Measures Routes of Exposure Airborne Bloodborne Foodborne D. Epidemiology and Symptoms of Bloodborne Diseases1 Certain pathogenic microorganisms can be found in the blood of infected individuals. For purposes of this standard, OSHA refers to these microorganisms as \"bloodborne pathogens\" and to the diseases that they cause as \"bloodborne diseases\". These bloodborne patho-gens may be transmitted from the infected individual to other indi-viduals by blood or certain other body fluids, for example, whenblood-contaminated needles are shared by intravenous drug users. Because it is the exposure to the blood or other body fluids that carries the risk of infection, individuals whose occupation duties place themat risk of exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materialsare also at risk of becoming infected with these bloodborne patho-gens, developing disease, and in some cases, dying. Infected individu- als are also capable of transmitting the pathogens to others. Communicable diseases, those capable of being transmitted from person-to-person, are not new and include many commonly knowndiseases such as: Pneumonia Chicken pox Meningitis Hepatitis Measles Rubella Influenza Tuberculosis11Notes: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Communicable diseases include not only those pathogens capable of being transmitted by a bloodborne route, but also those capable of transmission through airborne or foodborne routes. For purposes of the OSHA-required training, this program will focus primarily on discussion of two of the most significant bloodborne patho-gens; hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Included is a discussion of each of the viruses, the disease each causes, modes of transmission, and documented risk of infection resulting from occupa-tional exposure. Hepatitis Virus Hepatitis means \"inflammation of the liver\" and can be caused by a number of agents or conditions including drugs, toxins, autoimmunedisease, and infectious agents including viruses. The most commoncauses of hepatitis are viruses. There are four types of viral hepatitis that are important as occupational health risks in the U.S. Hepatitis A, formerly called \"infectious\" hepatitis, is spread by fecal contamination and is not generally considered to be a significant risk inthe occupational setting. Hepatitis B, formerly called \"serum\" hepatitis, is a major risk to healthcare workers and others in occupations that involve the handlingand manipulation of human blood and certain other body fluids. It isoften referred to as HBV. Hepatitis D, or delta hepatitis, may co-infect with hepatitis B or may infect persons already infected with HBV, and can increase the severityof acute and chronic liver disease in these individuals. Non-A, Non-B hepatitis is caused by viral agents other than hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Two that have been identified are hepatitis E, previ- ously known as enterically transmitted (ET) non-A, non-B C, previously known as parenterally transmitted non-A, non-Bhepatitis. Hepatitis E is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and has occurred both in epidemic and sporadic forms in parts of Asia, North and West Africa,and Mexico. It is not known whether the virus is present in the UnitedStates or western Europe. Hepatitis C is known to be efficiently transmitted by blood transfusion12Notes: and by needle sharing among IV drug users. There have been some reports of occasional transmission of HCV to health care workers. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Hepatitis B virus is the major infectious bloodborne occupational hazard to healthcare workers. The CDC estimates that there are ap-proximately 8,700 infections in healthcare workers with occupationalexposure to blood and other potentially infectious materials in theUnited States each year. These infections cause over 2,100 cases of clinical acute hepatitis, 400-440 hospitalizations, and approximately 200 deaths each year in healthcare workers alone. Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus that attacks and repli- cates in liver cells. The virus has an inner core and an outer shell structure. The inner core contains DNA, enzymes, and various pro- teins, including the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B eantigen (HBeAg). The outer shell is composed of lipoprotein calledhepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which is produced in great excessby liver cells replicating the virus, and is found in the form of small spheres and larger tubular particles in the blood of infected persons. There is a readily available laboratory test for HBsAg and its presencein blood indicates that an individual is currently infected with theHBV, and is potentially infectious to others. Infection with the hepatitis B virus in a susceptible person can pro- duce two types of outcomes: self-limited acute hepatitis B and chronicHBV infection. The most frequent response seen in healthy adults isdevelopment of self-limited acute hepatitis and the production of anantibody against HBsAg, called anti-HBs. The production of the antibody coincides with the destruction of liver cells containing the virus, elimination of the virus from the body, and signifies lifetimeimmunity against reinfection. Unfortunately, the destruction of liver cells in an attempt to rid the body of this infection often leads to clinically apparent acute hepatitis B. About one third of infected individuals have no symptoms wheninfected with the virus, one third have a relatively mild clinical courseof a flu-like illness which is usually not diagnosed as hepatitis, andone third have a much more severe clinical course with jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin), dark urine, extreme fatigue, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, and sometimes joint pain, rash, and fever.These symptoms require hospitalization in about 20% of jaundicedcases, and often cause several weeks to months of work loss even inthose cases that do not require hospitalization. Fulminant hepatitis, which is about 85% fatal with even the most advanced medical care, develops in about 1-2% of reported acute hepatitis B cases, and in an13Notes: estimated 1 per 1,000 HBV infections. The second type of response-development of chronic HBV infec- tion-has more severe long-term consequences. About 6-10% of newly-infected adults cannot clear the virus from their liver cells and become chronic HBV carriers. These individuals continue toproduce HBsAg form many years, usually for life. HBV carriersare at high risk of developing chronic persistent hepatitis (25%),chronic active hepatitis (25%), cirrhosis of the liver, and primary liver cancer, called primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC). Chronic HBV infection has been estimated to cause 10% of the25,000-30,000 deaths that occur due to cirrhosis in the U.S. eachyear, and about 25-33% of all PHC cases, or 750-1,000 PHC casesannually result from HBV infection. HBV: Modes of Transmission In the workplace, HBV is spread via parenteral (by direct inocula-tion through the skin) or mucous membrane (blood contamina-tion of the eye or mouth) routes. The most efficient mode of transmission is direct inoculation of infectious blood, such as might occur during blood transfusion, needle sharing by IV drugusers, or needlestick or other sharp instrument injury in occupa-tionally exposed workers. Direct inoculation of infectious bloodmay occur in less apparent ways. Preexisting lesions on hands from injuries incurred at the workplace or at home, or from der- matitis, may provide a route of entry for the virus. In addition,transfer of contaminated blood via inanimate objects or environ-mental surfaces has been shown to cause infection in thehealthcare workplace. One milliliter (ml) of HBsAg positive blood may contain 100 million infectious doses of virus; thus exposure to extremely smallinocula of HBV-positive blood may transmit infection. In differ-ent studies, 7-30% of susceptible healthcare workers sustaining needlestick puncture injuries from HBsAg positive patients be- came infected if they did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis. While there has been concern about the potential infectivity of aerosols generated by dental, medical, and laboratory equipment, and although HBsAg may be found in large particles of \"spatter\" that travel short distances, there is no known data that links HBVtransmission with aerosols through inhalation. HBV: Epidemiology HBV infection does not occur uniformly in the U.S. population. There is a substantial difference in the reported numbers of hepa-14Notes: titis B cases by geographic region. The presence of certain popula- tions with a high percentage of individuals who are carriers may result in higher prevalence rates for certain defined areas, such asparts of Alaska and the U.S. Trust Territories. HBV infection is moreprevalent in certain ethnic and racial groups, and is especially preva-lent in certain \"high risk\" groups defined by occupation and lifestyle. The prevalence of HBV antibodies in the general population, reflect- ing the percentage of the population ever infected, is 3-4% for whitesand 13-14% for blacks. Foreign born Asians have a prevalence ofantibody of greater than 50%. The HBsAg prevalence, reflecting thepercentage of the population who are HBV carries, is 0.2% for whites, 0.7% for blacks, and up to 13% for foreign born Asians. The high prevalence rate in the last group is a reflection of the fact that mostHBV infections in Asia occur in childhood. Approximately 1% (or more) of hospitalized patients are HBV carri- ers; most HBV carriers seen in the healthcare setting are not symp- tomatic, are unaware that they are carriers, and their medical chartsdo not contain this information. Workers may take extraordinaryprecautions when dealing with a known carrier, but are often un-aware that they may treat five carriers for each one they recognize. This is a key point in understanding the rationale for the concept of \"Universal Precautions \" and for the use of the hepatitis vaccine in workers with exposure to blood. Hepatitis B Vaccine In 1982, a safe, immunogenic, and effective hepatitis B vaccine de- rived from human plasma was licensed in the U.S. and was recom- mended for use in healthcare workers with blood or needle exposurein the workplace. A second vaccine, produced in yeast by recombi-nant technology was first licensed in 1987. The hepatitis B vaccina-tion is the most important part of any HBV control program, because gloving and other protective devices cannot completely prevent puncture injuries from needles and other sharp instruments. The yeast derived vaccines contain no human plasma and there is no possibility that they could be infectious for HIV, a concern that was raised regarding the earlier plasma derived vaccine. Although the concerns about the earlier plasma derived vaccines were studied andaddressed, the plasma derived vaccine is no longer available in theU.S. since the yeast derived vaccines have been verified as effective,safe, and more economical to produce. Only the recombinant DNA derived vaccines are used in the U.S. Hepatitis B vaccines are given intramuscularly in the deltoid (upper arm), in three doses over a six month period. These vaccines, when15Notes: given according to manufacturers directions, induce protective anti- body levels in 85-97% of healthy adults. Protection against both the illness and development of the carrier state lasts at least nine years (the duration of the follow-up studies) and perhaps longer. Although antibody in many individuals will decaybelow detectable levels within seven years after immunization, if theseindividuals are exposed to HBV, they develop a rapid (anamnestic)antibody response and do not become ill or develop the HBV carrier state. For persons with normal immune status, it is not recommended that a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine be given after the initial series,although this may be recommended in the future if it appears that immunity conferred by the vaccine wanes after some time period. Pre-exposure vaccination is the most effective method for preventing HBV infection. However, if an individual declines vaccination, andhas a subsequent exposure, effective post-exposure prophylaxis exists if appropriate protocols are followed. A copy of the vaccination re- quest/declination form can be found in Appendix D. Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis Non-A, Non-B hepatitis in the U.S. is caused by more than one viral agent. Studies have shown that parenterally transmitted (PT) non-A, non-B hepatitis accounts for 20-40% of acute viral hepatitis in the U.S.and has epidemiological characteristics similar to those of hepatitis B. Because the primary mode of transmission is blood to blood contact, and a large asymptomatic carrier reservoir exists, precautions to prevent non-A, non-B hepatitis in the workplace are identical for thoseof other bloodborne viruses, such as HBV. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) In June of 1981, the first cases were reported in the U.S. of what was to become known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).During 1983 and 1984, French and American scientists independentlyisolated a human virus associated with AIDS. This virus was identi- fied as human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV). Eventually, human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) became the universallyaccepted term for the virus. The CDC estimates that in the U.S. between 1 million and 1.5 million persons are infected with HIV. As of July 1991, 186,895 cases of AIDS had been reported to the CDC, 3,199 of whom are children under the16Notes: age of 13. At least 63.5% of the adult/adolescent cases had died, as well as 57% of the pediatric cases. Although the rate of spread ofHIV in the future is unknown, scientists with the U.S. Public HealthService have estimated that in the U.S. alone, a cumulative total ofmore than 365,000 cases of AIDS will have been reported by the end of 1992 with 80,000 new cases diagnosed during that year. Of perhaps greater importance for workers is the 1.0 to 1.5 million persons who are infected with HIV, often unknowingly so, and whorequire medical treatment for related or unrelated conditions. There are reports of at least 30 healthcare workers who apparently were infected with HIV through occupational exposure to blood orother potentially infectious materials. Of these cases, five occurredoutside the U.S. The number of known work-related HIV seroconversions among healthcare workers is approximately 24 at present. The increasing number of individuals with AIDS, the large number of unidentified HIV infections, and the reports of occupational infection all indicate that healthcare workers are at risk for occupa- tionally acquired HIV infections. HIV: Biology HIV is a member of a group of viruses known as human retroviruses. Its genetic material is ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the genetic material found inmost living organisms. The virus particle is comprised of a corecontaining the RNA and viral enzymes surrounded by an envelopeconsisting of lipids and proteins. Because they lack the cellular machinery necessary to reproduce, all viruses must reproduce intracellularly, that is within the host cell.HIV replicates in human macrophages and T4 lymphocytes, twotypes of human cells that are vital components of the immune sys- tem. T4 lymphocytes and a few other cell types have protein mol- ecules on their surfaces called CD4 antigens or receptors. HIV par-ticles bind with the CD4 receptor sites of the host's cells and thenrelease their viral RNA. The RNA is then transcribed by viral en-zymes into double-stranded DNA that is incorporated into the DNA of the host cell. The viral DNA then serves as a template to produce more virus particles. The transcription of RNA to DNA is the re-verse of what occurs in most organisms and thus HIV is called aretrovirus. The process occurs with the aid of the viral enzymereverse transcriptase, which is considered to be a marker for retrovirus production. HIV gradually depletes the number of cells17Notes: which are essential for host immune function, rendering the infected individual increasingly susceptible to opportunisticinfections. Circulating macrophages are also considered a reservoir as well as another target for HIV infection. Since some macrophages cancirculate freely throughout the body, they may actually transportHIV to the brain which may lead to neurological complications. HIV: Serological Testing Infection with HIV may be identified through testing the bloodfor the presence of HIV antibodies. Although the antibodies donot appear to defend or protect the host against HIV, they serve asmarkers of viral infection. Most people infected with HIV have detectable antibodies within 6 months of infection, with the ma- jority generating detectable antibodies between 6 and 12 weeksafter exposure. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA or EIA) tech- nique used to detect HIV antibodies is sensitive, economical, and easy to perform. However, as with all laboratory determinations,this test can produce a false positive result when the HIV anti-body is not present. Therefore, current recommendations includerepeating the ELISA test if the first test is positive. If the second test is also positive, another test, usually employing the Western blot technique, is used to validate the ELISA results. A positiveELISA test and a positive Western blot result indicate the presenceof HIV antibodies and HIV infection. HIV: Transmission Although HIV has been isolated from blood and many other bodyfluids, epidemiologic evidence implicates only blood, semen,vaginal secretions, and breast milk in the transmission of thevirus. Documented modes of HIV transmission include: engaging in sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected person; using needles contaminated with the virus; having parenteral, mucous membrane, or non-intact skin contact with HIV-infected blood, blood components, or bloodproducts; receiving transplants of HIV-infected organs and tissues including bone, or transfusions of HIV-infected blood; through semen used for artificial insemination; and perinatal transmission (from mother to child around the time of birth). HIV is not transmitted by casual contact. Studies have produced18Notes: no evidence that HIV is transmitted by shaking hands or talking, by sharing food, eating utensils, plates, drinking glasses or towels, bysharing the same house or household facilities, or by \"personal inter-actions expected of family members\" including hugging and kissing on the cheek or lips. Other studies have shown that HIV is not trans- mitted by mosquitoes or other animals. Some types of exposures are clearly more efficient at transmission than others. The risk of infection following receipt of transfused blood from an HIV-infected donor is approximately 90%. The risk of perinatal transmission from an HIV-infected mother is estimated tobe 30-50% or higher. Besides the particular types of exposure, othervariables contributing to the likelihood of transmission may include: susceptibility of the host; the virulence of the particular strain; the stage of infection of the source; and the size of the inoculum the individual is exposed to. This last factor, the actual amount of virus, may be very important in the likelihood of transmission since, it appears, there is greater prob- ability of infection from HIV-contaminated blood transfusions (890infections per 1,000 persons transfused with contaminated blood)than from accidental needlesticks with needles contaminated withHIV (3-5 infections per 1,000 persons injured with contaminated needles). HIV: Clinical Manifestation of Disease HIV adversely affects the immune system, rendering the infectedindividual vulnerable to a wide range of clinical disorders. These conditions, some of which tend to recur, can be aggressive, rapidly progressive, difficult to treat, and less responsive to traditional modesof treatment. They usually lead to the death of the HIV infectedpatient. The CDC has divided disease progression into several stagesaccording to types of infections or symptoms reported: Group I: Within a month after exposure, an individual may experience acute retroviral symptoms, the first clinical evidenceof HIV infection. This is a mononucleosis-like syndrome that caninclude fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, alrthralgia, diarrhea, fatigue, and rash. Acute retroviral syndrome is usually self-limiting and followed or accompanied by the development of antibodies. Group II: Although most persons infected with HIV de- velop antibodies to the virus within 6-12 weeks after exposure, most of these individuals are asymptomatic for months to years following infection. However, they can transmit the virus to others throughout19Notes:this time. Group III: Although no other signs or symptoms are experienced, some HIV-infected patients will develop a persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy that lasts more than 3 months. Group IV: Epidemiological data indicates that most persons who are infected with HIV will eventually develop AIDS.AIDS can result in severe opportunistic infections that an indi- vidual with a normal immune system would only rarely experi- ence, as well as a wide range of neurologic and oncogenic orneoplastic processes. HIV: Workplace Transmission Occupational transmission of HIV has been documented in healthcare workers. As of May 1990, there are at least 65 case reports of healthcare workers whose HIV infections are associatedwith occupational exposure. Eighteen of these casesseroconverted following a documented exposure incident. Thir-teen of the seroconversions were caused by parenteral exposure to blood or blood containing fluids (11 by needlesticks and 2 by cuts with a sharp object). Five seroconversions involved blood con-tamination of mucous membranes or non-intact skin one wasdue parenteral exposure to concentrated HIV-I. HIV: Epidemiology A number or prospective studies and surveys have been con- ducted to determine occupational risks for HIV infection. The CDC has been conducting a national prospective study whichbegan in 1983, to assess initially the risk of AIDS and later, withthe advent of HIV-antibody testing, the risk of HIVseroconversion among healthcare workers exposed to the blood or body fluids of persons with HIV infection. Of those subjects who had sustained either a needlestick injury or a cut with a sharpinstrument contaminated with blood or body fluid from an HIV-infected patient, the seroconversion rate was determined to be0.35%. Weiss and co-workers conducted a prospective study to assess the risk of HIV infection in laboratory workers. Of 225 laboratoryworkers, 10 reported one or more episodes of parenteral exposureto HIV, including needlesticks or cuts, and 35 reported one or more episodes of skin contact with HIV. One individual who worked with concentrated HIV-1 was seropositive for the virusupon entering the study. The HIV isolated from the subject'sblood was shown to be genetically identical to a strain of HIV20Notes: used in the laboratory, thus strongly implicating occupational exposure as the source of infection. No seroconversions wereidentified in the other study participants during the period ofprospective follow-up. The authors calculated that the rate of HIV infection was 0.48 per 100 person-years for laboratory per- sonnel in this study. Other Bloodborne Pathogens Several additional infectious diseases are characterized by a phase in which the causative agent may circulate in blood for a pro-longed period of time. With the exception of syphilis and malaria,these diseases are rare in the U.S. Syphilis Syphilis is caused by infection with Treponema pallidum , a spiro- chete. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that is increas-ingly prevalent in the U.S. Although syphilis is primarily trans-mitted sexually and in utero, a few cases of transmission byneedlestick, by tattooing instruments, and by blood transfusion have been documented. Preventive treatment of an exposed healthcare worker with an antibiotic during the incubation periodwould be expected to prevent serological test positivity and thepotential for permanent reactivity on treponemal testing, as wellas preventing the manifestations of infection. Malaria Malaria is a potentially fatal mosquito-borne parasitic infection ofthe blood cells characterized by paroxysms of fever, chills, andanemia. Malaria is an important health risk to immigrants fromnumerous malaria endemic areas of the world and to Americans who travel to such areas. Malaria is characterized by a prolonged erythrocytic phase during which the causative agent, one ofseveral species of the Plasmodium genus, is present in the blood. In many nations, malaria is among the most common transfusionrelated infectious diseases. In temperate countries, it is only occasionally reported. Malaria has also been transmitted by needlestick injury; in one incident, malaria was transmitted to achild who received a unit of blood and to the recipient's physi-cian, who stuck himself with a needle. E. Stanford University Exposure Control Plan Two Exposure Control Plans are maintained by the University. One Exposure Control Plan is maintained by the Biosafety Office at EH&S and contains specific procedures applicable to all operating21Notes: units at the University, including the School of Medicine Blood Center but excluding the Stanford Health Services. StanfordHealth Services maintains a second Exposure Control Plan which contains specific procedures applicable to clinical and patient careoperations. The Exposure Control Plan describes Stanford University policy regarding handling and working with human blood and otherpotentially infectious materials covered by the OSHA BloodbornePathogen standard. The Exposure Control Plan describes the spe- cific materials covered by the policy, assigns responsibility for compliance with the policy, provides detailed information regard-ing the work practices to be followed, and personal protectiveequipment to be used at Stanford, references existing biologicalwaste disposal policies, and provides information regarding post- exposure follow-up. Some of this information is summarized in the discussion below, however, each Stanford University em-ployee is responsible for complying with the requirements andprocedures detailed in the Exposure Control Plan . F. Universal Precautions There is no way to tell by looking at a person whether or not that person is carrying a bloodborne pathogen. Anyone of any age,race, or gender can be infected with hepatitis B, HIV, or otherbloodborne disease and still appear perfectly healthy. As a result, all exposure control plans are based upon the concept of Universal Precautions . Staying healthy depends upon always following safe work practices whenever you may be exposed tobloodborne pathogens. Applying Universal Precautions means you must always as- sume that blood or other potentially infectious material is carry- ing a disease, and always take the necessary measures to protect yourself. To avoid infection with a bloodborne disease, you must maintain an attitude of continual self-protection. The specific procedures you must follow may vary, depending upon your particular job or the particular situation that you face. But applying Universal Precautions will always involve the same basic safe work practices. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Wearing personal protective equipment is usually an important22Notes: part of applying Universal Precautions . The PPE worn must al- ways be appropriate to the situation. Gloves Whenever hands might come into contact with blood or any otherpotentially infectious material or with contaminated surfaces,gloves are required. They should be made of latex or some other impermeable materials that will not allow fluids to pass through. Disposable (Single Use) Gloves In normal situations, surgical or examination type gloves areused. Where exposure to a large quantity of blood is likely, or where gloves might be damaged during a procedure, wearing two pairs (double gloving) is recommended. These gloves may not bedecontaminated for re-use. They must always be discarded assoon as possible. When removing disposable gloves, care must be taken not to allow the outside surfaces to come into contact with bare skin.The following procedure will minimize this potential exposure. 1. Grasp the top or wrist of one glove, being careful not to touch anything but the glove. 2. Pull the glove off, turning it inside out. Continue holding the glove. 3. Insert a finger into the top of the other glove, being careful not to touch its outside surface. 4. Pull the glove off, turning it inside out and pulling it over the first glove. Both gloves should now be inside out, one inside the other. 5. Discard both gloves into an approved waste container.6. Wash your hands. Utility Gloves For some tasks, like cleaning up and decontaminating after ablood spill, household type utility gloves are acceptable. Thesegloves may be decontaminated and re-used provided they are not cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, discolored, or deteriorating in any way. If they are not in perfect condition, they should bediscarded. When removing these gloves, make certain that theiroutside surfaces do not come into contact with bare skin.23Notes: When wearing any type of possibly contaminated gloves, avoid touching any surfaces unnecessarily to limit the spread of con-tamination. To avoid infection, never touch your face or rub your eyes with contaminated gloves. Eye Protection, Masks, and Face Shields Whenever blood or other potentially infectious material can splash, spray, or spatter and might contaminate the eyes, nose, or mouth, additional protection is required. A mask may be used incombination with goggles or glasses that have solid side shields.A chin length face shield may also be used. In some situations, a gown or apron may be required to keep contamination away from the body and clothing. Use the PPE that will protect you from any reasonably anticipated exposure. Safe Handling and Disposal Applying the Universal Precaution s also involves following safe work practices at all times. Potentially infectious materials andany contaminated materials must always be handled safely anddisposed of correctly. Warning Labels Warning labels shall be affixed to containers of regulated waste, refrigerators and freezers containing blood or other potentially infectious material; and other containers used to store, transport, or ship blood or other potentially infectious materials. Labels shall include either the following legend: BIOHAZARD or in the case of regulated waste the legend: BIOHAZARDOUS WASTE The Biohazard Symbol - Everyone should be able to recognize thebiohazard warning symbol and know that it indicates contami- nated or potentially infectious material. 24Notes: The symbol itself must be fluorescent orange or orange-red, or predominantly so with lettering and symbols in contrasting color. The biohazard symbol should also be used as a warning on any contaminated equipment until the equipment can be decontami-nated. Individual containers of blood or other potentially infectious materi- als that are placed in a labeled container during storage, transport,shipment, or disposal are exempted from the labeling requirement. Needles and Sharp Objects A sharp object that has been contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material is extremely hazardous. A puncturewound can introduce bloodborne pathogens directly into the blood- stream. Personnel must be especially careful with needles and syringes. Needles must never be recapped nor deliberately bent or broken,but are to be discarded as soon as possible in a sharps disposal container. Remember, rubber or latex gloves will not provide protection against a puncture wound. Other Contaminated Materials Anything that has come into contact with blood or other potentially infectious material should be considered to be contaminated. Thiscan include work surfaces, machinery, materials used during firstaid procedures, clothing, and personal protective equipment. Toavoid infection, and to keep from spreading contamination further, safe work practices are essential. Never handle possibly contami- nated materials without wearing gloves and any other appropriatePPE. Avoid letting your gloves or any other contaminated materialcome into contact with uncontaminated surfaces. Dispose of all contaminated materials following Stanford University's Biohazardous Waste Disposal Guidelines. Decontamination When blood or other potentially infectious material has come into contact with a work surface, machinery, or the surfaces of sinks andother fixtures, use an approved disinfectant to decontaminate theaffected areas.25Notes: A one to ten dilution of ordinary household bleach and water is an effective disinfectant - approximately 1 1/2 cups of bleach added to 1 gallon water. If possible, begin by covering the contaminated area with paper towels (or an absorbent cloth). Pour the bleach solution over the paper towels, allow it to soak through, and wipe the area. Then pour more bleach solution over the area and use fresh paper towelsto wipe it clean and dry. Some equipment may be damaged by bleach, and another disinfec- tant may be required. Remember that not all disinfectants will destroy HBV. A summary of disinfectants and their effective use isfound in Appendix B of the Exposure Control Plan and is availablefrom the Biosafety Officer at 5-1473. Wash Your Hands Hand washing after handling possibly infectious or contaminated materials is a very important part of Universal Precautions. Even ifyou have been wearing gloves, washing your hands vigorously and thoroughly with soap and warm water is a vital part of avoiding infection. You should not eat, smoke, or touch your face with yourhands until they have been washed. Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling any possibly contaminated material! G. Procedures to Follow if an Exposure OccursIf you are ever directly exposed to blood or other potentially infec- tious material, wash the area contacted with bacteriocidal soap and warm water as soon as possible. Washing should be very thorough,including, for example, under the fingernails if hands have beenexposed. If material has splashed into your eyes, immediately use an emer- gency eyewash or another source of clean running water to flushthem for at least 15 minutes . Hold the eyes open and roll them around to make certain that water reaches their entire surface. All employees of the Medical Center and medical students are to report exposures as soon as possible. Between the hours of7:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., report to the Stanford University HospitalEmployee Health Office for post-exposure evaluation and follow-up medical consultation. If an exposure occurs after these hours,26Notes: on holidays or weekends, please report to the Stanford Univer- sity Hospital Emergency Department for post-exposure follow-up. Always report any exposure to blood or other potentiallyinfectious materials to your supervisor or to EH&S as soon as possible. Treatment is most effective if exposed personnel can be seen on the same day that the exposure occurred. Exposuresreported after the first 24 hours are not considered to be urgent. H. Post-Exposure Evaluation and Follow-Up Post-Exposure Follow-UpAfter any occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials, a confidential medical evaluation and coun-seling will be made available at no cost to you. The exposedindividual will be provided with post-exposure medical treatment(e.g., hepatitis B vaccine), counseling and evaluation as appropri- ate and in accordance with CDC recommendations. All test results and medical records will be available to you, but otherwisethey will be kept strictly confidential. Treatment and follow-up are dependent upon the specific expo- sure. Post-exposure medical protocols are maintained by the Stanford University Hospital Emergency Department and may bereviewed upon request. Employee information The exposed employee will be provided with a written opinion that will include: HBV vaccination status and recommendations; results of the post-exposure evaluation; and discussion of any medical conditions resulting from exposure to blood or otherpotentially infectious materials that require further evaluation ortreatment. All other findings or diagnoses shall remain confi- dential and shall not be included in the written report. I. ConclusionsAvoiding occupational exposure to bloodborne disease is not difficult. Apply UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS whenever you might be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials: Always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment. Always handle and dispose of any contaminated materials safely.27Notes: Always wash your hands, even if you have been wearing gloves. Maintain an attitude of continual self-protection and always follow safe work practices. J.

Title 8, California Code of Regulations, General Industry Safety Order 5193 APPENDIX D: Hepatits B Virus Vaccination Declination FormAPPENDIX A: Universal Precautions Universal Precautions apply to blood, body fluids, and all human tissues. Body fluids include: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, and amniotic feces, urine, sputum, nasalsecretions, saliva, tears, and vomitus. Handwashing Universal Precautions are designed to supplement important routine infection control, such as handwashing.oHands and other skin surfaces that are contaminated with blood or body fluids must be immediately and thoroughly washed. oGloves must be changed and hands must be washed between patient contacts involving blood or body fluids. oHands must be washed between patient contacts not involving blood or body flu- ids. Use of Protective Barriers Protective barriers will be worn to prevent exposure to blood or body fluids during procedures where splashing or aerosolization may occur. Individual departments/units will specify the type of protective barrier(s) to be used during any specific proce-dure, according to the type of exposure anticipated. Barriers such as gloves, gowns,plastic aprons, masks, protective eyewear or face shields may be required. These poli- cies will be reviewed by the Infection Control Committee. Gloves Gloves will be worn during phlebotomy, finger or heel sticks, when starting or manipu-lating intravascular lines, or during any procedure involving a potential exposure to blood. Gloves will be worn in situations where exposure to body fluids may occur. oUse sterile gloves for procedures involving contact with normally sterile areas of the body. oUse examination gloves for procedures involving contact with mucous membranes and for other patient care. oChange gloves between patient contacts. oDo not wash or disinfect surgical or exam. gloves for reuse as this may cause dete- rioration. oUse general-purpose utility gloves (e.g., rubber household gloves) for houseclean- ing chores and for instrument cleaning and decontamination procedures. Utility gloves may be decontaminated and reused, but should be discarded if peeling, cracked, torn or damaged. Preventing Penetrating Injuries Gloves should reduce the incidence of contamination of the hands, but they cannot prevent penetrating injuries due to needles or other sharp instruments. oDo not recap needles by hand; do not remove used needles from disposable sy-ringes by hand; and do not bend, break, or otherwise manipulate used needles by hand. oPlace used disposable syringes, needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items in red puncture-resistant containers for disposal. Containers should be located at the bed- side or as close to the use area as practical. oTake care, both during and after procedures, to prevent injuries from needles, scal- pels, or other sharp instruments or devices.APPENDIX B: Criteria for Determining the Risk of Occupational Exposure to Hepati- tis B Virus or other Bloodborne Pathogens Does the employee ever: a) work with animals, such as primates that are infected with hepatitis B or other bloodborne pathogens OR perform tasks where such animals are housed?
