But you don't have to stay in the hospital for your infusion care. Geisinger Home Infusion Services gives you the high-quality infusion services you need to get well, in the comfort of your home. What is infusion therapy? Infusion therapy is the delivery of medications into your body either through your bloodstream (intravenous or IV), under your skin (subcutaneous or intramuscular) or into the membranes surrounding your spinal cord (epidural). You may need infusion therapy for pain management, dehydration, nutrition deficiency, infections or conditions such as immune deficiency, cancer or anemia (lower-than-normal red blood cells). With home infusion therapy, most medications can be delivered to your house. Our team of pharmacists and case management professionals will coordinate care with your physician, home health agency or skilled nursing facility. Our comprehensive infusion therapies include: - Anti-infective therapy (antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral) - Catheter care and management - Chemotherapy - Pain management therapy - Steroid therapy - Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) - IV hydration - Biologics - Enteral therapy - Immunoglobin therapy - And more Prefer outpatient infusions?
