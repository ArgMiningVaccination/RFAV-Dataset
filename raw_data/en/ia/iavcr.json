However, while this process is important, pet owners should be careful to make sure they are not over-vaccinating their animal companions because this can lead to health issues. At Dr. Michael Dym, VMD in West Palm Beach, we focus on holistic therapy for pets to protect them from the side effects of over-vaccination. That means using alternative and traditional therapies to keep pets healthy. What is Over-Vaccination in Pets? Over-vaccination in pets is when a pet is inoculated with the same vaccines multiple times. When this happens, it can result in adverse effects on your pet's health. This can be dangerous to some animals because they are vaccinated too frequently for their bodies to handle. Studies show that over-vaccination can cause hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmune diseases. Over-vaccination is especially dangerous for younger animals because their immune systems are still developing. Their bodies cannot handle vaccines at the same rate as adult animals. When puppies and kittens are repeatedly inoculated, it can negatively affect their health. When animals are given vaccinations they are too young to receive, it also increases the likelihood of an adverse reaction. Diseases Associated with Over-Vaccination in Pets Several diseases can develop as a result of over-vaccination. Some pets have experienced neurological conditions, immune deficiencies, and more after being vaccinated too many times. A few of these diseases include: - Uterine infections - Death of tissues - Degeneration (atrophy) of lymphoid tissue - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia - Lameness or stilted gait due to inflammation, muscle disorders, and bone loss in the limbs - Increased allergies in the ears and eyes - Hormonal issues The Titer Test Veterinarians can perform a titer test to see if your pet has immunity against parvovirus, distemper, and rabies. This is the only way to tell if your dog or cat needs to be vaccinated again. For example, if an animal's titer reading for parvovirus is very high after it was vaccinated years ago, there might not be a need to re-vaccinate for the moment. A titer test will determine whether or not your pet needs that specific vaccine.
