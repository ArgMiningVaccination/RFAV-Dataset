Nearly 737 million people have watched videos bearing its hashtag on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lymphaticdrainage?lang=en), and treatment bookings service [Treatwell](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treatwell.co.uk%2Fplaces%2Ftreatment-lymphatic-drainage) reported a 41 per cent increase in appointments for lymphatic drainage massage last year. But manual lymphatic drainage is nothing new. This specific type of massage has long been employed to enhance the function of the lymphatic system - a large network of tissues and organs that help rid the body of toxins and waste. The technique is a known treatment for relieving swelling and discomfort in the limbs caused by lymphoedema, a chronic condition brought on by a malfunction of the lymphatic system. More widely, its often promoted alongside promises to 'de-bloat' or 'sculpt' for all - especially for those who suffer from water retention - though the benefits of lymphatic drainage massage are myriad. \"Lymphatic drainage works by causing the lymph fluid to carry waste products and destroyed bacteria back into the bloodstream,\" explains Micheli Calmon of [The House of Massage](https://thehouseofmassage.com/). \"The liver and kidneys work to remove this bacteria and waste from the blood. The body then passes this through waste via bowel movements or urine.\" The process increases blood flow throughout the body, she explains, while also \"activating cells which helps to make your body work much better as well as your muscles\". What are the benefits of lymphatic drainage massage? As well as promoting circulation, which in turn boosts energy and alertness, Calmon says the treatment bolsters the immune system and relieves stress, promoting better sleep. \"Whether you want to detox, feel lighter, or just relax, you can always benefit from a session,\" says [Flavia Morellato](https://www.flaviamorellato.co.uk/about), London's leading lymphatic therapist. Something you shouldn't expect from it, however, is the elimination of fat cells. \"Some people believe lymphatic drainage will get rid of fat instead of water retention and toxins - but this definitely doesn't happen,\" explains Morellato. How regularly should you have lymphatic drainage massage? Morellato hails from Brazil, where lymphatic drainage is big business in the country's aesthetically-focused culture. \"Lymphatic drainage became very popular in Brazil due to the number of cosmetic surgeries that happen there, and treatment is always mandatory as part of the pre- and post-care,\" she explains. Now, it's perfectly normal for Brazilians to have manual lymphatic drainage on a weekly basis. \"Lymphatic drainage is recommended weekly for standard benefits, but you can have it every day in more needed circumstances such as post-operative care for plastic surgeries or when postpartum,\" Morellato shares. \"For lymphoedema, treatment is recommended two-to-three times per week.\" What does lymphatic drainage massage feel like? With notions of toxin-flushing, one might easily assume that manual lymphatic drainage would mimic deep-tissue massage techniques. On the contrary, a very light pressure is applied with long, rhythmic strokes used to gently stimulate the lymphatic system without pressing hard on the vessels. Indeed, it's deceptively powerful, Calmon explains. Despite the light touch, the drainage \"will keep working for over 72 hours after the massage has taken place\". A similar technique is used on the face, with the aim to decrease puffiness and sculpt the contours. Skincare and Traditional Chinese Medicine expert [Ada Ooi](https://www.instagram.com/ada.ooi/?hl=en), whose clients include Rooney Mara and Lily Allen, always uses lymphatic drainage techniques as part of her facial treatments. It's also a fixture in the much-loved [Rose Crystal Lymphatic Facial by The Organic Pharmacy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theorganicpharmacy.com%2Frose-crystal-lymphatic-60min%2F), which employs rose crystal stones to drain, creating a sculpted and de-puffed look. Can you do lymphatic drainage at home? The Organic Pharmacy brand founder and homeopath, Margo Marrone, says there are many techniques that can be adapted at home to help stimulate and drain the lymph, which can be very useful to keep you topped up between treatments or if you aren't able to see a professional regularly. \"If you're looking to boost the immune system there are easy lymphatic drainage techniques you can build into your routine to boost your immunity,\" she says. At a pro appointment ( [The Organic Pharmacy](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theorganicpharmacy.com%2F) has a series of lymphatic drainage treatments available at their flagship store and spa in Chelsea) ask for a demonstration of how to perform a mini massage on yourself . Then, \"concentrate your efforts around the tummy, all around the neck, the groin and armpits which are where lymph nodes are located.\" Alternatively, or in addition, Marrone recommends a five minute daily drainage using [dry skin body brushing](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a41663/body-brushing/) followed by oil application. \"Look for products with ingredients such as juniper, fennel and grapefruit which are the main drainage oils.\" Dry skin brushing stimulates the whole lymphatic system, and is easy to add in to a morning routine, either alone or in addition to regular lymphatic massages. \"Always massage from the bottom up, starting from the feet before moving to the arms and then in and around the tummy and bottom.\" [See more dry body brushing tips here.](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a41663/body-brushing/) When it comes to the face, in this video below Ooi demonstrates how to perform facial lymphatic drainage massage on yourself at home: Can skincare stimulate lymphatic drainage? Adding to the buzz around lymphatic drainage is the development of new skincare technology enabling the topical activation of the skin's lymphatic system. \"The new [Ir\u00e4ye skincare line](https://uk.irayeskincare.com/) does exactly this and thus can be used either as a stand-alone daily skincare approach or can be combined with lymphatic drainage massage,\" explains the brand's co-founder Professor Michael Detmar. The products' specific combination of five plant extracts, known as its proprietary Lymphactive Complex, has been designed to actively enhance the function of the lymphatic channels to stimulate drainage as well as support long-term maintenance. \"The best results are obtained by following the application of the [serum](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harveynichols.com%2Fbrand%2Firaye%2F944829-radiance-firming-serum-30ml%2Fp4449792%2F) with application of the [cream](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harveynichols.com%2Fbrand%2Firaye%2F944954-the-cream-50ml%2Fp4449788), and by massaging them into the skin following the natural lymphatic vessel routes towards the lymph nodes, morning and evening,\" explains Dr Detmar. With lymphatic drainage increasingly endorsed by medical and beauty experts alike, plus such skincare innovation happening in this area, its availability - and the benefits that come with it - looks set to soar.
