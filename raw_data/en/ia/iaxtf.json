APPROV AL OF THE MARCH 1, 2011 SPECIAL BOARD OF EXAMINERS' MEETING MINUTES Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: Good Morning ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the meeting of the Board of Examiners. Before we get into the agenda, I am not sure if you noticed that when you walked into the room the etched glass above the doorway? It now reads the Guinn Room. This room will now be called the Guinn Room and you will see a very nice plaque that is dedicated to Governor Guinn's memory because he was the one responsible for building this Annex. There will also be a beautiful portrait of Governor Guinn in this room and I think it is just a small token and a memorial to realize him and show the respect that I personally had for Governor Guinn and for the people of the State. So on your way out look up , it is very impressive and I had the opportunity to show the former fi rst lady the pla que that will be on the wall. So with that we will begin this meeting and move to agenda item one which is the approval of the March 1, 2011 Special Board of Examiners' meeting minutes. Have the members had the opportunity to review the m inutes? Secretary of State: Move for approval. Attorney General: Second the motion. Governor: We have a motion from the Secretary of State and a second by the Attorney General to approve the minutes. Is there any discussion on the motion?

STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL REVISIONS The State Administrative Manual (SAM) is being submitted to the Board of Examiners' for approval of additions and revisions in the following Chapter: Chapter 1300 - State Vehicles Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of Sta te Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will move to agenda item four; State A dministrative Manual (SAM) revisions. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Agenda item number four is a request to revise the SAM. In your packet under item fou r is a summary of the changes that are being requested to update the SAM . 1303 is a new section that outlines authorized operators of State vehicles. 1305 is a new section Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 5 as well that outlines the insurance coverage and points of contact for que stions. 1306 is a revision to the home storage of state vehicles and the key changes now requires the department heads or their designee to grant the approval of home storage of vehicles, requiring department heads to develop internal policies and procedu res for the approval process and also requiring the departments to document that the approval meets Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines in reference to home storage. 1310 this is a revision for the labeling requirement for State vehicles. 1312 is a lso a revision for unmarked vehicles to remove the current language in SAM and grants the department heads the authority to approve vehicles that will be used in law enforcement activities to be unmarked. An agency is not in law enforcement would have to come to BOE for approval. Governor: Mr. Clinger I have a question with regards to section 1306 which requires department heads to develop internal policies and procedures for the approval process. Would the adoption of this provision allow for inconsist ency or would it be preferable to have one standard policy for all state agencies? Clerk: Governor, the way that this is written it would let the department heads develop their own policies and procedures in which could lead to different policies and pro cedures in different departments. There is some criteria outlined in SAM 1306. But certainly another approach to this would be to develop more stringent statewide criteria that would be followed by all State agencies. Governor: Are there any questions from any members of the Board? Attorney General: Governor, I have a question for Andrew. On section 1305 I am assuming that the blue is new language that has been added to SAM, is that correct? Clerk: That is correct. Attorn ey General: So I guess number three is of concern to me directing insurance questions to my office ; not quite sure why they would be directed to my office. We only come into play after the fact when we are dealing with any motor vehicle accident. So I d on't want people to get under the impression that we manage the insurance and we are able to answer questions with respect to insurance coverage for them. So I was just curious as to why that was put in there? Clerk: I am not too sure why that specific language was included. We can certainly strike out the Attorney General's Office portion of that and have the agencies go to Risk Management first and then if it was necessary after the fact then they could contact the Attorney General's Office. Attorney General: I would appreciate that, thank you Andrew. Keith Wells: Governor, 1306 home storage we put language in there requiring agencies to reference the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines because the IRS guidelines are very specific. Governo r: And that is the clarification that I needed. I would just like one policy so that there are not agencies saying we did it this way and why did they do it that way. So you are representing because of that IRS regulation there will be consistency throu ghout? Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 6 Keith Wells: Yes, and my other thought that needs to happen with this to go along with one of your concerns is if we just bring awareness to this topic of home storage that they need to pay attention to then there will be compliance. There is not a lot of home storage of state vehicles but we need to make agencies aware that they have to follow IRS guidelines. Governor: What was the genesis of doing these amendments in the first place? Keith Wells: Because w e started a fleet committee at the r equest of the Legislature they wanted us to review the entire section of 1300 in SAM, general housekeeping and that is just part of this process. Governor: Are there any current problems or issues at this time? Keith Wells: Internal Audits did an audit on what was released last year on home storage and they were concerned that home storage wasn't as monitored as it should be. So that is one reason why the committee looked at those policies. Governor: In your mind , this a mendment to 1306 will be responsive to the Internal Audit mission? Keith Wells: Yes. Governor: And do you have any comment with regards to the Attorney General's question on 1305 subsection 3? Keith Wells: Yes, that was just put in there at the request of members of the committee. They wanted to have a place that directed the agencies on how the state insurance system works. The Attorney General's Office provides the liability insurance and Risk Manageme nt provides Comp. and Collision. So they just wanted to clarify that for the agencies, but we can definitely remove that. Governor: Do either of the Board members have any questions for Mr. Wells? Thank you , Mr. Wells. Members of the Board would you c onsider a motion to or what's the action Mr. Clinger? Do we move to approve the language with the deletion of the Attorney General's Office in reference to chapter 1305 subsection 3? Clerk: Yes, Governor. Secretary of State: I'll move for approval of agenda item four with the opposed revisions to the State Administrative Manual striking chapter 1305 subsection 3. Attorney General: I'll second the motion. Governor: Before we accept a second, Mr. Secretary of State you said strike all of 3 or just th e language referring to the Attorney General's Office? Secretary of State: I guess I am not clear as to what we are removing from the subsection. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 7 Attorney General: Just to the Attorney General. So it should read \"Insurance questions should be directed to the Risk Management Division. Secretary of State: I will make a motion to approve the Attorney General's suggestion.

Department o f Conservation and Natural Resources - Division of State Lands Pursuant to NRS 322.001, the Nevada Division of State Lands (NDSL) is requesting approval, on behalf of the Division of Forestry to accept a donation of a parcel of lan d from Henry B. Sprenger II. The current land owner has offered to donate the property to the state for preservation of the Steamboat buckwheat habitat. This acquisition will afford the state the ability to preserve a rare, federally protected plant spec ies. This parcel contains the only known location of Steamboat Buckwheat and is located in South Reno adjacent to Hwy 395 prior to the junction with Hwy 341 (Mount Rose Hwy) coming out of the Washoe Valley. The NDSL has no estimate of value, because it i s a donation of land and the Nevada Revised Statutes do not require a value. The Nevada Division of Forestry currently administers t he critically endangered flora program and there would be no additional administrative costs or need for increased staffing as a result of this acquisition. The landowner will convey clear title to the state by deed as a gift of land in accordance with NRS 353.335. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will move on to agenda item number 5 , which is the approval to accept a donation of land on behalf of the Division of Forestry. I would like to make note that there is a reference to NRS 322.001 and that should read 321.001 is that correct? Clerk: That is correct, Governor. This is a requ est by the Division of State Lands on behalf of the Division of Forestry to accept a donation of a parcel of land. This acquisition will afford the state the ability to preserve a rare, federally protected plant species. This parcel contains the only known location of Steamboat Buckwheat. Governor: Is there someone here from the Division of State Lands? Charlie Donahue: Good Morning. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 8 Governor: Good Morning, I have no problem with this I j ust wanted to get clarification, is t his the only place on the planet w here you can find Steamboat Buckwheat? Charlie Donahue: It is generally in that location but I would have to defer to Pete Anderson with the Division of Forestry. Pete Anderson: Yes, Governor that is the only known location for Steamboat Buckwheat. Governor: That is pretty amazing. Do any of the Board members have any questions with regards to agenda item number 5? Secretary of State: I'll move for approval. Attorney General: Second the motion.

STATUS OF FURLOUGHS Pursuant to Senate Bill 433, Section 5.2 (a) of the 2009 Legislative Session, the State Board of Examiners shall determine positions within the Executive Branch of State Government that cannot be subject to furlough leave. Section 8 provides $4 million in General Fund over the biennium to cover furlough leave exceptions statewide . A. Department of Corrections The Department was granted an exception for FY 2010 which expired June 30, 2010 and included all Correctio nal Officer and Senior Correctional Officer positions. The department ha d put forth a plan to close Nevada State Prison and open Units 7A & 7B at High Desert State Prison , to the Board of Prison Commissioners (Board) which was denied at its June 23, 2010 meeting. It was then suggested at the July 13, 2010 meeting of the board that the department submit a biennial plan to implement Senate Bill 433 to the August 2010 BOE. A biennial plan to implement Senate Bill 433 was presented to the board at its Augus t 11th 2009 meeting. Subsequently, the department submitted a request for exceptions to the board at its November 9, 2010 meeting and was approved $625,174 for the months of November and December 2010. The Department of Corrections requested exceptio ns for the months of January 2011 through March 31, 2011, for multiple positions necessary for public safety at a cost of approximately $938,069 (the unobligated balance in the furlough account is $1,018,755). This request includes all Correctional Office r and Senior Correctional Officer positions. The Board of Examiners at its January 11, 2011 meeting approved furlough exemptions for the month of January 2011 based on testimony provided by the new Acting Director, Greg Cox, who indicated that the departme nt could implement furloughs beginning in February 2011; the estimated cost of this exemption is $323,113, leaving an unobligated balance of $695,643 in the furlough account. Clerk's Recommendation Motion By: Seconded By: Vote: Comments: Governor: Agenda item 7 is the status of furloughs. I see Mr. Cox is here. Clerk: And Governor if I may before Mr. Cox starts , I would like to give the Board members an update just on where we are from the 2009 Legislative Session. In your p acket under item 7 page 3 of that item there is a schedule of Board of Examiners actions as well as how much is left Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 10 in the account. The 2009 Legislature appropriated four million dollars and you can see the actions taken through FY 2009 and the amounts t hat the Board allocated at that time which left a balance of $179,432. The Department of Corrections actual funds transferred to them was $2,355,531 . The Board in November approved exceptions for November and December which totaled $625,714. The Board i n January approved furlough exceptions for the month of January which totaled $323,113. The remaining funds that were allocated from the 2009 Legislative Session is $695,643. Governor: Good Morning, Mr. Cox. Do you have any questions for Mr. Clinger? Greg Cox: Good Morning. I still recommend the implementation of furloughs for all staff for our department. Our top priority and focus is maintaining the safety and security of all staff, inmates and the public. We continue to look at data in regards t o the outrage. We focus on different parts of that and how we can reduce the risk to staff. We will continue to review th e data regarding staff's furlough and the impact it has on our inmates and we will monitor that carefully as we move forward. Govern or: Mr. Cox I saw some error in your report with regards to two incidents that happened. Is there a relationship between those incidences and the furloughs? Greg Cox: Governor, I have looked at both of those instances and there is no correlation with those instances and furloughs. Governor: How would you characterize the impact the furloughs have had on the department compared to when you weren't taking any furloughs? Greg Cox: On page 5 of your packet under agenda item 7, there is a table which sho ws furloughs not taken there were 442 total instances. Once the furloughs were in place we see a smaller number 420. So this is not a correlation between furloughs being taken and those instances. Basically, our inmates get very problematic at times, bu t we continue to look at how and why the instance occurred. Governor: Do you feel confident that this is the correct approach? Greg Cox: Yes I do Governor. And I will continue to monitor and I will come back at update you on the status of the furlough impact. Governor: Do any of the Board members have any questions for Mr. Cox? I believe that this is just a status report and no action needs to be taken by the board? Clerk: That is correct Governor, u nless the Board wanted to grant additional exceptions to furloughs. Governor: You are not seeking any action on behalf of the Board are you? Greg Cox: No, Governor. Governor: Ok, Thank you. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 11 *8. VICTIM S OF CRIME PROGRAM ( VOCP) APPEAL Pursuant to NRS 217.117 Section 3, the Board may review the case and either render a decision within 15 days of the Board meeting; or, if they would like to hear the case with the appellant prese nt, they can schedule the case to be heard at their next meeting. A. Juan Moore Juan Moore appeals the denial of his application for VOCP assistance. Mr. Moore submitted his application to the VOCP on October 27, 2010 because his car had been burglari zed and vandalized while he was away from home. His application was denied because this type of crime is not covered under NRS 217. Additionally, the police report was filed nearly a month after Mr. Moore discovered the break in. During the appeal heari ng, Mr. Moore indicated this is related to harassment by the FBI that he has suffered for the past 43 years. Appeals Officer Geraldine Schwartzer upheld the Compensation Officer's decision, finding that the situation Mr. Moore has described does not satis fy the requirements of the program. Clerk's Recommendation : It is recommended that Mr. Moore's appeal be denied . Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will move to the next item on the agenda which is the Victims of Crime Program Appeal. Clerk: Thank you, Governor. This is an appeal to the Board of Examiners for the denial of a claim for Mr. Moore. His application was denied because this type of crime is not covered under NRS 217. In addi tion the police report was filed nearly a month after Mr. Moore discovered the break in to his vehicle. We do have Rebecca Salazar down in Las Vegas as well. Governor: Mrs. Salazar, do you wish to make a presentation with regards to this agenda item? Rebecca Salazar: No, Governor. I believe my packet is sufficient. I can answer any questions that anyone might have. Governor: Would you provide a quick summary of your packet that you provided? Rebecca Salazar: Mr. Moore filed this application for a break -in. He was away from home for a few days, came home and discovered that his car had been broken into and vandalized. That type of crime is not covered under NRS 217 so that was the reason for the denial. The police report was filed after the five days allowed by law so that was the secondary reason. During the appeal Mr. Moore didn't offer any other information . He did indicate that he believes that the break in relates to harassment he has suffered throughout his life by the FBI. The Appeals Hearing Officer found that this type of crime is not covered under NRS 217 and the case remained denied. Governor: Thank you, Mrs. Salazar. Do any of the other Board members have any questions? Is there a representative for Mr. Moore present? Rebecca Sal azar: He is not present. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 12 Governor: Is there anyone there on his behalf? Rebecca Salazar: No Sir. Governor: Is there anyone here in Carson City on behalf of Mr. Moore? Are there any Board member comments or questions? The chair will accept a motion on this matter. Secretary of State: I will move to deny the appeal and uphold the decision of the Hearings Officer. Attorney General: I will second the motion. Governor: It has been motioned by the Secretary of State and second by the Attorney General to uphold the findings of the Hearings Office. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none all those in favor signify by saying aye. The motion passes unanimousl y. *9. LEASES Five statewide lease s were submitted to the Board for review and approval. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will move to agenda item 9, which are leases. Clerk: Thank you, Governor. There are five leases on the agenda this morning. I would note that I would like to pull lease number 3 from the agenda. This lease is with the Department of Business and Industry; depending on legislative action we will bring that lease to the next meeting. Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger. I noticed that lease number 4 and 5 are renegotiations which will be a savings to the State of approximately $60,000. Were you able to ascertain if an y of the other leases provided savings to the State? Clerk: Governor, the first two leases with the Department of Administration, Appeals Division and Hearings Division those are leases that were renegotiated back in April 2010. The original leases were a $1.30 a square foot escalading to $1.47 a square foot after 6 years. The current lease that you see on the agenda today has a rate of $1.25 a square foot for year one and $1.29 a square foot for year three and four. So you can see compared to what the lease was prior to the April 2010 reduction it has been reduced approximately 10%. I don't have the annual savings. Governor: So it is probably about a $5,500 dollar savings a year? Clerk: That is fair; it is about $5,000 a year less than the old lease. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 13 Governor: Do any of the Board members have any questions for Mr. Clinger with regards to agenda item number 9? Hearing none the chair will accept a motion for leases 1 , 2, 4 and 5. Secretary of State: So moved. Attorney General: Second. Governor: It was motioned by the Secretary of State and second by the Attorney General. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unan imously. *10. CONTRACTS Sixty -Seven independent contract s were submitted to the Board for review and approval. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We move on to agenda item number 10 which is the contracts, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. There are sixty seven contracts on the ag enda this morning for the Board's review and consideration. I would note two changes for the Board. Contract number 17; I would request that the item be withdrawn at this time and would note that contract number 19 has indicated on the agenda that it is a sole source contract, this is actually not a sole source contract. Governor: Thank you . Do any of the Board members have any questions with regards to agenda item 10, 1 -67? I have a few. The first contract is number one for the Energy Office. The next contract I have a question on is number 10, Data Communications Division. My question is a very minor one, under the justification it states \"to provide a more economical internet solution at 200 South Virginia, Reno\" what does that mean? Dave Gusta fson: This contract is to true up authority for connection. Governor: \"True up authori ty\"? Dave Gust afson: The original contract actually was insufficient regarding the authority for internet services. Governor: Thank you. The next contract I have a question is contract number 13 for the Department of Education. My question is are t here any issues with regards to the recording of the results and are they returned to Nevada in a timely manner? Carol Crothers: This particular contractor processes the results after our statewide process of teachers who score the results. So this cont ractor essentially returns the data back to us within hours of receiving the data. This amendment is an opportunity for us to see if we can decrease the amount of time that it takes us to turn around the results. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 14 Governor: Excellent, thank you. Next I would like to move to contract number 16 and I don't need a representative to come forward I just need to make a declaration. This is a contract between Welfare and Supportive Services and The Children's Cabinet. I need to disclose that my wife is an employee of The Children's Cabinet and that because she is employed with them I will not participate in the move on this matter. The next contract is number 27 for the Department of Corrections. I see that we are essentially d oubling the amount of the contract; will this allow the service for more individuals? Jeff Mohlenkamp: Yes it will, Governor. Governor: Ok, thank you. The last contract that I have is number 67. Whenever I see a figure of $247,200,000 I would like to have a little discussion regarding what it is for. Jim Wells: This contract provides HMO services for all of our 13 Northern Nevada counties. This provides us an alternative to the self funded PPO plan. So this contract has gone through the RFP proces s and there were three vendors, this company not only had just the best cost proposal but the purchasing plan design of the three that put their bid in. The amount of the contract is based on our projected enrollment. Governor: So you are saying that Home Town Health had the lowest bid and the highest rating for their services? Jim Wells: Yes. Governor: Do any of the Board members have any questions for Mr. Wells? Do any of the Board members have any questions with regards to agenda item 10 contracts 1 through 67? Hearing none the chair will accept a motion to approve all of the contract items with the exception of contract number 17 which has been withdrawn and contract number 16 which I will be abstaining from the vote. Secretary of Stat e: So moved. Attorney General: Second. Governor: There is a motion to approve agenda item 10, 1-67 with the exception of 17 and 16 by the Secretary of State and a second by the Attorney General. Is there any discussion on the motion? All in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. Governor: The chair will accept a separate motion on contract number 16. Secretary of State: I will move for approval of contract number 16. Attorney General: I will second the motion. Secretary of State: All those in favor of the motion please say aye.

APPROV AL OF REVISED AGENCY TRA VEL POLICY Pursuant to SAM 0208, in the event an agency adopts a rate of reimbursement less than the amounts specified in NRS 281.160, Board of Examiners approval is required. A. Office of the State Controller This request allows the Division to adopt a rate of reimbursement less than the amounts specifi ed by the GSA in NRS 281.160. The Office of the Controller is requesting the following changes: 1. Employees will be provided lodging arranged by the Executive Assistant. Employees, who choose not to avail themselves of the arranged lodging, will not be eligible for lodging reimbursement above the amount arranged by the Executive Assistant. 2. Employees will receive meal reimbursement when they are over 50 miles from their duty station based on the hour limits disclosed in the revised travel policy. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will now move to agenda item number twelve. Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Agenda item number 12 is an item requested by the State Controller's Office. The request is a change to the State Controller's travel policy specifically what they are requesting is that employees will be provided lodging arranged by the Executive Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 16 Assis tant within the Controller's Office. Employee 's who choose not to avail themselves of the arranged lodging, will not be eligible for lodging reimbursement above the amount arranged by the Executive Assistant. Number 2 is the employees will receive meal r eimbursement when they are over 50 miles from their duty station based on the hour limits disclosed in the revised travel policy. Item number 2 is consistent with the State Administrative Manual . Item number one is a variation from the State Administrati ve Manual. Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger. Is there a representative here from the Controller's Office on this matter? I just wanted to see if you would like to add anything further to this agenda item? Mary Keating: No sir, I am happy with the way that Mr. Clinger described it. Governor: Do any of the Board members have any questions for Mr. Clinger or Ms. Keating regarding this agenda item? Attorney General: Mary Keating, could you just explain how it departs f rom the existing policy that is set through SAM and the Statute and why you feel that it is necessary to depart from that policy to some extent. Mary Keating: As I understand correctly the current policy in SAM, several years back the State of Nevada ado pted the GSA rate policy and that allows certain hotels amounts depending on where you are going. What we are experiencing in today's market is very adequate hotels through the Purchasing website that the fees are less than what is currently been authoriz ed in GSA rates or the CONUS rates. What we are trying to clarify is we would find hotels on behalf of the employees and we will pay those amounts; however we have had instances where the employees have wanted to be paid equal or beyond that amount. Tha t is beyond what it costs us to do this in today's market and we just can't afford that. In the event that the rate is changed and at some point the hotels will equal the amount that we are finding in the GSA we will pay that rate. But just want to clari fy that we are not willing to pay the higher rate when we can find a cheaper rate on Purchasing's website. Attorney General: So just so that I can clarify, because this doesn't make sense to me . What you are basically saying is that you can find a hotel rate that is cheaper than what is allowed in the GSA even still State Employees will ask for reimbursement for the difference even though they may have received a cheaper rate? Mary Keating: Yes, madam Attorney General. Clerk: If I may clarify, there are multiple lodging rates. The GSA does a survey and they publish those surveyed rates. In the areas that they don't survey they have a CONUS rate which is a standard rate that they provide for un -surveyed areas. In the State Administrative Manual if you use a CONUS rate which is the minimum rate for the state there is no receipt that is required. If you use one of the published rates you do have to provide a lodging receipt to get reimbursement. So they should not be exceedi ng the GSA rate, and I believe what the Controller's Office is trying to do is if they can find rates that are cheaper than what the employees are turning in receipts for but they can not exceed the published rates. Attorney General: If we are going to b e physically prudent why would be paying our State employees more than what there actual expenses are? Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 17 Clerk: And we are not, I am saying that they have to supply a receipt. We should not be paying them more than what they spent. The only time that cou ld happen is if they are in an un - surve yed area using a CONUS rate which doesn't require them to submit a receipt for those areas and they could get reimbursed at a higher rate. We certainly could bring back a change to the State Administrative Manual tha t would require receipts in all cases and that would help fix the situation. Attorney General: I would prefer that. Is there some reason why we stopped requiring receipts in all instances when we are reimbursing for travel expenses and isn't that what w e are trying to be prudent with our dollars and insure that we are only paying for those expenses that are put out and not additional money that they might not be entitled to? Clerk: These are travel policies that were approved after the 2007 Legislative Session when we went to the GSA rates prior to that we didn't use the GSA rates. I am not sure why we didn't include receipts for the unsurveyed areas at the time, but it is easy to fix the State Administrative Manual if that is the direction of the Boar d. Attorney General: I don't want to get off track here but I would ask that we could bring this item back as a future agenda item that we could look at to see if we are on the right track. Since we just passed it maybe we should take a look at it and s ee how it is being implemented in practice and whether we need to make changes to that particular policy. Governor: I agree with you madam Attorney General. My question would be should we say with consideration with this agenda item in light of the poss ibility of adoption of a new policy that would include the provision of receipts. Clerk: I don't think so and Ms. Keating can correct me if I am wrong currently in the areas that are surveyed they publish rates for those areas and I think what the Contro ller's Office is indicating is that they can procure rooms less than the published rate is why they are requiring their staff to go to one executive assistant. The changes that I am talking about would not change that. Governor: Perhaps madam Attorney General, in the Board Member comments you could request or the Board could request the examination of SAM being consistent with what Mr. Clinger has indicated to ensure that there is a review of all of the receipts and that there is not a reimbursement gr eater than the cost of the trip. Secretary of State: I would just like to comment that I remember seeing some concerns from the Department of Wildlife that they sometimes stay in places where they would not obtain a receipt so I think we would just need to check and see who is or would be exempt from turning in those types of receipts. Clerk: Mr. Secretary your memory is better than mine, but now that you mentioned it that was the issue and we can certainly review the minutes from those meetings and see who would be exempt from the policy. Governor: The chair will accept a motion to approve the revised agency travel policy. Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 18 Secretary of State: So moved. Attorney General: I will second the motion. Governor: It has been motioned by the Secretary of State, second by the Attorney General. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. 13. BOARD MEMBERS' COMMENTS/PUBLIC COMMENTS Comments: Governor: Are there any Board member comments? Mr. Clinger, I don't want to be redundant but if you would explore a possible limit to SAM's policy as represented by the Attorney General and also to respond to the Secretary of State with regards to those agencies who would be exempt from this policy. Clerk: Yes I will. Attorney General: Thank you Governor. Governor: Are there any other Board member comments? Are there any public comments from any one in Las Vegas or in Carson C ity? Kevin Ranft: I am testifying this morning in matters of public concern. I was hoping that I wouldn't have to be here today regarding the impact of the furloughs for the Department of Corrections. However, I have major concerns with agenda item 7 . I am told that Nevada is the only state that uses furloughs for their staff for the prison system through the country. There are some alternatives that can be used in place of the furloughs. With all due respect to Director Cox I feel that the furloug hs have impacted the safety, and the security of the staff, the officers and all of those involved in the prison system. NDOC with all of its fallen down positions has the lowest officer/inmate ratios in the nation. NDOC used additional holding shut down s to absorb these furloughs. That is not safe and has caused instances like the nurse. We feel that there is a major concern here and had there been two officers on the floor that inmate would have been restrained and taken care of orderly. Two days la ter the Department of Corrections said that we made a mistake. Again this is a matter of public concern and there are some security concerns here. I respectfully request investigating and a temporary exemption into the Nevada Department of Corrections fo r their furloughs. Thank you for your time. Governor: Thank you sir. Is there any other individual that would like to provide public comment? Seeing and hearing none I will close public comment. *14. ADJOURNMENT Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Secretary of State Seconded By: Attorney General Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Board of Examiners Meeting April 12 , 2011 - Minutes Page 19 Governor: We move to agenda item number 14, Is there a motion to adjourn?

APPROV AL OF PROPOSED CHANGE TO TRA VEL REIMBURSEMENT Pursuant to SAM 0208, in the event an agency adopts a rate of reimbursement less than the amounts specified in NRS 281.160, Board of Examiners approval is required. A. Public Utilities Commission This request allows the Commission to require employees to submit lodging receipts for travel within the Continental United States (CONUS) regardless of the actual cost in curred. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney Seconded By: Secretary of State Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: Welcome to the May meeting of the Board of Examiners. All members are present. I ask that we move to the first item on the agenda, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Item one on the agenda this morning is a request from the Public Utilities Commission to revise their travel policy to require receipts for all lodging and the State Administrative Manual does not require a receipt for all lodging. We will be bringing an item to the Board revising the current policies in the State Administrative Manual. Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger, is there someone here from the Public Utilities Commission on this matter? Could you please give us some more bac kground as to the genesis of this item? Crystal Jackson: Thank you Governor. As Mr. Clinger just stated the current policy doesn't require a lodging receipt for reimbursement for the CONUS rates around the State. What the Public Utilities Commission ha s experiencing is that employees can apply for reimbursement with respect to lodging without a receipt and can seek reimbursement up to $77.00 even though the expense never occurred. For example you may have an employee who got a complimentary room or the y may stay with family or friends, but on their travel reimbursement they claim the $77.00. So we would like to change that policy to require a receipt for all lodging expenses and that way the Commission will have the ability to reimburse the actual amou nts that we incurred so no more and no less. Governor: Is this something that has been abused? Crystal Jackson: We have our suspicions. It is difficult to say yes when we don't require a receipt. But we are aware that we have some employees that have been submitting for reimbursement when the travel expenses have not occurred. We are estimating that we could probably stretch our travel dollars with this change and currently we are trying to make our spending go as far as we can so that we don't excee d that budget account. Governor: Thank you Ms. Jackson. Do any of the other members have questions? My question is should this be a state wide policy? Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 4 Clerk: Yes Governor. This relates to the discussion that we had at the last BOE with the State Controller 's Office. We currently don't require receipts when they use the CONUS rate which is the lowest rate. What we discussed at the last meeting is that we are going to look into this policy and bring back changes to the Board members. Governor: If there are no questions by the Board, the chair will accept a motion. Attorney General: I will move for approval. Secretary of State: Second. Governor: This item has been motioned by the Attorney General and second by the Secretary of State to approve agenda item one. Are there any questions on the motion? Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. *2. VICTIMS OF CRIME 201 1 3RD QUARTER REPORT AND 2011 4TH QUARTER RECOMMENDATI ON NRS 217.260 requires the Board of Examiners to estimate available revenue and anticipated claim costs each quarter. If revenues are insufficient to pay anticipated claims, the statute directs that claim payments must be reduced proportionately. The Victi ms of Crime Program Coordinator recommends paying the Priority 1 & 2 claims at 100% and Priority 3 claims at 100% of the approved amount for the 4th quarter of FY 2011 . Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney General Seconded B y: Secretary of State Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: Next item on the agenda, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. This is a request for the Victims of Crime program to approve the reimbursement rates for the 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2011. This requirement is pursuant to NRS 217.260 the Board is required to estimate available revenue and anticipated claim costs each quarter. Based on those projections it is recommended that we continue to pay Priority Claims a t 100%. In your packet you will see beginning on page two of the information provided you can see on the first table the amounts that were billed in fiscal year 2011. Governor: Is this an information item or an action item? Clerk: This is an action it em. The Board has to set approve the reimbursement rates for the 4th quarter based on the projections. Governor: I have a question; it says that the federal governments' contribution for the grant is $820,000 higher than last year. What are the elements that come in that determine how much that grant is going to be? Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 5 Clerk: Governor, I am not sure if we have anyone here from the Victims of Crime program. I am not sure w hat the criteria is , for allocating those funds to the state. Governor: For my reading on this because the increases in revenue from fines, restitution, wage assessment, court assessment, treasurer s interest it has got to be because we increased the gran t, but if the grant doesn't come in next year at that level what would we have to consider? Clerk: Governor, this is something that we have to evaluate every quarter to see what the state receives to pay the claims and you are correct for this fiscal yea r we did receive a $820,000 more in federal assistance than we received last year so that has enabled us to pay the claims at 100%. We are required to come back every quarter and make the projections off what we think the revenue would be . Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger. Are there any questions from the Board members? The chair will accept a motion. Attorney General: I'll move for approval. Secretary of State: Second. Governor: It has been motioned by the Attorney General to approve agenda item n umber two and second by the Secretary of State. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. *3. SALARY ADJUSTMENTS A. Distribution of Salary Adjustments to Depart ments, Commissions and Agencies, pursuant to Chapter 391, Senate Bill 433, Sections 6, 7, 8, of the 2009 Legislative Session. The 2009 Legislative Session made appropriations from the General Fund and the Highway Fund to the Board of Examiners to meet certain salary d eficiencies for fiscal year 2011 that might be created between the appropriated money of the respective departments, commissions, and agencies and the actual cost of the personnel of those departments, commissions, and agencies that are necessary to pay for salaries . Under this legislation, the following amounts from the General Fund and/or Highway Fund are recommended: Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 6 BA# BUDGET ACCOUNT NAME GENERAL FUND ADJUSTMENT HWY FUND ADJUSTMENT 1052 ARCHIVES & RECORDS $4,567 2870 NEVADA HISTORICAL SOCIETY $8,036 2891 NEVADA STATE LIBRARY $11,537 2892 CULTURAL AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATION $11,508 2940 NEVADA STATE MUSEUM $24,172 2941 MUSEUMS & HISTORY ADMINISTRATION $4,784 3194 HHS - CONSUMER HEALTH PROTECTION $15,990 Total $80,594 Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney General Seconded By: Secretary of State Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: Item number three on the agenda, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Item number three is a request to disburse funds out of the Board of Examiners' salary adjustment account. These are funds that were appropriated by the 2009 Legislature for the purpose s of allocating to state agencies the Governor's budget. Over the current biennium it was a 6% salary reduction and when the legislature implemented that furlough which reduced the cut to 4.6% and when the legislature approved those budgets they did not r estore all of the funding back to the individual accounts. Instead the difference between the 6% cuts for the Governor's budget and the 4.6% approved the legislature was appropriated to the Board of Examiners salary adjustment funds. So this is the firs t of the series of salary adjustments that you will see for the fiscal year of 2011. Most of these items relate to the Department of Cultural Affairs and there is one Consumer Health Protection on there from the Department of Health and Human Services. S o these items come in to our office at the end of each fiscal year and each agency is allowed a certain amount of the Board of Examiners funds to be allocated. Governor: Which account do these funds come out of? Clerk: It comes out of an account that we refer to as the Board of Examiners salary adjustment account. So the legislature appropriates funds to this account to be disbursed to state agencies based on the difference between the 6% reduction that was originally put in the budget. Typically this account is used to fund cost of living and instead of putting the cost of living into each individual account it is just appropriated to this account and then allocated out to the correct agency based on the adjustments. Governor: And we will have a sufficient amount to cover this? Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 7 Clerk: Yes, we will have sufficient money to cover this. We track how much each agency is eligible for the biennium and we don't let any of the agencies to exceed their calculated amount . Governor: Thank you , Mr. Clinger. Are there any questions from the Board members? Attorney General: Quick question, so that account it will no longer exist after the next biennium is that right? Clerk: It depends on what the legislature does and if they were to change the salary reduction and they didn't go in and change each individual account than it would be put into the Board of Examiners' salary adjustment account for disbursement to the agencies. Governor: Are there any other questio ns from the Board members? Hearing none the chair will accept a motion on agenda item number three. Attorney General: I will move for approval of agenda item three. Secretary of State: I'll second. Governor: It has been motioned by the Attorney Gene ral and second by the Secretary of State for the approval of agenda item three. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion please signify by saying aye. The motion passes unanimously. *4. STATE VEHICLE PURC HASE Pursuant to NRS 334.010 , no automobile may be purchased by any department, office, bureau, officer or employee of the State without prior written consent of the State Board of Examiners. AGENCY NAME # OF VEHICLES NOT TO EXCEED: Department of Business and Industry - Industrial Relations - Mine Safety & Training Section 1 $26,359.25 Total: $26,359.25 Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney General Seconded By: Secretary of State Vote: 3 -0 Comments: Governor: We will move to agenda item four, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Item number four is a request to purchase a vehicle. This is a replacement vehicle for the Department of Business and Industry, Industrial Relations Division, Mine Safety & Train ing Section. This is to replace a vehicle that has 127,488 miles on it. Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 8 Governor: Are there any questions from the Board members on number four of the agenda? Hearing none, the chair will accept a motion. Attorney General: Move for approval of item f our. Secretary of State: Second. Governor: It has been motioned by the Attorney General to approve item four on the agenda and second by the Secretary of State. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. *5. LEASES Three statewide lease s were submitted to the Board for review and approval. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney General Seconded By: Secretary of State Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: We will now move to agenda item number five. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Agenda item number five is the request for approval on three leases. The first lease is for the Department of Business and Industry, Director's Office for a move due to the consolidation of the Depart ment. Just a note for the board members this consolidation was actually approved this morning by the joint subcommittee. This item is contingent upon final legislative approval. If the legislature didn't approve the consolidation this lease would have t o change. The second lease on the list is an amendment to an existing lease and I believe the third lease is also an amendment. Governor: Are there any questions from the Board members on agenda item five? Attorney General: Let me back up to lease one, if the legislature doesn't approve the consolidation we will not need this lease? Clerk: Not necessarily, it just depends what the legislature decides to do. The size of this lease could change if the legislature decides not to approve the consolidation. Attorney General: I guess I just wanted to make sure that we are able to get out of t he lease at no cost to the state if the consolidation is not approved . Clerk: That is correct; all of our leases have a funding clause so if the funding is not approved for this relocation there will be no costs to us. Attorney General: So it's conditi oned not necessarily on Interim Finance Committee and the Board of Examiners or is it IFC that approves it or is it the legislature? Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 9 Clerk: There is actually several pieces to it. The Joint Subcommittee today approved the consolidation. What IFC will d o is there is some funding needed in fiscal year 2011 to make the move happen and there are some tenant improvements that also needs to be done. There is a work program that was submitted to IFC to provide funding in the current fiscal year. Governor: Mr. Secretary do you have any questions? Secretary of State: I do not, Governor. Governor: The chair will accept a motion on agenda item five for leases. Attorney General: I'll move for approval. Secretary of State: Second. Governor: It has been m otioned by the Attorney General and second by the Secretary of State. Is there any discussion on the motion? Hearing none all those in favor of the motion please say aye. The motion passes unanimously. *6. CONTRACTS Seventy -five independent contract s were submitted to the Board for review and approval. Clerk's Recommendation : I recommend approval. Motion By: Attorney General Seconded By: Secretary of State Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: We now move to agenda item six, Mr. Clinger. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Agenda item six is the request for the Board of Examiners' to approve 75 independent contracts. Governor: I have a few contracts that I would like to discuss contract number 1, 6 -14, 15, 17, 42, 73 and 74. Do any of the other Boar d members have any contracts that you have any questions on? Secretary of State: No Governor. Attorney General: I have questions regarding contract number 17. Governor: We will move on to contract number one. My question is simply what are we accomplishing on this contract? Tom Wilczek : This contract is to provide the Nevada Energy Assistance Corporation (NEAC), a non -profit corporation, formed by the Department of B usiness & Industry funding to lessen the burdens of government of the State by promoting the development of renewable and sustainable energy projects with Nevada. Pursuant to the recommendations of the Governor's Renewable Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 10 Energy Transmission Access Adviso ry Committee, and the Governor's Renewable Energy Transmission Access Advisory Committee, Phase II, NEAC was formed to perform the essential functions of conducting feasibility, environmental and engineering studies and planning for the construction and op eration of transmission lines necessary to connect renewable and sustainable energy generating sites to the State and National power grids. Secretary of State: Governor, I would just note that NEAC is in default with our office. The contract requires th at they maintain themselves in good standings. We will follow up with them to make sure that they are incompliance. Governor: We will move on to contract number six. Greg Smith: These contracts are all linked together is there any specific questions or would you like me to talk a little bit of why we administer these contracts? Governor: Yes, that was my question why are we doing these contracts? Greg Smith: The short answer is why purchasing? We do a good job. I will tell you a couple of things is the State needs to be the recipient. We actually administer about seven Commodity Foods Programs such as, The School Nutrition Program is one of them and there are several other s. They all kind of link together in our distribution and keep the trucks full, receiving money. The recent internal audits that we have had by both LCB and our own Internal Audit staff from the Department of Administration have discussed the idea, would it be better in Welfare or in DHHS? We have come out of each of those audits with a recommendation of continue to talk, continue to get the biggest bang for the buck for right now and the last 30 years it has been done in the Purchasing Division. When y ou talk about how , the State has a 65,000 square foot warehouse located in Reno next to the DMV. We also have a 15,000 square foot warehouse located in Las Vegas that we own. One of the reasons that it has been hugely important for the State to continue to play this roll is that once you get outside of Clark County and Washoe County and maybe Carson City being the exception you will find that there is not enough storage place s in the rural areas to administer the program and so what happens is the federal government will decide that Nevada is allocation of chicken is x million pounds of chicken. These contracts are for processors to turn the raw chicken into chicken nuggets, chicken fingers things that the school lunch folks have determined that their kid s will eat and therefore they are interested in buying. The commodity product goes to the processor, the processor then ships us the product we bring it into our warehouse and then our trucks deliver it out to the school facilities on a regular basis. On e of the things that is kind of neat is how our system works. Keep in mind the State Purchasing also operates the surplus excess property program where we pick up desks and chairs any excess property that an agency is getting rid of and bring it back and either use reallocation techniques to get it back into other agencies or non-profit organizations or we auction it off and bring that revenue back into the State. The synergy of these kinds of product we are able to send full trucks because we have a vari ety of programs going out like to Elko and we are able to bring half to three quarters of a truck load of surplus property back in. So in essence the federal government and this is all cost allocated out and it has all been approved the federal government through these programs helps subsidize our surplus property program to a tremendous extent. If we weren't doing that full truck out and half truck back we would still be settled with doing the excess surplus property program. Coming to the legislature o urselves and asking for general fund money in order to do that. So there is a lot of Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 11 duck tailing that goes on. The allocations are based on the School lunch program but also the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). We work very closely with the food banks in the state primarily Three Square in the South and Food Bank of Northern Nevada and we are having some very serious discussions on maximizing the distribution points and value. We have a lot of people that are very happy to do busine ss with us but we want to make sure that our distribution point isn't four miles down the road from someone else's distribution point to where an individual who probably doesn't have transportation needs food to where we say well here is your food basket n ow if you want the one that you would get from Three Square you have to figure out a way to get over here. So we are talking in earnest of how we can combine these things and even combine some of the deliveries so we can maximize the amount of food we get to the people. The two primaries are: how we get the money is the unemployment population and the percentage of people at or near the poverty levels. Unfortunately in Nevada in the last three or four years that graph has gone up and our budget has grown immensely from the federal government and food product distributed out to people. But we have been able to keep up we have used man power a lot of volunteer workers help distribute the food to churches and to food banks. It is quite an intricate program ; I would love to show it to you sometime. Also, these two warehouses kind of function as an ombudsman state garage if you will. There is a lot of times where something comes up and things need to be picked up and taken out of places, we are not concerne d where it goes right now just get it out here. And we can take it and store it and then decide what we will do with it. These programs basically pay for the operation of that facility that a lot of agencies get to benefit from. Governor: Thank you Mr. Smith. That was one of my questions, so you are in conversations with Non -Profits like Three Square and Food Bank to see if they perhaps would like to take it over because they are in the business as well? Greg Smith: We have over all conversations going on right now. We brought a facilitator in to keep everybody in their corners and keep things moving productively as you might imagine there is a little bit of turf protection that goes along with these things as well simply because we have done it for thirty years doesn't mean that is the best way to do it now. We do have very sophisticated food banks at either end of the State right now. Part of our concern at least with those two food banks is our program delivers food products to the whole State. Those two programs that I just mentioned specifically really focus on Clark and Washoe. They do get out into the other areas, but they really focus heavily on Clark and Washoe. So part of our concern is we want to make sure the people in Ely, the people in Gabs, the people in Panac a are not forgotten in their distribution plan. We can do better than what we are doing now together. Governor: So back to the schools, the school districts have their own vendors so you deliver the food to the school Greg Smith: The vendors such as Tyson they are the ones that package all of the chicken fingers or nuggets or what ever it is the schools says they want to order . Back up just a little bit we weren't very close with the schools to decide what to order out of these products because they found out that the kids liked different stuff, so we are trying to always work with them and make sure that the product we are sending is something that they can buy from the distributor. The cost of these products and this is why the school districts love this, the chicken is pretty much given to the State so we are able to keep the cost low on this. So they maximize every school Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 12 district in the State including Clark County, does everything that they can to use up their alloc ation on the commodity products to keep their costs low for the school lunches. Governor: Thank you Mr. Smith. Do any of the other Board members have any questions? Hearing none we will move on to item number fifteen. Just a couple of questions you are looking to develop and then secondly I see that this is an out of state advertising firm? Larry Friedman: The whole process was overseen by State Purchasing. The Committee that reviewed the resp onses is made up of five people, but two of them are our Commissioners. There were eight responses that were from Nevada the others were all out of state. The proposal from one of the vendors was alarming with regards to the scoring. One of the vendors from Nevada was one of the top three but the other vendor came in less. Governor: I am not a marketer but I have lived in the area a longtime and is it important that you renew a brand every three years? This concerns me. Larry Friedman: We have never done brand researching. We have had a very successful campaign and they are pleased just with our advertising and we just want to send the strongest message possible. Governor: You said that there were only two vendors in Nevada? Larry Friedman: Yes. Governor: I don't have anymore questions. Do any of the other Board members have any questions? Thank you, Larry. We will now move on to agenda item number seventeen. Could you please give us some background and let us know why you nee d this contract. Chris Nielson: The way that this contract was written is there is an option for a one or two year extension on the original contract. I believe the Secretary of State as well as the Attorney General both have some history with this cont ract that goes back to 2008. What this contract does is provides lock box services. Those services are a high volume processing and depositing of taxpayer payments. This is the fastest way that the department can process the returns. The reason why it states a one or a two year extension is the current contract expires June 30th of this year. The departments intent I believe was to go out to RFP at some point. The one year lease might not give us enough time to go through the RFP process but I will fee l comfortable with either extension of the contract. Governor: If you knew that this contract was due to expire in June why hasn't it come to the Board any sooner? Chris Nielson: Thank you Governor. I anticipated that question and personally I don't know. I was not involved with the original contract. I suspect that the policy was to go to RFP. Governor: Are there any Board member comments? Attorney General: Yes, thank you. I know that back in January when this came before us and you were not w ith the department at that time. One of our concerns is that the money has to be in Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 13 the state and our approval was contingent upon JP Chase moving the money to an account here in Nevada. Are the lockboxes here in Nevada? Chris Nielson: I do not believe so. Attorney General: Just let me tell you that I have the statute in front of me and it is very specific and from my understanding it hasn't changed. Any money belonging to the State must be deposited into an institution or national bank. So unless you went to the Board of Finance it has to be at a facility in the State. That was a condition of our motion on the original contract. It sounds like that has not happened. Chris Nielson: I apologize my deputy is not here today, I can 't say for sure w here the account is at. It was certainly not the intent of the department to defy what is in statute. Attorney General: Here is my concern obviously we are in a bind and in this point in time we are going to have an extension so that you can go through the RFP process so that there is no disruption in service . Chris Nielson: That is correct. Attorney General: At the same time however, can we move that money to a different account now or is that going to disrupt the process ? Chris Nielson: I can certainly pleasure the board and contact JP Morgan Chase today and even though they are located in Arizona get some insight as to what we can do to move the account to Nevada. Attorney General: That is what I ask Governor, I don 't know what the pleasure of the Board is but at least I am willing to extend this for a year with the promise that you are going out to RFP. Chris Nielson: Absolutely. We will start that RFP much sooner than later. Governor: If you could also follow up with each of the Board members as to whether there is an account here and if not what does it take to get one. Chris Nielson: Absolutely . Clerk: Governor, if I may we can certainly bring an information item back to the next meeting to give the Board members an update on this process. Governor: Yes if you could please follow up with that Mr. Clinger . Mr. Secretary , do you have any questions? Secretary of State: I have one comment and just a couple of questions. I just want to echo the concerns o f the Attorney General. I remember this discussion in 2008 and at that time had commented that it is one of the top complaints that I hear because people confuse me as the tax collector in the state that they have to send their money to Arizona. So I am certainly anxious to see that result. I do have a couple of questions for Mr. Nielson, under the previous terms of the Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 14 contract the state was paying in the ball park of about a million five a year and under this proposal the one year extension that we are contemplating it looks like we are contemplating a substantial discount and paying about five hundred and twenty -one thousand . If we extend that additionally it jumps up to a million five or in the ball park of what we were paying previously. Do you hav e any idea why they offered that substantial discount for this one year extension? Chris Nielson: Mr. Secretary, it is my understanding that when we were funded last session we estimated the amount it is variable depending on the term because it is based on transactions. We over estimated so if the Board approves the one year there is a discount, no t because JP Morgan is offering a discount but because there is extra money or a credit going forward and if we do the two year we initially go back to the original dollar amount. Secretary of State: What is your recommendation? Is it to extend it on e year or two years and part of my concern is in looking at the amount for the two year extension that seems to be more in line with the original contract rate. Some of the back ground material attached some of the concern is that if they put the RFP out and they select another vendor you would want to insure over lap in services so that there is no disruption of service. And if that were to happen if we were to select a different contractor I could see how some people suggest that the state may not be in a strong bargaining position because obviously the contractor at that time wouldn't have much incentive to give us the benefit of the doubt. Have you been given any insurance from JP Morgan that should we only continue this for one year and we are not ab le to finalize the RFP in the expedited manor that they would hold that same rate and make it available to us? Chris Nielson: We have been given assurances from JP Morgan that if we choose another vendor they will make sure that there is no interruption of services. As far as your specific question on the extension beyond one year, I am not aware of the specifics regarding the rate but that is certainly something that I can find out and bring back to the board. Secretary of State: So at this point what is your recommendation is it a one year or two year extension. Chris Nielson: My organization would be comfortable with the one year. Governor: Are there any other questions? Thank you, Mr. Nielson. We will move on to contract number forty two. Jus t a question on how that number $643,520 was established? Jeff Morrow: The $643,520 is a two year rate. It will be $1.52 per month per child. I am not sure what the going rate is and I am new to this position but that is the rate during school and for summer school. Governor: So is it essentially in line with what the state is paying? Jeff Morrow: I understand that it is but I can't 100% verify. Governor: That is all that I have, do any of the members have any questions? Thank you. Next is contract number 49 for the Department of Public Safety. This is just a mec hanical question, this contract is for $295,000 and there is also a collection of registration fees. Is there Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 15 reimbursement for each student, or is there a payment that is made for these motorcycle lessons? How does all of that work? So this is just a s ubsidy for people who want to take that class? Kiphart: That is correct. Governor: That is all I have on that, do any of the other members have any questions? Thank you. Next we have contracts 73 and 74. Jim Wells: Thank you Governor. Contract n umber 73 is a new contract to replace an existing contract. We went through the RFP process there were 8 vendors in the RFP and in the process of the evaluation committee some of the things that they looked at were guarantees and the biggest part of this contract is to provide prescription drugs to the participants. Only about 3.1 million will actually go to the vendor and the other portion is for the cost of the medication for the participants. Governor: Are we spending more or less on prescriptions? Jim Wells: We are spending much more. Governor: Is there any explanation for that? That is a significant amount of money. Jim Wells: It is dramatic. The prices of the prescriptions are very expensive. Governor: Does that State have any kind of w ellness program to compliment that? Jim Wells: Absolutely Gove rnor. We are meeting with o ur wellness vendor this morning to go over diet, nutrition and exercise for participants that choose the PPO Plan. Governor: Do either of the Board members have a ny questions on contract number 73. We will move on to the next contract number 74. Jim Wells: This contract has no state dollars attached to it. This is just a service that we provide to our participants to offer discounted insurance. Currently as of December 31, 2009 there were 14,500 policies with a premium of about $16,000,000. Governor: Is there a process to which we could open this up? Jim Wells: This contract went to an RFP four years ago. Governor: And how long are we exten ding this contract? Jim Wells: This particular contract is being extended for two years. One of the reasons that we went with two years is the number of participants that are with this vendor. Governor: Are you satisfied with Liberty Mutual as far as claims go with all of the participants? Jim Wells: There are many services provided by Liberty Mutual. Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 16 Governor: Are there any other questions for Mr. Wells from the Board members? Thank you.

Department of Transportation - Settlement claims paid to former employees Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 18 NRS 41.037(3), allowing state agencies to pay an administrative claim or settlement from any money appropria ted or lawfully available for that purpose. In fiscal year 2010, Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) paid settlement claims to three former employees in the amounts of $10,000, $22,500, and $150,000, for a total of $182,500. These payments were n ot approved by the Board of Examiners prior to issuing the payments, may not have been in compliance with Chapter 41 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and were not transparent. Items for possible future action include direction from the Board for the approv al of contracts and settlements, possible changes to the State Administrative Manual, Chapter 300, regarding cooperative agreements and contracts to change the threshold requirements and/or add a section regarding settlements, and possible future discussio n and action regarding the three settlement claims paid by NDOT in fiscal year 2010. Comments: Governor: Mr. Clinger if you would move on to agenda item 8B. Clerk: Thank you Governor. Agenda item 8B is an information item for the Board dealing with the settlement claims to former employees involving the Department of Transportation . We put this on the agenda as an informational item for the Board review. I have also included information on there on potential future direction from the Board on how the Board would like to see these settlement claims handled. We included a potential request to change the State Administrative Manual to clarify the requirements on th ese and we are really just looking for some direction from the Board on future settlement agreements and how we should proceed. Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger. I see Mr. Munro here from the Attorney General's Office. Keith Munro: There appears to be three claims here. The State has a public policy matter that is called the Tort Claims fund and everyone knows about the Tort Claims fund. There is also a Settlement Account Fund. This budget account was created by the legislature. The Department of Transportation has the authority to settle their claims through this account, but there is a little difficulty in process. The process is the constitution creates the Board of Examiners and it requires the Board of Examiners to approve all claims. It doesn't appear that the Department of Transportation or the Budget Division are coming to the Board of Examiners to get the claims approved. I would recommend that all claims come to the Board for approval. Governor: Thank you Mr. Mun ro and are you aware if there are other claims that may have made their way past this separate account? Keith Munro: These are the only three claims that I am aware of. Governor: Do you know when the settlement account was established? Keith Munro: No I don't, but it should be available in LCB records. Governor: Perhaps Mr. Clinger would know the answer? Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 19 Clerk: Governor, I do not. We can bring that information back to the Board. 9. BOARD MEMBERS' COMMENTS/PUBLIC COMMENT Comments: Governor: Agenda item number nine. Are there any Board member comments today? Secretary of State: Governor, I just wanted to wish your Budget Director Mr. Clinger the best of luck in his endeavors. It has been a real privilege to work with him since I was elected in 2007. He has done an exceptional job, I was kind of selfishly hoping that he would stay for the long haul but I certainly understand the opportunity is in front of him. I witnessed firsthand how challenging his job has been over that period of time a nd think he has handled it with utmost grace. So the City of Reno's gain is certainly our loss. I really appreciate his service. Governor: Thank you, Mr. Secretary and I am not letting him go just yet. I agree with everything that you said and the Cit y of Reno is going to be extremely well served. Andrew has had a very steady hand for somebody that has universal respect. Here in Carson City as well as throughout the State he has the utmost integrity, work ethic, family man and I just appreciate every thing that you have done during my opportunity to work with you. Attorney General: And let me just say that I echo the comments as well. Clerk: Thank you to all of the Board members. I am very humbled by all of your comments and just want to say that I have enjoyed working with all of you and I will definitely be here until the budget is done, Governor I have committed that to you. I have just really enjoyed the process and I want to thank you all. Governor: Thank you Mr. Clinger that is the best news that I have heard all day. But I also have Public Comment and I am sorry if I mentioned this at the last meeting, maybe when you walked into t he room you saw the etched glass above the door way. This room is dedicated to the memory of Governor Guinn. You see his picture there and in the very near future the former first lady Mrs. Guinn has agreed to donate a portrait of the Governor which will hang in here permanently. So in the future you are not coming to the Annex you are coming to the Guinn Room. Do we have anyone from the public who would like to make a comment? Kim Wallin: Good Morning Governor. I would like to comment regarding the last agenda item with NDOT and settlement claims. The way that I got involved in this is the individual who receiving the money called and said that it is on the wrong form. That was first acknowledgement of this happening. That is when our office started investigating it and that is when we found that it hadn't gone to the Board of Examiners and we wanted to bring it to your attention as well. We started doing some checking and this individ ual had left state service and their employee id was still active. A couple of things that I would like to see happen is have some procedures I need to get a copy of all of the agreements because I need to make sure that it is on the right form so the ind ividual can get paid. Andrew I will help you out on your job. There was another settlement that happened in February 2011 for the Insurance Division for $12,000 and it was again paid through miscellaneous services again using the employee id number. Board of Examiners Meeting May 10, 2011 - Minutes Page 20 Governor: Thank you, Is there anyone else here from the public wishing to make a comment? *10. ADJOURNMENT Motion By: Attorney State Vote: 3-0 Comments: Governor: We will move to agenda item ten adjournment. Is there a motion to adjourn? Attorney General: So moved. Secretary of State: Second. Governor: It has been motioned by the Attorney General and second by the Secretary of State. All of those in favor of the motion please signify by saying aye.

Liberty St., Ste. 110 Reno, NV 89501 (775)331-4555 WHEREAS. NRS 284.173 authorizes elective officers, heads of departments, boards, commissions or institutions to engage, subject to the approval of the Board of Examiners, services of persons as independent contractors: and WHEREAS, it is deemed that the service of Contractor is both necessary and in the best interests of the State of Nevada: NOW. THEREFORE, in consideration of the aforesaid premises, the parties mutually agree as follows: 1. REQUIRED APPROVAL. This Contract shall not become effective until and unless approved by the Nevada State Board of Examiners. 2.

CONTRACT TERM. This Contract shall be effective from Board of Examiners Approval to June 30. 2011. unless sooner terminated by either party as specified in paragraph ten (10). 4. NOTICE. Unless otherwise specified, termination shall not be effective until 30 calendar days after a party has served written notice of default, or without cause upon the other party. All notices or other communications required or permitted to be given under this Contract shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally in hand, by telephonic facsimile with simultaneous regular mail, or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid on the date posted, and addressed to the other party at the address specified above. 5. INCORPORATED DOCUMENTS. The parties agree that the scope of work shall be specifically described. This Contract incorporates the following attachments in descending order of constructive precedence: ATTACHMENT A: SCOPE OF WORK ATTACHMENT B: INSURANCE SCHEDULE A Contractor's Attachment shall not contradict or supersede any State specifications, terms or conditions without written evidence of mutual assent to such change appearing in this Contract: 6. CONSIDERATION. The parties agree that Contractor will provide the services specified in paragraph five (5) at a cost of $200.00 per hour (state the exact cost or hourly, daily, or weekly rate exclusive of travel or per diem expenses) with the total Contract or installments payable: Upon Invoice, not to exceed $80.000.00.

All subcontracts shall reflect re- quirements of this paragraph. c. Period of Retention. All books, records, reports, and statements relevant to this Contract must be retained a minimum three (3) yeans, and for five (5) years if any federal funds are used pursuant to the Contract. The retention period runs from the date of payment for the relevant goods or sendees by the State, or from the date of termination of the Contract, whichever is later.

The State may terminate this Contract, and Contractor waives any and all claim(s) for damages, effective immediately upon receipt of written notice (or any date specified therein) if for any reason the Contracting Agency's funding from State and/or federal sources is not appropriated or is withdrawn, limited, or impaired. c. Cause Termination for Default or Breach. A default or breach may be declared with or without termination.

Winding Up Affairs Upon Termination. In the event of termination of this Contract for any reason, the parties agree that the provisions of this paragraph survive termination: i.

There is no change in the existing rate structure. 6.CONTRACT AMENDMENT 1.The maximum amount of the original contract: $9,009.00 2.Total amount of any previous contract amendment: $8,227.00 4.New maximum contract amount: $17,236.00 and/or the termination date of the original contract has changed to: 06/30/2014 II. JUSTIFICATION 7.What conditions require that this work be done? This is a flight safety issue for NDOW. NDOW flies helicopter and fixed wing aircraft a total of about 1,400 hours annually. Much of the terrain surveyed is high altitude and mountainous. In the event of an emergency landing or crash, NDOW dispatch operations will have near real-time location data for the aircraft, allowing for time-sensitive and potentially life-saving response by emergency responders. Page 1 of 3 Contract #: CONV5727 1018.Explain why State employees in your agency or other State agencies are not able to do this work: The technology is not available to provide this service. 9.Were quotes or proposals solicited? No Was the solicitation (RFP) done by the Purchasing Division?No a. If yes, list the names of vendors that submitted proposals: Not Applicable b. Soliciation Waiver: Not Applicable c. Why was this contractor chosen in preference to other? SkyTrac manufactures the equipment installed on NDOW aircraft, which was obtained through the Purchasing division in 2008. NDOW investigated and learned that if we select another flight service provider that can interface with the equipment, that provider would still be required to use the SkyTrac network to obtain and share the date with us and such third party vendor would be charged by SkyTrac. Therefore, such an arrangement would not save the State any money, especially in light of the low dollar value of this contract amendment (roughly $2,800 per year). Replacing the devices would be equally impractical - they have about four years of remaining life. d. Last bid date: Anticipated re-bid date: 10.Does the contract contain any IT components? No III.
