OVERALL CORE - SPECIFIC AIMS The mission of the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute ( UR-CTSI ) is to develop, demonstrate and disseminate methods and approaches to advance translational research, by: 1) providing ed- ucation and training, 2) fostering transdisciplinary teams, 3) improving quality and efficiency, and 4) engaging community and national stakeholders and partners. Our vision is to become a replicable model environment for research, across the translational spectrum from molecules to populations, responsive to community priorities, conducted by transdisciplinary, patient - and community -engaged teams, that improves population health. We build on a decade of exceptional accomplishments in translational researc h: vibrant workforce training pr o- grams, national contributions to research methods and education, and productivity of UR -CTSI supported translational researchers. We train leaders in team science, including data science, informatics, regulatory sc i- ence, and population science. We are committed to diversity in workforce development , community engag e- ment, and research participant recruitment. The UR -CTSI fosters transdisciplinary teams, connecting them with resources, and tracking metrics of success to continuously improve research quality and efficiency. We direct pilot programs that accelerate translation of basic science and bedside discoveries into clinical therapeutics, and develop novel research competency and regulatory science programs. We advance translational research by developing innovative informatics methods and research support. A cornerstone of our work is the dynamic integration of healthcare delivery and research, clinical trials, and implementation of novel evidence- based i n- terventions, the \" living healthcare laboratory,\" at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), the ac a- demic home of the UR -CTSI. We actively participate in the CTSA Consortium leadership in the Domain Task Forces, and recently collaborated on seven X02 Innovation Network applications. Our Aims include the follo w- ing: Aim 1: Workforce Development: To train the next generation of translational science workforce leaders in the collaborative, technical, and regulatory skills necessary to improve the translation of discoveries to clinical application and to improve population health. This will include education, support for transl a- tional science workforce diversity, translational science degree programs, regulatory and human subjects' r e- search science, and training in high impact areas such as informatics, and population- based, community - engaged research across the lifespan. We will continue to strengthen workforce diversity at all levels, from staff to trainees to faculty. Aim 2: Collaboration and Engagement: To accelerate translational research collaboration and en- gagement across the spectrum of community stakeholders. We will foster community -driven research by engaging practice- based networks, by ensuring the active participat ion of community members in research de- sign and oversight, and by implementing innovative methods of research participation (e.g. mobile devices). Key to our success will be comprehensive support for transdisciplinary team science through education, col- laboration, and development of innovative tools and strategies. We will extend our national collaborations, leadership, and the development of metrics and standards within the Collaboration and Engagement Domain Task Force (DTF). Aim 3: Integration: To accel erate efficient integration and translation of research findings and data ana- lytics into transformative clinical practices and population health improvement. We will accomplish this by: 1) integrating translational science efforts across the research and c linical realms by providing education, resources, and integrated support for transdisciplinary teams; 2) Improving the quality, efficiency, and timely completion of clinical trials (investigator initiated, NIH/NCATS sponsored, industry -partnered); and 3) c reating a programmatic focus on the health of complex and disadvantaged populations across the lifespan using innov a- tive methods that reach broader segments of the community. Aim 4: Methods and Processes: To develop and disseminate methods and processes t hat advance translational research locally and nationally across the CTSA Consortium and beyond. We will advance the scientific study of the conduct of translational science, which includes regulatory science, outcomes me t- rics, network science, implementat ion science, social research and data science. These efforts also include development of processes that accelerate translational research, standardized patient consents and IRB pr o- cesses, rapid access to specific study populations, and participation in the CTSA Consortium . Aim 5: Informatics: To catalyze translational research speed, quality, and impact though a research friendly 'data environment', including innovative informatics, secure and integrated data management tools and support, and workforce tra ining. Data integration and dissemination is critical to accelerating translational research. We will achieve this aim by supporting research teams with core and innovative infor- matics methods and services, including data collection (EMR, data set integrat ion), secure warehousing, HIPAA compliant de- identification, informatics analysis, and data sharing across the CTSA Consortium . CORE O. OVERALL CORE - RESEARCH STRATEGY O.1 BACKGROUND The University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute ( UR-CTSI ) is located in Upstate New York, and has its academic home within the University of Rochester and the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC). The URMC provides advanced healthcare for Upstate and Western New York and is the premier translational research institution in the region. For the last decade, the UR -CTSI has built on the Uni- versity's innovative research history and strengt h in sponsored research ( Figure O1). We have advanced translational research workforce training, sustained highly successful mentoring and pilot program s in transl a- tional research, been a national leader in community engagement, developed novel methods for improving quality and effic iency in translational research, built a n a- tionally recognized program in regulatory science, and provided translational research leadership on a national level to the CTSA Consortium and NCATS. Our buil ding has been lit eral. In 2011 the University of Rochester built the Saunders Research Building, with 200,000 sq. ft. of integrated space to house the UR- CTSI and affiliated translational research programs . This physical support, along with extensive institutional support from the UR (Table O1 ) has allowed us to achieve a critical mass for synergy and collaboration, and to lead changes that ac- celerate translational research at the URMC, as well as nationally. As exemplified by our recent set of ten collabo- rative NCATS X02 grant proposals, we continue to deve l- op exceptional and nationally recognized expertise in translational research infor matics, clin ical research data integration, mobile device- driven research, research regulatory science, network science, and training in r e- search competencies . At the UR- CTSI, are committed to transdisciplinary team science, and our strong commitment is reflected in our leadership struc ture. With our current multi -PI grant, our Principal Investigators form a team with extensive and diverse translational research expertise, spanning from molecules to populations (basic science, informa t- ics, clinical trials, population science). This emphasis is injected into every aspect of our translational research, workforce development, and education programs. We have vibrant and successful TL1 and KL2 training pr o- grams, organize and administer new certificate and degree programs in Translational Science and Medical I n- formatics (see Section O.3.1, Table O 3), and have programs such as the Deaf Scholars Bridges to Science program engaged in train ing a diverse translational workforce. Importantly, we also have a very successful track record of nurturing individuals into successful and self -sustaining translational research careers, and a similar success record of helping cutting edge research teams develop into self-sustaining research centers. Examples of such success can be found in the subsequent grant sections. UR-CTSI programs are also integral driver s of the University of Rochester \"learning healthcare sy s- tem\", wor king to bring translational clinical research findings into clinical practice, and to improve the health of, and healthcare delivery to, patients and populations. The UR-CTSI actively supports and partners with URMC programs that innovate and then pilot int erventions to improve clinical out- comes. As the largest employer in the region, the only academic medical center within a 60 mile r a- dius, and the dominant healthcare provider for an urban/suburban/rural population that mirrors the nation, we are uniquely p laced within the CTSA Consortium to explore the impacts of translati onal research on the health of a population reflective of the na- tion. The UR -CTSI continues a driving force in advancing diversity at the University of Rochester Medical Center. An outstanding example is our unique and longstanding work with Deaf , GLBT, and underserved populations . We have several pioneering education programs for training deaf researchers within the workforce, including the Bridges to Science program for PhD level workfor ce training and a K12 post -doctoral training program. We are committed to the principle that a diverse workforce fosters diversity in translational research, and have Table O 1.

University of Rochester Medical Center NIH Funding and Ranking Deaf faculty, medical trainees, graduate students, laboratory technicians and research coordinators throughout the Medical Center. We have extensive minority and underserved community programs through the Center for Community Health (led by Dr. Nancy Bennet t, UR-CTSI PI) , and across the URMC. Other efforts are highlight- ed in the Diversity sect ion below. In the next 5 years, our goal is to extend this blueprint for advancing diversity across the CTSA Consortium , and to disseminate our methods to other CTSA hubs. As a measure of our commitment, we have established a UR -CTSI Director of Diversit y and Inclusion to oversee these programs. We intend for this position to serve as a model for other CTSA hubs, and for the UR -CTSI to continue to be at the vanguard of inclusion of underserved and special populations within translational research and the work- force. The UR -CTSI is deeply involved with the University of Rochester Goerg en Institute for Data Science, which contains the 5th most powerful academic supercomputing facilities in the country. Our Informatics group is at the forefront of developing new methods for data exchange within the CTSA Consortium, including data virtual- ization, integration of EHR data for research, mobile device research, network science and high performance computing use in health informatics. Our goal is to contribute new innovations in translational data science and informatics to the CTSA Consortium during the next five years. The University of Roches ter Medical Center and the UR -CTSI, has extensive experience in clinical trial conso r- tia, including participation in NeuroNext, the NIAID sponsored AIDS Clinical Trials Group, the HIV Vaccine Tr i- als Network, and an extensive array of Phase I - IV clinical trials. The UR- CTSI is extensively involved in ac- celerating translational research through participation in standard contracting and centralized IRB review within the CTSA Consortium . We have also participated in the Leadership for the recent CRO Acceler ated Clinical Trial Agreement and CRO Accelerated Confidential Disclosure Agreement (ACDA) for the CTSA Consortium , which will form the basis for clinical trial agreements across all 62 CTSA hubs. Thus, we stand ready to parti c- ipate in the CTSA clinical t rials network. We view research translation and integration as a bidirectional process, involving active conversations among our community, UR -CTSI researchers, and the CTSA Consortium . We have an engaged and diverse local Community Advisory Committee that actively participates in defining resea rch priorities for the UR -CTSI. Their suggestions are then woven into the fabric of our research pilot grants, workforce development initiatives, r e- search regulatory oversight, and ongoing research education program s. We serve as a model for bidirectional communication for the CTSA Network, including the Leadership Committee of the Collaboration/Engagement DTF (Dr. Nancy Bennett, UR -CTSI PI). Nationally, we continue to be a leader in the CTSA Consortium . Our PI s and other leaders serve in multiple national leadership and committee positions within the CTSA Consortium , as well as within multiple CTSA funded supplemental programs and pilots in Regulatory Science, workforce training standards, metrics and processes, and community engagement. 1-4 We have contributed to numerous publications with Consortium partners sharing our translational research methods and practices.5-11 UR-CTSI faculty and staff are routinely engaged to contribute their experience and expertise to initiatives launched by partner hubs. Examples include a sub- contract from Vanderbilt to support development of the now -adopted standardized contract terms, as well as co -leading/contributing to NCATS -funded projects to establish standards for institutional scientific r e- view of protocols and competency -based training for the research workforce. Other examples include the Sen- tinel Network Project and Institutional Community Engagement Self -Assessment Project. During the next five years, we will continue to participate as leaders, and as engaged followers, in the CTSA Consortium . Efforts will include developing a Trial Innovation Unit to drive efficiency locally and connect with the CTSA Consortium contributing programs in Regulatory Sci ence and Translational Network Science, devel- oping and disseminating software to increase EMR access and data integration using CTSA Consortium tools REDCap and i2b2. We are ready to engage in NCATS directed clinical trials, using the Accelerated Clinical Trial Agreement, centralized IRB and master contract mechanisms. We will continue to serve in leadership positions throughout the Domain Task Forces. The following section makes clear how our Specific Aims align with our vision and strategic goals, and how they will be realized by the UR -CTSI during the next five . O.2 VISION AND STRATEGIC GOALS The UR -CTSI is a collaborative, engaged, and innovative CTSA hub participating in the CTSA national consor- tium to efficient, high quality transl ational research.8,9 The UR -CTSI, as one of the first 12 CTSA awards, has for ten years, used our local community as a laboratory to demonstrate how research can address community health priorities and significantly contribute to improving health.10,12,13 We measure the health of the population and correlate our research activities to changes in health status.10 We will create the workforce to sustain research across the translational spectrum from molecules to populations, be responsive to community priorities at all translational stages of research ,10,14 -20 and develop and support transdisciplinary, collaborative, patient - and community -engaged teams.5,21 We believe that research, properly conducted, will contribute to improving the health of the population in our local region, and to the development of models demonstrating the importance of research to the health of the nation. 8,9 Vision: By 2020, the UR -CTSI will be a replicable model environment for research across the transl a- tional spectrum from molecules to populations, responsive to community priorities, conducted by trans- disciplinary, patient - and community -engaged teams, that improves population health Strategic Theme: Molecules to Populations. The UR- CTSI focuses on all stages of the translational spectrum and seeks to further innovative research and education for sustainable impact. Mission: The UR-CTSI develops, demonstrates and disseminates methods and approaches to advance translational research, by providing education and training, fostering transdisciplinary teams, improving quality and efficiency, and engaging community and national stakehol ders and partners. Strategic Result : Increase the impact of transdisciplinary research programs, projects and teams f o- cused on translational research: from basic science discovery to population health improvement, and from challenges in population health t o innovations in basic science. The UR -CTSI focuses on improving the health of the community and the nation by creating an institutionally integrated translational research environment that provides resources to the URMC, and to collaborating with national investigators, to perform innovative, high quality, reproducible, ethical, and efficient research. This en- vironment contributes to the development of a high- performing research community that includes investigators, staff and students prepared to contribute to the translational research challenges of the future .3 UR-CTSI i n- vestigators design and study innovative approaches to team science,5 collaboration,5,22- 27 and commun i- ty/stakeholder engagement3 in a supportive institutional environment. By focusing on population health i m- provement as the ultimate objective of our work, we address disparities in health status and research participa- tion, seek to develop models for the inclusion of special populati ons and target our work across the lifespan .28,29 We develop tools to overcome barriers to the performance and implementation of innovative and efficient translational research.6,7,30,31 Particular strengths of the UR science,1,25,42,43 research- technologies ,34,35,44 data science and statistical methods ,3,31,45 -73 clinical trials ,35,49,60,62,73- 90 and biomedical informatics .91-99 Our Strategic Goals (addressing each Aim) are to: 1. To train the next generation of translational science workforce leaders. We will expand our innovative approaches to educate and diversify the next generation of translational science workforce leaders. New approaches are targeted to ensure competence in t he collaborative, technical, and regulatory skills neces- sary to accelerate the translation of high -impact research to clinical and community applications that i m- prove population health. We will d evelop, demonstrate and disseminate novel educational materials and methods, focusing on priority areas such as community engagement, team science, informatics, data sc i- ence, enabling technologies, regulatory science, personal genomics, and population science. ( Aim 1 ) 2. To demonstrate the value of the engagement and participation of multiple stakeholder communi- ties. We will broaden and deepen programs to ensure that research across the translational spectrum ad- dresses the needs of patients, underrepresented populations, special populations, including those with di s- abilities, and all ages, and eliminate disparities in research participation. We will study the impact of com- munity engagement on the quality of research. ( Aim 2 ) 3. To establish translational research collaboration and engagement among researchers. Specific a c- tions will include enhancing the research environment to support transdisciplinary team science, strengt h- ening institutional support, recognition and rewards for team science, and ensuring team science training. (Aim 2 ) 4. To accelerate efficient integration and translation of research findings and data analytics into trans- formative clinical practices and implementation science. Over the next 5 years we will extend and strengthen the integration of research into the daily operations and strategic planning of the health system, and align the UR -CTSI, community and institutional research priorities. Specific targets for this proposal i n- clude: expansion of informatics data integration development work with novel software tools to permit rapid data collection, and integration and analysis from the UR health system and other EMRs. ( Aim 3 ) 5. To establish expertise and capacity to implement and manage multi -site research studies through the CTSA Consortium . We will strengthen our existing capacity and focus specifically on contributing to continuous improvement of the research enterprise to prepare our hub and the CTSA Consortium to su c- cessfully operate multi -site clinical trials. This will require establishment of a local Trial Innovation Unit and the real time use of evidence, including the NCATS -standardized CTSA common metrics, to continuously improve quality and efficiency. We will employ our existing strengths, such as global multi -site study man- agement, development and deployment of novel research- enabling technologies, and development of standardized contracting arrangements, to implement and manage multi -site research studies. (Aim 4) 6. To establish and sustain a robust informatics infrastructure. We will leverage, expand and boost the sustainability of our critical, r esearch friendly infrastructure to support translational researchers, enhance data security, share innovative informatics, and improve data sharing, integration and access to strengthen precision medicine, population health, and biomedical data science. (A im 5) We will address these goals, measuring and continuously adjusting our approaches, to ensure the highest quality and efficiency of research and education at our institution and in the CTSA Consortium . O.3 TRACK RECORD IN TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH The University of Rochester has a long and extensive track record of excellence in clinical and translational research. In the twelve months ending June, 2015, 1,200 externally sponsored research projec ts were active at the medical center, with total awards of $216 million. A number of noteworthy contributions are listed below. O.3.1 Workforce Development : The UR -CTSI is committed to translational science workforce development with highly productive programs in pre- and post -doctoral training, support for faculty career development, flex- ible and innovative didactic training, pioneering programs for research staff development, and commitment to diversity. Training and Career Development Programs. The UR-CTSI TL1 has supported over 90 trainees in the transl a- tional research w orkforce (Table O2). The program is highly integrated with the twenty T32 research training pr o- grams at the UR, encompassing 80 pre- and 45 post -doctoral positions. The UR-KL2 program compl ements 34 individual K awards in place at URMC over the last 5 years, 20 feder- ally funded institutional training programs supporting 82 pre- and 48 post -doctoral trainees, and 16 fellowship awards. The UR-CTSI has a substantial impact on training and career development with many KL2 awardees going on to individual K awards. Going forward we will extend the UR- TL1 program to build on our unique strengths in informatics, regulatory science, and basic science programs, aligning with our theme of molecules -to-populations. We will continue KL2 development with 3 new themes: Enabling Technologies, Regulatory Science, and Electronic Health Record Research, aligned with the Optional Core Functions in Regulatory Science in Precision Medicine and Translational Network Science. Innovative Didactic Training: To meet the need for programs responsive to current translational research trends and workforce demands, the UR- CTSI launched 5 advanced translational research certificate programs this year . In addition, the UR- CTSI informat ics program and the UR 's Goergen Institute for Data Science now offer a joint graduate certificate for advanced study in Biomedical Data Science. Drs. Joan Adamo and Scott Steele from the UR- CTSI d e- veloped two new courses to teach core compe-tencies in Regulatory Science, in collaboration with other CTSA institutions. During the next funding period, we will develop curricula in the Regulatory Science of Precision Medicine (O p- tional Function H2), which will address the unique challenges precision medicine, and in Transl a- tional Network Science (Optional Function H1), specifically designed for translational research. Research Coordinator Professional Development: Over the last five years, the UR -CTSI directly advanced research coordinator workforce training. In collaboration with the Office of Human Subject Protection, we provide continuing education of research coordinators and staff, ranging from basic orientati on to human subject research, to a more advanced \"research boot camp\" of 9 topical core modules, and a monthly seminar Table O2.

The UR-CTSI houses the Study Coordinators Organization for Research and Education (SCORE) group, offering monthly speakers on translational science, an annual half -day symposium, and a matching resource for researchers to help find full or part -time study coordinators. We worked closely with the University's human resources department to institute a set of research coordinator job descriptions, to standardize qualifications and build a career path. This program has had a large impact at URMC, allowing for standardized research competencies in hiring, and allowing translational researchers to connect with study coordinators for grants and projects. We will extend these offerings by integrating research coordinator competencies and national standards developed by the CTSA Consortium . Research Degree and Workforce Training for Underrepresented groups: The UR -CTSI, through its component the CDC- funded Rochester Prevention Research Center, National Center for Deaf Health Research (housed in the same building as the rest of the UR-CTSI) has built one of the best and most extensive training programs in the world for deaf students in the bio medical sciences. The NIH -funded Rochester Bridges to the Doctorate program, a collaboration between the UR and the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), prepares deaf students in the master's degree program at RIT to be competitive for doctoral training in biomedical sciences. The NIH K12- funded Rochester Partnership for Research and Academic Career Training of Deaf Scholars, also a UR/RIT collaboration, supports career development of deaf scholars to become independent biomedical and behavioral scienti sts. Building on our 10 year experience in educating and recruiting deaf scholars, we will extend this model in the next 5 years to training and supporting other underrepresented groups in translational science. O.3.2 Collaboration/Engagement: The UR-CTSI is a national leader in research collaboration and engag e- ment. Community Engagement: URMC is one of the few academic Medical Centers in the country with Community Service as one its 4 core missions (along with Education, Patient Care and Research), and where our comm u- nity actively helps to set the institutional res earch agenda and priorities. K ey to this effort is the Center for Community Health (CCH) , founded by Dr. Nancy Bennett (co -PI of the UR -CTSI) in 2006 to address health inequalities in our community and improve health through research, education, and service. The CCH provides a large infrastructure (75 faculty and staff) for community engaged research and service, and oversees the Community Advisory Council (CAC), drawing on diverse communit y leaders from across the region to advise the URMC and UR -CTSI. Significantly, two CAC members are active members of the UR -CTSI's Strategic Leadership Group and UR -CTSI leaders attend quarterly CAC meetings . This has provided a unique mecha- nism by which the community contributes to determining priorities for UR -CTSI education, research and fund- ing programs. Based on this model, we propose to extend our community engagement work to include more consistent community involvement in research across the transl ational spectrum, expanded community input, funding of joint CTSI / community -initiated research pilots, and development of new \"feed- back\" mechanisms to inform the community of research results and methods. Greater Rochester Practice Based Research Networ k (PBRN) : In collaboration with the CCH, we created a research network of primary care practices that treats 80% of children and 45% of the adults in the region. Over the last 10 years, the GR -PBRN accelerated community based research by pairing over 100 investigators with network practices on 176 research studies resulting in 50- 60 active projects in the PBRN at any time, and leading to numerous publications .14,24,28,41,59,100 -113 In addition to creating a platform for research recruitment, the GR-PBRN clinicians advise researchers about critical clinical research questions that can rapidly advance quality of care. In this last 5 year period, collaboration between PBRN community clinicians and researchers at the Rochester Aging Study yielded the first accurate blood test to predict who is at risk for Alzheimer's disease.114 In addition, a UR-KL2 study of 400 seniors comparing peer companionship with care- as-usual examined risk for suicidal behavior in late life showing improved out comes with peer companionship.19,115 We propose to advance PBRN capacity and efficiency during the next 5 years by integrating our EMR -based research tools into practice- based research studies, and enhancing clinical input into research priorities . Team Science and Collaboration: The UR -CTSI is a primary driver of team science and collaboration, helping researchers across the URMC to build successful transdisciplinary research programs. We have seeded new collaborations through the UR -CTSI pilot and incubator programs, the TL1 and KL2 programs, and our Informatics group. For example, CTSI support at multiple levels was key in the integration of multiple projects spanning basic s cience to clinical trials in the Center for Musculoskeletal Research (CMSR). The research program in rheumatoid arthritis spans molecular research in a murine model to experimental therapeutics in humans, involving TL1 trainee Kofi Mensah who discovered t he role of interferon in non -erosive inflammatory arthritis; KL2 scholar, Wakenda Tyler recognized early arthritic flare in a patient referred to her oncology clinic, and subsequently facilitated enrollment of the patient in UR -CTSI Incubator awardee Chris Ritchlin's clinical trial of certolizumab in rheumatoid arthritis. This research program, and the CMSR itself, is led by Dr. Edward Schwarz, Pilot Translational, and Clinical Studies co- leader. During the proposed grant period, we will build on this succe ss by developing programs within the TL1 and KL2 programs to foster team science, especially collaborative translation research by teams of basic and clinical scientists. UR-CTSI supported trainees, faculty and mentors form highly successful multidisciplinary teams: One objec- tive measure of UR -CTSI success in foster ing collaboration within the UR is the large number of publications by authors with prior support from the UR -CTSI TL1, KL2, BERD, Pilot Project, and Incubator Award projects (see Figure O2). In the next period, the UR-CTSI will collaborate with the Roches ter Center for Health Infor- matics to use advanced graph theory and network science to study the formation of translational research teams across the spectrum of training, publication, funding, and self -organizing collaboration. UR-CTSI fosters regional col laboration: The UR-CTSI established a network of biomedical research instit u- tions in Upstate New York upon its inception in 2006. The Upstate New York Translational Research Network (UNYTE), a consortium of 18 Biomedical Research Institutions from across New York State, convened by the UR-CTSI, whose mission is to assist faculty and trainees from member institutions to increase the quality and quantity of translational research. Leadership from the GR -PBRN and two other regional PBRNs -- SALT -NET (SUNY Ups tate Medical University), UNYNET (State University of New York at Buffalo), meet on a monthly basis to link researchers from each institution with primary care patient populations across the region. UNYTE and PBRN partners have received funding from NY State, the CDC, and NIH for multiple projects involving cancer screening, researcher mentoring (UR Vice- Provost for faculty diversity Vivian Lewis, MD), hypertension control, and other translational topics. 116 UR leads collaboration efforts in the CTSA Consortium : Faculty and staff connected with the UR- CTSI have long played important leadership roles in CTSA Consortium committees and groups, such as key function committees, strategic goal committees and others. In the current NCATS -led network structure, Dr. Kieburtz has been a member of the CTSA Steering Committee, Dr. Bennett is a member of the Lead Team of the Col-laboration/Engagement Domain Task Force (and was previously co- chair of the national Community Engag e- ment Key Function Committee), and Drs. Kieburtz and Zand are members of one of the four Common Metrics working groups. O.3.3 Integration: The UR -CTSI has an extensive track record of integrating translational science across mul- tiple phases and disciplines, within complex populations, and across the individual lifespan. Integrated UR-CTSI supported research: The UR -CTSI supported rheumatoid arthritis program in the previous section highlights UR -CTSI support for trainees and pilot awardees in multiple disciplines that helped advance this research program across discovery in a murine model to clinical trials. UR -CTSI TL1 trainee Josef Bartels assembled a resear ch team under the guidance of mentor Ron Epstein, MD, that included UR Eastman School of Music Professor Katherine Ciesinski, to conduct a grounded qualitative analysis of silences during phys i- cian-patient communication. The team focused on pitch, volume, intensity and rhythm, finding tantalizing ev i- dence that \"conversational mirroring\" may lead to an objective measure of communication quality. The UR- CTSI Incubator program funds multidisciplinary, multi -pronged research programs that promise to deliver a quantum advance in therapies, diagnostic techniques or public health programs. Three such projects have i n- vestigated MLK -3 inhibitors in cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's ;117 development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cigarette smoke- induced oxidative stress, inflammation and lung injury ;118-125 and novel technology to sustain extensively self -renewing erythroblasts as an ex -vivo source o f human blood.126,127 These programs have been highly successful, leading to a furt her $21 million in extramural funding in Figure O2. UR-CTSI supported investigators connected by publications - Investigators building connections through UR-CTSI spo n- sored publications over 10 years, demonstra t- ing the impact of the UR -CTSI within the Un i- versity of Rochester. Each node is an investig a- tor's publication(s) for that year citing the UR - CTSI grant, and each edge represents a co n- nection between investigators by publication. The plots are annual, not cumulative, allowing visualization of the growth in publications. Note the slight decline in gra ph density, which corr e- lates with to the decrease in overall NIH funding for extramural research since 2012. the last 5 years. During the next 5 years, the UR -CTSI will extend our successful model to bring all institution- al incubator and pilot programs under consolidated administration, including solicitation, scientific r eview, and tracking metrics of success. Integrating Special Populations in Research. The UR and UR -CTSI have built an extensive track record of partnership with numerous complex and special populations across the lifespan. URMC is home to the CDC - sponsored Rochester Prevention Research Center: National Center for Deaf Health Research . Now in its 11th year, the NCDHR is a community -based participatory research partnership with deaf and hard -of-hearing populations that includes deaf researchers and staff .128,129 The UR-CTSI and NCDHR share administrative staff (Jensen, Lyons, Libby, Fogg), a CTSA supplement funds research on informed consent processes with deaf sign language users, and a UR- TL1 trainee gained practical research experience with the NCDHR. UR- CTSI Diversity Director Dr. John Cullen is extensively involved with the justice- involved population studies reduc- ing morbidity and mortality related to intimate partner violence.130 UR-CTSI pediatric pilot funding and KL2 training has helped build a productive partnership for research on issues in families with children with autism spectrum disorders .131-133 A UR-CTSI funded pilot led by Dan Mruzek, PhD developed a wireless moisture alarm for urinary continence training for individuals with autism. Career development scholar Suzannah Iadar o- la, PhD, is developing evidence- based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families.134 Former UR-KL2 scholar Supriya Mohile, MD now leads a PCORI -supported research program to investigate improving care for elderly cancer patients.135,136 Cindi Lewis, PhD, worked with the UR Center for AIDS Research and the Department of Public Health Sciences to establish a partners hip with leaders of LGBT communities for increasing HIV prevention knowledge, and participation in HIV vaccine trials.117 O.3.4 Methods/Processes: The UR -CTSI is in the vanguard of institutions that are creating more efficient and expeditious approaches the conduct of clinical and translational research. W e have extensive experience in accelerating clinical trials. For example UR is a NeuroNEXT collaborating center, led by PI Robert Holloway, MD MPH, who also serves as KL2 Director. Dr. Holloway is Co -Chair of the NeuroNEXT Conflict of Interest Committee, and serves on its Executive Committee. The UR collaborating center is participating in 3 out of 4 currently active NeuroNEXT protocols. The UR has agreed to Central IRB review and master contracts, as it will for the CTSA Consortium . Network IRB approvals have taken an average of 24 days (vs institutional aver- age of 72) and contracts an average of 63 days (vs 102), adding to trial efficiency. The UR has internationally recognized expertise in managing global multi -site clinical trials . The Center for Human E xperimental Therapeutics (CHET) specializes in neurology clinical trials, and includes a Clinical Mat e- rials Services Unit (CMSU) which provides GMP -compliant investigational drug/device packaging, labeling, di s- tribution, and return services for multi -cente r, multi -year clinical trials. Through CHET, the UR recently became a member of the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education (NIPTE), an academic r e- search collaboration advancing the quality, safety, affordability and speed to market for new medicines. Dr. Ray Dorsey, Director of CHET (a former KL2 scholar) will serve on our Trials Innovation Unit. The Heart R e- search Follow -Up Group specializes in managing national and international multi -site cardiology clinical trials. The Cancer Control Program serves as the National Hub for the NCI Community Oncology Research Program, coordinating sites across the country. Scientific Review of Proposed R e- search. The UR-CTSI simplified and accelerated scientific review of prot o- cols prior to IRB submission by impl e- menting rigorous, department -based review, that includes a standard review template and provision of standard i n- formation to the IRB along with the proposed protocol. During the next 5 years we will study the effectiveness of this process (e.g. return on funding for pilots, time to evaluation, investigator satisfaction, and extend this suc- cessful model to standardized review of pilot and incubator awards across the UR medical center. Real-time Remote Research Participation and Data Collection. The UR-CTSI has several cutting -edge pr o- grams integrating mobile technologies into research consent and data collection. Translational Biomedical Sc i- ence PhD student Solomon Abiola developed the Node app (android based) to track the spread of Ebola in real time and provide people who may be infected with treatment center and prevent ion information. The app is currently deployed in West Africa, through an NSF- funded study involving UR-CTSI faculty Dr. Henry Kautz, PhD, Dr. Ray Dorsey and Mr. Abiola. Other remote and mobile sensing projects include the mPower app (based on Apple's Rese archKit technology, developed by Dr. Dorsey's group) to study of the symptoms of Table O5. Research Projects Involving Mobile Technology and Participating UR-CTSI Faculty Project UR-CTSI Faculty Tracking and prevention of Ebola with mobile technology Dorsey, Kautz mPower Parkinson's disease study Dorsey Virtual research visits Dorsey Detecting depression i n the African American men with HIV by mobile technology voice analysis Silenzio nEmesis: Twitter GIS identification of food -borne illness Kautz Parkinson's disease. The app allows informed consent and participation without travel to a study site, with col- lection of rich and dense data through the internet. Dr. Dorsey is also PI of a PCORI - funded study of virtual research visits (akin to Skype) in the management of advanced Parkinson patients as compared to routine care. In the proposed award period, we will initiate a new KL2 program in Enabling Technologies to build on this type of cutting edge research. O.3.5 Informatics: The UR- CTSI's Informatics Team, led by Tim Dye, PhD, is at the heart of Informatics - related and supported research at the UR. i2b2/REDCap Integration. The UR-CTSI's Informatics Team developed a n ovel tool to integrate data from i2b2 into REDCap through an intuitive and powerful graphical user interface that requires no formal training in query languages. The tool features the ability to aggregate multiple instances of similar data into a single value (for example, averaging a set of values, or choosing a value with a time stamp closest to a desired time). R e- searchers have already used the tool to accelerate clinical data acquisition for over 30 studies, and have trans- ferred over 1.8 million individual data items, saving thousands of hours of analyst time and reducing data tran- scription errors. During the proposed research period, the UR Informatics Team will work with CTSAs at Ha r- vard, Vanderbilt and other institutions to disseminate the tool and develop it further, and develop other such tools to facilitate clinical data acquisition. Securely Linking Sensitive Data Across Institutions. The UR -CTSI Informatics Team pioneered the develop- ment of an industry -standard \"cryptographic hash function\" key to facilitate linking of patient data across instit u- tions without sharing the underlying protected health information (PHI). The key is non- invertible, meaning that the encryption process cannot be reversed by taking the key and re -calculating the original PHI. This method is already having impact, allowing institutions to link de- identified EMR data for research across multiple data systems through honest broker systems, and accelerating research efficiency and interoperability. During the next 5 years, we will collaborate with the CTSA Consortium to make this technology widely available. Innovative Data Collection Methods. The UR-CTSI Informatics Team has pioneered the use of Amazon M e- chanical Turk (mTurk) to conduct survey research across the globe rapidly (thousands of surveys can be co m- pleted overnight) and at low cost (for a brief survey, for $0.25 to $1 per survey). This method is now being rap-idly adopted by many translational researchers at URMC for survey work, especially for reaching diverse popu- lations. The UR -CTSI will expand this service for translational researchers during the next funding period. Methodologic Advances. Dongmei Li, PhD, Associate Professor of Clinical and Translational Science in the UR-CTSI, led a study of statistical methods c ommonly used to analyze microarray data in DNA methylation studies in order to develop evidence regarding choice of method based on the sample size. The study com- pared six techniques and presented advantages and disadvantages of each.160 This me thods study has al- ready had a wide impact in the genomics community, garnering over 1,200 views in the first week following publication. It is the first cross -comparison of these widely used methods published. Conceptual Advances. Dr. Tim Dye, Director of Biomedical Informatics for the UR-CTSI, has pioneered the new field of Data Diplomacy, which explores the social, political and ethical dimensions of data sharing across institutions, locally and globally. The World University Network, of which the UR is a member, will sponsor a symposium on this topic in New York City in October 2015, led by Dr. Dye. O.4 INTEGRATION OF HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH Background: The UR -CTSI is the hub of a regional learning healthcare system centered at the URMC, re- ferred to as UR Medicine. We have an active, productive, and ongoing role in coordinating the translational r e- search enterprise with h ealth care delivery across UR Medicine to ensure synergy, early engagement of clini- cians in translational research, implementation of findings, and health systems delivery research. Our efforts Figure O3. Integration of Tran s- lational research and healthcare delivery . The spe c- trum of translational path from foundational research to oper a- tional standard of care. The co n- cept of \" stall\", originally devel- oped to describe areas of the translational process that are significant barriers to translational research endeavors. How the UR-CTSI addresses these issue s is described below are specifically directed at addressing and overcoming the \"st all\", obstacles to research engagement and di s- semination w ithin the process (Figure O3) The URMC delivers medical care to a catchment area of 1,274,936 people across Upstate and Western New York. The core clinical enterprise includes the University of Roche s- ter Medical Center, with Strong Memorial Hospital and Highland Hospital (1,090 beds), over 200 primary care and subspecial ty offi c- es within a 115- mile radius, over 1,500 primary and specialty care attending physicians, over 700 advance practice providers, 750 medical residents and fellows, and almost 2 million outpatient visits, admissions, and ambulatory procedures annually. The data from all of these interactions are available for research on the URMC eRecord electronic health record system . In addition, UR Medicine also includes several regional hospitals (F.F. Thompson Hospi tal, Strong West), and numerous satellite subspec ialty clinics. Our e f- forts also extend beyond the URMC, with ongoing and active r e- gional collaborations through the Center for Community Heath, Greater Rochester Practice -Based Research Network (PBRN), U p- state New York Translational Research Network (UNYTE ), Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency (FLSHA), and Rochester Health I n- formation Organization (RHIO). Integration of Translational Research and Healthcare Delivery : Several examples from numerous UR-CTSI projects illuminating our success in these areas i n- clude: (1) A UR -CTSI Informatics pilot, led by Tim Dye and funded by Pfizer, which is designed to use the EHR to acquire patient information to enable collabor a- tive healthcare decisions for patients with menopausal symptoms and their providers; and (2) The use of pa- tient reported data with the PROMIS system in the or-thopedi cs group which predicts patient recovery from orthopedic surgery as well as clinical measurements . 161,162 Research Awareness and Recruitment - The UR -CTSI directly maintains a wide variety of innovative and cutting- edge efforts to enhance research awareness and recruitment for patients. Through distribution of promotional literature and a dedicated Clinical Research pa- tient web site, patients receiving care at URMC are made aware of ongoing research, and invited to participate in research opportunities. The UR -CTSI established the URMC Volunteer Registry for clinical research, a web- based site where patients can register and consent to be contacted for clinical research studies for which they might qualify. The site also has an option for healthy volunteers to register to participate in studies. Researc h- ers can access research volunteer lists via the UR -CTSI. More than 420 participants have registered in the l o- cal registry; 1237 participants have registered in ResearchMatch.org; 342 studies have used the website; and 120 investigators have used the registries to identify potential research volunteers. Associated with the site is a Research Registry hotline, where patients can call and speak with a Research Specialist regarding research opportunities at the URMC or be connected to the UR- CTSI Recruitment Unit for assistance with questions r e- garding research consent, monitoring, and participation. Translation of Research Findings into Healthcare Policy : Adoption of research findings by clinicians, instit u- tions, agencies and policy makers is essential to achieve the ultimate impact of research on population health. The UR -CTSI has significant local experience that will be leveraged to increase the scope and pace of transl a- tion of research findings into policies and practice. 9,13,163,164 Some examples include: 1) the Surgical Health and Outcomes Research Enterprise (SHORE), led by Dr. Katia Noyes, a surgical quality impr ovement and healthcare policy initiative, 2 ) the Community Transformation Grant (funded by CDC) that broadened i m- plementation of evidence based initiatives such as the Diabetes Prevention Programs to underserved/minority populations, which addressed policy related to the prevention of chronic disease, 41 3) an NIH funded Com- munity Based Participatory Research grant to increase adoption of evidence- based breastfeeding practices across hospitals, prenatal/pediatric practices and WIC peer counselor programs ,165,166 4) New York State funded initiatives to train and support provider practices in the adoption of evidence- based smoking cessation,20,167,168 5) implementation of protoc ols to reduce scheduled late preterm deliveries, 6 ) Adoption of discharge protocols to shorten length of stay and reduce readmissions169 and 7) Implementation of evidence- based infection control approaches based on studies in the Rochester Emerging Infections Pr o-Table O6 .

The Center f or Research implementation and Transl a- tion (CRIT), housed in the School of Nursing, serves as a central hub for the development of research impl e- mentation science. At CRIT, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians undertake bio- behavior -environment sy s- tems research, and develop approaches that direct the efficient and successful incorporation of promising treatments into real world practice. CRIT scientists conduct rigorous qualitative, observational, survey and mixed method studies; in addition to knowl edge generation, these studies inform experimental hypothesis - driven studies in which interventions are tailored, tested and systematically incorporated into clinical practice at URMC. O.5 WORKFORCE DIVERSITY Background A diverse research workforce furthers the translational research mission and empowers organi- zations to ask and answer the broadest, most innovative research questions. Without diverse perspectives, we cannot begin to adequately answer the multitude of questions that span the spectrum from molecules to popu-lations. The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) embraces a commitment to a diverse and incl u- sive environment that guides and transforms our approaches to research, healthcare, education, and comm u- nity partnerships. It is a core value reflected in the URMC strategic plan, and the UR- CTSI plays a central role in the URMC goal of strengthening workforce diversity, particularly in the area of translational research. Implementing Diversity Recruitment and Retention in the Translational Workforce: For over a decade there has been a strong emphasis on recruitment and retention of a diverse faculty across the UR . The UR- CTSI works closely with the School of Medicine and Dentistry, School of Nursing, and the University to assist in r e- cruiting faculty f rom diverse backgrounds. There are many potential barriers to engaging people from under - represented groups in science and medicine to pursue a research career. These barriers may be related to finances or education, to limitations in mentorship or exposur e to research careers, or to ongoing experience of implicit biases and microaggres- sion. 170 The UR-CTSI recognizes that developing a diverse scientific workforce requires engagement from students as early as elemen-tary school through coll ege, grad- uate, and faculty recruitment and retention. UR-CTSI Director of Diversity and Inclusion: To assure and organize a coordinated and targeted approach to development of a diverse scientific workforce, we have appointed Dr. John Cullen as the Direc tor of Diversity and Inclusion to serve as the champion for research diversity and inclusion efforts. Dr. Cullen currently works closely with Dr. Linda Chaudron, the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean for Inclusion and Culture Development. 171 Dr. Cullen is responsible for: 1) coordinating communication involving diver sity and inclusion efforts and supporting recruitment and retention of diverse students, faculty, and staff; 2) overseeing development of educational curricula related to scientific issues of diversity; 3) overseeing development of web-based resources focused on diversity in research, local and national training programs, and funding opportunities; 4) working with the UR Office for Faculty Development and Diversity on the university's annual research diversity conference with a focus on highlighting UR-CTSI resources, research, and outreach to students and trainees from diverse backgrounds; and 5) expanding UR- CTSI processes for tracking program graduates including improved engagement with and tracking of graduates of URMC pipeline programs for underrepresented students. During the proposed funding period, Dr. Cullen will also work with the URMC Office for Inclusion and Culture Development to conduct a culture and climate survey of medical center faculty, staff, and students, specifically focusing on those engaged in translational research. This will provide critical insight into the needs and perspectives of the translational workforce. Based on these data, Dr. Cullen will develop and implement targeted workforce diversity interventions, and also conduct a f ollow -up survey in 2- 3 years to assess change. The UR-CTSI will support the Director of Diversity and Inclusion as a sustainable long- term position focused on the translational research enterprise, and will support direct links between this position and central URMC and University -wide efforts related to diversity and inclusion. Diversity Programs and Priorities at the UR : The UR School of Medicine and Dentistry (URSMD) has a long history of programs that target underrepresented minorities and their unique needs. For high school and undergraduate students, the URSMD offers 6 long- standing (since 1982) and successful programs targeting underrepresented minority students (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, Science and Technology Table O7. Faculty diversity with in the UR -CTSI and University of Rochester Med i- cal Center , compared with AAMC faculty and New York State population (%) UR- CTSI URMC UR- All Faculty AAMC Medical Schools NY State (2010) Male 62.8 % 58.4 % 66 % 61.9 % 48.5 % Female 37.2 % 41.6 % 34 % 38.1 % 51.5 % White 77.2 % 78.3 % 81 % 65.2 % 58.3 % Asian 18.1 % 17.7 % 14 % 14.0 % 7.3 % Black (non -Hispanic origin) 2.9 % 2.1 % 2 % 2.9 % 14.4 % Hispanic 1.9 % 1.7 % 2 % 3.3 % 17.6 % American Indian/Alaskan Native 0.4 % 0.0 % 1 % 0.1 % 0.3 % Pacific Islander 0.0 % 0.0 % 0 % 0.3 % 0.0 % Not provided /Other 0.1 % 0.1 % 0 % 12.7 % 2.1 % Entry Program, Pathology Information Technology Training Program, The Perry Initiative, Early Assurance Program, and the AMS Post -baccalaureate Program). As a result of this commitment to diversity and efforts to recruit and engage students from diverse backgrounds, the URSMD has a diverse medical student body. The current URSMD medical student population is over 15% Black or Hispanic and more than half are (52%) women. The PhD student population at UR is 7.1% Black or Hispanic and 58% women. The success of our pipeline programs in attracting underrepresented minority students into translational research careers has not been well established. During the proposed funding period, we will share infrastructure that is used for follow - up of participants in the KL2 and TL1 programs with these pipeline programs to improve the capacity to track and engage with program graduates. Use of these UR- CTSI resources will enhance the URSMD's ability to discern both program successes and areas for improvement in overcoming barriers to engaging students from diverse backgrounds to train in research careers . Fostering diversity in translational research: The UR-CTSI recognizes the unique views that people with disabilities and diverse backgrounds contribute to translational research, as well as barri ers to recruitment and retention (e.g. bias, lack of mentorship, lack of natural networks). We collaborate with the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) to increase the number of deaf and hard -of-hearing people entering the translational workfo rce and are a leader in supporting the career advancement of deaf and hard- of-hearing individuals research or healthcare. Our programs with the deaf and hard -of hearing populations serve as robust models for our efforts going forward. In the next 5 years, led by Dr. Cullen (Director of Diversity and Inclusion), we will develop programs to support the unique needs of other underrepresented populations in order to increase recruitment of diverse translational workforce members. These efforts will also include mentoring a diverse workforce through the Mentor Development Working Group (established in 2007) within the TL1 and KL2 programs, which was extended in 2013 to the URMC faculty as a whole, and which includes those who mentor high school and undergraduate students in pipeline programs mentioned above. In addition, groups for women scientists and for junior faculty in the biomedical sciences have been developed. The UR- CTSI will continue to expand these efforts over the next 5 years, targeting underrepresented minority trainees and faculty for participation. We anticipate that these efforts towards development of a supportive environment in which faculty receive mentorship and guidance, will be highly valued and promote retention of a diverse workforce. Translational research study coordinators are key to enrolling a diverse group of study subjects. In addition to trainee and faculty diversity, we recognize that diversity at the study coordinator level creates an environment that enhances a sense of trust, understanding, and research relevance during study recruitment and retention of a diverse study population. For example, the UR -CTSI has been substantially involved in the Center for Deaf Health Research, Center for Community Health, and the Victory Allianc e for HIV studies, which have study personnel from Deaf, Latino and African American, and LGBT communities respectively. In addition, the UR-CTSI has taken the lead in identifying investigators who engage in human subjects research to develop targeted educ ation and career development, which will include curricula attending to issues of diversity. UR-CTSI diversity goals for the next 5 years. During this award, we aim: 1) to develop a central infrastructure through the Director of Diversity and Inclusion that enables consideration of issues of diversity in all UR-CTSI activities and includes broad i mpact across the University, 2) to assess the needs of the existing workforce with respect to environment and support, 3) to improve the recruitment and r etention of diverse faculty, 4 ) to increase the number of trainees of underrepresented and diverse backgrounds in the KL2 and TL1 programs, and 5) to improve the education of the scientific workforce regarding issues of diversity. These efforts will be led by Dr. J ohn Cullen, the newly appointed Director of Diversity and Inclusion, who will coordinate across the UR -CTSI Cores, including the KL2 and TL1 programs, and work with the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean for Inclusion and Culture Development, Dr. Linda Chaudron (member, UR-CTSI Strategic Leadership Group), to assure integration across the School of Medicine and Dentistry and the School of Nursing. We anticipate that these targeted efforts will foster a culture of inclusion within a diverse scientific workforce, will result in study recruitment that more accurately reflects community demographics with respect to age, gender, ethnicity, and other factors, and will expand research topics to more broadly represent issues that impact the entire population. Metrics of success. During the next 5 years, we will continue to track metrics of diversity across our programs. Such metrics will include: 1) climate and culture survey results, 2) benchmarks of diversity of UR- CTSI -involved faculty compared to national data, 3) numbers of research studies led by faculty from under - represented groups, and 4) numbers of research studies conducted with primarily underrepresented or diverse subjects. Metrics will be collected by the Administrative Core, and analyses will be led by Dr. Ann Dozier O.6 SUMMARY The UR-CTSI has a long history of research and educational accomplishments, and as one of the originally awarded CTSA hubs has been efficient and highly productive. We have capitalized on the opportunities pr e- sented by being the only academic medical center in a 60 mile radius, the largest regional employer (8th in NY State), and dominant healthcare provider, to focus on how a research agenda shaped by community input can improve the health of the region. Given the relatively small number of healthcare providers, we have been able to establish principles for access to local health care data (just one facet of health), which we can link with es- tablished indices of health from the region, as well as to the practice patterns of physician referral and utiliz a- tion. We can target research activities to the areas of grea test local and national need. Established programs in suicide prevention, obesity prevention, emerging infection control, immunization, and HIV disease are exam-ples of successful efforts impacting the community. We have also committed to including all of our commun i- ties in our research and educational efforts, seeking diversity and inclusion. The strong collaboration with the locally prevalent Deaf community is an example we intend to extend to other communities (autism spectrum, developmentally delayed, ot hers), taking advantage of emerging technologies to reach a population spread from an urban center to a broad rural surround. We have brought together the translational research infrastruc- ture and programs under a single roof, but maintain open collaborati ons with every element of the University. The space also serves as common ground for regional community meetings and collaborations. All that said, we see a new set of challenges for the next 5 years as outlined in the Cores that follow. Innovations we int end to build over the next 5 years include a Director of Diversity and Inclusion for the UR- CTSI, a Trial Innovation Unit to drive efficiency locally and connect with the CTSA Consortium , a CTSA -wide competency based curri c- ulum for Regulatory Science, and new research technologies to reach anyone, anywhere, no matter what their disability, income, race, ethnicity or gender.

ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - SPECIFIC AIMS The primary goal of the Administrative C ore (AC) is to provide overall leadership for the UR-CTSI. Our organi- zational and governance structure supports participatory communication among the Cores and translational research spanning the institutional, community, and national levels. A cornerstone of our AC is our multiple PI leadership structure. This is intentional \u2014in our UR -CTSI lea dership structure, we lead by example. As trans- lational research requires a team of domain experts capable of true transdisciplinary leadership, so does the leadership of the UR- CTSI. Our Leadership T eam of three UL1 PIs possess complementary expertise in popu- lation health science and community engagement (Bennett), translational clinical trials and regulatory science (Kieburtz) , quantitative basic science and health informatics research (Zand) . Strong collaboration requires good governance, continuous evaluation processes and collection of metrics. AC support includes integrated administrative resources and governance for the UL1, TL1, and KL2 programs. Integration with institutional priorities is facilitated by extensive PI involvement in UR governanc e at the highest levels . Integration with n a- tional CTSA Consortium strategic priorities is provided by robus t participation in the CTSA Consortium leader- ship and task force initiatives. Our Specific Aims for the Administrative Core include: Aim 1: To provide administrative oversight of the UR- CTSI organization, via governance, collaboration and communication. Under the direction of the AC director, we will achieve these aims by: a. Providing administrative organization and support for the UR- CTSI, including integration across the UL1, TL1 and KL2 programs . A single governance structure will administer all programs and integrate with relevant university leadership. b. Providing institutional and multi -PI governance structure for the UR-CTSI . This includes comprehen- sive leadership across the UR- CTSI, with PIs that have complementary domain expertise, facilitating seamless and highly effective integration of administrative responsibilities across all Cores, as well as conflict resolution and leadership succession plans. c. Actively championing and suppor ting collaboration and communication between UR- CTSI stakeholders, internal and external collaborators, and workforce trainees. (i) through decision making that integrat es stakeholder input from a diverse range of internal and external partners and interactive team leadership across the UR- CTSI ; (ii) by managing competing institutional perspectives and resources to actively connect trainees and researchers with the resources and expertise they need for successful transdi sci- plinary research; and (iii) through a programmatic focus on transdisciplinary research across popul a- tions, institutions and cultures . Aim 2: To develop and utilize evaluation and continuous improvement metrics across the UR -CTSI, in- cluding NCATS Consortium standardized performance metrics. We will develop and implement rigorous metrics to monitor progress and effectiveness of the UR-CTSI : a. We will continue to implement process that evaluate, improve and accelerate translational research. This includes standard enumeration metrics (papers published, grants submitted), and systems/process oriented metrics (e.g. workforce training success, utilization of high throughput informatics methods, team formation, sustainability) b. We wil l implement CTSA Consortium evaluation and continuous improvement metrics. c. We will ensure annual reviews by the UR -CTSI Leadership Team, the External Advisory Committee, l o- cal community local and regional stakeholders . Aim 3: To direct and support improvements in translational research quality and efficiency. To achieve this aim, we will a. Implement initiatives based on the metrics developed in Aim 2 to increase research quality, including scientific and human subjects protection review and consent processes, and methods to improve r e- search efficiency across the translational spectrum b. Work with the CTSA Consortium to implement CTSA processes that enhance research efficiency . CORE A. ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - RESEARCH STRATEGY A.1 AIM 1: TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE UR- CTSI ORGANIZATION, VIA GOV- ERNANCE, COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION A.1.1 Organization and Governance The UR-CTSI is the major organizing force for clinical and translational research at the University of Rochester. It is housed within the School of Medicine and Dentistry (SMD ). Our UR-CTSI organi zation reflects our overall goal of team science, with clear responsibility for operations activities, and liai son responsibilities to advisory groups and NCATS ( Figure A1). We actively connec t at the leadership level with the School of Nursing, the Eastman Institute for Oral Health, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and other University struc- tures. Nationally, we connect to the NCATS Consortium through collaborative projects and leadership pos itions on the NCATS Domain Task Forces. The UR-CTSI Executive Team, made up of the Directors and Executive Directors, pr o- vides ultimate oversight over programs and projects and the allocation of resources. The three PIs (Bennett, Kieburtz, Zand) have ul- timate responsibility for the functions of the UR-CTSI and are called CTSI Directors. PI/Directors are accountable to Dr. Mark Taubman, Dean of the SMD and Medical Center CEO. The Corresponding PI (Ki e- burtz) serves as the Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Research, with responsibilities to Dean and Medical Center CEO Taubman. All three PIs are appointed as Directors of the UR -CTSI by University President (Seligman) and by the Unive r- sity Board of Trustees. In addition, the PIs of the TL1 and KL2 Cores, who are appointed by the UL1 PIs in consultation with the Vice Dean for Research, serve on the Executive Team. The TL1 (Dye) and KL2 (Hol- loway) PIs report to the Corresponding PI (Kieburtz). Each Director is supported by an Executive Director (Fogg, Jensen, Rubinstein), who has responsibility for program operations and is accountable for Core perfo r- mance and progress towards NCATS goals and UR-CTSI Specific Aims, as outlined below. Thi s matrix organ i- zation has several significant advantages: Team Governance - We lead by example, and our governance structure emphasizes team science lead- ership within the UR- CTSI. This highly functional structure exemplifies and models our vision for team sci- ence at all levels. This structure leverages the diverse and complementary skill sets of the PIs and Exec u- tive Directors. Accountability - We recognize that team members must know who has primary responsibility for any task, function or communication within the UR- CTSI . Thus, each PI and Executive Director dyad has a de- fined portfolio of responsibilities and accountability. Efficiency and Flexibility - The five primary NCATS goals (Workforce Development, Informatics, Collabo- ration/Engagement, Methods and Processes ) cut across all the Cores. Our leadership structure assigns responsibility for each of the 5 goals to a PI and Executive Director dyad, to ensure that we have high level vision and accountability. Overall Organization: The Executive Team is advised by a Community Advisory Council, an External Advisory Committee, and a Strategic Leadership Group (an internal advisory committee with local stakeholder/ comm u- nity representation). The Operations Committee is made up of the Executive Team and function leaders . It provides a communication forum on progress and priorities, active guidance and direction for implementation of strategy and tactics, and ensures integration across all programs. Also reporting to the Executive Team are the TL1 Training Program Steering Committee, and the KL2 Career Development Program Steering Commi t- tee (described in their respective cores). Reporting to the Operations Committee are the UR-CTSI c ores, which provide a focused level of leadership across thematic domains re flecting CTSA program priorities. Cores are overseen by a core director ( Table A1), are supported by an Executive Director, and benefit from other UR- CTSI leaders with operational involvement in the given domain, including program managers. Figure A1. UR -CTSI Institutional Governance UR-CTSI Leaders hip also leads within the Medical Center and University. CTSI Directors are closely integra t- ed with the leadership of the Medical Center and School of Medicine and Dentistry. Dr. Kieburtz has a dual role as the Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Research. He has authority over the allocation of space in the Saun- ders Research Building (the home of the UR -CTSI and related programs), and guides policies and institutional resources related to clinical research via the Clinical Research Review Process Improvement Team. The inf lu- ence of the UR- CTSI at the Medical Center is also manifested through membership and direction in numerous committees throughout the Medical Center . A.1.2 Executive Team Members The UR-CTSI Executive Team is the primary governing body of the UR- CTSI , and comprised of the three UL1 PIs (with Dr. Karl Kieburtz, Dr. Martin Zand, and Dr. Nancy Bennett) , the TL1 and KL2 PIs (Dr. Timothy Dye and Dr. Robert Holloway, respectively) and three Executive Directors ( Kathleen Jensen, Thomas Fogg, and Eric Rubinstein ). The UR-CTSI Executive Team meets weekly to review strategy, program activity, opportuni- ties, and budget. They have primary responsibility for 1) appointing and evaluating l eadership of the UR-CTSI, 2) financial oversight, 3) setting Institute policy, and 4) approving the I nstitute's strategic, financial, and oper a- tional plans. The Team meetings are highly collaborative and interactive, and frequently include represent a- tives of the University or Medical Center leadership to discuss plans and issues specifically relevant to their domain of expertise. The Team regularly reviews metrics and program alignment with the Medical Center, University and community directions and strat egic plans. Karl Kieburtz, MD , MPH , is corresponding PI, and serves as the Institutional and CTSA Consortium PI with a primary responsibility for connections to other elements of the University and CTSA Consortium .

A.1.3 Governance Groups (Figure A2) . In addition to the Executive Team, the UR-CTSI has four primary governance groups: External Advisory Committee (EAC , Table A2): The EAC meets twice per year, once by teleconference and once in person in Rochester. Dr. Kieburtz (PI) serves as the liaison to the EAC. The committee reviews pr o- gress, producing an annual report for the Executive Committee, which is included in our annual report to the NIH and to the Dean's. The EAC report is r e- viewed by the UR- CTSI Executive Committee and the Strategic Leadership Group, who prioritize s the recommendations and form u- lates an action plan and metrics for the coming year . Metrics are then reviewed with the EAC prior to the next meeting. EAC members are drawn from the CTSA Consortium , and private foundations. Strategic Leadership Group (SLG , Table A3) : The SLG is chaired by Dr. Bennett (PI) and meets monthly to develop strategic direction for the UR-CTSI and align priorities with those of the CTSA Consortium , the Unive r- sity of Rochester, and the comm u- nity. Members are drawn from across the institution and communi-ty. The PIs and Executive Direc- tors, as well as the TL1 and KL2 PIs, also attend the SLG meeting . A significant amount of preparation, including review of materials, oc- curs in prep aration for the monthly meetings. Over the last year, the SLG r eviewed and revised the UR- CTSI Mission, Vision, Values and Strat egic Plan to align with the new NCATS structure for the CTSA Consortium , and reviewed a- tions w the UR -CTSI . Recommendations formulated by the SLG, once approved by the Executive Team , are passed to the Oper ations Committee, who are accountable for implementation. After implementation, me t- rics of success are r eported back to the SLG. Community Advisory Council (CAC) : The CAC (further described in the Community and Collaboration Core) provides community gui d- ance across all mission areas of the medical center, including r e- search. Wade Nor wood, Chief Program Officer at the Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency, serves as Chair of the CAC, and Scott Benjamin, President and CEO of the Charles Settlement House serves as Vice -Chair. The CAC is broa dly representative of the greater Rochester community, and included representatives from a wide va riety of community organizations and interests, including the Urban League of Rochester, the Rochester City School District, the Latino Health Coalition, the African -American Health Coalition, the Finger Lakes Development Di sabilities Service Office, the M ental Health Association of Rochester and Monroe County, neighborhood centers, settlement houses and others. Two members of the CAC, Ann Marie Cook and Elissa Orlando, have ta ken on the added r e- sponsibility of serving on the SLG ( Table A3) . Table A2.

Holloway Chair, Department of Neurology TL1 T. Dye Vice Chair for Research, Dept. of Ob/Gyn Operations Committee: Dr. Zand (PI) chairs the Operations Committee, which meets twice each month, and consists of the UR-CTSI Executive Team and function leaders ( Table A 4). Highly interactive discussions in the Operations Committee meetings provide critical opportunities for cross -talk between the Executive Team, core directors and function leaders to ensure programmatic integration of all aspects of operations. The Operations Committee also reviews all fi scal, performance and other core and function metrics. Strategic plans brought from the Strategic Leadership Group are discussed with respect to implementation, and sub- committees are formed when necessary and tasked with developing operations and implementation planning. Because me m- bership in the Operations Committee cuts across all Cores, Functions and leadership roles within the UR- CTSI, it provides a responsive, and cross -disciplinary team structure that actualizes oper ations. A.1.4 Communication: The Administrative Core will ensure bidirectional flow of communication between the UR-CTSI and the CTSA Consortium Steering Committee and NCATS through r egular communication, pr o- gress reports, annual participation in person at the NCATS PD/PI meetings, and monthly PD/PI calls with the NCATS Program Officer . Dr. Kieburtz is designated as the corresponding PI for communications with NCATS and NIH. UR- CTSI representatives from the Executive Team are each assigned to one of the five CTSA D o- main Task Forces, and will continue to actively participate in these activities. We will continue to serve on the CTSA Steering Committee. We will continue to lead and collaborate on CTSA Consortium projects, metric d e- velopment, evaluation efforts, and dissemination activities. A.1.5 Synergy between the UL1, T L1 and K L2 award leaders: The strategy, planning, evaluation and man- agement of the U, K and T awards are fully integrated through leadership, program direction and staff activity. Dr. Robert Holloway who leads the KL2 program, and Dr. Tim Dye who leads the TL1 program are both mem- bers of the UR-CTSI Executive Team, and sit on the Strategic Leadership Group and Operations Committee. They also meet with the External Advisory Committee. The KL2 and TL1 Steering Committees meet quarterly to review all aspects of these programs, and report to the Executive Team through the TL1 and KL2 PIs. The Strategic Leadership Group and the Operations Committee provide critical opportunities for cross -talk between the Executive Team, Core Directors (including the KL2 and TL1) and function leaders (e.g.: operational chang- es within functions or changes in scholar or trainee needs) in order to ensure the proper programmatic integr a- tion of educational and training programs. A.1.6 Program Oversight and Conflict Management Plans Leadership conflict management plan: Any administrative conflicts or issues that cannot be resolved between Drs. Kieburtz, Bennett and Zand (PIs) will be arbitrated by Dr. Mark Taubman, Dean of School of Medicine and Dentistry at UR. Drs. Kieburtz, Bennett and Zand have each agreed that any decision by the Dean is binding, and will abide by it. Finally, Drs. Kieburtz, Bennett and Zand have each directed and co- directed several multi - disciplinary centers over the last decade, as well as dual -PI grants, and are extensively familiar with the re- sponsibilities and conduct of the multiple PI role. The trio has worked through joint leadership on program prior-ities in the current year of collaboration (including submitting the Annual Progress Report and completing this renewal application) in a spirit of mutual respect and optimism. They are personally committed to the model of group leadership as a path to novel research efficiency and effectiveness, and recognize that they lead by ex-ample. Conflict management among the executive directors or func tion leaders: Should a conflict arise among exec u- tive directors or function leader s, the appropriate Director (Drs. Kieburtz, Bennett or Zand) will take up the ma t- ter and attempt to resolve the issue through consensus. If consensus cannot be reached at this level, the D i- rector(s) will present a set of options for discussion at the Operations Committee, which will attempt to reach consensus on a resolution. If consensus is not achieved at that level, the matter will be decided by the three Directors. Should the D irectors be unable to reach a decision, the matter will be decided by the Dean of the School of Medicine and Den-tistry. The three D irectors have agreed to abide by any dec i- sion so made. Succession plan: If a PI b e- comes unable to serve, the Dean will recruit a replacement from, in order of prefe rence, (1) the Operations Committee , (2) through an internal recrui t- ment process, or (3) through an external search. If a PI for the TL1 or KL2 component should simi larly become una- ble to serve, The Directors will recruit a r eplacement principal investig ator through internal recrui tment. Should a function lead er or Executive Director b ecome unable to serve, the D irectors will recruit a replace ment through internal or exter nal searches. Continuity in op erations is assured through the team structures described in this section which exist at all lev- els of the UR-CTSI. Plans are in place for managing competing institutional perspectives, disparities in institutional culture and r esources, sharing institutional expertise and resources, and collaborative leadership; Directors, Executive Dire ctors and function leaders serve in multiple leadership roles and are members of numerous influential decision- making bo d- ies throughout the institution (Table A5) , and thus influence instit u- tional plans to promote the mi ssion and vision of the UR- CTSI. A.2 AIM 2: To develop and utilize evaluation and continuous improvement metrics across the UR- CTSI , including NCATS standardized CTSA Consortium metrics. A.2.1 Background A3): Evaluation and Continuous Im- provement (CI) are integrally related, with evaluation informing and identifying areas for improvement and continuous improvement , i.e., a process to identify and implement needed changes. This is a key component for assuring \"evaluation use\", a commonly acknow l- edged weakness across evaluations. Our existing infrastructure and Table A5.

This also positions us to collect data for the common metrics that are currently under development through NCATS in the areas of workforce, hub resources and services and collective impact. The UR-CTSI has also contributed extensively to the metrics used by the CTSA Consortium ,2-8 and we will continue to both contribute and to implement standard metrics mandated by NCATS. Our infrastructure also suppor ts the evaluation of training and research innovations discussed within the KL2 and TL1 Cores. The Evaluation Working group is led by Ann M. Dozier, RN, PhD, and includes Ca- mille Martina, MS, PhD, Nicole O'Dell, MLS, Thomas T. Fogg, MS, MPH and Eric P. Rubinstein, JD, MPH. A.2.2 Prior Accomplishments: Over the last 10 years, we developed and refined internal processes for con- tinuous improvement , and plan to continue this over the next grant period , including collection and use of pro- gram metrics and milestones through a quarterly reporting process. Many of these processes and metrics arose from our work within the CTSA Consortium .2-8 This includes a sophisticated dashboard for quarterly re- porting available through a common SharePoint web site, which allows the Operations Committee to easily re- view program progress. We annually assesses the metrics and milestones for each program and, through col- laboration with program leaders, recom mends modifications to assure that the data generated through this process is informative and drive s programmatic decision -making (CI). Assessment of UR-CTSI impact on collaboration among researchers at URMC. In 2011, we launched a novel research -collaboration- assessment process that identifies existing and emerging research collaborations among URMC investigators through a biennial online survey . Social Network Analysis of this network of over 1000 investiga tors, which we have termed the UR-CTSI 'Collaboratome' already resulted in one publication 2 and several manuscripts under development. These research network data are now linked to publications and grant -funding data extracted from PubMed and the UR grant s database. Metrics for improving transla tion, population health, and time to implementation. We interview investigators to better understand how ideas move (handoff) from investigator to investigator (i.e. following the idea). Such qualitative work is essential for identification of barriers to translation of research. Using these methods, we have identified potential opportunities to improve these handoffs, an area we plan to study further , including within the Translational Network Science Optional Function. Evaluation and improvement database: Since 2006, we have maintained and updated databases including information on the following: UR-CTSI Trainees (with the KL2 and TL1 Cores) , UR-CTSI Project Funding, In- vestigator s that have benefitted from UR-CTSI support , and URMC Research Resource Inventory (RRI). These data are used to inform metrics, and quantitatively track progress for enumerative metrics (papers pub- lished, grants awarded, scholars completing programs). We have participated in national CTSA Consortium evaluation initiatives including the design and pilot testing of the CTSA Common Metrics Project 7 to assess feasibility of establishing common metrics as well as a train- ee metrics initiative with other CTSAs .5 Further, by design, our evaluation work interdigitates with the Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) process. The Evaluation Working Group also provided guidance to the Institutional Community Engagement Self-Assessment Project, led by the UR-CTSI and which involves eight Academic Health Centers (CTSA instituti ons or applicants ; see Community Engagement and Collaboration Core for additional detail s).8 A.2.3 Goals: During the proposed funding period, we will expand our evaluation and metrics efforts. Most im- portantly, we have been and plan to continue to be active in the committees developing the NCATS guidelines to be implemented across the CTSA Consortium in the five NCATS goals/ Domain Task Force (DTF) areas. Specific areas of innovation will include the following: Expand the UR-CTSI evaluation plan to include bidirectional impact evaluation across five primary groups of stakeholders, including the Medical Center as a whole, the larger University of Rochester, the local community, other biomedical research Institutions including other CTSA hubs , and the CTSA Consortium . This will be ac- complis hed through enhanced engagement with and annual feedback from key research groups (also see Ta- ble A5) including the Scientific Advisory Committee (Medical Center), UR Research Office (Dr. Rob Clark , Senior Vice President for Research, see letter of support, Overall Section), Community Advisory Council insti- tutions (also see CAC above and Core C, Community and Collaboration) , and an annual exercise identifying involvement of UR investigators with regional, CTSA hubs and CTSA Consortium /NCATS activities . This work will demonstrate improvements/increases and opportunities for improvement in UR-CTSI impact on research, priorities , and policies involving the Medical Center, University and/or local community, as well as UR-CTSI involvement in research with other regional and/or CTSA institutions and NCATS. Additionally this work will identify the extent to which these constituencies impact/strengthen the UR-CTSI . Metrics for this work will in- clude Interactions/visibility of UR-CTSI in key URMC/UR research groups and inter-institutional research col- laborations. Assessment of team science on collaboration at UR. We will expand analyses and utilization of findings from analyses of the Collaboratome including additional publications. This will include conduct of biennial asses s- ments of URMC investigator research collaborations, and expansion of this methodology to other UR and non- UR investigators. We intend to create an exportable tool kit for use by other CTSAs with the goal of developing joint CTSA initiatives to analyze commonalities and differences as an impact on collaboration and team sci- ence. Outcomes will include dissemination of team science findings based on network analysis of the URMC Collaboratome, including development of data-driven approaches to facilitat e new and enhance current re- search teams. Metrics will include publications, and adoption of Collaboratome methodology by other CTSA hubs. New methods based on network path analysis will be developed in collaboration with the Translational Network Science Optional Function, and extended to examine team formation, collaboration, and integration. Improving Translation of Research Findings . With the broad array of publications and published studies, pas- sively awaiting citations and other mechanisms to draw attention to results is inefficient. Often, despite appro- priate dissemination of results, promising discoveries are insufficiently recogniz ed resulting in delays in devel- oping the next translational inquiry and in identifying the appropriate investigative team to conduct the re- search. In collaboration with the Translational Network Science and Hub Research Capacity cores, we will de- velop methods to assess opportunities for translation (handoffs) of ideas and findings across the research con- tinuum. First, using existing data sources within UR-CTSI and other CTSAs to identify successful handoffs and stalled translation of findings and associated contributing factors, we will seek to determine evidence of road- blocks that would benefit from handoff facilitation. We will then engage the CTSA Consortium or specific part- ners to test these specific approaches. Outcomes will include development and testing of methodology to iden- tify stalled findings and approaches for facilitating successful handoffs, to continue translation. Metrics will in- clude assessment of successful and stalled handoffs by faculty at UR and other CTSAs. In pursuit of continuous improvement, we will refine the UR-CTSI quarterly program -reporting process to en- sure the quality, utility and efficiency of metrics and their utilization for data-driven decision- making. The pro- gram reporting process will includes process and outcome metrics defined by each program and will be repor t- ed quarterly. These will be reviewed and reported to the Operations Team along with recommendations for next steps (e.g. program modification). The Evaluation Working Group also will review these reports and through at least yearly meetings with each program and with the Operations Team implement an ongoing pro- cess that includes careful review/refinement of metrics , based on their usefulness for program modification and alignment with program objectives, assessments of how findings are used to implement program modifications and follow -up monitoring that changes have resulted in program improvements. Key to these efforts is an ob- jective to optimize our processes such that we are collectin g the data we need and using the data we collect. Implementation of the CTSA Consortium Metrics: Once the forthcoming CTSA common metrics are finalized they will be incorporated into our program metrics. Another critical aspect of continuous improvement includes consultation with our EAC. An analysis/evaluation report of the UR-CTSI will be provided to the EAC in advance of our annual meeting with them. Based on their feedback , the Executive Team will develop recommended changes. The Evaluation Working Group , as part of our continuous improvement role will track implementation of these changes. Based on feedback from the EAC over the last 5 years, the UR-CTSI has made significant changes with positive impact. These includ ed the fol- lowing : Enhanced institutional approach to informatics, including broad development of informatics methods and tools, and improved coordination and tracking of expert consultations. This included recruitment of Dr. Timothy Dye as UR-CTSI Director of Informatics, and adding Dr. Martin Zand (PI) with extensive expertise in both clinical and basic science informatics methods. Implementation of extensive new methods for data sharing and development of novel technologies, includ- ing a new softw are solution for integrating i2b2 and REDCap data. Integration of efforts with the Rochester Center for Health Informatics (RCHI, led by Dr. Zand). The RCHI uses advanced graph theory and network analysis to analyze very large data sets of patient journey s through the healthcare system. This collaboration has significantly enhanced the our ability to integrate re- search findings in population health and health systems research into clinical changes at URMC Formalized our emphasis on the molecules to populations theme, enhanced by the training program run by Dr. Nancy Bennett (UR-CTSI PI) Define d evaluation metrics for community health and population health studies.7,8 Provided more career guidance to trainees in interdisciplinary clinical and translational research programs Conduct ed regularly scheduled sessions that bring together UR-CTSI trainees in a common venue Continued to strategically develop novel 21st century clinical trials methods and technologies4,9,10 A.3 AIM 3: TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY. To positively impact the health of the population, sound research data must be efficiently generated within a culture of quality. This culture of consistent and customary practices is best developed and maintained by a workforce knowledgeable in and committed to the tenets of quality processes. That workforce can then devel- op systems and methods to effectively recruit and maintain participants in robust clinic al studies. We are then able advance research from \"molecules to populations\" and ensure excellence in our clinical and translational research enterprise . A.3.1 Background: At the heart of our operational efforts to direct and support translational research quality and efficiency is the Research Help Desk, which is overseen by Executive Director Eric Rubinstein JD MPH, and our Research E n- gagement Specialist Carrie Dykes PhD. The CTSI Research Help Desk serves as a single, integrated point of contact for researchers. All help request s are recorded in the Research Request Dashboard (RRD) , a web- hosted request management system (see informatics example in Figure B2). T he Research Engagement Spe- cialist evaluates submitted information and engages request ers to clarify needs and identify solutions . Through RRD, r esearchers are expediently connected to resources (e.g. i2b2, UR research core facilities), provided with support (e.g. letters of support for grant applications, consultation for research design) , assisted with team formation (e.g. research coordinator support for studies, collaboration su g- gestions, connections to other teams), and provided with assi s- tance in subject enrollment, as well as a vari ety of other services (Figure A 4.). All requests and responsive activities are logged, and quality and utilization improvement reviews occur semi - annually, including user satisfaction surveys, resource utilization, referrals, and other metrics . The UR -CTSI also has a long track record of establishing quality systems and standards in support of a wide range of regulated research. The URMC hired a Research Quality & Compliance D i- rector , Sharyl Zaccaglino in 2013. This posit ion complements the UR Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) described be- low. The director is responsible for providing institutional quality and compliance direction and oversight regarding US FDA regul a- tory requirements for research. For FDA -regulated Good Manu- facturing Practice (GMP), the director oversees quality for the r e- cently constructed Upstate Stem Cell cGMP Facility (USCGF), a fully validated facility designed for the manufacture of stem cells for early -phase clinical trials as well as research grade monoclonal antibody products. The USCGF is a key component of the Univer- sity's Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Institute and serves as a regional resource for both academic and industrial scientists. The USCGF is a multi- use cGMP manufacturing and testing facility with the goal of accelerating \"first -in-man\" early -phase cl inical studies. Another University initiative for meeting quality standards in drug and device de- velopment is our Clinical Materials Services Unit (CMSU). The CMSU is a fully GMP compliant packaging, la- beling and distribution operation, which manages enti re supply chains to produce Clinical Trial Materials (CTM) for use in multi -center clinical trials. The CMSU partners with the University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals (UIP) for manufacturing CTM. Both CMSU and UIP are members of the National Institute for Pharm aceutical Technol o- gy and Education whose main goals are to collaborate with other (14) CTSA institutions for drug product d e- velopment. Support for pre- clinical research conducted under good laboratory practice ( GLP) regulations is also now available. Regulatory experts provide tailored training regarding regulatory requirements and can Figure A4. CTSI Research Help Desk - Is the central point of contact for researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center, connecting researchers with resources, help and services to accelerate their work. serve as the Quality Assurance Unit (QAU), conducting system audits and critical phase inspections to GLP - compliant research within the URMC. Accredited by the Association for Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP), the HRPP ensures that human subject research is guided by the ethical principles stated in the Belmont Report. The University's fundamental commitment to the protection of human subjects applies to all human subject r e- search conducted by University faculty or staff, regardless of funding source or site of the research. The Uni-versity follows the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, and the FDA regulati ons at 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50 and 56. In developing its policies and pr o- cedures, the University considers the guidance provided by the federal Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) and the FDA as part of its commitment . The UR Office for Human Subject Protection (OHSP) ensures that the rights and wellbeing of human subjects are protected, educates researchers on how to improve study conduct, and assesses research risk. Partnering with OHSP, the UR- CTSI plays an active role in the enhancement of research infrastructure, advancing high quality, safe and ethical research that is well designed and efficiently operated. Throughout the lifecycle of r e- search planning, operations, analysis and reporting, the UR- CTSI has engaged t he research community in process improvement. University policy requires that department chairs or their delegate(s) review protocols submitted to the HRPP for review by the Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB , our Institutional Review Board (IRB ) prior to sub- mission to the RSRB to ensure that the proposed science is sound, risks to subjects have been identified and minimized and the proposed research team has the resources and qualifications necessary to implement the protocol, as designed. The UR -CTSI convened an initiative that included development and and implementation of standard criteria for inclusion in all department -managed scientific review s. The resultant policy and process guidelines were contributed to the CTSA Consortium as part of particip ation of an NCATS CTSA Steering Committee prioritized supplemental project aiming to establish standards for scientific review for all CTSA hubs with Eric Rubinstein MPH JD leading the UR -CTSI contribution. Research plan review for safety, efficiency, and feasibility: Throughout the University research enterprise, r e- searchers engage processes for developing an idea into a refined research question and an efficient, safe and ethical research plan. Long before a human subject research protocol is review ed by a scientific reviewer or by an Institutional Review Board to evaluate whether the potential benefits to answering the research question justify the potential risks to human subjects, researchers have access to expertise to support study design. As described more fully within the BERD function of the Research Methods Core, the UR- CTSI draws on these successful approaches to provide methodological input and access to subject matter experts with whom to col- laborate. The Quality Improvement (QI) group wit hin OHSP conducts regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) reviews and ensures compliance with UR policies and procedures. They provide consultation services for study start -up to educate research team members in applicable regulations required to ensu re human sub- ject protection, protocol compliance, research documentation, and to facilitate the site activation process. Recruitment and Retention: To guide effective strategies for recruitment and retention of research subjects, the UR-CTSI created a Rec ruitment Unit, as described in the Network Capacity Core LRIC function. To assure development of an effective and appropriate study -specific recruitment plan, the above- described scientific r e- view requires that the Plan for recruitment, retention and foll ow up with subjects is feasible. Effective monitoring of clinical investigations is critical to the protection of human subjects and the conduct of high quality studies. The University has several ongoing initiatives in this regard including the development of risk based monitoring within the Clinical Trials Coordination Center (CTCC). A risk based approach will focus on risks to the most critical data elements and processes necessary to achieve study objectives. The I nforma t- ics Core narrative describes increased focus on patient safety by alerting health care workers in the E HR of a patient's enrollment in a research study. In addition, the UR- CTSI has piloted a Clinical Trial Management System to establish more efficient means of monitoring all aspects of trial activation and execution and early intervention for futile or non- adherent studies. Coordination of communication within the UR- CTSI and the UR as a whole is essential for the continuous ex e- cution of high quality studies and continuous process improvements. Appropriate channels for communication have been established. One such venue is led by Karl Kieburtz, co -PI and Director of UR -CTSI and Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Research. Dr. Kieburtz chairs the Clinical Research Review Process Improvement Team (CRRPIT), which provides input and guidance for improvement of governing institutional research- management processes. CRRPIT provides for innovative development and institutional adoption of solutions to systemic process challenges. Another venue is the newly formed Quality & Compliance Forum led by the Research Quality & Compliance Director , which has as its mission to foster communication, institutionalize quality processes, leverage skills, and educate the greater university community on quality. A.3.2 Goals Goal: A culture of quality is pervasive in our institution . We will continue to improve institutional capacity to en- sure quality and efficiency of research by pursuing this culture of quality throughout our University research enterprise. As described in the Research Methods (Regulatory knowledge and support ( RKS) function) , we will contribute to developing standards for data reproducibility, test those standards in research environments and disseminate evidence- based standards throughout the University and the CTSA Consortium . We will measure the number of new studies using data reproducibility modules (including the use of predefined Common Data Elements (CDEs) as set forth by NIH ), the changes in process time for development of study databases after protocol approval, and the changes in process times from database lock to high level results given availability of reproducible analytical modules. We will expand participation in the Quality and Compliance Forum by including other groups. We will facilitate skill sharing and dissemination of best practices to reduce negative fi ndings from monitoring and auditing acti v- ities. We will measure the changes in: (1) the number of research units represented in the Quality and Compl i- ance forum; (2) the number of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality document practices utilized across the University; and ( 3) the change in the number of negative findings from both internal and external monitoring and audits. Goal: Research tools and processes are available to enable more efficient and higher quality research. As de- scribed in the Network Capacity Core Liaison to the Recruitment Innovation Center function, we will implement processes to ensure that patients of our learning healthcare system are presented with the opportunity to learn about opportunities to volunteer as a research s ubject. We will introduce efficiencies in identification and r e- cruitment of research subjects to ensure nimble and effective accrual of study -specific target populations and sample sizes. We will measure changes in process times from study initiation to fulfillment of accrual goals. Aligned with NCATS expectations and coordinated through CTSA Trial Innovation Centers and our local Trial Innovation Unit (TIU) (see Network Capacity , Liaison to the Trial Innovation Center function), we will deploy coordinated clinical trial management systems to enable our ability to monitor study quality and timelines, to provide real time monitoring of into accumulating serious adverse events (SAEs), to track futile studies for timely termination and also to intervene for course correction, if needed. Such a system provides the TIU with increased central monitoring of the scope and breadth of studies in the University human subject research portfolio. We will measure the proportion of studies that complete on time as established in the IRB -approved protocol, changes in the rate of subject withdrawal prior to study completion, the proportion of serious adverse events reported to sponsors, regulatory agencies and IRBs on time and the number of actively enrolling, co m- pleted and published clinical trials. We will implement a document management system to improve compliance with procedures, to reduce time for review and approval by coordinating parallel review processes, to ensure consistency of process and to i m- prove efficiencies by reducing duplicative work effort for related review processes (e.g. IRB and scientific con- tent review) . Further, we will measure the number of audit findings regarding document controls, changes in time for revision processing, and the numbers of research units utilizing standardized procedures. We will con tinue collaborations with the URMC Department of Pharmacy Investigational Drug Service (IDS) and CMSU to select and implement software to manage investigational study drugs that will minimize wasted drug, provide more efficient means of study drug maintenance and tracking of expiry dates and enhance co m- pliance in the event of a recall or recovery of short -dated supplies. We will measure cost savings realized through more efficient allocation of supplies and process time for execution of supply recovery vers us paper based systems and will reduce dispensing errors. Goal: The University clinical and translational workforce is effectively trained to produce high quality research that is efficiently managed. As described in the Translational Endeavors Core transl ational workforce develop- ment function and the Research Methods (Biostatistics, epidemiology and research design and RKS fun c- tions ), we will contribute to and adopt common currency for GCP, GLP and GMP training and will develop standard expectations for co mpetency based training. The outcome of these efforts will be that researchers are educated in regulatory requirements and study design methodology and competent to perform their assigned roles and duties. We will measure changes in the numbers of funded s tudies, stratified by faculty rank, the number and proportion of Inves tigational New Drug and Investigational Device Exemption applications submi t- ted to the FDA that are accepted upon first submission and the change in the number of FDA -issued \"Clinical Holds\" prior to target study start date.

INFORMATICS - SPECIFIC AIMS Informatics is a central capacity that facilitates an effective clinical and translational science enterprise1 and increasingly drives the research agenda prioritizing science that informs precision medicine,2-4 population health,5-7 and biomedical \"big data\" science.8-10 The University of Rochester (UR) has amplified informatics across the institution with a $100 -million investment to establish the Goerg en Institute for Data Science (IDS) ,11 with the inclusion of data science as the University's top priority in its 2013 -2018 Strategic Plan,12 an emphasis on electronic health records- driven care and research in the UR Medical Center Strategic Plan,13 and with the inclusion of informatics capacity as a critical investment in the School of Medicine and Dentistry Research Strategic Plan.14 UR has one of the most powerful academic computing systems in the nation, and conduct s groundbreaking research in health data mining of social media,15-17 computational modeling and molecular informatics,18-20 and population health informatics.21,22 In addition to the IDS , UR houses the Health Sciences Center for Computational Innovation (HSCCI), a partnership between UR, IBM, and the State of New York, that facilitates access to high -performance computational resources for biomedical research; the Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC) that provides researchers across the University with hardware, software, training, and support necessary to utilize computational and data analytics technology in research; and the New York State Center of Excellence in Data Science to leverage basic research, training and technology development to drive regional economic development; and numerous specialty Centers/ Institutes with informatics, technology , and health research priorities. The overall goal of the Informatics Core is t o catalyze translational research speed, quality, and impact though a research friendly 'data environment', including innovative informatics, secure and integrated data management tools and support, and workforce training. Data democratization, integration, and dissemination accelerate translational research. We will achieve this goal by supporti ng research teams with innovative informatics methods and services, including data a cquisition , secure warehousing, HIPAA compliant de -identification, informatics analysis, and data s haring across the CTSA Consortium with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To coordinate researcher -friendly and accessible resources to support informatics -engaged research toward science informing precision medicine, population health, and biomedical data science. a. Create a wrap- around system for service provision, informatics -engaged policy development, and resources deployed through thematic and technical informatics clusters . Aim 2: To leverage and expand the sustainable informatics infrastructure at the UR that supports translational researchers, enhances data security, and improves data sharing and access. a. Develop a Research Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization System to enhance efficient and secure data access b. Create a technical infrastructure cluster that engages the Univer sity's technical resources c. Enhance the Electronic Health Record (EHR) -base that supports informatics -engaged research Aim 3: To establish, promote, and provide access to educational programs in informatics and biomedical data science in collaboration with medical school and other partner stakeholders (degree and certificate programs, non -traditional opportunities) for students, staff, trainees, and faculty. a. Expand informatics -specific continuing education, credit -bearing, certificate, and degree options for staff, students, and faculty (including for KL2 scholars and TL1 trainees) b. Convert training options (courses, modules, materials) to an online portal enabling public access The overall approach to expansion of the Informatics Core is based upon several assumptions, including: 1) EHR as the major institutional resource around whi ch informatics and informatics -based research is centered; 2) Informatics resources at the University are embedded and distributed throughout the Institution and provision of informatics -related services and expansion of expertise occurs in collaboration and partnership with other University and external entities; and 3) Driving priorities underlying informatics at UR include data availability (security, source, quality), sharing and usage (access, analysis, tools), and governance (researcher/community enga gement, policy development/implementation). With a strategic focus on creating a sustainable informatics research resource, the CTSI anticipates that the Informatics Core will enable continued rapid expansion and progress of UR's research enterprise. UR in formatics partnerships are established and productive from local to global levels, and the institution's resources and investment are significant. The CTSI is poised to expand its scope to facilitate research accessing new informatics technologies, data ty pes, and analytic methods to support new research directions across the translational research spectrum. CORE B. INFORMATICS - RESEARCH STRATEGY B.1. BACKGROUND UR-CTSI informatics activities to -date (Table B1) have included supporting and engaging with governance of the University's data science and informatics initiatives and policies; prioritizing development and implementation of tools that provide access to EHR and to research repositories for clinical researchers;23 securing protected health information ( PHI) and dat asets through novel data management and access strategies;24 enabling sharing of data within and across institutions through technical and policy cooperation;25 and creating tools and systems that support population health research.26,27 Further, CTSI activities have included establishing institutional governance in these areas, and development of internal and external partnerships to facilitate their accomplishment. The CTSI I nformatics Core has leveraged t informatics capacity with approximately $2 million in additional extramural funding during the past y ear for informatics -related research that focus ed on use of EHR to improve care (Pfizer), for informatics -focused global population health research and training (CDC, NIH) , for biorepository development (Mae Stone Goode Foundation) , and for pioneering the development of \"data diplomacy\" to address inter -institutional and international data sharing and governance (World University Network) . The practical foundation for much of UR informatics activity surrounds the research use of the Medical Center's enterpr ise-wide installation of the Epic EHR. Implemented in 2011, the EHR contains approximately 11 million encounters, 1 million patients, and 3 million diagnosis events . B.2. APPROACH Informatics -related activities are embedded throughout UR and with its local partners (for example, the Rochester Health Information Organization, or RHIO). As such, the overall approach to the CTSI Informatics Core is necessarily engaged and distributed i n a context of shared governance. The work of the Core will therefore occur in the context of \"clusters\" that involve key informatics partners throughout the institution, but will be coordinated by the CTSI. The overall approach to the Informatics Core will prioritize integration of, and access to, data from EHR, clinical research databases, sensor -based and continuously streamed data, social media, patient -generated data , regional health information exchange data, and publically available data sources. This comprehensive approach crosses numerous organizations within and outside of UR, and requires federated collaboration. The CTSI Informatics Core will often function in a substantive way in these collaborations, as a single point -of-entry coordination for researchers, enabling a clear and simple pathway to access informatics resources. We term this wrap -around set of services from ideation to action, to convey that researchers have CTSI informatics support and insight as needed throughout the research devel opment and implementation process .

Aim 1 is designed to facilitate productive, impactful informatics -engaged research across the lifespan of a researcher's program, from ideation to action covering the informatics spectrum of translational research. Because the technical and content scope o f this informatics spectrum is vast, the CTSI Informatics Core builds on its prior success in facilitating service and expertise across organizational lines via pre- existing relationships with key technical stakeholders. Through the Research Request Dashboard (RRD) component of the CTSI's Research Help Desk , researchers will have a single point of entry to obtain whatever informatics technical assistance is needed, facilitated by CTSI Informatics Core staff, but engaging others from throughout the Universit y, wherever technical and context expertise may reside. Our overall model to approach Aim1 will be to aggregate existing expertise and informatics capacities from throughout the institution and community into Infor matics Core Clusters; this will provide a mechanism through which informatics services and assistance will be provided to researchers and where technical issues, opportunities, and challenges facing researchers at the institution will be addressed. Broadly , there will be six clusters: 1) data capture and management ( Data) ; 2) analytic expertise across the spectrum of informatics, from bioinformatics to public health (Analytics ); 3) engagement with communities and community health needs ( Population Health Informatics); 4) technical infrastructure ( Technical Infrastructure) ; 5) the vast scope and volume of the Institution's EHR ( EHR); and 6) education related to informatics ( Informatics Education). In all cases, we designed clusters to provide a single point -of-contact within the CTSI Informatics Core that facilitates wider access to related resources from across the University. In each cluster, a CTSI Informatics Core staff member will coordinate the work of the cluster. Cluster functions will include: 1) fielding service requests that fall within that cluster's domain, matching researcher with institutional informatics resources to meet requests; 2) monthly meeting s (and virtually as needed) to discuss and strategize institutional developments, policy needs, and workload that relate to that cluster; and 3) serve as the go-to resource for the University for the focus area of the cluster. The existing CTSI RRD is a web- hosted request management system that serves as the 'front door' through which requests are m ade (directly by researcher or service requester, or facilitated through a CTSI Research Engagement Specialist) . The Research Engagement Specialist ( Figure B2) will identify the Cluster Coordinator that best matches the researcher or service request to manage that particular requirement and will bring in other clusters as needed. This primary Cluster Coordinator will follow task progress in the RRD until the task is closed out. Researchers and requests that come directly to an Informatics team member will e nter the same RRD management cycle. Figure B2. Research Engagement System Cluster Description s (also see biosketches of named cluster members ) The Data Cluster will be the primary mechanism for providing expertise and access to resources regarding capture and management of all types of data. Our enhanced expertise in sensor -generated, social media, and unstructured data, in addition to more typical clinical, EHR (which has its own cluster), and other data. The data cluster (represented in Figure B1, with leadership named in Table B2) will be constructed especially to represent expertise and capacity for data acquisition and analysis of social media data (Kautz),16,17,28- 33 machine learning and unstructured data (Luo),34-38 continuously -measured clinical data (Kieburtz),39-41 sensor -generated biological, genomic, and molecular data (Holden- Wiltse).18,45 -48 Our practical expertise in novel data acquisition and analysis of myriad data types will complement existing strong expertis e within the CTSI Informatics Core in clinical and public health data management, and create an innovative, unique institutional mechanism for the development of novel platforms and tools to embed these data types within clinical and translational research. The data cluster will both propel collaboration, policy, and tool innovation while facilitating expertise to federated data resources throughout the institution. Table B2. For the Analytics Cluster , we will provide technical assistance and expertise for analysis of biomedical informatics and bioinformatics data , providing assistance to researchers directly or by connecting them to the external UR community with the required analytic skills. This analytic capacity will be particularly relevant for researchers using novel or unusual data cap ture and EHR sources facilitated by the Data Cluster and the EHR Cluster. We will prioritize bioinformatics analysis of complex computational biological data (McMurray), 49-52 high dimensional data analytics ( Strawderman),53-56 evaluating the cost and quality of health care and outcomes analysis (Noyes),57-60 graph theory/ network analysis (Zand),18,61,62 and public health and informatics (Li).63-66 Of note, we will support the UR -CTSI Translational Network Science module submitted with this application. Collectively the set of resources assembled in the Analytics Cluster will cover a wide range of analytic skills, software ex pertise, and approaches addressing many current and emerging research questions that engage the informatics enterprise. Further, the UR high -performance computing facility (CIRC ) will provide the platform and mechanisms for analytic work of this cluster. T able B3. For the Population Health Informatics Cluster , we will provide informatics design and systems expertise to communities an d community -engaged researchers and other researchers interest in population health. This expertise will include designing systems, assessing needs, and evaluati ng community programs addressing informatics and information (Holt), 67-70 mixed methods research and qualitative analysis of unstructured data (Demment),71-73 clinical research recruitment and program evaluation (Dozier),74-77 community engagement, community research study design and implementation (Bennett).78-82 Further, D. Li (Analytics Cluster) will maintain investigator access to a wide range of public health data sets from the National Center for Health Stati stics and elsewhere, which enhance the resources of this cluster. This cluster is closely affiliated with the CTSI -support ed Center for Community Health (N. Bennett, CCH Director; K. Holt, CCH Informaticist) and the department of Public Health Sciences (Dozier and Li), ensuring integration with the applied work and related education in both. Table B4. B.2.2. Approach, Aim 2 : To leverage and expand sustainable informatics infrastructure at the UR that supports translational researchers, enhances data security, and improves data sharing and access. Aim 2 involves three mechanisms to facilitate technical informatics infrastructure: 1) create a focal point for research -related informatics infrastructure and systems through the Technical Infrastructure Cluster that leverages resources and capacities across the institution, 2) support the development of a Research Data Warehouse (RD W) and Data Virtualization (DV) system to streamline access to and security of data for research, and 3) support a robust EHR -based infrastructure accessible to researchers. The Technical Infrastructure Cluster , together with the other components for Aim 2 , will enhance security of and access to research data and databases by facilitating involvement of a range of leaders from throughout the Institution along with significant leveraging of technical resources that assure access to and appropriate use and understanding of the technical and computing infrastructure to support informatics. Coordinated by CTSI Senior Research Informaticist J. Chang, the Technical Infrastructure Cluster leverages the resources of the Medical Center's Academic Information Technol ogy (AIT) capacity to address the specific technical requirements of researchers engaged with the Informatics Core along w ith central involvement of S. Wormsley , Table B2.

Additionally, the involvement of D. Krusch (who heads Medical Informatics and enterprise -wide installation of EPIC) who is responsible for technical requirements of the EHR system -wide, and B. Mort who heads the Institution's Center for Integrated Research Computing , the high performance computing facility, will enable researchers to access computer resources that facilitate access to clinical data and big data analysis. Further, the CTSI technical team of A. Tatro (who facilitates researcher access to EHR and direc ts the University's i2b2 installation), C. Irvine (who directs the University's REDCap installation), and P. Ng, a senior research programmer analyst embedded within the eRecord system, will provide additional assurances that researchers can access the inf ormatics resources of the Core easily to facilitate their research. Table B5. Research Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization: While the URMC possesses a rich variety of data from diverse clinical and research systems, these data are not necessarily integrated nor standardized, which imposes unnecessary data handling burdens on investigators and introduces security risk as physical data moves from device to device. Our major goal over the next 5 years will be to enhance data management capabilities , prioritizing access and security . We will support this goal ( Figure B3) by contributing to the development of a Research Data Warehous e (RDW; S. Wormsley, Lead) and Data Virtualization (DV; J. Chang, Lead). URMC has developed a Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) with information derived from clinical systems that include inpatient and outpatient EHR systems as well as laboratory, radiology, and financial information systems. Over the next 5 years, the CDW will be expanded and integrated into an RDW with other data sets located at the University and with its partners. In addition, to allow integration of URMC databases, we propose implementing data virtualization that provides \"just-in-time\" inventory of data, available as needed by submitting standardized and reusable extraction and integration programs. The RDW will be a solid foundation for data analysis and reporting, deliver ing intelligent insight into data with enhanced data quality, consistency and historical intelligence. DV will improve access and security by combining disparate data sources into a \"virtual\" data layer , thereby providing unified access, integrated and agile data services, unified data governance and security to consuming applications in real -time (right -time), with significantly reduced cost. Shown in Figure B3, for the purpose of mining data and acquiring information and knowledge about the patient populati on, the RDW aggregates data from clinical system s and selected research systems, carries out research -driven and meaningful data transformation, extraction, integration, annotati on, quality improvement, and unstructured data pre- processing using advanced Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies . Translational research, however, demands data services (e.g. access, integrati on, security, etc.) far beyond what the traditional data warehouse soluti on can provide alone with ever -increasing q uanti ty, diversity, complexity, and distributi on of research data and data sources. Data Virtualizati on represents an innovative, contemporary approach for provision of real-time data access and integrati on to deal with the complexity, heterogeneity and volume of research data , while providing far greater enhanced security . The hybrid architecture for the RDW and DV will result in scalable infrastructure that fulfills the research demands for data. Table B5. Technical Infrastructure Cluster (see biosketches) Jack Chang (CTSI), Coordinator Steven Wormsley, PhD David Krusch, MD Brendan Mort, PhD Adam Tatro, MS RN Carrie Irvine, MS Philip Ng Figure B3: UR Proposed Research Data Warehouse and Data Virtualization System Electronic Health Record Central Record Resource: The central resource driving patient -based research and the UR population health approach is the EHR system, depicted in Figure B4. While one of many data systems of interest to researchers, it is the most widespread, complex, and central to URMC and is the focal point of many CTSI Informatics resources. Much of the recent experience with EHR informatics has been developmental and experimental in that it is a new resource that did not exist at the time of the last CTSI renewal and the CTSI has been part of the national movement to make EHR more accessible through development of tools and methods. In the next cycle, we will continue our EHR goals to: 1) simplify access to EHR content; 2) develop and implement tools for research (e.g. to create analytic databa ses); 3) promote use of the EHR platform for conducting clinical and practice- based research; 4) use the EHR to alert patients and clinicians to research opportunities; 5) enhance inclusion of patient -reported outcomes within the EHR system; and 6) facilit ate CTSA -wide EHR- based quality collaboratives. These priorities will be facilitated through coordination of the EHR Cluster , engaging relevant resources and expertise from throughout the institution. Through the EHR Cluster , we will facilitate researcher access to and use of EHR data along with the above- mentioned goals , The EHR Cluster evolved from prior informatics partnerships at UR that contributed toward the enterprise- wide implementation of i2b2, REDCap, an i2b2 to REDCap tool, and development of a cryptographic hash function tool, all of which facilitates data democratization and improves researcher access to clinical data. We will ensure maximal researcher use and access to timely EHR data, facilitated by the EHR's technical home (ISD) and the Chie f Medical Information Officer (Krusch) and the CTSI technical team managing i2b2 (Tatro). The EHR core will also facilitate patient -generated outcomes measurement through the PROMIS (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) methodology. Further, we will liaise with researchers within and outside of UR to facilitate EHR -centered quality initiatives, such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program and the Maternal Quality Improvement Program (Glance). Importantly, we will continue our integral, innovative collaboration with the regional health information exchange for the Rochester region (RHIO) . As a repository of vast clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from throughout the entire Rochester region, the RHIO presents an opportunity for collaboration involving population- based EHR -informed research. Table B6. B.2.3 Approach, Aim 3: To establish, promote, and provide access to educational programs in informatics and biomedical data science with partner stakeholders (degree and certificate programs, non- traditional opportunities) for students, staff, trainees, and faculty. For A im 3, we will focus on coordinating access to training opportunities in use of informatics tools such as methods and techniques for informatics data manag ement, bioinformatics analysis, and data science. These offerings will be available to staff, faculty, and students (including KL2 scholars and TL1 trainees) and will include: training to access informatics resources such as continuing education offerings for i2b2 and REDCap. Skills Building Training for Informatics will include offerings from Miner Library's Bioinformatics Consulting and Education Service (BCES) on many bioinformatics topics. Additionally, the Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC) offers programming/ analytic language training. The CTSI Informatics Core is home to the Graduate Certificate of Advanced Study in Biomedical Data Science (CAS -BDS), which offers a range of courses offered across the institution such as Data Structures and Data Mining (offered through Computer Science), Biomedical Informatics and Team Science (offered through Public Health Sciences), and Applied Statistics in Biomedical Science (Biostatistics and Computational Biology). Table B6 : Electronic Health Record (EHR) Cluster Leadership (see biosketches) Adam Tatro, MS, RN (CTSI), Coordinator David Krusch, Ted MPH (RHIO) Figure B4: UR Medical Center Infrastructure Medical Faculty reform health information organization; AHP: URMC accountable care organization For Aim 3, we will also support establishment of an Informatics Education portal online, providing public access to informatics -related training materials that can be used as self -study, or can be integrated into training programs of other CTSA, Research Centers in Minority Instit utions , or other infrastructure initiatives. Selected courses from continuing education, certificate, and degree options will be converted to provide public access through the UR Informatics Education portal, and also as massively open online courses ( MOOC s). In addition, areas of unique capability at UR -CTSI (e.g., social media analysis, network analysis, data virtualization, data diplomacy, statistics supporting bioinformatics) will be promoted as specialized offerings available to the community of resear chers worldwide. Informatics Core Governance: The Informatics Team (including coordinators ) is co-located and will meet bi -weekly to review progress and needs. The CTSI Informatics Core governance cluster (Table B7) aims to: 1) assure communication and cooperation among the major stakeholders in informatics at UR; 2) harmonize with the overall goals and aims of the CTSI; and 3) connect with the wider CTSA and clinical research community across the US. Timothy Dye (Professor of Obstetric s and Gynecology, Pediatrics, Public Health Sciences, and Medical Informatics) currently serves as the CTSI Director of Biomedical Informatics and will continue to do so for the next CTSI cycle. He is funded by NIH, CDC and foundations, with extensive leadership and research experience in informatics, currently serving on the CTSA Informatics Domain Task Force and Co- Leading the Informatics DTF Working Group on Sustainable Research Informatics I nfrastructure . He also designed and directs the Certificate of Advanced Study in Biomedical Data Science, and serves on numerous advisory boards and steering committees relat ed to informatics at UR. The leadership structure, linked with informatics representation on the CTSI External Advisory Board, ass ures collaboration among the major informatics - related resources and entities involved in the CTSI Informatics Core, and provides mechanisms for connection to the CTSA Consortium through the PIs and External Advisory Committee . A CTSI -coordinated Annual Informatics Planning Retreat wi th the wider university community will review progress, needs, and developments , and harmonize informatics workplans . Table B8 .

COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION - SPECIFIC AIMS The UR-CTSI views community engagement and collaboration/team science as the means to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of research to significantly improve health. Our community and increasingly, our region, is a laboratory where we can demonstrate how research directly and indirectly impacts the health of the population through better, more rapid translation of science to cl inical and community solutions. To do this , we engage communities and stakeholders early and throughout the research process to identify : the most important research needs for our community, culturally tailored research designs, meaningful outcomes, and the best implementation practices. These groups may include patients, clinicians, members of underrepresented minorities, disease advocacy groups, special populations, community based organizations, and the business community . Although these stakeholders may have widely divergent interests, the principles of engagement are the same. For scientific research to be embraced by the public, we must demonstrate its value - its impact - on the health status of the nation. We measure our success by our capacity to respond to local health priorities and to link research to population health improvement. The URMC commitment to community health, the similarity of our region to most of the US (urban, suburban and rural populations), and the community's collaborative nature provide fertile ground for this ambitious goal. Translational science requires expertise from a variety of disciplines and communities, because of the complexity of human science and because of the necessity of reaching across the continuum fr om \"molecules to populations.\" Scientists and stakeholders must identify their common interests, learn to work together, develop infrastructure for their work, and appreciate multiple perspectives. The synergy that grows from bringing multiple disciplines together results in new insights and methods that , in turn, more rapidly and efficiently advance research and health improvement. We will strengthen the skills of our workforce - both trainees and current investigators - to better understand and implement these concepts and practices through a variety of training opportunities - both didactic and experiential. Personnel from this Core will actively collaborate with all UR -CTSI education initiatives (Workforce Development, TL1 and KL2) to ensure integration of community engagement and team science constructs. Our expertise in community engagement and collaboration will ready our hub to contribute to and lead national research networks, expediting and supporting multi -institutional research. We disseminate our best pract ices throughout the CTSA Consortium and similarly, learn from other hubs. Knowledge and implementation of best practices in team science and strong and deep engagement with communities, special populations, patients, and stakeholders will yi eld high quality, more readily applicable research to improve the health of the public. Collaboration among investigators and with community stakeholders will be integrated across all UR-CTSI - supported initiatives and will ensure the development of future productive and efficient transdisciplinary teams. Over the next grant period we will accomplish the following : Aim 1: Community Engagement: To deepen and broaden community and stakeholder engagement across the research spectrum. a. Engage community stakeholders (including disease advocacy groups, local business, special populations, community based organizations, business) more deeply in specific research projects to advance the science of community engaged research. b. Increase capacity to conduct community -based participatory research and community -engaged research across the full spectrum of translational research. c. Build on existing educational opportunities for researchers/staff, health professions students, and increase opportunities for community members to learn about research. d. Lead CTSA Consortium activities to measure the value of community engagement and collaboration. e. Document the relationship between UR -CTSI activities and community health improvement. Aim 2: Collaboration and Multi -disciplinary Team Science : To enhance the research environment that supports transdisciplinary science by training a research workforce that can easily adopt the best pract ices of team science, and ensure an institutional environment that supports team science. a. Further institutional culture change b. Increase Opportunities for Experiential Learning /Guided Practice in M ultidisciplinary Team Science c. Accelerate research collaborations in Upstate New York Translational Research Network (UNYTE) d. Strategically expand the number of GR -PBRN member practices and create formal mechanisms to increase research deriving from clinician interests. CORE C. COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATION - RESEARCH STRATEGY C.1 Aim 1: Community Engagement: To deepen and broaden community and stakeholder engagement across the research spectrum. Commu nity engagement (CE) is an historic strength of the URMC and is a critical tool for the improvement of translational research and population health. The UR -CTSI aims to improve population health and therefore requires the engagement of many communities including underrepresented minorities, communities across the lifespan, special populations, patients, and stakeholders. We support research that addresses the critical health challenges identified by our community and faci ng the nation. Our proposal demonstrates how communities can become an integral part of all research, informing study design, recruitment and retention, dissemination and implementation, and thus increas ing the value and efficiency of research to improve population health. We have fully embraced CE by integrating the Community Advisory Council (CAC) into the leadership and fabric of the UR -CTSI, thus bringing the community perspective to all parts of our institute. Although this description focuses specifically on the activities of the Community and Collaboration Core, the influence of our community and critical stakeholders is apparent throughout the Institute . C.1.1 BACKGROUND AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS As outlined in Principles of Community Engagement, Second Edition1, we define CE as the process of working collaboratively in a bi -directional manner with communities and stakeholders in the research endeavor. Our CTSI has benefitted from deep URMC commitment to improving the health of the Rochester region, dating back to 2004 when community health was added to patient care, research and education as a critical mission area. Examples of the impact of research on community health in Rochester include: higher immunization rates, low er childhood lead poisoning rates, and lower breast cancer death rates among African American women compared to national data. Since 2006, our CE function has had the following aims: 1) To Increase community engagement in the design and conduct of research; 2) To increase provider participation in research; 3) To improve the CE capacity of investigators and students; and 4) To increase diversity in research subject recruitment and retention. Significant progress has been made through the development of strong infrastructure and programs as described below. One critical asset is the Center for Community Health (CCH), which serves as the UR infrastructure for CE and community health improvement .2 The CCH is a model of CE and team science, combining service and research, with the mission, \"To join forces with the community to promote health equity, improve health through research, education and services, and to establish local and national models for prevention and community engagement.\" The CCH was founded in 2006 by Dr. Nancy Bennet t, CTSI co -PI and Community and Collaboration Core Director; it is located off -campus in the heart of the Rochester community, and employs six multidisciplinary faculty members and 69 staff. The Center receives $1M in institutional support and approximately $5- 6M in extramural funding each year , supports community -academic partnerships , and provides consultation and support to faculty, staff, and s tudents throughout the URMC to establish community - based initiatives and research. The CCH coordinates and convenes the Community Advisory Council and the Population Health Interest Group, both advisory to the UR -CTSI. The philos ophy of the CCH, joining research and community service, has resulted in increased CE across departments and schools leading to research addressing community priorities, such as obesity , diabetes and mental health, and increased attention to the translation of basic science to community health improvement. The URMC Community Advisory Council (CAC), crea ted in 2006, provides guidance across all institutional mission areas including research. (See Letter of Support , Norwood and Benjamin) The CAC, comprise d of 22 community leaders from multiple sectors (e.g., health and human service agencies, government, business, community -based organizations, the faith community, media, and community coalitions ) establish es priorities, provides consultation to investigators in all phases of research, partner s on specific research projects, and participate s in the dissemination of findings. The CAC works with the CCH to identify and analyze community health data, a critical part of the prioritization process. Two members of the CAC are members of the Strategic Leadership Group, and UR -CTSI leaders attend CAC quarterly meetings. UR- CTSI and CCH staff members participat e in m ultiple ot her community coalitions such as the African American and Latino Health Coalitions . Outcomes of this close collaboration have included improved attitudes (surveyed periodically , Recruitment Unit, Network Capacity ) towards clinical research (e.g., value to s ociety, value to community, future of clinical research) a mong al l respondents (to >90% ), especially African Americans. Likelihood of participation in research (by self or family member encouragement) also increased to nearly 80%, with a reduction in the disparities between minority and non- minority respondents. In addition, data regarding inclusion of underrepresented groups showed an increase in African Americans (from 10 to 18% - greater than their percentage of the population) enrolled in all studies closed in 2014, compared to 2010. A similar increase did not occur among Latinos, but their distribution (7 - 12%) is similar to their proportional of the regional population. The Population Health Interest Group (PHIG), established in 2006, is comprised of faculty and staff interest ed in CE , population health and prevention research. The mission of this group is to improve research and education programs across the inst itution. The PHIG enhances CE across the research spectrum and foster s team science. The PHIG established and oversees the biweekly Public Health Grand Rounds series, developed an annual award (the Dr. David Satcher Award) for CE research, developed a mini -grant program to support community -academic partnerships, advocated for promotion and tenure policies that recognize CE and team science, coordinated CE research across departments, and developed and published a framework for the evaluat ion of institution CE activities .3 The Greater Rochester Practice- Based Research Network (GR -PBRN) ,4 brings the perspective of clinicians into the research endeavor , facilitates practice based research , and is f ully described in the Collaboration section below . Since the inception of the CTSI ten years ago, CE experts (including the Di rector of Community Health Partnerships, the GR -PBRN Coordinator, the CAC , and the Community Clinician Steering Committee) have provided consultations on more than 200 research projects. The CAC and other community -URMC collaborative groups enhance CE across the research spectrum as recommended by the 2013 CTSA Institute of Medicine Report . One example is the UR-CTSI -funded Incubator Project entitled, \"Mechanisms of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes -induced Musculoskeletal Comorbidities .\" This study addresses a community -identified research priority , and was inspired by discussion at a community -CTSI Healthy Weight Research Roundtable. This Roundtable brought together 60 investigators (from multiple basic science and clinical departments) and community repres entatives , and contributed to the development of an ongoing transdisciplinary Healthy Weight Research team. Although communication strategies for research recruitment and retention are specifically addressed in other sections of this proposal (e.g., OPENDOOR, Network Capacity Core ), several were originally developed by our CE group with contributions of the commu nity and clinicians to developing effective, culturally appropriate strategies for recruiting and retaining res earch participants. In conjunction with the Recruitment Unit, CE consultations include advising on culturally competent, population -specific recruitment and retention strategies. Further, w e have successfully integrated CE training throughout the URMC with many educational opportuniti es for students, faculty/staff, and community members in population health, the social determinants of health, cultural competency and community -engaged and participatory research. ( Table C1 ) Over the past five years , we have collaborated with other CTSA hubs on CE activities. The URMC was one of five collaborating CTSAs on two Washington University Sentinel Network5 projects. We led a multi- CTSA project known as the Institutional CE Self-Assessment Project (ICESA) . The ICESA project, which includes 8 CTSA hubs, test ed a 2- phase process3,6 for ass essing CE in academic centers. Currently collaborating on a manuscript and strategies for dissemination, we recently agreed to partner on a Medical College of Wisconsin- led XO2 pre- application related to social network analysis appli ed to CE . C.1.2 . INNOVATION AND APPROACH With the goal of health improvement for the population of our entire region and building on existing structures and programs, we seek to broaden and deepen our collaborations and integrate our knowledge of team science and collaboration into our partnerships. While previously, much of our focus has been on underrepresented groups such as our African American and Latino inner city, populations, we will now broaden our focus to other special populations, collaborating with the Hub Research Capacity Core to integrate special populations including patient groups, disability groups, all age groups, and rural populations. We will also develop specific programs to ensure that the engagements are deeper and result in novel community and stakeholder engaged research across the translational research spectrum. We will revise our current consultations, making them more formal and structured; further, we will develop an education program for Table C1 . CE Education Opportunities supported or sponsored by CTSI Course Learners / Students Community Health Improvement Course 4th Year Medical Students Mastering Medical Information - Problem Based Population Health Required for all 1st Year Medical Students Addressing Disparities in Health Care (full day seminar) Required, all 1st Y.

We will also deepen our dialogue with our community by including additional methodologic information in our existing education series , and we will work with the CTSA network to apply metrics to assess the value of CE. Finally, we will continue to study the impact of research on community health improvement. C.1.2.1 Sub-Aim 1.a: Engage community stakeholders (including disease advocacy groups, local business, special populati ons, community based organizations, business) more deeply in specific research projects to advance the science of community engaged research. 1) We will a dapt Meharry - Vanderbilt's Community Engagement Studio7 model to expand and formaliz e our existing consultation processes , and deepen and broaden comm unity stakeholder involvement. The CE Studio is a structured program that facilitates project -specific input from community and patient stakeholders to enhance r esearch design, implementation, and dissemination. Based on this model, CE Consultation will be integrated into the Research Methods Forum (see Research Methods Core) t o increase, broaden (to additional partners) and intensify our existing research consul tation activities. (See Letter of S upport , Bernard) 2) We will r eplicate our successful topic -specific, community -URMC Healthy Weight Research Roundtable model to address other community -identified research priorities and other stakeholder groups. Through these two activities, we hope to increase the number , and improve the quality , of community engaged research studies that address community priorities. C.1.2.2 Sub-Aim 1.b: Increase capacity to conduct community -based participatory research and community- engaged research across the full spectrum of translational research. Develop a CE Training and Pilot Awards Program , adapted from the Columbia University model that provides training to investigators, research staff and community members in teams who then compete for pilot research funding. (See Letter of Support , Ginsberg ) The training will be co- led by research (Amina Alio, PhD) and community faculty (TBN) with a focus on CE and team science. It will be evaluated by its success in generating multidisciplinary, community and stakeholder engaged research teams with competitive pilot applications , and through participant satisfaction. C.1.2.3 Sub-Aim 1.c: Build on existing educational opportunities for researchers/staff, health professions students, and increase opportunities for community members to learn about research. Educational opportunities that are currently offered (Table C1) will be continued. GotHealth will be expanded to additional community sites with a strengthened focus on the impac t and conduct of research (in collaboration with the Network Capacity Core). Special attention will be given to dissemination of research results (in concert with the Hub Research Capacity Core). This activity will be measured by participant number s and satisfaction. C.1.2.4 Sub-Aim 1.d: Lead CTSA network activities to measure the value of community engagement . Dr. Bennett is a member of the Lead Team of the Collaboration and Engagement Domain Task Force and the Lead Team liaison to the Measures for Assessing and Improving Collaborations Work Group. Ms. Newton, UR-CTSI CE Lead, coordinated the ICESA project described above. We will continue to build upon and expand this work, and participate in efforts to standardize measures including the CTSA Program Common Metrics . C.1.2.5 Sub-Aim 1.e: Document relationship between CTSI activities and community health improvement. We will actively measure the health of the local population and correlate changes with research impacts. The long term outcome of our work is community health improvement. We will use our previously published model to track the impact of research .3 We will work closely with our public health colleagues and the Informatics Core to identify and analyze community health data. These data are used by the CAC to establish research priorities. Dr. Holt will focus on the collection and analysis of population data and coordinate with the Informat ics Core . C.2 Aim 2: Collaboration and Multi -Disciplinary Team Science: To enhance the research environment that supports transdisciplinary science by training a research workforce that can easily adopt the best practices of team science, and ensure an institutional environment that supports team science. C.2.1 BACKGROUND AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Over the past two decades , interest and investments in large- scale multidisciplinary team science (MTS) programs in Rochester and the US have grown dramatically. This is evidenced by the steep growth in the number of cross -disciplinary publications, journals and RFPs released by public agencies and private foundations, as well as overall research collaborations. At the UR-CTSI, we believe that the MTS approach is an essential tool supporting the Research Methods and Network Capacity Core s to promote innovation and improve efficiency of research collaborations and training. E ffective MTS leaders hip and engaged followers hip are also core competencies of the CTSI workforce training and career development programs, and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) team in the Research Methods Forum . The mission of the Collaboration and MTS Group is to foster an environment that promotes and accelerates scientific innovation by creating productive transdisciplinary alliances thus equipping investigators at all levels of expertise with skills and resources to effectively communicate with partners outside of their own area of expertise; this includ es academic , government , community , and industry partners . In the past 10 years, UR - CTSI efforts gave rise to a wide spectrum of pioneering initiatives, pr ograms and interventions that reach across all UR- CTSI Components . Some examples are outlined below. 1. In 2012, the CTSI helped launch the Surgical Health Outcom es & Research Enterprise (SHORE ) built on the synergy among healthcare quality improvement, healthcare innovation, and medical education.8-12 2. Our MTS experts were instrumental in development of the Healthy Weight Research Ini tiative and Roundtable, which brought to gether 60 investigators from multiple departments and community stakeholders to discuss transdisciplinary projects addressing healthy weight and obesity. 3. The MTS Group works closely with other community and educational initiatives to design faculty mento rship training. The Population Health Interest Group successfully advocated for revision of the facult y tenure and promotion guidelines to recognize and reward CE and team -based productivit y. (See Letter of Support, Lyness ) AAMC highlighted this accomplish ment as a model innovation. 4. UNYTE was created to assist faculty and trainees from 18 New York State biomedical research institutions to enhanc e the quality and quantity of translational research in the Upstate New York region, and improv e access to expertise, technologies, services , and curricula shared among institutions, foster ing collaborative research, reducing resource duplication, and enhancing bidirectional transfer of information between basic and clinical investigators. We have awarded UR -CTSI Pilot Awards to five UNYTE multi- institutional, collaborative teams, which have resulted in twelve publications13-24and two additional awards from foundations . UNYTE hosts regional Scienti fic Sessions, attracting MTS researchers , on specific topic s (e.g., Neurology, Informatics, and Population Health) . 5. The Greater Rochester Practice- Based Research Network (GR -PBRN)4, established in 2007 , includes 85 member practices from primary care specialties (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, g eriatrics, medicine, and pediatrics ), and all local health systems (URMC, Rochester Regional Health System, and federally -qualified health clinics). GR -PBRN member clinicians provide medical care to approximately 45% of adults and more than 80% of children in Monroe County. Sixty -two of our 85 member practices have partnered on research projects ( n=176, Table C2). The GR -PBRN is overseen by a 13- member Community Clinician Steering Committee (CCSC) , who consult s with investigators on protocol efficiency, clinical integration, patient recruitment and retention, study design, and other issues . Our goal is to increase the percentage of consultations that occur early, prior to funding applications. (Figure C1 ) C2.2 INNOVATION AND APPROACH Our novel approach to fostering institutional c ollaborations and MTS is based on identifying and training a cadre of internal MTS practitioners and leaders within each department and research center who will then serve as members of teams, rather than relying on infrequent consultations with external MTS experts. We will mentor and train these MTS facilitators who are familiar with the unique research culture of each team and have established str ong connections within their department and centers . Furthermore, our proposed approach to facilitate institutional culture suppor tive of MTS will incorporate the best evidence from behavioral modification theory, behavioral economics and complex adaptive system theory to encourage new desirable behaviors - transdisciplinary collaboration and MTS . 25-30 The specific aims, goals and approaches for the next funding period have been formulated to address system - wide barriers to MTS that were identified by ongoing UR -CTSI evaluations as well as systematic problems reported by other CTSA hubs : common misunderstanding of MTS goals among faculty and academic Table C2. GR-PBRN Consultations by Research Development Stage Years GR -PBRN Process leadership; substantial discomfort on the part of individual investigators and cultural resistance to multi - disciplinary team -based initiatives; financial and organizational disincentives for formation of cross -disciplinary collaborations; and shortages of individuals with specific training and expertise necessary for mentorship of efficient multidisciplinary teams .31-33 C.2.2.1 Sub-Aim 2.a: Further institutional culture change. To lead institutional culture change to support MTS across all research programs and workforce development initiatives, the MTS expert team will meet with each Department C hair, Center Director and research team PI, to assess their needs and potential to benefit from the MTS approach. For programs where MTS is a good fit, the Chair /PI will nominate a MTS practitioner who can choose from a wide variety of MTS training opportunities (C.2.2.2 ) from the beginner level (practitioner) to teacher to expert . As the number of MTS practitioners grows and their expertise expands, we will aim for each Department and Center to identify a departmental MTS trainer . These MTS trainers will be mentored by the MTS Expert Team while serving as the key MTS point of expertise within their organizations. MTS leadership will meet with the key institutional financial and academic officers to discuss evidence- based approaches to ignite academic productivity and MTS by using financial incentives (e.g., equitable way s for collaborators from different departments to share indirect recovery benefits ), peer recognition (e.g., consistent use of tenure and promotion guidelines to recognize MTS ) and other incentives . We will create an online registry of MTS activities and available positions/expertise sought (\"MTS H ub\") to best MTS strategies opportunities . C.2.2.2 Sub-Aim 2.b: Increase opportunities for experiential learning and guided practice in MTS ( see BERD Research Methods Forum) . We will provide on- line modules, mentoring , small group discussions, experiential and didactic, hands -on, guided training in team science practices for all levels of in vestigators, students and staff . We will participate in introductory team meetings with the Research Enga gement Specialist ( Administration Core) to ensure that composition of each multi -disciplinary research team reflects goals and project needs , and identify MTS practitioners, trainers and experts . with UNYTE member and recent CTSA awardee, the University of Buffalo . Our MTS Team will expand on the success of earlier Scientific Sessions, which have attracted more than 80 participants each, by holding two yearly Scientific Sessions , bringing together multidisciplinary UNYTE researc hers focused on specific topics . Through programmatic follow up, we will identify and support new collaborations . C.2.2.4 Sub-Aim 2.d: Strategically expand the number of GR -PBRN member practices and create formal mechanisms to increase research deriving from clinician interests. Expand the GR -PBRN focusing on three priorities: geriatric practices, practices in the newly -merged Rochester Regional Heal th System, a nd rural practices in the surrounding region. W e will increase the number of projects addressing the research questions identified by primary care clinicians. Specific activities will be incorporated into the regular meetings of the Community Clinician St eering Committee (CCSC) to elicit clinician research ideas and to link clinicians to relevant researchers. Adam Tatro, MS, RN, the CTSI Clinical Research Informaticist, will attend CCSC meetings when proposed research studies involve changes or utilization of the electronic medical record or patient por tal, thereby ensuring early engagement and coordination between the health care delivery system and the translational research enterprise demonstrating the \"learning healthcare system.\" We will continue to engage clinicians earlier (Figure C1) in the research process for protocol consultations to increase the feasibility of research studies in primary care settings . C.3 CORE LEADERSHIP AND KEY TEAM MEMBERS: We wil l integrate CE and MTS into a single Core led by Dr. Nancy M. Bennett , MD, MS.

TRANSLATIONAL ENDEAVORS - SPECIFIC AIMS The Translational Endeavors Core will oversee Workforce Training and the Pilot Translational and Clini cal Studies Programs. These functions are designed to develop workforce autonomy, and to develop individual autonomy and begin the path to a sustainable research program. Workforce Training Program: In concert with CTSA Network partners, we will develop, implement and evaluat e core competency -based clinical and translational workforce training for faculty, staff and community members as well as non- degree trainees. Such training will strive to transcend degrees and work roles, and focus on competencies across the translational spectrum. Training will include in person, re mote synchronous and a- synchronous , platforms for learning, with standardized assessments for achieving competency. M ulti- and trans -disciplinary training will utilize diverse instructors (and learners) from ac ademia, industry, research foundations and the community. Pilot Translational and Clinical Studies Program (PTC): Since its inception, our CTSI has had a robust PTC , which has continually expanded and evolved. The PTC uses multiple funding mechanisms to foster collaborative translational research on topics from molecules to populations, and to catalyze translation of discoveries to treatments. The primary goal of our PTC program is to provide seed funding for highly innovative translational and clinical research that addresses translational research questions and provides insights generalizable to other projects. During the next 5 years, we will oversee 15 currently independent URMC pilot programs, assuring high quality review and monitor ing outcomes. W e will also continue to work within the CTSA network to lead development of national standards and metrics for success of pilot programs. Aim 1: To train the next generation of translational science workforce leaders in the collaborative, technical, and regulatory skills necessary to accelerate the translation of high -impact research discoveries to clinical applications that improve populat ion health. Our specific actions will include: a. Innovative workforce training and support across the transdisciplinary research and implementation spectrum . We will expand our extensive educational activities with new multi- modal educational content. New programs will focus on several key areas, including: m entoring for team science, career development and workforce diversity . New courses in regulatory science dealing with the challenges of therapeutic development and regulatory requirements in precision medicine will be introduced, along with initiatives in network analysis in population research across the lifespan. b. Expand our competency -based evaluation programs with a focus on translational research team science, integrative informatics for translational research, research regulatory and implementation sciences. We will accomplish this through new curriculum development in these areas, including development of innovative tools for the translational research community. c. Extend our national collaborations with the CTSA consortium to develop and disseminate integrated and innovative training modules and metrics for national workforce competence. Aim 2: To accelerate translational research through a comprehensive Pilot Translational and Clinical Studies Program. Our specific actions will include: a. Provide seed funding for highly innovative translational and clinical research that: 1) addresses translational res earch questions, and 2) provide insights that could be generalizable to other projects . In so doing, we hope to build multidisciplinary research teams, and promote the next generation of independent investigators and national leaders in biomedical research. This will be accomplished by the current PTC administrative team and CTSI faculty using: 1) RFA solicitations, 2) grant review by a multi -disciplinary committee patterned after an NIH study section to ensure pilot projects are of high methodological quality and answer important scientific questions, 3) pilot funding, and 4) a proven progress reporting structure developed during the prior funding period. b. Work within the URMC and the CTSA network to develop and implement CTSA review standards and participate in reciprocal reviews with other CTSA consortium members. The UR -CTSI leadership will continue to work through leadership positions within URMC and the CTSA Consortium . c. Unify CTSI and URMC pilot funding programs. The PTC leadership will establish a single CTSI PTC system that hosts 15 independent University of Rochester pilot grant programs in biomedical research. We will orchestrate a synchronized RFA solicitation including electronic receipt of applications, management of conflicts for grant reviews, collect ion of priority scores with written critiques, and infrastructure for short and long-term progress reporting. CORE D. TRANSLATIONAL ENDEAVORS - RESEARCH STRATEGY A fundamental role of CTSA hubs is to develop and maintain a diverse translational workforce capable of efficiently and effectively advancing scientific discoveries into interventions that improve the health of patients and populations. Our first Aim describes how we plan to ex pand our capacity to meet this objective in the next phase of the University of Rochester Translational Science Workforce Development program. Training must be complemented with opportunity to develop pilot, exploratory and preliminary research into sustainable and innovative research programs. To this end, our second Aim describes how we will take the lead at the URMC in integrating pilot research programs across the Medical Center by expanding the framework of our highly successful CTSI Pilot and Incuba tor Award Program. D.1 AIM 1: To train the next generation of translational science workforce leaders in the collaborative, technical, and regulatory skills necessary to accelerate the translation of high -impact research discoveries to clinical applications that improve population health. D.1.1 Background and Accomplishments : The University of Rochester (UR) has a number of well - established workforce development programs (Table D1), as well as several popular, well - established pipeli ne programs to expose high school and college students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to medical science and research. For example, University -sponsored activities are available through all high school science classes in the Rochester City school district and 75% of UR undergraduate students do some type of research. In addition, the Univers ity offers Master's degree programs in public health, clinical investigation, health services research and policy, medical technology innovation, dental science, medical statistics, entrepreneurship, and health professions education . There are also advanced certificate programs in analytic epidemiology, clinical research methods, trial -based clinical research, health services research, public health, and biomedical data science (See Table A 3 in Overall section) . UR also has a large number of PhD programs re levant to translational science. Aiding the CTSI efforts are The University of Rochester's Warner School of Education, which has a rich tradition of applying research to practice and developing highly trained educational workforce practitioners. It is home to the Center for Professional Development and Education Reform , which is dedicated to fostering and supporting research- based innovative professional practice in applied, real -world settings. During the proposed grant period, we will actively work with developers from the Warner School to upgrade UR- CTSI workforce education programs . The UR-CTSI led and participated in several collaborative efforts focused on training and education, including the development of Regulatory Science competencies , 1 serving in a leadership role in the NCATS -funded supplement \"Enhancing Clinical Research Professionals' Training and Competencies\" (see Letters of Support, Barohn and S hanley) , and the medical device and drug development component of the CTSA other specialized competencies project. In these endeavors we worked in partnership with other CTSA hubs, the FDA funded Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSIs), NIH, FDA, the PhRMA Foundation and other organizations and companies. Regionally , in partnership with the Univers ity of Maryland CERSI, our CTSI launched an \"America's Got Regulatory Science Talent Competition\" to increase awareness and student interest in Regulatory Science at which winners presen ted their ideas to the FDA Chief Scientist and other FDA scientists. E xperiential training opportunities with internal and external partners including industry, the FDA, non- government organizations, and within the UR- CTSI have also been established in partnership with the University of Rochester Broadening Experiences in Sc ientific Training (UR- BEST) program. An important common need for all research training and education programs is a pool of qualified mentors. The CTSI Mentor Development Working group has provided training, support and evaluation to TL1 and KL2 programs since 2007 2 to assure that all mentors are qualified. Our successful hybrid online- face to face mentor training is now available to the entire URMC faculty, whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9s include students (ranging from high school students to PhD candidates ) and other faculty and staff. A recent Long- Term Master Mentors program expands upon our early UR- CTSI training program to include material from our own multicenter Table D1. UR CTSI Workforce Development Programs High School Programs Bridges to the Doctorate - deaf pre -doc preparation Online Training Modules (Comparative effectiveness, regulatory science, community -based research) New certificate programs (Translational Science, Informatics, Population Health, Regulatory Science , PhD Program in Translational Biomedical Science Burroughs -Welcome Program in Immunity: From Molecules to Populations CTSI KL2 Career Development Programs Rochester Partnership for Research and Academic Career Training of Deaf Postdoc toral Scholars (K12) Junior Faculty Mentoring Program UR Master Mentors Program UR Center for Professional Development UR B roadening Experiences in Scientific Training p rogram for doctoral students randomized trial of 150 mentors and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s .2 This study showed that m entor training , when combined with peer mentoring , increased the likelihood that career planning would be discussed, and that the overall mentor -prot\u00e9g\u00e9 experience would be rated better than the control group. The qualitative and quantitative mentor eval uation processes used by the Mentor Development Working Group include widely accepted broad mentor competencies3 and address a range of relevant topics (research, career planning, teaching, etc.) in ways that are useful to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.2 D.1.2 Significance and Innovation: Our approach to Workforce Development over the propos ed funding period contains several innovate components, focused on providing education, support, and competency based evaluation. In addition to updating our existing programs, we will introduce new programs using online and hybrid learning approaches. To this end, we will add two Educational Course Designers with experience in creating online courses in collaboration with senior faculty , and leverage our existing web -based learning resources at the UR. We will continue our extensive contributions in translational research training, with competency -based evaluation metric development, and disseminate these throughout the NCATS Consortium. Innovative aspects of our approach include the following: An integrated approach to online and hybrid Learning across the entire translational workforce spectrum using online modules, Cou rsera -based courses, and massive open online courses (MOOCs) . Highly novel programs to prepare competent translational workforce members for in the following emerging translational research areas: integrative informatics for EMR -based research, network science (see Optional Function H1: Translational Network Science) in population health, fundamentals of team science, implementation science, and regulatory science issues in precision medicine (see Optional Function H2: Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine). Inclusion of community, high school and college l earning modules D.1.3 Approach D.1.3.1 Sub- Aim 1.a: To provide innovative workforce training and support across the transdisciplinary research and implementation spectrum . Figure D1. To accomplish this sub-aim, we will utilize the full range of educational methods currently available, including traditional instructional methods, online learning, short courses and other intensive learning experiences, and experiential training such as the engaged followership component of our KL2 program proposal. For example, we recently instituted an online course in grantsmanship designed to provide learners with the background skills and knowledge needed to effectively and efficiently assemble a research team and write a c ompetitive grant application. The course is completely online, easily shared with other CTSA hubs, and free from scheduling constraints to allow for engagement of busy working professionals. We will use similar approaches to expand access to our existing w orkforce development programs and extend experiential training opportunities in translational and regulatory sciences with NIH, FDA, PhRMA Foundation, industry and other CTSA hubs. The new online training modules proposed for the Biostatistics, Epidemiolog y and Research Design function of the Research Methods Core is an example of how will proceed. Mentor education and training will be adapted to sharpen the focus on workforce readiness for a range of prot\u00e9g\u00e9s . We will improve materials already in use, such as the online course in the creation of easily accessible and trackable individual development plan templates . These modalities are already being rolled out across the UR translational science Figure D1. Workforce Development Methods programs. The Mentor Development Working Group will support new and existing peer mentor groups by making available the types of support us ed in our CTSA mentoring program2 (e.g. mentor training via a hybrid online course). This approach was found to be sustainable, highly acceptable to mentors, and effective. We also will continue a number of successful programs developed and refined over our ten-year UR-CTSI history. One such program is our Junior Faculty Academic Core Curriculum, which provides a one- week, intensive introduction to translational research principles. Ronnie Guillet, MD PhD is the program coordinator. In addition, we will continue support for the Mentor Development Working Group, described above, led by Vivian Lewis, MD. We will also continue to present our popular seminar series, hel d once each week throughout the academic year, with each semester devoted to a theme in translational science (such as the Regulatory Science series, currently underway, described in the Research Methods core). The CTSI will also continue support for the P hD program in Translational Biomedical Science and its Program Director P. J. Simpson- Haidaris, PhD. Finally, we continue to support TL1 training program leadership, specifically Core Director Tim Dye, PhD; postdoctoral program director Deborah Ossip, PhD; Academic Research Track program director Robert Gross, MD PhD; and Medical Scientist Training Program director M. Kerry O'Banion, MD PhD. Successful translation of high- impact research discoveries to clinical applications that improve population health requires workforce development programs that are meaningful and accessible to the entire translational workforce. A key aspect of this is the ability to evaluate competency using standardized metrics such that competency attained at one CTSA hub meets the standard in place across the CTSA Network. To this end, we will develop translational research competency evaluation tools across the UR -CTSI programs. We will engage the Warner School of Education, other CTSA hubs, other academic institutions, and indus try to extend our educational programs to be competency -based, tailored, interactive, and emphasize the collaborative nature of translational and clinical research. We will work with UR Center for Experiential Learning to design web-based competency assess ment tools, and continue to actively incorporate NCATS assessment tools into the UR -CTSI offerings. We will also add new curricular elements to support the development of skills essential for successful team -based translational research , including creativ ity, brainstorming/concept mapping, group interaction tools, systems thinking, knowledge management, and implementation and dissemination research. These activities will include the development of new courses in translational network science (see Translati onal Network Science Optional Core section) and implementation and dissemination research. In addition, we will offer c ompetency -based curricular elements based on existing standards when possible and include cultural competency, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for personnel engaged in NIH defined clinical trials, and the newly defined Regulatory Science competencies. An im portant part of providing workforce training and support across the transdisciplinary research and practice spectrum is engaging members of the translational science workforce who have not been traditionally seen as members of the clinical research enterpr ise: students, practicing clinicians, and community members. This effort address both workforce development and team science. Working in close collaboration with the existing URMC research and research training infrastructure, our practice- based research network, the Center for Community Health, and members of our community advisory panels, we will create new opportunities for non - engaged workforce members to learn about translational science and how they can benefit by participating in the process via online learning, as well as community based education events . These efforts to expand the workforce will be guided by the experience of the Warner School of Education Center for Professional Development and Education Reform. D.1.3.2 Sub- Aim 1.b: Expand our competency- based evaluation programs with a focus on team science, integrative informatics, network, research regulatory and implementation sciences. Specific programs to introduce translational research will be expanded for basic science PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, clinical practitioners, public health workers, local media, and community members. The process will include new MOOCs dedicated to translational and regulatory science, podcasts, interactive online training materials, as wel l as more traditional face-to-face workshops, seminars, formal coursework, and mentoring. For example, utilizing existing University of Rochester participation in Coursera, we will create new open online modules that will serve as introductory primers on t ranslational science, network science (see Optional Function H1) and regulatory science (see Optional Function H2). To help individuals not enrolled in structured degree programs efficiently access our workforce development resources, we will develop an online guide to translational science training to help learners identify and select learning activities provided locally and through collaboration with other CTSA hubs and training partners , enabling them to access appropriate learning opportunities . Educational offerings will include a new Regulatory Science curriculum, utilizing the recently developed competencies to map available courses from several CTSA hubs and CERSIs , a collaborating with other CTSA hubs to identify and develop mechanisms to sha re relevant courses, case studies and educational materials. This will complement our Network Science and Precision Medicine Optional. We will also look for similar , functioning opportunities to share educational resources with other CTSA hubs. To begin t his process, the CTSI (in partnership with the Department of Public Health Sciences) has proposed a new Regulatory Science certificate of advanced study, utilizing the Regulatory Science Competencies. Building on the proposed Certificate , and collaborating with the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT) existing MS in Regulatory Science, we will develop complimentary on- line course offerings and case studies to support distance learning for trainees at bot h institutions. Based on mapping existing courses (UR course catalog) and core strengths at our two institutions, we will create on- line versions of Pathways to Medi cal Innovation (BME 431 and 432) and Fundamentals of Science, Technology and Health Policy (PM 494); ITMAT will share online courses in Clinical Study Management (REG 611) and Introduction to Drug Development (REG 612) . These offerings will be stored with the CTSA Consortium via web. D.1.3.3 Sub- Aim 1.c: Extend our national collaborations with the CTSA consortium to develop and disseminate integrated and innovative training modules and metrics for national workforce competence To meet the CTSA goal of advancing innovation in education and training programs, we will work with the Warner School to develop an ongoing effort to assess the effectiveness of our programs using comparative education research methods. Eric Fredericksen, Associate Vice President for Online Learning & Associate Professor in Educational Leadership at the University of Roches ter is actively engaged in the workforce development process. 4 He will coordinate efforts to engage Warner School resources and expertise. In addition, specific educational research proposals will be included in our pilot studies offerings as described below . D.2 AIM 2: To accelerate translational research through a comprehensive Pilot Translational and Clinical Studies (PTC) Program D.2.1 Background: A critical component of the CTSI since its inception has been a robust Pilot Translational and Clinical Studies Program (PTC), which has continually expanded and evolved from its initial focus on novel methodologies , to its current form that utilizes mult iple funding mechanisms to foster collaborative translational and clinical research on topics from molecules to populations to catalyze translation of discoveries to treatments. The primary goals of the PTC program are to provide seed funding for highly innovative translational and clinical research that: 1) addresses translational research questions, and 2) provide insights that are generalizable to other projects. During the past 5 years, the PTC awarded $2,487,397 , which was divided into seven distinct programs (Table D2). Collectively, these awards demonstrated a 5.5 -fold return on investment (ROI), including $13,617,350 in extramural funding, 87 primary research articles, and 5 patent applications. This exceptional productivity lead to the promotion of 4 junior faculty members who are now established investigators . The PTC has highly cost -effective administration that: 1) solicits applications via its broad CTSI network, 2) provides written critiques for all applications by appropriate experts, and 3) tracks the short and long -term output of funded pilots. Based on this exceptional track record, the URMC senior leadership has assigned the administrative review, award, and follow -up of several inst itutionally -funded pilot studies and bridge funding programs to the CTSI PTC. Several NIH -funded P -awards with pilot studies have also chosen to utilize the CTSI for this purpose. During the next award period, this consolidation will create additional efficiencies by synchronizing all tr anslational and clinical research pilot funding into a unified calendar cycle, freeing applicants to spend more time on productive research. Furthermore, the CTSI plans to adopt emerging CTSA review standards, and participate in reciprocal review support t o exchange expertise between hubs, which will improve the review and administration of both the CTSA -funded PTC and the other programs that will now be administered through the CTSI. Results will be tracked and analyzed for process improvement. D.2.2 Innov ation: Evidence of clinical and translational science research with great impact from molecules to populations. Although the CTSI runs a disease agnostic PTC, the following vignette, focused on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) research, is provided to illustrate the highly leveraged synergies between our programs , which are producing the next generation of national leaders with sustainable research programs and have great impact on US healthcare from molecules to populations. RA is a destructive inflammatory j oint disease characterized by intermittent periods of clinical quiescence and enigmatic \"flare.\" The UR -CTSI training and PTC programs were instrumental in fostering a multidisciplinary translational research program to test the Table D2 . Pilot & Translational Clinical Studies Program publications 2011 - 2014 Program n Incubator Program 5 CTSI Investigator Pilots 20 UNYTE Pilot Grants 5 Trainee Grants 7 Biostatistics Methodologies 13 Laboratory Support 5 Clinical Trial Designs 2 Total 87 hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF), B cells and lymphatics converge to trigger arthritic. These studies resulted in sever al published discoveries5-24 and new NIH grant support. This journey began with the thesis resear ch of a T32-funded PhD student in Biomedical Engineering .5 His findings were advanced by several PhD trainees , including an African- American MD/PhD student (Kofi Mensah) funded by the CTSI TL1 grant who is now completing his Rheumatology Fellowship at Yal e. Dr. Mensah discovered the role of interferon in non- erosive inflammatory arthritis.12 Other major breakthroughs in t his program were the development of near infrared -indocyanine green (NIR -ICG)13 and power Doppler -ultrasound (PD -US)18,25 imaging of lymphatics in mice, which are now being used as clinical outcomes measures in RA patients. Further laboratory studies were supported by a CTSI PTC Incubator Pilot. Two newly recruited clinician- scientists also participated in this research: Dr. Wakenda Tyler, a Native American orthopaedic . Being mentored by the RA investigators, Dr. Tyler was familiar with the above work , and recognized that a patient referred to her for evaluation of a synovial sarcoma was actually suf fering from early RA flare. Moreover, Dr. Tyler was aware of an open clinical trial \"The Effect of Certolizumab on Lower Extremity Lymph Flow in Rheumatoid Arthritis\" NCT01098201, and used resources from the CTSI -funded Incubator to enroll the patient into the study. Dr. Rahimi retrieved the CE -MRI data, and performed 3D rendering analyses of synovial and PLN volume on this patient, and 9 other subjects in this clinical trial, and submitted her 1 st author paper. In parallel, collaborations fostered by the Incubator and CTSI Laboratory Support also facilitated referral of RA patients with end- stage knee arthritis for enrollment into Dr. Edward Schwarz's clinical pilot study \"Elucidating the Mechanisms of Arthritic Flare and Developing Treatments,\" which is funded by NIH P01 AI078907. The results from these PCT- funded studies were featured in four newly funded ( NIH grant awards to members of the transdisciplinary research team . In summary, this example of the highly interactive and efficient Core s in the CTSI demonstrates how we intend to continue our PTC Program and: 1) educate and train young professionals, 2) publish high- impact innovative discoveries, and 3) translate these findings into sustainably funded programs to improve the health of our patients. D.2.3 Approach D.2.3.1 Sub- Aim 2.a: To provide seed funding for highly innovative translational and clinical research. Based on its proven track record, the CTSI will continue its PTC for highly innovative translational and clinical research for the eight distinct programs: 1) Incubator Program, 2) Investigator Pilots, 3) Upstate New York Translational Research Network ( UNYTE ) Pilot Grants, 4) Trainee Grants, 5) Novel Methods, 6) Laboratory Support, 7) Clinical Trial Designs and 8) Community Engagement Training and Pilot Program . This will continue to be a yearlong process that commences with RFAs for each released in Augu st. The initial step will be a 1-page pre -proposal online submission due in early September designed to: 1) identify responsive proposals with a high likelihood of success (we will aim for a 30% payline to reduce applicant and reviewer burden), 2) provide appropriate feedback to uninvited applicants, and initial feedback to invited applicants so they can strengthen their full proposals, and 3) inform the PTC Directors and staff of the reviewer expertise needed for the Study Section. Invited full proposal will be due online by late November. Each application will be distributed to 3 reviewers, who will provide an online review including overall impact score based on the 1 -9 NIH scoring system, and written feedback on strengths and weaknesses . The NIH styl e study sections for each category will meet ( from January to the end of February ) to discuss each application, produce a summary of discussion for each application, and provide a CTSI Executive Committee report, which will include a rank ed order of the applications. Based on expected funding ($200K CTSI and $600K annual institutional support and donor directed pilot funding) the CTSI Executive Committee will make final funding decisions. Finally, PTC directors and staff will produce letter s to the applicants that include the funding decision and the Study Section Critique. For applicants approved for funding, the notice of award clearly will stipulate that: 1) funding is contingent on the non -competitive renewal of the UR-CTSI , appropriate human subject (IRB) and vertebrat e animal (IACUC) approvals, 2) semi -annual progress reports due in December and June, and 3) all peer reviewed publications that result from this PCT funding acknowledg ing the CTSA and being PMCID compliant. The PCT directors will review all progress reports; and data on publications, extramural funding, patents and promotions will be collected to quantify the return on investments of the PCT Program. D.2.3.2 Sub- Aim 2.b: Work within the URMC and the CTSA network to develop and implement CTSA review standards. Although the CTSI has maintained a \"home grown,\" robust and highly successful PCT with a 10- year proven track record, we will be responsive to NCATS initiatives for the CTSA network and the implementation of national standards that will allow for reciprocal reviews to enable best expertise in the country to be utilized for each PCT review . Indeed, the CTSI has already implemented inter -CTSA PCT application reviews for two of its pro grams. For the last three years , we utilized reciprocal reviews of our Biostatistics Methodologies with the CTSA -funded Center for Clinical & Translational Science & Training (CCTST) program in Cincinnati, OH. We note however that the remarkable success of this mutually beneficial collaboration, which we will continue throughout the next funding cycle, is due in large part to the highly focused research topics of the applications . D.2.3.3 Sub- Aim 2.c: Unify CTSI and URMC pilot funding programs. The PTC leadership will establish a single CTSI Pilot Program Review and Administration program, with a central website that hosts all of the independent University of Rochester pilot grant programs in biomedical research. Currently there are fifteen programs within the URMC, with submission, review and funding cycles occurring throughout the year . This inefficiency results in applicant and reviewer fatigue, a disorganized reporting structure, and sometimes review of the same application submitted to mul tiple Pilots, and disorganized accountability of funded institutional research. To address this problem, the PCT directors and staff will also orchestrate a synchronized RFA solicitation, electronic receipt of applications, manage conflicts for grant reviews, collect priority scores with written critiques, and provide infrastructure for short and long -term pr ogress reporting. Since the different pilot mechanism s must comply with their fiscal budgets that may be different from the July to June CTSI Pilot cycle, we will implement a January to December RFA to funding cycle, which should accommodate all Pilot Pro grams at the University of Rochester.

RESEARCH METHODS - SPECIFIC AIMS The Research Methods Core will provide support to UR- CTSI investigators in two areas: (1) Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) for support of clinical research design and analysis, including educational programs and novel method development and (2) Regulatory Knowledge and Support (RKS), which will provide investigator support and institutional knowledge to assist investigators in complying with IRB policies, State laws, and Federal regulations. These Core Functions are foundational strengths of the UR- CTSI , and during the proposed period, we will extend their reach by developing enduring materials (such as online documents, webcasts, and courses), and via access to live, sustained, multi - disciplinary consultations. Directly interacting with well- trained colleagues who have diverse competencies is critical across the spectrum of professional development. This need exists for faculty, staff and community members who all play central roles in the research process. To this end, the UR-CTSI provides a single, convenient and central access point for investigators and teams to access both BERD and RKS support. Through th e Research Request Dashboard (RRD) , we will connect researcher to available resources and manage requests for assistance, and provide on- demand Research Help, including connection to applicable regulatory expertise. Our goal in this Core is to create a mechanism by which all available expertise in these areas is accessible and inter operable- both locally and within the CTSA Consortium . The overall objective of the BERD group is to provide support and a central source for technical collaboration to translational investigators for appropriate study design, interim and final data analy sis, as well as development of novel statistical and analytic methods for clinical and translational science research. We accomplish this goal through collaborative interactions, by education in appropriate techniques and methods, and by the development o f novel research methodologies. In conjunction with the Community and Collaboration Core, the BERD group will also assist investigators in developing new collaborations, facilitating a team's ability to efficiently generate valid empirical evidence in the pursuit of improved health care and primary prevention. The overall objective of the UR- CTSI Regulatory Knowledge and Support (RKS) team is to provide and enhance foundational regulatory training through both online and in -person approaches, ensuring guidance and support to researchers for proper data and safety monitoring, timely reporting of adverse events and compliance with governing regulation . The RKS team provides education and training regarding such standards through courses, certificate programs, and online training modules to orient researchers to the requirements of FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) and Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) applications. Collaborating with partners at other CTSA hubs, RKS has made the content of these training modules available via a web- hosted sharing mechanism. RKS staff also provides tailored education and training upon request through collaboration with research teams, through regulatory -content modules, a range of education programs and through courses specific to FDA regulatory requirements and processes. We will build on our strong track record in these areas (national BERD leadership, and leading efforts on regulatory science competency training) to strengthen and advance these capabilities locally and within the CTSA Consortium . Under the guidance of a Cor e Director we will achieve the following Specific Aims : Aim 1: To provide novel means of initially accessing the diverse skill sets required for clinical and translational research methodology, through the BERD team. a. Create a bi -weekly Research Methods For um, including a broad spectrum of consulting disciplines, to allow for concentrated discussions of novel, transdisciplinary ways to conceive of problems, ask research questions and collect and analyze data b. Facilitate interactions of trainees and faculty wi th potential new colleague collaborators (including from the community) as they develop new research projects c. Develop on- line training modules on research methods d. Foster the development of novel research methods Aim 2: To provide guidance and training on applicable regulatory standards for translational research, including compliance with Human Subjects protections with Federally -defined Good Practices. a. Provide live and online regulatory training b. Foster Research Coordinator workforce development c. Utilize a Research Request Dashboard to manage expertise and collaboration d. Share nationally our 'culture of quality ;' processes that cover all regulated environments in the academic space, in an effort to standardize and streamline national efforts, beyond a target of compliance, with a goal of excellence e. Develop and provide Regulatory Science Training and Education CORE E. RESEARCH METHODS - RESEARCH STRATEGY The focus of the UR-CTSI is to catalyze high quality research, across the translational research spectrum - from molecules to populations, through the use of transdisciplinary research teams. The Research Methods Core, including the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) group and the Regulatory Knowledge and Support (RKS) team, plays an integral role by providing resources that improve research design, facilitate the development of new and novel research approaches, and cultivate interdisciplinary collaborations and productive research teams. As such, BERD and RKS are well integrated with other UR- CTSI cores and functions ( Figure E1), and provide a central point to facilitate access to 150 research -related services offered by 27 different entities both within the U R-CTSI and elsewhere in the University. The BERD group consists of leading experts in scientific areas key to the clinical and translational research enterprise, with biostatistics and epidemiology at the core, but supplemented by other critical areas across the translational spectrum such as informatics, health outcomes research, and ethics. Prior to the creation of RKS in 2007, there existed no central University team specifically designated to improve scientific integrity, system efficiency, research- participant safety and FDA -regulatory compliance. The RKS team brings deep knowledge about research regulation and implementation to the UR-CTSI. E.1. AIM 1: To provide novel means of initially accessing the diverse skill sets required for clinical and translational research methodology, through the BERD team. E.1.1 Background: Many individual investigators received UR- CTSI support for study design and statistical analysis during the previous funding period. For example, in the 2013 -14 and 2014- 15 fisc al year , 63 and 50 individual investigators respectively were assisted through the Biostatistics and Epidemiology consulting service. While these consultations were successful, resulting in 6 peer -reviewed collaborative manuscripts to date1-6, they were primarily individual, ad hoc consultations. Due to the nature of the consultation, they did not fully take advantage of the existing collaborative research environment and educational infrastructure at UR that could have benefitted from the design of the original research study or helped establish a collaborative research team to develop a new translational research program. Therefore, to facilitate a multidisciplinary involvement , development of collaborative research teams, and access to educational resources on research methods, we will transition BERD from the previous system of primarily provision of individual research consultations to a system co mprised of four interactional resources available on a more continuous basis. The end result will increase researchers' knowledge base and promote collaborative science. E.1.2 Innovation : First, the BERD team will collaborate with research faculty at URMC through a bi -weekly 'Research Methods Forum' which will provide guidance on trial and observational study designs, study protocol development, recruitment strategies, survey design, power and sample size calculations, data collection, statistical analysis , and associative versus causal inferences. The breadth and complexity of clinical and population research studies requires not only expertise in biostatistics and epidemiology, but also in informatics, health outcomes, clinical research infrastructure, et hics, intervention research, community engagement and other relevant fields in clinical and translational research. Second, to better accommodate the complexity of clinical research, the BERD team will facilitate new research collaborations by helping to establish connections between faculty seeking research help and collaboration, and researchers who have expertise in areas of need. BERD will also utilize existing CTSA resources to help establish new research collaborations across the CTSA Consortium . Third, we will develop new online educational modules to complement existing modules at the UR-CTSI and available online through CTSA Consortium efforts focusing on methodologies that increase the validity of clinical and population studies. Last ly, the BERD team will take the lead in administering a pilot project program for the development of novel research methods that is integrated with the Pilot and Translational Clinical Studies Program. Figure E2 provides an overview of the interactions between the BERD team and URMC researchers, as well as its collaboration with other UR- CTSI Cores and the CTSA Consortium . Figure E1. Contribution of the Research Methods Core to the UR -CTSI E.1.3 Approach E.1.3.1 Sub -Aim 1.a: Research Methods Forum: We will establish the Research Methods Forum that will meet bi -weekly (or occasionally more frequently if warranted by demand) and will be attended by the BERD group, RKS team members, and members of other UR-CTSI cores that provide important complementary research expertise. The structure of the forum is based on a design that the Experimental Therapeutics T32 (NS07338- 20) program has used for several decades in the Working Group on Therapeutic Trial s and the Mellow Fellows meeting (both initially run by one of the UR-CTSI PIs, K Kieburtz , for over 15 years; both have been instrumental in enhancing junior faculty's research acumen). This approach resulted in an impressive track record of extramural funding; in 2012, the year of the last comprehensive survey, 48 past trainees had acquired over 70 extramural grants, including 17 NIH R awardees and 15 NIH K awardees . 7 The Research Methods Forum will complement these existing T32 seminars by inviting investigators of all ranks to attend, and by emphasizing multidisciplinary research methods. The Forum will provide an interactive setting for: 1) investigators to initially present their research ideas for review, critique, and receive recommendations from forum attendees and potential collaborators; 2) review of preliminary results; 3) discussion of pilot data and idea- generation for future studies; and 4) review of grant proposals. Interested investigators will be asked to present their research proposal(s) at least twice at the Forum : once at the early stages of project development, and again when the research design and desired collaborative team is more established (see \"New Collaborations\" below). These meetings will provide an opportunity for an unstructured discussion of goals, methods, practical limitations and issues ranging from design and partici pant recruitment to funding and publication strategies. Junior faculty will particularly benefit from this forum, including acceleration of their integration into the URMC research enterprise; obtaining early comprehensive feedback on their proposed resear ch plans; and, ultimately, advancing towards an independent research career more efficiently. All UR-CTSI -supported trainees and scholars (TL1 and KL2) and pilot awardees will be required to both present at this forum, and to attend when other investigator s present. This will facilitate continued learning and further interaction with other research groups. Furthermore, junior investigators from Cancer Control, Emergency Medicine, Heart Research, Medicine, Neurology, Orthopedics, Pediatrics, Public Health Sc iences, and the Wilmot Cancer Center (for example) whose research focuses on clinical and translational research will be strongly encouraged to attend the forum (see letters of support from department chairs and program directors). More senior faculty will be encouraged to attend the forum, especially if they are mentors of junior investigators, or they will be asked to present on the core elements of their own successful research programs as practical examples for junior investigators. Information on the R esearch Methods Forum and other BERD resources will be provided to both new Assistant Professors and professors of other ranks new to the URMC as part of faculty orientation and the existing URMC Academic Core Curriculum for Junior Faculty. E.1.3.2 Sub -Aim 1.b: New Collaborations: The Research Methods Forum is an interactive for mat that will be attended by the BERD team and investigators from a wide range of areas, and as such its structure inherently fosters new collaborations. The F orum will allow attendees to obtain a better understanding of the researcher's needs, and concurrently improve the investigator's understanding of the research network available to help him/her while further developing their research idea. During the weekly for um, BERD and other research experts will identify scientific areas in which new collaborations are likely to translate an initial research idea into a full -fledged research project that has the potential for generating novel research findings. After the investigator's collaboration needs have been identified, the BERD team will identify potential collaborators with expertise in methodologies relevant to clinical or translational research (e.g., biostatistician, epidemiologist, health services researcher, in formaticist) at either an institutional level (i.e. URMC - allowing for in -person discussions) or, as appropriate or necessary, secondarily at other universities across the CTSA Consortium . Potential collaborators at URMC will be identified from the indivi dual network of BERD team members, the existing CTSI -driven URMC Research Network ( Rochester's implementation of the Harvard CTSA's Profiles research networking system) , and the new online registry of ongoing Translational and Biomedical Sciences Figure E.2 . BERD objectives and intera c- tions with URMC investigators, other UR- CTSI cores and functions, and the CTSA Consortium. activitie s created by \"Collaboration and Multi -disciplinary Team Based Science (MTS)\" team (Community and Collaboration Core). Ideal candidates for collaboration will be those with research interests and methodological expertise in an area of identified need. Addit ional collaborators in the CTSA Consortium will be sought from the CTSA Methods/Processes Domain Task Force (DTF) and the Association for Clinical and Translational Science (ACTS) BERD special interest group (SIG). These activities will be coordinated with the MTS team who will then work to help educate the faculty researcher on how to engage a multidisciplinary research team. E.1.3.3 Sub -Aim 1.c: Online Educational Modules: UR-CTSI members have been actively involved in online educational initiatives in the CTSA Consortium . For instance, BERD team member Dr. Thurston was Program Director from 2009- 2011 for the CTSpedia, a national effort maintained by members of BERD and others to collect tools, educational materials, and other items useful for clinical and translational researchers (www.ctspedia.org). CTSpedia is a widely -used resource, with a range of 10,000 to over 18,000 page views per month (data from the first 8 months of 2015). Furthermore, the UR- CTSI developed online educational modules on Community -Engaged and Health Outcomes research. Finally, BERD members previously participated in a CTSA consortium publication describing and prioritizing statistical competencies in clinical and translational science education. 8 The consortium concluded that coursework should be tailored to individual researchers' needs after their baseline knowledge has been determined. Accordingly, we will expand UR-CTSI offerings and contribute additional content for CTSpedia to increase the breath of topics, and encourage investigators to view selected modules both before and after their presentation at the research methods forum, upon determining their learning needs in the context of their particular research project. We will work with the Translational Workforce Development Core to develop 'online educational modules' that will be then made available to URMC researchers (in particular junior faculty) and the CTSA Consortium . BERD team members will prepare ~45 -minute modules on key topics of interest to new investigators (we will survey investigators at the URMC Academi c Core Curriculum for Junior Faculty) that augment already -available modules. Topics may include the basic principles of systematic literature reviews, study design considerations to increase the validity and efficiency of clinical and population studies, and an introduction to methods specifically developed to reduce bias, confounding, and measurement error in such studies. Once new online modules have been used and evaluated by faculty researchers, we will share them with the CTSA Consortium through CTSpe dia and other networks . E.1.3.4 Sub -Aim 1.d: Novel Methods Development: Since 2009, the UR-CTSI has offered a pilot program for novel biostatistical and epidemiological methods (NBEM). Currently, review of these investigator -initiated proposals takes place under a swap system (initiated by Dr. Sally Thurston in 2010) in which investigators at the Cincinnati CTSA review Rochester's NBEM proposals, and Biostatistics personnel at the University of Rochester review corresponding NBEM proposals from Cincinnati. From 2011- 2015, 11 NBEM pilot awards were made, which resulted14 peer-reviewed publications9-22 and significant scientific contributions ( Table E1), including a study that helped to support the correction of a fundamental mathematical mista ke in existence in statistical community for more than 40 years19, After the publication of a paper from another NBEM pilot ,9 an investigator from the University of Florida contacted the NBEM reci pient about collaborating on a research project. This started a new cross -university collaboration which includes a draft manuscript on a new gene expression analysis framework. Table E1.

We will issue RFPs that target specific areas including novel methodologies to generate, manage, and analyze large databases from a molecular scale (computational biology) to clinical and population- level data (health outcomes research). This expanded approach, combining investigator -initiated proposals with those intended to address specific needs, will facilitate innovative team science and more efficient clinical research. For proposal reviews, we propose to continue our successful cross -CTSA swap system with the University of Cincinnati. E.1.4 Organization : See Table E2. In addition, w e will invite faculty members to the Forum on an ad hoc basis to complement the BERD team (e.g. Community Engagement), and provide faculty who do not have a role in the UR- CTSI an honorarium to their departmen t to support their attendance. E.2 AIM 2: To provide guidance and training on applicable regulatory standards for translational research, including compliance with Human Subjects protections and with Federally - defined Good Practices. E.2.1 Background: Subject matter experts housed within the RKS group includes a Director (E Rubinstein JD MPH); co -Director (J Adamo PhD); (C Dykes PhD); and Manager (N Needler) of Research Coordinator Programs. The newly Research Engagement Specialist manages the Research Request Dashboard (RRD) and other Research Help resources. RKS members have held multiple consortium leadership roles for the past 5 years (Table E3 ). Through RKS, we provide guidance on IND and IDE applications (8 submitted, 6 successful last 5 years), regulatory consult ations (n=64 last year), assist ance with FDA audits, and support for registration and result s reporting through ClinicalTrials.gov. Tailored training is provided (n=131 trained in last year), including for regulatory requirements for pre-clinical research conducted under FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. In addition, we devel oped the capacity to serve as the Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) required by GLP regulations, to provide system audits and inspections for GLP-compliant research. Connecting with the University Director of Quality and Compliance (see Quality and Efficiency i n the Administrative Core), and the Office for Human Subject Protection (OHSP) Quality Improvement Program, RKS staff are working toward an enhanced \"culture of quality\" in the overall University research enterprise. Course offerings that the RKS function contributes to includes the following: BME 431 FDA Regulatory Processes and Intellectual Property, BME 432 Navigating FDA Regulatory and Commercialization Landscapes, PM 494 Fundamentals of Science, Technology and Health Policy, PM 488 Experimental Therapeutics, ENT 425 New Venture Management and Technical Entrepreneurship, BST 465 Design of Clinical Trials, MBI 403 Drug Discovery, PHP 404 Principles of Pharmacology, and TOX 521 Toxicology I. In addition to the education and training described above, RKS staff also contributed to local and national workforce development through several initiatives: We c reated the Study Coordinators Organization for Research and Education (SCORE), which provides peer support and a forum for sharing best practices. (Monthly meetings (n=20 attendees) and annual \u00bd day events (n=143) report over 90% satisfaction with the educational material. ) SCORE, via RKS, convened a working group (n=39) of research coordinators, administrators, URMC Human Resources and the Office for Human S ubject Protection (OHSP) that met 7 times in 2013, and adapted templates produced by the Consortium Research Coordinator work group to propose a 3- level job series for research coordinators, which was implemented in April 2014.

E.2.2 Innovation: Building on the success of our past regulatory training, we will build on- line IND/IDE management tools, share our GMP and GLP compliance procedures in an academic 'culture of qual ity' across the CTSA Consortium , and create competency -based training standards for researchers, in collaboration with Consortium partners. Regulatory Science refers to efforts to shape evolving regulatory policy and requirements through the application of innovative science, while Regulatory Affairs refers to work directed toward compliance with existing regulation. We will provide leadership in Regulatory Science training via programs developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania, and dev elop new policy and guidance (Optional Core , Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine ), on behalf of the Consortium , regarding regulation of Precision Medicine (Figure E3) . E.2.3 Approach: E.2.3.1 Sub- Aim 2.a: Provide live and online regulatory training : We will continue to provide and enhance foundational regulatory affairs training through both online and in- person approaches, ensuring guidance and support to researchers for proper data and safety monitoring, timely reporting of adverse events and compliance with governing regulation. As new research approaches are developed, the RKS group will provide updated guidance for these emerging methods and technologies -in particular we propose development of regulatory guidance for precision medicine as outlined in an Optional Core. The operation of two new systems, the Research Request Dashboard (RRD -completed) and a web- hosted IND/IDE data- management tool (partially completed) will continue t o facilitate consultations and build connections between collaborators. We will also develop innovative tools for informed- consent formulation. We will strengthen and share nationally our capabilities in creating GLP - and GMP -compliant environments (including stem cell manufacturing, and experimental drug packing and distribution) within an academic environment. We will use our established GMP quality system as an example of successful manufacturing in an academic environment, and will also share the experiences of developing a Quality Assurance Unit and auditing G LP-governed studies. CTSA hubs will continue to be provided with details about the regulated programs we have built. E.2.3.2 Sub- Aim 2.b: Foster Research Coordinator workforce development : Building on the successful initiative to standardize the career pat h for research coordinators, and drawing from standards under development via CTSA collaborations for competency -based training, we will standardize education for both research coordinators and faculty investigators. In addition to assuring baseline GCP training, we will continue to collaborate with OHSP and CTSA Consortium partners to develop innovative and readily available modalities for educational content on topics of increasing sophistication, enhancing approaches for assessment of competency and will develop approaches to evaluate the impacts of such training on quality and ef ficiency of research activities. E.2.3.3 Sub- Aim 2.c: Utilize a Research Request Dashboard to manage expertise and collaboration : The RRD (a web -hosted request management system) will continue to serve as the 'front door' through which connections to regul atory experts will be facilitated. Regulatory experts also will participate in the range of activities described above in BERD -coordinated activities. The participation of individuals knowledgeable about regulatory requirements as contributors to multi -disciplinary collaborative teams will provide for one -on-one consultations, identification of beneficial online training (e .g., orientation to requirements for FDA IND application, orientation to medical devices and the requirements for an FDA IDE application, GLP introductory and advanced training sessions) and connections to outside experts. The Research Engagement Specialist will assure availability of supportive resources throughout the lifecycle of supported research. A well -prepared and supported researc h workforce will be educated and competent to conduct research activities that not only comply with governing regulation and policy but also that deploy evidence- based best practices . E.2.3.4 Sub- Aim 2.d: Develop and Disseminate a Culture of Quality: NIH has noted a serious stumbling block surrounding the lack of reproducibility of data stemming from basic science research laboratories. The Figure E 3. Intersection of Regulatory Science and Regulatory Affairs development of our ' Culture of Quality ' initiative (see Administrative Core) will focus on efficiency in both basic science and clinical research environments. We will develop and eventually share our Culture of Quality processes to standardize and streamline efforts for best practices for research environments in the academic setting, and introduce and encourage adoption of emerging standards for data reproducibility and rigor for translational research\u2014 with a goal of excellence and reliability in research outcomes. We will improve processes in research -supporting clinical servic es (e.g. Investigational Drug Pharmacy), and will develop processes for comprehensive documentation and monitoring of research -related processes (e.g. a robust document management system) . Working in partnership with other hub Cores, including the Administ rative Core, the Data Reproducibility Initiative for clinical and translational research (a multi -institutional project led by the University of Minnesota and including CTSA hubs collaborating to develop quality system training for clinical and translational researchers) will be developed and adopted first within participating institutions and then disseminated to all CTSA hubs. The outcome of these efforts will be to ensure a robust research system with standardized processes and efficient oversight. E.2.3.5 Sub- Aim 2.e: Regulatory Science Training and Education: Responsive to the emerging field of Regulatory Science, and continued collaborations with our KL2 Institutional Career Development and Translational Endeavors Core, we will support Regulatory Science initiatives that build on our existing UR work and relationships with FDA -funded Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation in the following workforce development initiatives: 1. Create a certificate program in Regulatory Science, 2. D evelop and implement experiential learning opportunities in both industry and regulatory agencies (through the UR -BEST Program, in collaboration with PhRMA Foundation and the University of Pennsylvania ITMAP program ) and 3. Offer a seminar series on the topic of \"Advancing Regulatory Science and Translational Science: Research, Training and Partnerships.\" The intended outcome of these initiatives will be to not only train researchers to comply with existing regulation (regulatory affairs), but to also contr ibute to evolving regulatory requirements through innovations in the science of regulation (regulatory science). We will also create a National Forum on Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine, described in an Optional Core. Table E4.

HUB RESEARCH CAPACIT Y - SPECIFIC AIMS Critical activities for the successful conduct of translational research include ensuring the inclusion of all populations and the quality of participant and clinical interactions. These activities are necessary for research findings to be relevant to the many diverse communities that comprise the broad population. To this end, UR-CTSI programs facilitate the integration of research across the broad spectrum of human diversity (e.g., age, gender, disability, health conditions and other demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity and socio -economic status ). We have developed a participant -centric approach to research recruitment and navigation ( see Network Capacity Core- Recruitment Unit ), ensuring access and engagement throughout the research exper ience. At the CTSI , we have a successful history of including diverse populations in research, and of supporting investigators to do this appropriately. Due to the strength of our Community Engagement efforts, we conduct collaborative research with traditionally underrepresented populations , such as inner city African Americans , Latinos and people who are deaf or have hearing loss . As a result of the integration of the National Center for Deaf Health Research ( a CDC Prevention Research Center) with the UR- CTSI, we developed a particularly strong model for defining specific research needs and supporting the engagement of a special population. In this regard, t he UR-CTSI Workforce Diversity programs complement our Community and Collaboration and Hub Research Capacity Cores. We have also created an environment and processes that support continuous improvement for delivery of the highest quality research and maintenance of the highest ethical standards. Further, we provide support to investigators in t he development of: strong scientific design (Research Methods , Biostatistics, E pidemiology, and Research D esign function (BERD) ), realistic recruitment goals (Recruitment Unit) , systems to track enrollment and follow -up, data management to ensure high qual ity data, data monitoring protocols, identification of feasibility issues and safety concerns, appropriate response to these issues, efficient and orderly closure of studies, and monitoring of prompt publication. Clinical studies b enefit from a variety of support services to ensure the quality and efficiency of research, undergo departmental review prior to submission to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB), and are then meticulously reviewed by the IRB . Dissemination of scientific information is a priorit y for the CTSI because the ultimate goal of research is to improve the health of populations. Efficient dissemination requires several steps from prompt communication to the scientific community, to adaptation of best practices in the clinic and community, and, importantly, education of the population about research and study findings , all activities supported by the Recruitment Unit . We view this Core as an incubator for research innovation to improve quality and efficiency . In addition, for integration of special populations , we will ensure that innovat ions are responsive to the unique nee ds of a broad variety of populations. We propose to establish the Office of Special Populations Integration to complement Clinical Research Center activities and extend innovations throughout the UR -CTSI and the institu tion. In addition, we will shar e best practices across the CTSA network . Aim 1: To integrate special populations in the activities of the UR -CTSI through the collaborative development, implementation and expansion of specialized programs, technical assist ance, innovative methods and other activities to facilitate institutional culture change. The integration of special populations, including individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in research and individuals from across the lifespan (children to older adults), supports the UR -CTSI mission to improve population health. a. Increase the number of researchers who conduct community engaged research that is responsive to the priorities of special populations. b. Increase the number of individuals from special p opulations who participate in research. Aim 2 : To develop and maintain an integrated system that greatly facilitates the implementation of highest quality research with human subjects. This will be accomplished by increasing early scientific input, increasing the speed of study implementation, preventing protocol deviations, continuously assessing and improving quality, and enhancing dissemination of scientific information. These activities will be pursued not only at our institution but via collaborative efforts with other CTSA hubs . a. Promote t he best science and enhance rigorous scientific review process at UR. b. Establish best practices for study conduct. c. Establish scientific handoffs to ensure continued translation of promising findings CORE F. HUB RESEARCH CAPACITY - RESEARCH STRATEGY F.1 AIM 1: To integrate special populations in the activities of the UR -CTSI through the collaborative development, implementation and expansion of specialized programs, technical assistance, innovative methods and other activities to facilitate institutional culture change. F.1.1 Background and Accomplishments : The UR -CTSI will continue to integrat e special populations into programs at all levels. Our success with integrating special populations is directly connected to our commitments to community and stakeholder engagement and to promoting diversity in the translational science workforce. Our successful research programs involving subpopulations include research on the interrelationships of health and disease with factors such as environmental exposures, culture and interpersonal factors, and health- related behaviors. We work with subpopulations distinguished by language, communication, disability, condition or ri sk, culture , geographic location/dispersion, and socioeconomic status (Table F1). This work with special populations complements our work with inner city Rochester populations (see Community and Collaboration Core). The UR has a portfolio of research and research training across the lifespan ; these resources enhance UR-CTSI efforts for translational research involving children and older adults. The URMC Office of Aging Research and Health Services (OARHS) is a resource for geriatrics and gerontology progra ms of research, education and clinical care. OARHS -associated initiatives include those of the HRSA -funded (2015- 2018) Finger Lakes Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program (FLGWEP), which brings together clinicians and other stakeholders in urban and rural areas across the region. OARHS also convenes UR researchers with complementary foci, such as those examining aging and sensory system function (hearing, vision, balance), with implications for independence in later life. Research under the umbrella of the URMC Department of Pediatrics includes six major areas that span the translational spectrum. URMC pediatric clinical and research programs engage children with chronic and life- threatening conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and cancer, and these programs follow patients/participants into adulthood, in collaboration with their primary care clinician. The Greater Rochester Practice Based Res earch Network (see Community and Collaboration Core ) is another resource to enhance engagement with more c hildren, older adults, and \"hard -to-reach\" populations. Rochester NY has large populations of deaf sign language users and people with hearing loss . 1 The UR-CTSI programs with these populations are unique in the CTSA network. Deaf sign language us ers and people with hearing loss comprise two groups that differ in many aspects, including language, culture, and lived experience. Three similarities are : risk for health inequities, barriers to health communication, and limited engagement with health research. The broad range of human diversity is expressed within populations of deaf sign language users and people with hearing loss, including race, age, disability status and health conditions. Our work with populations of deaf people and people with hear ing loss provides a framework that we will use to inform, adapt and develop approaches to enhance integration with other special populations, including other groups of people with childhood conditions, other older adults, other language minority populations, and other disparity populations. The National Center for Deaf Health Research (NCDHR), a component of UR -CTSI, engages deaf and hearing loss communities in all phases of the research process, from priority setting through research design, recruitment and retention, interpretation of findings, dissemination, and back to priority setting. 2 The CTSI/NCDHR experience with stakeholder engaged research contributes to our integration of research across the lifespan (see letter of support, NCDHR External Advisory Committee) . Research with deaf sign language users presents opportunities to conduct stakehol der engaged research across the translational science spectrum. Most deaf adult sign language users are deaf since birth or early childhood, and this phenotype has a small number of common genotypes. Public health research that identifies Table F1. UR-CTSI examples of successful engaged research with special populations Population s Research across the lifespan includes: Pregnancy Children Adults -childhood conditions Older adults Deaf sign language users X X X People with hearing loss X X X Childhood cancer survivors X X Populations at risk for suicide X X X Veterans X X People/families with neurological conditions X X X Online communities X X People living with HIV X X X LGBT youth X X People/families with autism spectrum disorder X X X Women/families in the legal system X X X X People/families with inherited cardiac dysrhythmias X X X Obesity ( African Americans, pregnant women, deaf sign language users, children and their families, and people with serious mental illness) X X X X high prevalence health conditions (e.g., obesity3) or low prevalence health conditions (e.g., current smoking3,4) leads to basic research to understand the underlying genetics and cellular mechanisms of health and disease, and the translation of that research to inform precision medicine with individual patients and families. UR-CTSI work with deaf populations led to methodological innovations and the scientific study of those methods, and this leads to translation and adaption of those methods for use with other populations. We are currently conducting a NCATS/NIDCD funded randomized trial to assess three methods of informed consent with deaf adult American Sign Language (ASL) users: standard written English, a video monologue in ASL, and a video dialogue/novella in ASL. Video inform ed consent has applications to other populations, such as those with low literacy, including young children. UR -CTSI custom software that uses pre- recorded video to conduct surveys in ASL is being adapted for use with young children who are hearing. F.1.2 Innovation : UR- CTSI activities are innovative because of the populations we work with, our adaptation and use of technology to complement and enhance traditional approaches to integration, and our evaluation and adaptation o f novel methods used with one population to us e with other populations. F.1.3 Approach: We will codify many existing activities by establishing the Office of Special Population Integration (OSPI) to implement and coordinate activities and resources to achieve the aim of integrating special populations in UR -CTSI. The OSPI will provide technical assistance, offer enrichment activities, and foster collaborations to develop resources and novel methods that will enhance participation. The OSPI will evaluate lessons learned from the UR-CTSI experiences working with special populations , and will work to translate, disseminate, and implement successful approaches across disciplines and programs within the UR-CTSI, the institution and other CTSA hubs . The OSPI will include faculty, staff and trainees who work with and/or are members of groups that are underrepresented in research. OSPI will conduct activit ies to increase integration of special populations in clos e collaboration with the Recruitment Unit of the Network Capacity Core , the Com munity and Collaboration Core, and the Director of Diversity and Inclusion. We will share methods /resources with others in the CTSA network , and will evaluate and adapt/translate approaches CTSAs . F.1.3.1 Sub-Aim 1.a: Increase the number of researchers and research programs that conduct community engaged research that is responsive to the priorities of special populations. OSPI technical assistance: Research teams, trainees and community members from UR and the CTSA network can request consultation from the OSPI. We anticipate that the most common questions will relate to increasing the research participation of children, people with childhood onset conditions, older adults, people with hearing loss, and deaf sign language users. In response, the OSPI team (descri bed below) and other OSPI consultants will recommend approaches and resources used successfully with a specific population, or will work collaboratively with the r esearch team and community partners to adapt approaches and resources for use with a new population or in a new setting. The approach will be analogous to our work with inner city populations . We also expect requests regarding integrating individuals from special populations into research teams. For example, OSPI and NCDHR will work with research teams to retain individuals already in the scientific workforce who develop hearing loss. M any of the programs, resources and technology applications that we develop for use with learners and research participants who are deaf or have hearing loss can be used with aging researchers, teachers and clinicians who develop hearing loss, to support their continued contribution in their roles in the scientific workforce. Our experiences with this population have given us methods and approaches that can be applied to other special populations. OSPI enrichment activities : We will plan and conduct enrichment activities on topics informed by questions to OSPI and will address integrating special populations in research, accessible research methods, community/stakeholder engagement and collaboration, workforce diversity, microaggressions, and institutional culture change. The target audiences include faculty, students, staff and stakeholders. We will coordinate educational programing with the Director of Diversity and I nclusion. Presenters will include OSPI team members from UR and elsewhere. These activities will be filmed, captioned, and archived for future viewing. OSPI resource development : Data on research experiences and attitudes are ess ential to adapt existing and develop new programs that integrate special populations. OSPI will work with the Recruitment Unit and others to adapt/translate existing tools for use with new populations. For example, we have experience adapting surveys for use in ASL, with a rigorous process that includes translation, independent back -translation, individual in- depth cognitive testing, and studio filming.5 We will review and select items in tools such as the CTSA Research Participants' Perception Survey (RPPS6) and the UR -CTSI Survey of Community Attitudes on Research Participation (SCARP), adapt the selected items and evaluate them, and share the adapted tools through the CTSA network. F.1.3.2 Sub-Aim 1.b: Increase the number of individuals from special populations who participate in research. OSPI novel methods : We will use data on research experiences to identify and address barriers. We will foster new collaborations to leverage successful research programs to work with new populations in new ways, and increase access, participation and integration of special populations. Two examples: 1) Research with young children: Children too young or unable to read cannot respond to written survey items, such as those in the NIH Pediatric Patient Reported Outcomes Measures Information System (P - PROMIS). CTSI/NCDHR has experience and custom software to create surveys that use videos. We will bring together NCDHR and the URMC PROMIS team to create and evaluate a P -PROMIS survey that uses audio/video files for use with children, comparing the self -report findings with proxy responses from parents (the current standard for collecting P-PROMIS data for children who cannot read). 2) Research with older adults : More than 60% of non- institutionalized adults aged 70 and older have hearing loss .7,8 The prevalence is higher for older adults receiving home care services and those in long term care facilities. Communication barriers threaten research participation, generalizability and data integrity. CTSI/NCDHR will work with the Health y Living with Hearing Loss Community Committee (HL2) to identify and address barriers to research participation. CTSI researchers with the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics (CHET) use smart p hones to collect data and communicate with research participants. OSPI, CHET and NCDHR will work together to use smart p hones with older adults with hearing loss to examine the association of communication with connectedness and health, and will evaluate methods to enhance research participation and data collection with older adults with hearing loss. Steven Barnett MD, NCDHR director , will lead the OSPI team in close collaboration with the CTSI Director for Diversity & Inclusion. The team will include URMC research leaders working with older adults, children and other special populations ( Table F2). Our team will meet monthly to coordinate activities across programs and assess progress. Team members will meet with investigators and community member s in response to queries . F.2 AIM 2: Participant and Clinical Interactions : To develop and maintain an integrated system that greatly facilitates the implementation of highest quality research with human subjects. We will develop and maintain an integrated system that greatly facilitates the implementation of highest quality research with human subjects. This will be accomplished by increasing early scientific input, increasing the speed of study implementation, preventing protocol deviations, continuously assessing and improving quality, and enhancing dissemination of scientific information. These activities will be pursued not only at our instituti on but via collaborative efforts with other CTSA programs. F.2.1 Background and Accomplishments: The UR -CTSI has created an environment and the processes to support continuous improvement in the performance of the highest quality research and maintenance o f the highest ethical standards. To achieve these aims, the UR -CTSI invests resources in the education and training of investigating teams at all levels, from junior to senior faculty and study coordinators. Furthermore, since translational science is most often a team effort, the UR -CTSI facilitates the creation of multidisciplinary teams (Communi ty / Collaboration Core). These teams can take advantage of the CTSI Clinical Research Center (CRC ), a designated facility for translational research. This Center , directed by Dr. G Schifitto, Professor of Neurology, is currently used by 55 investigators with over 100 active protocols resulting in a total of about 2000 visits annually. Of study participants using the CRC , approximately 21% are children and 15% are over 65 years old. An average of 65% of all clinical departments at the UR uses the CTSI -CRC ( 9-33) yearly .

Frequent comments were that the highly experienced CRC staff provided outstanding quality control of clinical research and that the research environment created greatly enhanced study partici pant satisfaction. Thus, the CRC is a tangible hub for the UR -CTSI broader efforts to support the conduct of translational research and create an environment of continuous quality and efficiency improvement. The UR -CTSI also serves a vital function in the dissemination of research findings to the research community, enabling more rapid translation to the next step in the translational continuum. F.2.2 Innovation: The CRC has had significant success in creating a nurturing environment for high quality clinical and translational research at UR. We propose to continue and expand these efforts by developing and maintaining an integrated system throughout the UR -CTSI to facilitate the implementation of highest quality research, and by collaborating within the CTSA Network to achieve the ultimate goal of a nimble but effective national research engine that catalyzes quality and efficiency while assuring the highest ethical standards. F.2.3 Approach: We have identified key elements by which the PCI can contribute by refining or creating new tools that addres s the scientific review process at UR (creating guidelines and training modules for faculty); establishing best practices for study conduct (create protocol checklist with delegation of activities, and track protocol deviations via an incident module; prov ide study participants with educational material about scientific research); and establishing standards for scientific handoffs (from reporting to the scientific community, to disseminating to community based clinicians and community stakeholders at large) . F.2.3.1 Sub-Aim 2.a: Promote t he best science and to enhance rigorous scientific review process at UR. Establishing a sound scientific review process is an important step that helps prevent scientifically and ethically flawed studies from being conducted. Investigators benefit from the availability of scientific input in the early planning phase of a study . As described in BERD section (Research Methods Core ) of this application, we will implement an enhanced transdisciplinary Research Methods Forum to facilitate the creation of new teams and enhance early scientific input. Investigators directly supported by the CTSA award are expected to participate in the Research Methods Forum and receive scientific input from the start of their study. In addition, t he UR- CTSI has implemented institution -wide guidelines for departmental scientif ic review prior to revie w by the IRB. We believe this is the most cost -effective way for the CTSI to constructively influence the scientific review process at our institution. The review contains ass essment of the following : scientific merit (testable hypotheses, study design); societal benefit, investigator skills/expertise to conduct research; adequacy of resources and feasibility; and identification and mitigation of risk , as described in the Quality and Efficiency section of the Administrative Core ). We are now querying the IRB review to assess whether the current guidelines for scientific review are having the intended impact, i.e., preventing substandard protocols from reaching the IRB . For a first analysis, we will use the time the protocol stays in IRB (1 SD above mean) as a red flag for scientific concerns. M oving forward, the IRB will identify as unacceptable protocols which do not appear to have had adequate scientific review before submission. Unacceptable protocols will be flagged for intervention by the Trial Innov ation Unit (see Network Capacity Core) in their bi -weekly m eetings . The Trial Innovation Unit (based in the Dean's office and empowered to halt research projects) will already be tracking times from submission to IRB approval (and time for contract approvals), enrollment performance, and protocol deviations reported to the IRB. The intervention for unacceptable protocols may include identifying patterns within departments suggesting that additional training is necessary for those doing the scientific review and for the investigators submitting those protocols. This training may require additional modules via our Office for Human Subject Protection research education and training program. We are also piloting the approach of engaging those who are perform ing department -level scientific review of human- subject protocols to identify investigators who would benefit from our new Research Methods Forum. We will identi fy opportunities to measure scientific quality improvement in studies responding to scient ific reviewer feedback. If we demonstrate value through our efforts, we will seek to scale with other departments, to establish an efficient institutional approach to ensuring high quality research plans . Similar to the IRB process monitoring described above, the Trial Innovation Unit will be tracking compliance with ClinicalTrials.gov registration and results reporting requirements. Investigators requiring assistance will be supported by the RKS team (Research Methods). F.2.3.2 Sub-Aim 2.b: Establish best practices for study conduct. Prior to implementation in the CRC, each protocol is reviewed by the investigating team, a CTSI project manager, CTSI research nur ses and coordinators and the CRC director, Dr. Schifitto, to e nsure appropriate use of the CRC . We will have a customized checklist for each protocol and for each visit that assigns individual task responsibilities according to the protocol workflow, helping investigators adhere to the protocol. Briefly, the checklist will be protocol -specific and derived from the protocol -planned schedule of activities; thus it will help clarify procedures and identify preventable protocol deviations. We will, in addition, develop a reporting system to record all protocol deviations and near protocol deviations ( near misses). This information will then be reviewed with the study team and an action plan will be put in place to prevent further occurrences. Once fully developed, we will disseminate the task checklist and reporting system to the CTSA Consortium as a means to minimize protocol deviations. In order to maintain high quality research training at all levels at our Institution, the CTSI and the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) actively interact to promote education and training for compliance with human subjects regulations, as well as m ore advanced training to achieve additional competencies (Workforce Development). In addition to formal training, informal training is conduc ted during protocol reviews as mentioned above. We will establish a formal orientation program for study teams on protocol conduct by presenting the program on an annual basis to the UR Study Coordinators Organization for Research and Education (SCORE) as described in RKS (Research Methods Core). SCORE reaches study coordinators across the UR. This educational activi ty will also be included in HRPP educational modules accessible to all study team members. In addition, s tudy team members new to the CRC will be presented with a formal protocol implementation orientation (Table F3). Although study participants and thei r families are eager to have a particular condition assessed, they are often unaware of why a study is performed in a specific manner. This may affect their perception of the study as well as their willingness to participate, especially in studies that re quire significant commitment of time and involve invasive procedures. While the consenting process addresses study -specific questions, we propose to develop educational modules that integrate the study participants' bill of rights with elements of study de sign. The module will be short, one to two pages and will be given to study participants after a brief introduction of the key elements provided in the document. This should help study participants to ask appropriate questions of the study team and to bet ter understand future study results. We will develop these material s in collaboration with the Recruitment Unit (Network Capacity Core) as they coordinate their marketing campaign to educate the regional community about health research. We will also utiliz e their research satisfaction surveys , particularly for studies conducted i n the CRC , to identify areas for quality improvement in the participant experience. We will also collaborate with Community/Collaboration Core to assure cultural competence. Our overall goal is to maintain two- way communication with investigating teams and research participants to implement and translate the best research possible. It is important to receive feedback from investigators , as well as participants , to best support the CTSI enterprise to continue to proactively reach out to investigators. We piloted a survey, mentioned above, to ascertain whether the resources provided by the CTSI -CRC met the needs of study teams, and whether additional resources may be needed. Key elements of the survey assessed: access to resources needed , quality and flexibility of staff in accommodating needs, study participant satisfaction with care, and overall impact on study implementation. We intend to continue to conduct such a survey across the UR -CTSI twice per year and revise services based on feedback. Recruitment and retention of study participants: This is an important aspect of successfully conducting a study and is addressed by the Recruitment Unit described more f ully in the Network Capacity Core. The CRC will take full advantage of the Rec ruitment Units ' plans to disseminate information to the community as well as receive feedback from the community about research participation. F.2.3.3 Sub-Aim 2.c: Establish scientific handoffs to ensure continued translation of promising findings. In addition to ensuring timely analysis and reporting of study results, we will assist with identification of new research questions generated by research findings. Often, despite appropriate dissemination of results, promising discoveries are insufficiently recognized; this results in delays for development of the next translati onal inquiry . Working with the CTSI Evaluation Team (Administrative Core), we will develop methods for identifying stalled translational research. We will develop approaches to assist researchers to identify next steps in translation of their study results, and also to broadly disseminate information about available findings. We will ensure the broad communication of findings within the institution through presentations and seminars, to the Upstate New York Translational Research Network ( UNYTE ) network through Scientific Sessions (see Community and Collaboration Core), and to the CTSA Consortium through relevant Domain Task Forces. PCI Structure : Dr. Schifitto will lead the PCI Core and the CTSI -CRC. His team will include a PCI Project Manager; a PCI Health Project Coordinator, a PCI Research Engagement Specialist, four CRC research nurses and two CRC research dieticians. Dr. Schifitto will meet weekly with the PCI project manager and Eric Table F3.

NETWORK CAPACITY - SPECIFIC AIMS The NCATS Trial Innovation Centers (TICs) and Recruitment Innovation Centers (RICs) will guide the CTSA Consortium efforts to serve as an integrated site network. Such a network will be capable of recruiting, evaluating and retaining a diverse set of research participants for projects that originate from, and are funded by, all the NIH Centers and Institutes, as well as other research partners, such as not -for-profit foundations and industry. Each hub will need to have a prepared, diverse and willing cadre of experienced investigators to participate in those efforts, and be able to efficiently identify potential resear ch participants, and reach them with pertinent information regarding study participation. While study recruitment is often seen as a major hurdle in study completion, the 'activation period' of each study site (IRB approval and contract negotiation) can of ten be as lengthy as the recruitment period itself. The University of Rochester CTSI has an unusual depth of experience in both running global, multicenter trials for drugs and devices as a hub, and functioning as a performing site in NIH -funded networks. The experience as a site in the NINDS -funded NeuroNEXT consortium, requiring a central IRB (reliance model) and uniform site contracts, is particularly germane to the planned CTSA consortium activities. We co- led the efforts to develop the CTSA -driven mast er contract for industry and currently are furthering that effort (along with PCORI) for other master agreements, such as for NIH awards. We also co- led CTSA efforts on setting standards for scientific review of research proposals before IRB review. We hav e developed nationally recognized (the White House recognized Dr . Ray Dorsey as a 'champion of change') smartphone platforms to enable online consenting and remote research data collection processes that can serve as a novel model for CTSA projects. These efficiencies can speed consortium projects. Familiarity with network participation must be complemented by network performance, particularly with regard to recruitment of research participants. With strong and enduring community connections, the Rochester CTSI was able to recruit one of the highest numbers of ResearchMatch participants, has recruited subjects from disadvantaged and hard to reach populations for research (deaf and hard of hearing, autism spectrum disorder), and developed novel technologies t o enable 'anyone, anywhere' to participate in research. As a diverse urban and rural region we serve as a microcosm of the national population, with its assorted challenges and opportunities. A community that participates in research by enrolling in clinic al studies is a community that understands the important role health research plays in improving the health of the population. The UR -CTSI recognizes that raising community awareness, and providing education about and opportunities to participate in resear ch are essential to successfully move research forward. In addition, successful research capitalizes on novel methods, and builds teams with essential recruitment and retention expertise using tools to complement and enhance the skills of research teams. D irect contact with participants and the community through a variety of modalities is essential. These modalities must ensure connection with all groups in the community including underrepresented and special populations. Our plan to support recruitment and retention of participants was developed, and will be refined, with these themes in mind, and be in alignment with the community engagement initiatives described in the Community and Collaboration Core. Under the guidance of a Core Director and Trial Innov ation and Recruitment Units we will achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To establish a local Trial Innovation Unit , utilizing our experiences as both a hub and participating site in multi -center projects, to identify and streamline obstacles to trial initiation and conduct. a. Implement a database to track all relevant trial milestones including IRB and contract milestones, as well as trial conduct metrics of enrollment, protocol violations, and financial status, in an effort to improve trial efficiency b. Maintain a Clinical Research Review Process Improvement Team to monitor for and resolve institutional impediments to research implementation c. Actively seek complementary CTSA Consortium projects for which the Rochester region can effectively contribute as an enrolling site. d. Distribute our developing capabilities and technologies , across multiple disease areas, within the Network and to complement national NCATS TIC efforts Aim 2: To expand our Recruitment Unit to successfully interact with the CTSA RICs, and to provide expertise in the ethics, communications, informatics and patient engagement necessary for participant recruitment. a. Provide investigator and research team consultations in recruitment strategies b. Identify and deploy novel and established bes t practices , and provide education to researchers about recruitment tactics and strategies c. Enable patient engagement in research: communication about trial opportunities, data and experiences d. Implement policy changes , driven by the Trial Innovation Unit, i nto routine recruitment practices CORE G. NETWORK CAPACITY - RESEARCH STRATEGY G.1 BACKGROUND The CTSA Consortium is in the midst of transition from a loosely connected set of awarded institutions to a tightly integrated network of sites capable of deploying complex, multi -center research projects . Multi -center projects have historically been difficult and time consuming to initiate. Local negotiations on contracts and IRB deliberations have been part of that inefficiency. An additional inefficiency has been the uncertainty of whether appropriate research participants could be identified and recruited. In response to these historic obstacles, NCATS has proposed the creation of Trial Innovation and Recruitment Innovation Centers (TICs and RICs) to coordinate the CTSA Consortium efforts to reduce such inefficiencies. The University of Rochester CTSI has an unusual depth of experience in both running global, multi -center trials for drugs and devices as a hub, and functioning as a performing site in NIH -funded networks. Hence, we are well placed to both function efficiently as a participating site in Network projects (what we call 'engaged followership'), as well as to continue to contribute innovative methods to the CTSA Consortium in order to improve translational efficiency. The University of Rochester has been a consistent contributor to multi -center research groups across a broad range of conditions, involving all stages of translation. These networks include the recently formed NINDS NeuroNEXT (focusing on early stage trials) Trial Network, the NCI National Clinical Trials Network, the NIAID AIDS Clinical Trial Group and HIV Vaccine Evaluation Group, as well as NHLBI -funded networks in cardiology, the NIA -funded Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies, and NINDS -funded studies conducted by the Parkinson, Huntington and Muscle Study Groups (Table G1) . As importantly, the University of Rochester has served as the central coordinating center for over 36 NIH -funded multi - center clinical tr ials and observational studies (14 Cardiology, including long QT syndrome genetic studies , 1,2 11 in Parkinson disease, including the largest PD clinical trial to date,3 and 11 in other muscle, eye and degenerative disorders, including Huntington disease genotype/phenotype correlation4), and over 50 industry - and foundation- funded trials, utilizing hundreds of clinical trial sites across 4 continents .1-13 In addition, the UR serves as a national hub for the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. This work has given the institution a keen awareness of the qualities of a well performing site and the infrastructure needed to maintain efficiency. The UR -CTSI has taken a leadership role in streamlining contracting processes. In response to data from a 2010 CTSA Contracts Processing Study representatives from the University of Rochester participated, with the CTSA Master Cont racts Working Group in developing the Accelerated Clinical Trial Agreement (ACTA). The ACTA sets forth the contractual obligations of both parties, and presents language which is acceptable to both academic institutions and industry. Building on that success, the Group has completed the development of ACTA for studies utilizing a CRO and an Accelerated Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement, and is finalizing an ACTA for use by study coordinating centers. For the past 2 months, the UR -CTSI has taken the lead on the development of a sub -agreement template for multi -site federally sponsored clinical trials. The final template will be approved for use by both the Federal Demonstration Partnership and NCATS and will be considered the new \"gold standard\". Completion of this work is expected by the end of the calendar year. For the NINDS NeuroNEXT clinical trial network participation, the UR has agreed to pre- negot iated master contracts and to a reliance model central IRB. We have embraced the NeuroNEXT model of central IRB review and master contracts. Of the 3 NeuroNEXT studies started in Rochester, we have experienced an average 24 days to IRB approval and 63 days to contract signature (Table G2). This performance represents a significant improvement over our recent phase 3 trial experience, as was intended (more details below). The institution is fully committed to accepting a reliance model central IRB and master contracts as part of participating in the CTSA Consortium. In addition, we have used a central IRB (reliance model) for industry sponsored trials (n=300/yr) for the past decade. Our prio r experience was that local IRB review in multicenter trials added little to the process . 14 The UR-CTSI has recently piloted a Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) in a partnership with a local company (Bio- optronics Inc) in an effort to establish more efficient means of monitoring all aspects of trial activation and execution. The system was deployed at 4 major clinical trial recruitment sites within the UR to Table G1 . UR Mean Enrollment, Trial Consortia, 2011 -2014 NIH Trial Consortium mean enrollment HIV Vaccine Group (NIAID) 90 enrollments/ yr AIDS Clinical Trials Group (NIAID) 60 enrollments/yr Alzheimer's Disease Studies (NIA) 20 NeuroNext (NINDS) 1 trial completed, planned 10, enrolled 12 of 255 (28 sites) Table G2. NeuroNext Start Up Experience Study Days to Contract Days to IRB Approval Ibudilast in MS 8 14 Rituximab in MG 57 9 RHAPSODY - Stroke 126 14 assess the implementation logistics and potential efficiencies. While that pilot was illuminating regarding local needs and obstacles, we await the NCATS TIC and RIC creation before establishing a new local CTMS. We, in the intervening time, propose enhanced centralized tracking of study activation and recruitment performance, via implementing a Tracking Database in OnBase, a currently installed data management system. We established a Clinical Research Review Process Improvement Team (CRRPIT) in 2006 to improve institutional efficiency (Table G3) . Representatives from the University Offices of Human Subject Protection, Research Project Administration and Counsel all attend so the Team can implement changes. We also recognize that initiation (or 'activation') of a trial is just the first step, and that efficient recruitment of participants, expert execution of study procedures, and retention of study participants are essential next steps. In 2010, the UR -CTSI formed a Recruitment Unit , within Community Engagement , that included expertise in participant engagement, health policy, and cultural competency. In May 2013, the Recruitment Unit launched the OPENDOOR Health Research Website (funded by a supplement to our CTSA award) , creating an improved infrastructure for community participation in health research. OPENDOOR established communication that reduced the impact of barriers for r ecruitment by creating: 1) a web- based interface for a local participant registry and links to the national ResearchMatch.org registry, 2) a process for investigators to post their studies and for participants to search those studies, 3) a process for part icipants to complete an eligibility screen and communicate electronically with the study team, 4) a telephone number for questions about health research, 5) a website that the UR -CTSI can use to educate the community about the importance of research, linked to health education , and 6) media materials (public service announcements, posters, and brochures) to raise community awareness and to promote participation in health research. Since starting OPENDOOR, 428 participants have registered in the local regist ry and 390 of them have been contacted for a research study. In addition, 1237 local participants have registered in ResearchMatch.org, of the total 9,147 participants nationwide, the highest enrollment rate of all participating institutions. Since incepti on 342 studies have used the website and 120 investigators have used the registries to identify potential participants. In the past year alone, 169 participants have contacted the Participant Navigator interested in participating in research. The Recruitm ent Unit also supports investigators and research teams by providing expert consultation and a graduate -level course. Over 100 investigators/trainees have participated in or utilized these resources. In March 2015, a Research Engagement Specialist, Dr. Car rie Dykes was hired who manages the Recruitment Unit. Dr. Dykes also manages the CTSI Research Help Desk (see Administrative Core ) and sees all requests for research assistance. She proactively screens these requests and contacts investigators that may benefit from a recruitment and retention consultation. The U R-CTSI currently uses i2b2 to identify patients that meet particular study inclusion criteria. In the past year, there have been 45 i2b2 consults, 30 eRecord research consults and 284 investigators have completed the i2b2 training and accessed the tool. We have also developed an i2b2- to-RedCap interface (see Informatics Core) that allows investigators to obtain patient information so they can be contacted through their providers to participate in res earch. G.2 Aim 1: To establish a local Trial Innovation Unit , utilizing our experiences as both a hub and participating site in multi -center projects, to identify and streamline obstacles to trial initiation and conduct. G.2.1 Innov ation: We will develop a new Unit to monitor ongoing study metrics, take remediation actions with investigators and projects that demonstrate deficits, and guide all CTSA Consortium projects to collaborators. The UR -CTSI has had a strong interest in issues of tri al activation for the past decade, based on the challenges encountered by the institution in leading over 100 multi -center studies in Neurology, Cardiology and Table G3 . Selected Issues Resolved by Clinical Research Review Process Improvement Team Issue Brought to CRRPIT Resolution as Assisted by CRRPIT Involvement of Residents in Clinical Trial Recruitment Clarified guidelines with Residency Director IRB concerns about FDA non -hold comments on INDs Clarified meaning/impact of FDA IND comments for IRB Electronic health records access for site study monitors Codified legitimate use and restrictions Delay in obtaining institutional risk assessment for studies in which sponsor limits indemnification Established a Risk Assessment Review Committee that meets to take action as need for individual studies Necessity of clinical reads on images collected for a multi -site study utilizing central image -reading Determined local read not necessary Including VA sites in study with IRB reliance model Due to VA requirements not able to accommodate Charging subjects for device study participation Local site decided not to participate in the study other disorders. We were one of the first institutions to begin to rely on a Central IRB for our industry funded clinical trials in an effort to reduce review times. That said, our study activation locally is still in need of optimization. Reviewin g our experience with 12 Phase 3 trials in the first half of 2014, our IRB approval time was, on average, 72 days (range 32 -168). Contract approval times had a large variability with an average of 102 days (range 4- 164), which may be improved with a broader utilization of the master contracting process, as demonstrated by our NeuroNext experience. The first patient was enrolled, on average 82 days after study activation, but there was an outlier for a rare cancer of 368 days. Excluding that outlier the average time to first enrollment was 50 days. At present (1 year later) 60% of predicted enrollment (96/164 subjects) has occurred. In order to improve our local activation efficiency, and to be able to consistently serve the CTSA Consortium , we will codify our current activities into a local Trial Innovation Unit to draw on the accumulated expertise and diverse skill set available in Rochester. The Trial Innovation Unit will oversee 4 functions: G.2.2 Sub -Aim 1.a: Implement a database to track all relevant trial milestones including IRB and contract milestones, as well as trial conduct metrics of enrollment, protocol violations, and financial status, in an effort to improve trial efficiency . After piloting a CTMS (Bio -optronics - see above)) we believe that the most relevant technology now will be a new tracking system (using OnBase, an existing University data management asset) to monitor all IRB applications, contract proposals, and to capture enrollment status and fiscal data for all UR clinical trials. This tool will trac k in a single 'dashboard': IRB submission and approval dates, contract submission and approval dates, date of clinicaltrials.gov and OPENDOOR posting, study enrollments and protocol violations (from IRB and ORPA data), and study account financial status. B iweekly status reports on the IRB and contract process will be sent to investigators and reviewed by the Unit , and CRRPIT will review all trials monthly to identify poor performance. Recommendations for trial remediation or modification, based on inadequat e performance, will be made to the Vice Dean for Research. This system of review and intervention will be in place by the end of 2016. G.2.3 Sub -Aim 1.b: Maintain a Clinical Research Review and Process Improvement Team to monitor for and resolve institutional impediments to research implementation.

Clinical Research Review and Process Improvement Team (CRRPIT) which includes all members of the Trial Innovation Unit as well as active study investigators and the Research Privacy officer. This Team was created 8 years a go to monitor and resolve impediments in the research approval process. Study investigators who identify procedural impediments are asked to present to the Team, who is then empowered to implement further study of the issue and to change processes to improve efficiency. As part of efficiency initiatives, the University has fully committed to accepting a Central IRB in a reliance model, as previously agreed to in other NIH consortia, and to the acceptance of NCATS master contracts, which we have had a major role in creating, as attested to by the responsible Institutional Official, Dr. Rob Clark the University Senior Vice President for Research (See Letter of Support, Clark). G.2.4 Sub -Aim 1.c: Actively seek complementary CTSA Consortium projects for which the Rochester region can effectively contribute as an enrolling site. Dr Dykes (Research Engagement Specialist) will serve as the point of contact for the RICs and TICs once established by NCATS. As trial opportunities and new processes are developed, she will bring them to the Trial Innovation Unit, and NC Core director as needed, for consideration. In conjunction with the Recruitment Unit, the Trial Innovation Unit will ascertain the ability of the UR-CTSI resources to effectively contribute to the project. As appropriate we will involve the Practice Based Research Network , UNYTE and our Buffalo CTSA colleagues in developing a regional strategy. G.2.5 Sub -Aim 1.d: Distribute our developing capabilities and technologies, across multiple disease areas, within the Network and to complement national NCATS TIC efforts . As outlined in the Informatics and Community and Collaboration Cores, the UR -CTSI has unusual strengths in mobile technology to i mprove trial efficiency . 15-20 Two Novel mobile applications for smart phones were developed in Rochester (one for remote PD data generation - Apple mPower, and the other for Ebola epidemic tracking) ; novel visualization algorithms were developed to detect atrial fibrillation by Apple Face Time; Android applications were created to track motor per formance (e.g. gait) data continuously ; and we have utilized virtual research visits in PCORI - and foundation- funded clinical trials to ease subject burden and reduce research costs. As we further demonstrate the utility of these technologies we will disseminate them through the Trial Innovation Unit to the NCATS TICs. Our Optional Function H2 on Regulatory Science and Precision Medicine will help address how these technologies can be utilized in therapeutic development G.2.6 Trial Unit Management . The Unit will be led by Karen Rabinowitz JD and Ray Dorsey MD. Ms. Rabinowitz was appointed February 2015 as Assistant Dean for Research Administration and Regulatory Affairs, under the supervision of Dr Kieburtz, in his role as Senior Associate Dean for Clinical Research. She also attends the University Conflict -of-Interest and Senior University Research Group (SURG) meetings, which include the Research Deans of all University Schools . Ms. Rabinowitz 's additional areas of responsibility include: assisting with in stitutional risk assessment for RSRB protocols, assisting with data management including new & emerging mandates on data integrity & data sharing (such as FISMA) , attending Privacy and Security Executive Committee Meetings, and assisting with animal and bi osafety compliance (UCAR and IBC) as requested by the Vice Dean for Research. Dr . Dorsey is the Director of the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics and has developed multiple innovations in clinical trials including virtual study visits and smartphone data capture. He has led the Clinical Trials Methodology and Technology development efforts in the UR-CTSI since 2013. The Unit will also include the School of Medicine Director of Research Quality and Compliance (S . Zaccaglino), and the Directors of the Office s of Research Project Administration (ORPA -G. Liders), of Human Subject Protection (K . O'Donoghue), and the Research Subjects Review Board (T. Gommel), all of whom report to Dr. Rob Clark . G.3 AIM 2 : To expand our Recruitment Unit to successfully interact with the CTSA RICs, and to provide expertise in the ethics, communications, informatics and patient engagement necessary for participant recruitment. G3.1 Innovation : We will develop additional techniques (beyond our current web- based materials) to reach the community about research opportunities including targeted media campaigns, and create new mechanisms for participant feedback about research experiences to improve our research processes. The current RIC or TIC advance a project Research Engagement Specialist contacts Trial Innovation Unit Trials Unit reviews for competition with present studies and contacts Cores RM:BERD, CC:MTS, and Informatics: i2b2/EHR review the project re investigators and patient volumes Trial Unit and Research Engagement Specialist develop collaboration plan Research Engagement specialists advises RICs and TICs of UR CTSI capabilities and capacity Figure G1 . Work Flow of RIC and TIC Proposed Projects Recruitment Unit , initiated in our Community Engagement activities, will expand in order to successfully interact with the Recruitment Innovation Centers. We will coordinate with the Informatics Core to utilize their electronic health record (EHR) research expertise to support the study team in identifying potential parti cipants using the i2b2 interface and will also help the team plan their recruitment and retention strategy. We will also coordinate with Optional Function H1 to understand how individuals traverse the clinical, and eventually clinical research, environment . Our Recruitment Unit will also : 1) provide access to tools to monitor recruitment and improve the proportion of evaluable participants , and 2) will work with the study teams to assure appropriate recruitment data tracking and metrics. The Recruitment Unit will also disseminate best practices to our local investigators. We will support the recruitment of participants in the following ways: G.3.2 Sub -Aim 2.a: Provide investigator and research team consultations in recruitment strategies The Unit has prov ided recruitment and retention expertise through 17 consultations in the past 6 months to investigators and their teams to help them refine their strategies and tactics including methods to effectively engage underrepresented and special populations. For example, investigators in the Neonatology Unit were having problems reaching subjects for a 2 year visit due to the long gap of time between birth and year 2. After consulting with the Recruitment Unit they increased their contact with study subjects, and initiated an effort to integrate research into the clinical activities of the Unit. They now have a >90% retention rate. Dr. Dykes will schedule meetings with all new faculty, learn about their research program s and provide relevant UR-CTSI resources . This tailored approach will focus on recruitment and retention needs and resources, with a particular emphasis on integrating special populations , with Community Engagement and Hub Research Capacity Cores. G.3.3 Sub -Aim 2.b: Identify, deploy and educate about novel and best practices in recruitment methods and technologies . The unit will prioritize the identification of novel methods of recruitment (within and outside our institution), will provide technical assistance to investigators and their teams to support adoption of these methods , and will make these methods available to other CTSA hubs. For example, Dr. Dorsey is using a novel consent application for smartphones (mPower) that is completed entirely electronically , and is conducting a PCORI -funded study with virtual research visits (by video). Drs. Pollard and Barnett (Hub Research Capacity -ISP) ha ve developed a consent process for the deaf and hard of hearing. We will adapt these technologies to the recruitment of patients , particularly in underser ved and rural locations, to increase the participation. The Recruitment Unit will also provide evidence- based training and tools for investigators to include in their recruitment plans. The Recruitment Unit offers a graduate course (PM 419 Recruitment and Retention of Subjects into Clinical Research) that will be offered to all TL1 and KL2 trainees, any investigator who receives UR- CTSI funding support, and as an elective for the Public Health Sciences Advanced Certificate in Trial -based Clinical Research. Students learn to critique clinical research recruitment and retention methodologies and strategies, understand federal and regulatory issues relative to recruitment and retention, assess the effectiveness of recruitment and retention strategies and tactic s used in clinical research, and compare different models or conceptual approaches to recruitment and retention. The Unit will also develop new workshops and online educational resources to help investigators conduct feasibility analyses and optimize their recruitment plans. G.3.4 Sub -Aim 2.c: Enable patient engagement in research: communication about trial opportunities, data and experiences . In collaboration with Collaboration and Community Core, the Recruitment Unit will provide health research education to the UR health system patients about the importance of participating in research. As our health system expands we include patients from outlying/rural areas. With 47 investigators using our i2b2- RedCap interface to obtain subject contact and provider in formation, it would speed recruitment if they could contact potential subjects directly. In collaboration with the Informatics Core, we will enable the use of the existing MyChart patient portal for patients to agree to be contacted directly for research by study investigators (versus by providers), and record this in their electronic health record. We will also consent patients to be directly contacted for research through outpatient clinics that are part of our health system. Therefore, when feasibility s earches are performed for potential participants for future trials, investigators will know which patients can be contacted directly and which will necessitate access through their primary physicians. To supplement this effort, the Recruitment Unit will launch a marketing plan in collaboration with the UR Medicine using our already developed materials (print media; radio; television spots) to raise awareness across the community about the importance of research participation and how to volunteer for existin g and future research opportunities. The marketing plan will include a notification about available clinical trials for patients who have opted- in to participate in research, using individualized communication including social media. They will also receive a newsletter (quarterly) that will include potential clinical trials, new study results and health research educational materials. We will also expand our existing GotHealth community lecture series in community venues (see Community Engagement). We previously formally assessed the community's attitudes and knowledge about health research through a survey conducted by the Recruitment Unit .21,22 This survey was conducted in 2010 and 2012 and collected demographic information as well as opinions about research, motivations for participating in research, willingness to complete different types of study procedures, such as blood draws, and past clinical research participation. Key findings were that r acial and ethnic subgroups differed in motivation for participation. This tool will allow us to determine the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns in the community, to determine if attitudes change. Our program will include prompting URMC investigators , particularly those who have used the health research website, to disseminate their study findings, including an option to post on the website or our Facebook page. Dr. Kieburtz, the Core Director, has pioneered teleconferencing methods to reach hundreds of research participants simultaneously to rapidly disseminate research findings and learn of participant experiences . 10 Utilizing a tool established through a multi -hub CTSA initiative , in which UR participated ,12,13 to collect satisfaction data from research participants, we will make assessments shortly after initial enrollment to assess the recruitment and initial engagement experience and then again at the end of study participation to assess the overall experience with the investigative team, study requirements etc. These findings will be summarized and provided to investigators and in aggregate , used by the Recruitment Unit to identify areas for improvement. G.3.5 Sub -Aim 2.d: Participate in, and implement policy changes, driven by the Trial Innovation Unit . The Recruitment Unit will participate in the biweekly review of dashboard data, and also evaluate the feasibility analyses and recruitment plans of all protocols to ensure that the target enrollment (including planned gender, racial and ethnic diversity) can be reached. This r eview will take place alongside the IRB review so as not to delay IRB approval. The Recruitment Unit will improve the current OPENDOOR Health Research Website to further simplify ease- of-use for research teams and potential participants, and will assist the Trial Innovation Unit to link it to the OnBase system as described above, to ensure that all appropriate clinical trials are posted to the website. We will implement any needed institutional policy changes and revise processes to provide clinical study o peration and performance data to investigators. We will directly connect investigators with potential volunteers in a way that adheres to institutional principles, ethics and policies and will ensure a positive experience for participants. G.3.6 Recruitment Unit Management . Dr. Dozier will lead the LRIC function. Core members of the team are Dr. C. Dykes Recruitment Unit Coordinator, K . Vitale and N . Needler. The Unit will convene biweekly to assess progress on milestones, and meet in consultation with investigators on demand. A pre -IRB submission review process will be available to investigators through our consultation mechanism. Post -submission, Dr . Dykes will coordinate her review/assessment of the recruitment plan with Core members of the Recruitment Unit and will involve them directly if deficiencies are found to provide recommendations for protocol modification to the study team and IRB.

TRANSLATIONAL NETWOR SCIENCE - SPECIFIC AIMS A key goal of NCATS is to develop novel methods for translational science that will lead to improvements in the functioning of teams, both in the conduct of team science and in improving population health. Common to both of these domains is the methods of network science, which are emerging as essential tool s for studying com- plex networks (e.g. healthcare delivery s ystems, research teams, gene regulatory networks). Not only are these methods being used in translational research, but they are increasingly emerging as key tools for meas- uring outcomes in team science: team formation, cohesiveness, multi- faceted relationships. We will extend and further develop these met hods for translational research using our strengths in network science ,1-14 analysis of large data sets ,15-23 and high performance computing. The University of Rochester is an emerging leader in network science, with st rengths in graph theory ,1-14 data science,17,20,24,25 mobile device computing for healthcare,26-28 metrics of scientific collaboration. We propose to bring together the University of Rochester I n- stitute for Data Science, the Rochester Center for Health Inform atics, and the Department of Public Health Sc i- ences to create an Optional Function in translational network science that will develop, apply and disseminate novel network science methods , develop and implement a core curriculum in translational research network methodologies , and disseminate these resources to the CTSA network through the Methods and Processes Domain Task Force . Despite the emergence of network science as a key tool in performing and evaluating translational research, few integrated courses exist for translational science trainees. Thus the overall goal of this Optional Function is to develop a Translational Network Science program that supports translational r e- search and workforce training throughout the CTSA Network . Our Specific Aims include: Aim 1 : To develop novel graph theory and network science methods focused on translational science. We will develop the core function of network science analytics specific to questions in translational science. Our work will focus on the patient healthcare journey, and the translational investigator and team journey : a. Extend our novel translational network methods to study the patient healthcare journey: We will apply network analytics to the path that patients t ake through the healthcare system, in hospital and in a network. We will develop methods for constructing multipartite patient networks from a variety of da- ta sources, including insurance claims data, EMR data, and patient self -reported data. Using network analytics and graph isomorphism, we will compare patient journeys within the hospital , and identify pa- tients at high risk for adverse outcomes ( e.g. return to the ICU, death) . We will then extend these methods to study how underserved and diverse p opulations navigate the healthcare system, and de- velop methods for associat ing these paths with outcomes. These m ethods will be disseminated to the CTSA network by collaborating on analysis with other centers, and dissemination with the Domain Task Forces. b. Develop quantitative network analytic methods to study the process of team science in the context of the team and investigator path/journey : Using 10 years of UR -CTSI data measuring col- laboration between researchers, we will examine the dynamics of transl ational research networks, and the effect CTSI Cores (pilot programs, TL1, KL2) has on how teams arise, become sustainable (attain funding, publications and attract new members. We will use network science, specifically the represen- tation of investigators and teams along a \"path\", mapping interactions with team members, resources, and milestone events (e.g. IRB submission, grant submission, publications). These metrics will then be tested locally, and in partnership with the CTSA network . Aim 2: To develop and implement a curriculum in network science relevant to translational research , including courses across the translational workforce integrated with current UR -CTSI and NCATS Consortium activities (TL1, KL2, seminar series, post -graduate course work). The emerging field of net- work science is fast becoming a core research tool for specific questions that involve relationships between molecules, patients, healthcare providers, and populations. Using our current foundational work of Aim 1, we will develop an educational pro gram to teach core competencies in Network Modeling for Translational Sci- ence. Novel teaching methods will include development of traditional and online courses aligned with NCATS focus areas including: special populations, collaboration and community involvement, informatics, and integr a- tion. Courses will be developed over 5 years, and will be taught within the Translational Science graduate and certificate programs. A series of use cases will be developed, along with exerci ses. These will be available as fully transparent and reproducible \"computational documents\", manuscripts that contain not only the text de- scribing the project, but all of the data and computer code needed to recreate the study. OPTIONAL FUNCTION H1. TRANSLATIONAL NETWORK SCIENCE - RESEARCH STRATEGY H1.1 Background : The development of network science over the last decade has seen tremendous advances in our ability to analyze complex relationships, and to detect correlations among related sets of data. These analytic methods have allow ed UR-CTSI researchers to monitor transmissible diseases using networks creat- ed from mobile technologies ,26-31 assess institutional research culture,32 examine suicide risk using social net- work data,33 find the structure of hard -to reach community populations ,34 examine gene regulatory networks ,22,23 assess connectivity of researchers by publications ,35-37 and discover the basic principles of net- work growth1,2,7 (publications referenced are all from UR -CTSI investigators). These methods and their applic a- tions to medical science are now leading to new paradigms in pathology ,38,39 genomic research ,40-42 human disease classification,39 and the emerging translational research field of Systems Medicine.43 Thus, there is a press ing need to explore and adapt these methods for translational research, and to create an educational program in the core competency of network analytics within the UR -CTSI and the CTSA consortium.

Zand MD PhD , PI of the UR -CTSI, and Director of the Rochester Center for Health I n- formatics , will lead the program . He has extensive experience in network science across the translational spec- trum from gene regulatory networks to healthcare networks. Ghorab Ghoshal PhD , a physicist and reco g- nized expert in network science, will collaborate on developing new analytic methods. Henry Kautz PhD , di- rector of the University of Rochester Institute for Data Science will contribute his extensive expertise in m a- chine learning and analysis of geospatial information. Timothy Dye PhD , Director of the Informatics Core in the CTSI will co ntribute expertise in integration of EMR data with netw ork outcomes and analysis. Ann Dozier PhD, leader of the Metrics and Evaluations Function and Chair of the Department of Public Health Sciences , will provide her expertise in analysis of scientific col laborative networks. This Optional Function is organized into two Aims . In the first Aim, we leverage our existing expertise to devel- op network science methods specifically for translational research in t wo areas: graph theory analysis of pa- tient journeys and network analysis based metrics of team science. In the second Aim, we will create online modules and course material specific to Translational Network Science, as well as bring together investigators in the CTSA network via an annual conference t o discuss the application of Translational Network Science and incorporation of competencies into the standard translational research toolbox. Institutional commitment to the network science of translational research. The University of Rochester Medical Center has recognized this need, and invested substantially in research and education in network science, and this support extends to the proposed program in Translational Network Science. Advanced development and research in network science, specifically in the domain of healthcare journeys, requires processing of terabytes of healthcare information , and the UR supercomputing facilities will make this possible. This is one benefit of a University -wide strategic plan, with a $150 million invest ment in the Institute for Data Science, faculty recrui t- ment (including specifically in network science), and new workforce trai ning programs, including biomedical informatics and computational science degree programs with substantial UR -CTSI involvement. In addition, the UR has established in the last 5 years Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC) and the Health Sc i- ence Center for Computational Innovation (HSCCI). The CIRC houses an IBM BlueGene/2 supercomputer system, which is ranked the 5 th most powerful academic supercomputer in the United States. Two academic research centers at URMC are at the forefront of these efforts: The Rochester Center for Health Informatics (RCHI) and the Center for Health and Experimental Therapeutics (CHET). The mission of the RCHI, founded in August 2014, is to develop graph theory and network science methods for analyzing healthcare networks and patient journeys through the healthcare sy s- tem. Dr. Martin Zand, also PI of the CTSI, serves as the director, providing a direct link between the CTSI and the RCHI. Compl e- mentary to this is CHET, whose mission is to conduct hypothesis -driven, rigorously de- signed, initial investigations of novel ther a- peutic interventions for human diseases. N o- tably, Dr. Ray Dorsey (Trials Innovation Unit Function co -Leader) led a team that devel- oped a mobile application for measuring motor function in Parki nson's disease that enrolled over 15,000 sub- jects from all over the US within 4 weeks of release, and was r ecently honored by the White House for innov a- tion in translational biomedical research. H1.2 Significance: This proposal is significant in that it addresses a gap in current translational research methods and workforce training at UR -CTSI, and across the CTSA consortium It brings cutting edge and highly innovative methods (network theory, graph isomorphism) and technologies (graph analytic software, associative database technology, geospatial network soft- ware) into the translational science \"toolbox .\" It addres ses a pressing need to develop integrated training in an emerging, but currently poorly accessible , translational science core competency (translational network science) . Uses of network science have high utility and application across the five NCATS goals , the three major components of the UR -CTSI (U01, TL1, KL2), and our Overall Specific Aims (Integration, Collaboration and Engagement, Methods and Processes, and Informatics) . Development of an integrated program in translational network science, both at our own institution and across the CTSA consortium. H1.3 Innovation: We will develop network analytics that are tailored to specific translational science topic areas (population health, healthcare delivery, team science) , harnessing to power of parallel c omputing to build networks from terabytes of EMR, claims, and other data using the UR high- performance computing facilities. It brings cutting edge and highly innovative informatics methods (network theory, graph isomo r- phism) and technologies (graph analytic software, geospatial network software) into the CTSA network and translational science \"toolbox\" as they are emerging . We will use novel Open Science technologies that package all of the analytics and data needed to reproduce network analysis findings within the research document, advancing the reproducibility of translational network research. H1.4 AIM 1: To develop novel graph theory and network science methods for translational science. Background: The concept of a patient journey, the sequence over time of places, procedures, tests, medic a- tions, encountered by an individual within the healthcare system, provides both a data structure which captures the sequential events and state changes in the health of a patient, and suggests new translational science ana- lytic methods. Network science approaches make it possible to identify otherwise hidden relationships between patients based on the form of their journey, and associate these with outcomes in translat ional researc h stu d- ies. While c urrent translational research uses multivariate statistical models (e.g. ANOVA, survival analysis), time-series analysis, and data mining methods (e.g. multidimensional clustering) exist, these methods do not capture the dependencies, connections and paths that individuals take through treatment of an illness, hospi- talization, or utilization of the healthcare network. Extending network science to such translational domains will be of great value to NCATS, proving a unique set of methodolog ies applicable to translational research. In co n- trast, we propose to extend path -graph analysis, graph theory and machine learning methods to applications in the translational research realm. If successful, we will have added a new class of methods to the translational research \"toolbox\", both at the UR -CTSI and at the NCATS Consortium level. Table H1 .1.

Specifically, we have ident i- fied a group of patients that have multiple transfers to different functional hospital locations during their stay, which can be modeled by acyclic path graphs. Using two years of data (Figure H1.3 ), we have derived a weighted, directed, unipartite, cyclic, network graph of the entire hospital. Preliminary analysis of this network has identified patient paths and unit k -cliques highly correlated with rare outcomes (e.g. readmission to the i n- tensive care unit, cardiac arrest, re- admission to the hospital after discharge) . We will extend this work by codi- fying translational research methods that allow investigators to explore the relationship between topological complexity of patient journeys with out comes a nd integrated health data (laboratory results, diagnoses , pre- scriptions, provider teams) using our Informatics Core (i2b2, REDCap) and UR high performance computing resources. In collaboration with the Institute for Data Science (Dr. Henry Kautz) , we will also develop machine learning approaches for incorporation of asynchronous and sparse clinical data in graph analysis for modeling and prediction of adverse patient outcomes. We will then pilot our methods with other CTSA network hubs to validate the findi ngs for other hospitals within the CTSA network. If successful, we will provide expertise in novel methods that associate graph topology with multi -dimensional clinical data, add a new dimension to ou t- comes research, and provide personalized medical risk p rediction. H1.4.1 Sub-Aim 1.a: Extend our novel translational network methods to study the patient healthcare journey: We propose to couple graph theoretical descriptions of patient journeys to outcomes, beginning at the hospital level and extending this to use cases in community health. The concept of a patient \"journey\" as a temporal sequence of interactions with the healthcare system has been present in the literature for decades. However, the overwhelming majority of quantitative work has been limited in scope to operations research and critical pathway analyses. Operations research models have generally focused on managing the flow of pa- tients through hospital locations using stochastic simulations and queuing theory , 44-49 resource utilization and staffing using numerical optimization methods , 44,50,51 and systems occupancy management for surge planning (emergency services , hospital occupancy, etc.) . 50,52-54 Optimal design of patient care pathways has often been non-quantitative and focused on the \"ideal\" series of interactions and timings for to improve outcomes for spe- cific conditions . 55,56 More recently, graph theoretical methods have been used at the patient level in the con- text of social network analysis: of behaviors, network epidemiology models of infectious disease transmission, and the merging of these two methods to examine the social network \"contagion\" phenomenon of medical conditions such as obesity and depression. 57-63 However, such analyses have been criticized by some as they Figure H1.2. The patient journey. In each of these path- graphs, the nodes (circles) represent a physical location within the hospital, and the edges (arrows) represent the movement of a patient from one location to the next. ER = emergency room, ICU = intensive care unit, FL = lower acuity medical floor, SDU = step- down unit, HO = home, DT = death. Some journeys (A) are acyclic, meaning that the patient does not \"loop\" or return to a previous location. Other journeys (B) show a patient being re- admitted to an intensive care unit or (C) with multiple ICU readmissions. The formal graph classification (acyclic, cyclic, complex cyclic) is noted for each. Figure H1.3. A sampling of patient jour- ney graphs taken from 241,494 in hos- pital patient journeys over a 24 months at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Each node represents a hospi- tal destination (e.g. ICU, ER, floor), with the terminal nodes representing a hos- pital discharge destination (e.g. home, death, nursing facility). Data represents a selection of 72 patient journey graphs from 431 unique journey archetypes identified in the dataset. Patterns with \"loops\" were associated with longer hospital stays, higher mortality, worse functional outcomes, and higher hosp i- tal costs. were conducted on data sets that violate dependency and other fundamental statistical assumptions .64-66 These examples demonstrate the specific need for development of methods in the use of graph and network theory for inferential analysis in translat ional science and healthcare . 67-69 We will apply network analytics to the path that patients take through the healthcare system, in hospital and in network. We will develop methods for constructing multipartite patient networks from a variety of data sources, including insurance claims data, EMR data, and patient self -reported data. This will be done in collaboration the CTSI Informatics Core, and the Rochester Center for Health Informatics. Using network analytics and graph isomorphism, we will compare patient journeys within the hospital and t hrough the outpatient community healthcare system , and by coupling outcomes and other EMR data, we will identify patients at high risk for ad- verse outcomes ( e.g. hospital admission, re turn to the ICU, death ). We will then extend these methods , with input and use cases from the Community and Collaboration Core, into several domain areas: Developing geospatial path analyses of subject interactions with healthcare (e.g. providers, hospitals, etc.) and relevant non- healthcare locations (e.g. bodegas, grocery chains, fast food locations) to better study the multifactorial connections associated with obesity. This will be done in collaboration with Dr. Henry Kautz group using Twitter feed s that contain geolocation data and natural language processing. Develop methods to identify self -organized teams associated wi th better than expected patient outcomes. Develo p and validate measures of time -varying path complexity associated with study outcomes. Novel statistical methods that are consistent with the dependency conditions in networks will be developed with the input of the BERD Function within the Research Methods Core ( Dr. Robert Strawderman). Data for these studies will be gathered and de- identified with the assistance of the Informatics Core ( Dr. Tim Dye ). The Translational Network Science Function will work with the Research Help Desk and the Communication and Dissemination Program in providing network analysi s resources to UR investigators . Finally, we will work with the Collaboration and Engagement Domain Task Force Lead Team, on which Dr. Nancy Bennett , co-PI of the UR-CTSI ) serves, to disseminate these methodologies to the CTSA Consortium. H1.4.2 Sub-Aim 1.b: Develop quantitative network analytic methods to study the process of team sci- ence: The UR -CTSI has undertaken network analysis of sci entific collaboration since 2006 , using multiple data sources (Table N.1), we have chart ed the growth of research teams facilitated by the CTSI over 10 years and used multi -partite graph theory (multiple links between investigators such as grants, publications, self -identified collaborations) to explore research team for- mation within the UR-CTSI . Insights gained from standard network analysis have included (1) KL2-TL1-Investigator co-publication teams emerging as a direct result of CTSI involvement in these different realms ; (2) and steady increase in CTSI supported investigator collaboration, as measured by network traversal metrics (3) identification of new cross -disciplinary research collaborations at the extramural funding application stage. These standard network analytics have created the ability for the UR -CTSI to specifically connect individuals and collaboration networks for targeted research applications and sy nergy. We immediately recognized that the analysi s of patient journeys could be applied to investig ator career jou r- neys (Figure N.4.) , and using multi -graph analyses developed by Dr. Goroub Ghoshal to analyze team formation. This insight has led to the proposed extension of our Translational Network Science program to develop path -analysis and multi- partite graph th e- ory applications to the lifecycle of scientific teams and the career paths of i n- vestigators, with a goal of identifying advantageous (and deleterious) condi-tions and network topol o- gies for accelerating team formation and success. We will develop novel analytic methods to study how re- search teams move Table H1. 2.

(C) A network of related r e- source relationships derived from a multi - partite graph showing an investigator path (yellow). through the process and lifespan of executing a translational research project (Figure 4A). Using 10 years of UR-CTSI data measuring collaboration between researchers, we will examine the dynamics of translational research networks, and the effect of specific CTSI programs (pilot programs, TL1, KL2) on how teams become sustainable (attain funding, publications and attract new members. These metrics will then be tested locally, and in partnership with CTSA consortium . If successful, the UR -CTSI will contribute a new and highly novel network analysis method to the CTSA network, which is applicable to analyzing both pa tient journeys through the healthcare system and investigator and team journeys through the research system. Our contribution will provide a framework for translational network science. We will actively distribute these methods to the CTSA Consortium through the Methods and Processes Domain Task Force, an annual Translational Network Sc i- ence conference, and through online courses and web postings. H1.2 Aim 2: To develop and implement a curriculum in network science relevant to translational r esearch, including courses across the translational workforce int e- grated with current UR-CTSI and NCATS Consortium activities (TL1, KL2, seminar series, post -graduate course work). The CTSA network and NCATS currently lack a framework for incorporating Network Sc i- ence core competencies into translational r e- search. To address this issue, we will esta b- lish an education module that will be integrat- ed across the TL1 and KL2 programs, and opportunities for matching (see Hub Capacity Core) students and other investigators with faculty that have expertise and active research involving transl a- tional research network science with investigators methods. Module Development: We will begin by developing a series of modules (Table N.2) . Modules will be developed with Mathematica, which uses a format termed \"computational document format\" (CDF). Each CDF document is an integrated teaching module, and contains didactic material, with complete computer code and the data set embedded in the document. Students can execute the document and re- run the entire document using the Mathematica CDF Player (similar to the Adobe Acrobat Reader in concept). Students who have t he Mathema t- ica client can, in addition, modify, copy and re-use the programming code and data for other projects. The Uni- versity of Rochester has a student site license program, allowing students to obtain the Mathematica client free of charge. Dr. Zand has extensive experience in such teaching, and has published in the CDF format. Course Structure: The modules of the Translational Network Science course will initially be taught as a didactic seminar series within the CTSI. Each module will cons ist of a didactic lecture, with corresponding exercises, data and materials. In years 2 -5, some of the modules will be offered within the TL1 and KL2 course framework as individual lectures, thereby integrat ing the program across the CTSI. Online Education Format: Modules and data sets will then be posted on a dedicated UR CTSI Translational Network Science web page to allow any learner to access the course and materials. In Year 3, we will combine modules and multimedia material (videos of lectures, interactive web exercises) into a MOOC format. In this way, materials will be freely shared with other CTSA hubs. We will use similar approaches to expand across our workforce development programs. Open and Reproducible Science: NIH has recently introduced the S cientific Reproducibility Initiative, to i m- prove the reproducibility of scientific studies, and require public posting of data sets that form the basis of sc i- entific publications. 70 This is part of a general convergence of open science, open access publishing, and open data which are transforming research across the translational spectrum .71 Given that much network science, from genomics to social network research, uses publically available data sets, data accessibility and proveni- ence are often non -issues. Thus, n etwork science provides an opportunity for the UR -CTSI to lead in advanc- ing the Open and Reproducible Science agenda in a concrete fashion, by providing resources and consultation in software packages that allow for open science. Such software generally provides the ability to both access data sets used in publications (e.g. rOpenSci packages for the R programming language), to assemble your entire analysis, from statistics to plots and tables, within a single executable document (knitr, sWeave, Math e- matica ). Many of these packages are open source, and use the R programming language, which is rapidly be- coming the common language of scientific analytics for statistics, microarray data, and network analysis. Dr. Zand has experience with all of these packages. 72 Table H1.3.

To this end, we will actively use this Function as an opportunity to lead by example, us ing such documents for all course modules and posting them online under a GNU public use copyright notice. We will use the Transl a- tional Network Science function and course to provide a hands -on paradigm shift, leading by example within the UR -CTSI. In addition, we will promote the use of transparent, executable scientific documents as suppl e- mentary material to traditional scientific journals. Annual Translational Network Science symposium - Beginning in Year 2, we will host Translational Network Science symposium, the UR. The symposium will bring together researchers from basic network theory, to domain experts in areas of interest and relevance to the CTSA consortium. The format will be highly interac- tive, and include poster presentations by students and researchers within the UR -CTSI programs (pilot awar d- ees, researchers, TL1 and KL2 program students), as well as from institutions within the CTSA Consortium. Funding for the symposium will come from sponsorship by the Institute for Data Science, the Rochester Center for Health Informatics, and the University of Rochester Medical Center. H1.5. Summary: Timeline, Approach, Outcomes and Metrics of Success In summary, we will contribute to the development and dissemination of a foundational methodology and new tool for translational research, path analysis in translational network science. These methods will be of great value to the CTSA network, going beyond current methods, which have been based on standard social net-work analysis, by being able to describe and analyze how patients and researchers move through a network, associate those patterns with outcomes, and identify new barriers to good outcomes in healthcare and in trans-lational research. Our timeline and metrics are shown below. Table H1.4.

REGULATORY SCIENCE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE - SPECIFIC AIMS The goal of the Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine Optional Function is to better prepare the UR-CTSI, CTSA Consortium , FDA and NIH to address key challenges in Regulatory Science, which is the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA -regulated products, t o ultimately speed the translation of research to improve public health. This function will focus on FDA's identified Regulatory Science priority areas of 1) ensuring readiness to evaluate innovative and emerging technologies; and 2) stimulate innovation i n clinical tr ials and personalized medicine to improve product development and patient outcomes1. This goal will be achieved through developing, demonstrating and di sseminating science -based analysis to inform policy development and regulatory review, including new decision and review support tools. We will convene national stakeholders in a deliberative, live forum on pressing regulatory science topics. Working Groups will be established via the Methods and Processes Domain Task Force (DTF ) to identify and formulate topics in advance of the Forum. The Forum will provide recommendations to the CTSA PIs for review and then ultimately to policymakers, FDA and NIH regarding new regulatory approaches , review tools, research needs and policy changes to support improved evaluation o f these emerging technologies. This activity will include development of collaborative education models, case studies and experiential training opportunities for the regulatory and translational research workforce, integrated with current and proposed UR -CTSI a nd CTSA Consortium activities, including partnering with the FDA Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSIs), foundations, and FDA. The UR -CTSI recently led the collaborative development of competencies for Regulatory Science education and training programs and leads a CTSA -initiated Regulatory Science Workgroup. Additionally, UR - CTSI is uniquely positioned to address this need, leveraging current and proposed Regulatory Science research and training collaborations and existing partnerships with the FDA and CERSIs. T he specific aims of the Regulatory Sc ience to Advance Precision Medicine Optional Function are: Aim 1: To create a National Forum for Regulatory Science for evaluating and proposing new regulatory policies, approaches and tools , with an aim to advance precision medicine products. The new technologies of precision medicine, from personalized genomics to nanotechnology, are rapidly challenging the current conventions of regulatory review , based on regulating devices, pharmaceuticals and biological therapies designed to treat populations as opposed to individuals . A paradigm shift will be needed to ensure that precision medicine therapies are evaluated for safety and efficacy within a framework appropriate for treatments designed for an \"n -of-one\". To address this issue the following act ions are proposed: a. Identify and review key regulatory science issues impacting precision medicine. Precision medicine is recognized by the FDA and NIH as facing unique opportunities and challenges. During the following months, we will further validate these key regulatory science issues. Background position papers will be disseminated to the CTSA Consortium, NCATS, and the FDA, to create Working Groups within the Methods and Processes DTF to further develop Forum topics. b. Provide analysis and recommendations to inform new policies, decision tools, models and reviewer tools. The corner stone of this effort will be a two -day annual Regulatory Science Forum. The UR-CTSI will convene experts from the CTSA hubs, CERSIs, FDA, NIH, industry, foundations, patient and community groups to review and assess these key issues. Outputs will include proposed regulatory approaches, decision tools and polices for review by the CTSA PIs and then delivery to policymakers. c. Develop case studies and educational modules. The results of the Forum and W orking G roups (and leveraging other partners' efforts and existing resources) will be further utilized to develop case studies and educational modules for evaluating precision medicine technologies and methods. Aim 2: To d evelop an educational program that specifically addresses the regulatory science aspects of precision medicine. The UR -CTSI will utilize case studies and other educational modules developed in Aim 1 and integrate these materials into the UR -CTSI Regulatory Science Curriculum . We will shar e these resources across the CTSA hubs , utilizing novel teaching methods , such as online courses and experiential training opportunities . This approach leverages existing UR program s and regulatory s cience educational and trainin g initiatives proposed in the UL1, TL1 and KL2. The development and dissemination of these case studies, course offerings and training opportunities will build on partnerships with the other CTSA hubs, CERSIs, the PhRMA Foundation, Personalized Medi cine Coalition, FDA and NIH. Figure H2.1. Context for Precision Medicine OPTIONAL FUNCTION H2. REGULATORY SCIENCE TO ADVANCE PRECISION MEDICINE - RESEARCH STRATEGY H2.1 BACKGROUND US regulatory innovation has largely been reactive to tragedy and abuses. Protection of human subjects arose as an urgent topic after the abuses of Nazi medical experimentation, with the Declaration of Helsinki, and its subsequent modifications. The Belmont Report of 1976 further codified US policy on human subject research following revelations about medical research with the Tuskeegee and Willowbrook populations. While these innovations were well intended, and in many ways had their desir ed impacts, they were driven by reactions to past events as much as by careful future planning. Similar assertions can be made abou t Federal regulations concerning the development of new therapeutics. The init ial Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FD&C) of 1938, now generally refer red to by 21 United States Code, was driven by emerging safety issues in the food and cosmetics industries, as much as by drug safety. The ground breaking Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962 was also fueled by averted tragedy, when a reluctant FDA reviewer withheld approval of thalidomide (despite approvals in Europe and Canada) over safety concerns. This amendment led to the concept of requiring evidence of effectiveness, in addition to safety, as well as informed consent for clinical trials (a decade in advance of the Belmont Report). These novel advances were advocated for by a University of Rochester physician and clinical pharmacologist Louis Lasagana MD, who served as the chief consultant to the Congressional hearings concerning the amendment. His singular contributions have shaped the regulatory framework for developing new therapies for over 50 years. As inspir ing as this mix of reactivity to tragedy and scientific planning may be, it is sobering to consider that the statutory framework for assessing new therapies has advanced little in comparison to the major scientific advances in understanding the biological basis of disease and rational treatment. Impatience with the lack of regulatory reform is evident in the 21st Century Cures Act ('Cures Act'), passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on July 10, 2015, which calls for several major modifications to the current standards of assessments of new therapies. In surprising scientific detail, the current version of the Cures Act calls for (in Title II, subtitles C, D and G) specific modification to the FD+C Act with regard to precision medicine therapies, the us e of Bayesian statistics and adaptive trial designs, and for possible approval of antibiotics without human testing. Given the potential of such major revisions to the statutory framework for new product approval (drugs, biologics, devices and combinations of them with diagnostics), accurate and broad -based scientific consensus on the basis for such revisions is critically needed. Precision medicine, where therapeutic devices, agents and protocols will be designed for the specific biological nuances of small numbers or individual patients, is a primary driver of the need for such change (see Figure H2.1) . Additionally, precision m edicine can often involve the use of a combination of medical products to provide a tailored individualized treatment. Increasingly, an emerging technology or process (e.g., 3-D printing) may also be employed in prec ision medicine approaches. These innovations create regulatory s cience challenges and opportunities , both at a scientific and policy level , to ensure that products or processes are evaluated appropriately to ensure safety and efficacy. The importance and promise of p recision medicine has been recognized by many groups, including by the White House through the Precision Medicine Initiative , which involves key programs from the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, the FDA, and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. At the same time, FDA, NIH, industry, patients and other sta keholders have recognized that precision m edicine creates unique regulatory science challenges that require new approaches and tools to ensure advancements in this field. The national CTSA Consortium represents an unparalleled opportunity to generate scientifically sound positions on improving the regulatory process which may have dramatic and long lasting impacts on the future of translational research. Academia and industry will benefit from clear regulatory frameworks for developing new therapies, but may also be hindered by legislative or regulatory changes which are short sighted, or are less than rational. In the tradition of the sound scientific advice provided by Dr . Lasanga, we intend to serve as the national conveners of forums and workshops to generate state- of-the-science positions that can inform legislat ive and regulatory leaders engaged in formulating new policy , regulatory approaches and tools. The UR -CTSI has had a long interest in the intersection of precision medicine, translational research and regulatory science, including technical and policy challenges and promoting education and awareness of these issues. In 2009 the UR- CTSI sponsored the Genomics and Translational Medicine Symposium at the University of Rochester, which focused on pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. Speakers included Mara Aspinall (member of the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society), Teri Manolio (National Human Genome Research Institute), Amy Miller (Personalized Medicine Coalition), Kathy Behrens (membe r of President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Policy) and others from Merck, IBM, Roche, and Siemens. This was followed by the Biomarkers and Biorepositories in Translational Research Workshop held in 2010, that addressed issues regarding the development and use of biomarkers in clinical research and personalized medicine. Speakers included David Wholley (Biomarkers Consortium, FNIH) and other speakers from NCI, Roche and Merck. Subsequently, Personalized Medicine was developed as a new theme for the Process of Discovery course for fourth year medical students at URMC, including visiting lectures from leading researchers and policy experts from government, academia and industry (e.g., Dr. Bill Gahl, NIH, Dr. Dave Valle, Johns Hopkins Univ ersity). Finally, the current UR -CTSI Fall 2015 seminar series on \"Advancing Regulatory Science and Translational Science: Research, Training and Partnerships\" is engaging visiting regulatory science experts and collaborators such as Dr. Carol Linden (FDA) , Dr. Michael Rosenblatt (Merck), Dr. Emma Meagher (University of Pennsylvania- ITMAT) and Dr. Robert Meyer (University of Virginia). The UR -CTSI recently led an extensive collaborative process to develop competencies for Regulatory Science education and training programs 2 and leads an existing CTSA -initiated Regulatory Science Workgroup that includes ~15 CERSI's, the Reagan- Udall Foundation, the PhRMA Foundation, FDA, and NIH. In addition to experts in the UR -CTSI, the Regul atory Science Function will partner with complimentary centers at the UR, including the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics (CHET), Department of Public Health Sciences (PHS) and the Center for Medical Technology Innovation (CMTI). CHET conducts hy pothesis -driven, rigorously designed, initial investigations of novel therapeutic interventions for human diseases. Dr. Kieburtz is currently affiliated with CHET and was the founding Director. The UR health policy research and educational programs are ba sed in PHS, and the proposed Regulatory Science Certificate program will be administered in PHS, with Dr. Steele as the Program Director. The CMTI (Dr. Adamo is affiliated with the CMTI) supports the translation of multidisciplinary applied education and research to medical device development to improve patient care, particularly by providing technology driven training opportunities and partnering with industry. Dr. Steele will lead this new core. He joined the University of Rochester in 2008, previously s erving as the Executive Director of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Policy (PCAST) and coordinated the 2008 PCAST study and report on Personalized Medicine. He previously organized and led (or co-led) the UR precision medicine initiatives listed above. More recently Dr. Steele, along with Dr. Adamo (formerly of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research), have led a number of national and local Regulatory Science initiatives, including the development of the Regulat ory Science competencies and developing a proposed Regulatory Science Certificate program at the University of Rochester. H2.2 SIGNIFICANCE Precision medicine has become a national initiative and this proposal addresses an identified pressing need by FDA and NIH to develop and enhance regulatory science approaches to advance the use of precision medicines. It also provides an integrated program within the UR -CTSI (U L1, TL1, KL2), while aligning with our local and national initiatives via the Regulatory S cience Workgroup working with CTSA hubs, CERSIs, the PhRMA Foundation, FasterCures, the Reagan- Udall Foundation, industry, NIH, FDA, patients and other organizations. H2.3 INNOVATION This function provides recommendations to inform policy development and regulatory review, as well as regulatory science research and technology needs to advance precision medicine. We will develop real -world regulatory science case studies that are tailored to specific topics and challenges for precision medicine. We propose to address this need by specifically focusing on two of the FDA's identified Regulatory Science Priority Areas that are critical for precision medicine: 1) ensuring readiness to evaluate innovative and emerging technologies; and 2) stimulate innovation in clinical tr ials and personalized medicine to improve product development and patient outcomes . 1 Advancing precision medicine r equires informed and adaptable regulatory s cience approaches . This can be aided by regulatory science policy analysis , to inform policy development and regulatory review , including decision and review support tools . Additional efforts will focus on nimble educational programs linked with core competencies and case studies though the UR -CTSI and the broader CTSA and FDA CERSI Network. The goal will be t o support patient -centric regulatory decision- making approaches in the development and review of emerging medical products and processes. The goals of this Regulatory Science Function will be achieved through developing, demonstrating and disseminating sci ence -based policy approaches and tools to support improved d evelopment and evaluation of personalized or precision medicine technologies. This function includes two Aims . Aim one is focused on identifying, analyzing and addressing key regulatory s cience i ssues or topics facing precision medicine. The output of this aim will be regulatory science policy analysis, recommendations and decision tools for the CTSA Consortium , FDA, NIH and other stakeholders , and relevant case studies for each issue to support education and training initiatives . The second aim will utilize these case studies , and other on- going initiatives , to develop an educational program that specifically addresses the regulatory science aspects of precision medicine. This approach will include collaborative education models and experiential training opportunities for the regulatory and translational research workforce, integrated with current and proposed UR -CTSI and CTSA Consortium activities (TL1, KL2, seminar series, post -graduate course work), including working with our partners mentioned above. H2.4 APPROACH AIM 1: To create a national forum for regulatory science for evaluating and proposing new regulatory policies, approaches and tools, with an aim to advance precision medicine products. Policymakers and regulatory agencies look to the scientific community to provide rational and unbiased advice about pending actions. E stablished groups, such as the Institute of Medicine will often be called upon to address issues identified by Congress and the Executive branch. There is also a need to identify crucial issues to bring to policymakers and regulatory agencies before they can commission such studies. The CTSA Consort ium has an explicit mandate to improve the translational research process landscape, including the regulatory framework . Presently it lacks a coordinated mechanism to present the issues and relevant data, debate alternative actions, and present a consensus viewpoint on the best paths forward. We propose to create a National Forum on Regulatory Science with the specific goal of convening relevant stakeholders to debate issues and formulate recommendations on pressing regulatory science issues. H2.4.1 Sub-Aim 1.a: Identify and review key regulatory science issues impacting precision medicine. We propose t o initiate annual stand- alone two- day Forum conferences to tackle major regulatory science issues or topics (see Figure H2.2). Individual topics will be assigned to Working Groups comprised of members from interested hubs, who will then make recommendations for Forum conference topics, and report back on interim progress. Such W orking G roups w ill operate within the Methods and Processes Domain Task Force (DTF) (see letter of support, S. Khosla) . The priority topics are not static and will be responsive to emerging needs and continue to update and modify the list of key issues. Examples of possible topics include: 1. Evidentiary standards for 'precision medicine' - where the intervention may be a combination of (genetic) testing and combined interventions (drugs, biologics, devices) for very small populations, even single patients. Recent ex amples of such disorders are the specific genetic subtypes of Cystic Fibrosis, rare autosomal dominant forms of ALS and Alzheimer D isease (AD), and targeted oncology treatments . 2. Evidentiary standards for treating diseases before illness - genetic at risk status for serious illness (ovarian and breast cancer, familial AD, Huntington disease), where new concepts of balancing risk and benefit will be required.

Evidence quality for 'substantial evidence' - considering the use of response adaptive methodologies and non-frequentist statistical approaches that may afford efficiency at a potential cost of inferential certainty . 4. Regulatory requirements for clinical trials of devices and processes designed to create unique biologic agents (e.g. personalized tumor vacc ines) or precision devices used for generating individualized therapeutics (e.g. 3 -D printing of tissues or organs, synthesis of precision anti -sense RNA agents). The DTF Working Groups will provide additional background research and initial state -of-the-science position papers and analysis that will be developed and provided in advance of the Forum meeting each fall. H2.4.2 Sub-Aim 1.b: Provide analysis and recommendations to inform new policies, decision tools, models and reviewer tools. Building on the existing UR-CTSI led Regulatory Science Workgroup and previous experience in engaging experts in these fields, t he UR -CTSI wi ll assemble a range of experts from the CTSA hubs, CERSIs, FDA, NIH, industry, foundations , patient and community groups. We will also partner with FasterCures and the Personalized Medicine Coalition (see letter of support) to engage additional stakeholders in the process. The Forum will convene each fall to review and analyze major topic s identified by the Working G roups. A technical ly focused analysis and a policy analysis component, utilizing the background research and position papers developed by the Working G roups will be included. The general format for the Regulatory Science Forum is outlined in Table H2.1. A framework of key finding s and recommendations will be approved at the conclusion of the Forum. Following the annual meeting of the Forum, the UR -CTSI will quickly use the approved recommendations to generate final position papers and policy memos, providing a formal regulatory science policy analysis and recommendations to address the key barriers or future challenges for the development and implementation of precision medicine, examining how regulatory science can address these specific issues. We will propose a one day additional meeting at the annual CTSA PI meeting (December) to provide an opportunity to debate these key findings and final recommendations resulting from the Forum. Dr. Steele will coordinate the development and review of the short final position papers /memos that will be provided to all participa nts and disseminated more broadly through publication in the appropriate peer -reviewed journals, and as part of the minutes of the annual meeting. F inal position papers and policy memos will include proposed models and decision tools to support development and review of specific precision medicine technologies and methodologies. This will be diss eminated to the FDA, NIH, policymakers, and the CTSA Consortium . H2.4.3 Sub -Aim 1.c: Develop case studies and educational modules. Case studies and other educational modules , such as tutorials and policy analysis papers , are increasing ly being utilized for Regulatory Science programs . The FDA has collaborated to develop a limited number of targeted case studies. Discussion of case studies allows for vibrant debate and discussion at all levels of CTSA workforce development, as they can be tailored to specific translational science domains. Dr. Adamo will lead the development of the case studies and will engage our partner s to identif y and develop optimal case studies needed in precision medicine. These case studies will support education and training across a number of sectors and provide resources at varying career stages. Each case study will follow a general structure: Identify a current development in precision medicine that is likely to advance to the pre- clinical or clinical trials stage . Defin e the current evidentiary, regulatory and policy framework(s) that would be applied in this case for device or agent approval . Identify foundational issues that are likely to impede translation into an approved clinical therapy . Present an exercise to propose and analyze possible changes to current regulatory process that would address such issues (e.g., policy change, new review criteria, assessment tool, address technical gap) . A list of potential case studies is provided in Table H2.2. We will pilot these case studies in the UR -CTSI Regula tory Science courses and Certificate Program, as well as through regular seminars and presentations. The educational program outlined in Table H2.1. Format for Annual Regulatory Science Forum Day One: Morning Framing of issues (briefly review advance materials provided by DTF working groups) Breakout groups: analyze 2 -3 key issues and develop recommendations Day One: Afternoon Executive Group convenes: produce summary of key findings and recommendations Day Two: Morning Key findings and recommendations presented to Forum for feedback and concurrence Table H2 .2. Potential Case Studies Regulatory pathways for laboratory developed tests Issues to consider with clinical pharmacogenomics Balancing risk and benefit in precision medicine: new approaches to evidentiary standards Opportunities for next generation sequencing Acceptance criteria for adaptive trials Regulatory considerations for 3D printing of medical products Precision medicine and postmarket surveillance Aim 2 will focus on approaches to disseminate and integrate case studies into a range of programs at the UR - CTSI and across the CTSA Consortium . Dissemination will include development of an online curriculum and multi- modal learning tools in collaboration with the Translational Endeavors Core Workforce Development Function via Dr. Dolan . H2.5 APPROACH AIM 2: Develop an educational program t hat specifically addresses the regulatory science aspects of precision m edicine . At a national level, the UR -CTSI (Drs. Steele and Adamo) has led and participated in several collaborative efforts focused on Regulatory Science training and education, including the collaborative development of Regulatory Science competencies2 and other specialized competencies to guide the development of educational programs and training opportunities. This has built on the diverse partners represented in the CTSA -initiated Regulatory Science Workgroup mentioned previously. At a local level, Drs. Steele and Adamo have developed courses specially targeted to regulatory science and policy issues . These courses are core elements for the proposed UR Certificate in Regulatory Science. This aim will utilize the case studies and policy papers developed above and regulatory science experiential training opportunities to particularly address regulatory science needs to enhance precision medicine. We will leverage regulatory science training initiatives outlined in the UL 1, TL1 and KL2 and benefit from support from faculty currently leading regulatory science courses and related programs (Drs. Steele, Adamo and Fong) . Additional assistance will be provided from faculty s erving as mentors or leaders of the KL2 and TL1 programs (Drs. Gross, Kieburtz, Adamo and Steele) . The leader of the Tr anslational Endeavors Workforce Development Function (Dr. Dolan) will also serve as the overall Education Program Coordinator . Overall roles and responsibilities for key members of this core are listed in T able H2.3. The UR -CTSI will collaborate with the diverse membership of the existing Regulatory Science Workgroup to utilize the case studies and other educational modules developed in Aim 1 and integrate these materials into the UR -CTSI Regulatory Science Curriculum, while sharing these resources across the CTSA Consortium . This will also utilize the regulatory science training partnerships proposed in the UL1 and KL2 with the University of Pennsylvania Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT -see letter of support ) and the PhRMA Foundation (see letter of support) . The case studies will be integrated into Fundamentals of Science, Technology, and Health Policy (PM 494) and Pathways to Medical Innovation (BME 431/432). The case studies will provide real -life examples for trainees to consider the scientific technical and regulatory issues for an existing or emerging personalized medicine methodology or technology. Additionally, for science policy courses (such as PM 494), the policy analysis and position papers will also be utilized to further explore and consider the policy dimensions of these issues and opportunities to modify existing or propos e new legislation, regulations, guidance or other policies. The broader education program will employ novel teaching methods such as online c ourses and experiential training opportunities, integrating new modules into the proposed Regulatory Science Certificate , in collaboration with the Translational Endeavors Core Workforce Development Function. The existing Regulatory Science Workgroup and partnerships with the University of Pennsylvania ITMAT, and the PhRMA Foundation (detailed in UL1 and K L2) provide an ideal mechanism to receive additional feedback on the case studies to ensure they address clear needs from other academic institutions, FDA, NIH and industry. Additionally, it provides a rapid and well - established mechanism to disseminate t hese educational programs. Supplementing didactic course work and case studies with opportunities for experiential training opportunities (along with co-mentoring programs) is an additional key element we are developing for our broader regulatory science initiatives with ITMAT, PhRMA Foundation, FDA, NIH, CERSIs and other CTSA hubs , leveraging our Regulatory Science Translational Specialization in the KL2. We will identify regulatory science training opportunities that focus on precision medicine. This will further utilize programs developed in our UR Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training ( BEST ) program, where Table H 2.3.

KL2 CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM I.1 BACKGROUND I.1.1 The University of Rochester (UR) KL2 Career Development (UR -KL2) Program has had significant impact on the institution (2006 -2015) and will expand to promote the evolution of the clinical and translational investigator I.1.1.1 Institutional and individual impact of the existing UR-KL2 Program, 2006- 2015 Since inception in 2006, the UR Clinical and Translational Science Institute ( UR-CTSI) and UR -KL2 Program have been committed to training and developing a new kind of clinical and translational investigator who is equipped to design and execute high impact research across the spectrum of translation. The UR -KL2 Program is a core component of the UR- CTSI's overall mission to develop, demonstrate, and disseminate methods and approaches to advance translational research, by providing education and training, supporting transdisciplinary teams, improving quality and efficiency, and engaging community stakeholders. Between 2006 and 2015, the UR -KL2 Program has provided sufficient \"activation energy\" to launch the academic careers of 31 investigators (chosen from 124 total applicants), 58% (n=18) of whom were women and 12.9% (n=4) of whom were under -represented minorities (including one l). and research interests that span the translational spectrum \"from molecules to populations\" (e.g.: medicine, nursing, dentistry, psychology, epidemiology, and health services research). Of the 3 1 accepted UR-KL2 Scholar s (Scholars ), 26 faculty have been from the Medical School (124 applications) , 3 from the School of Nursing (8 applications) , and 2 from the Dental School (5 applications) . These Scholars hav e authored over 408 publications and have generated over $21 million external funding , which includes 21 NIH awards (8, K23; 2, K07; 2, K01; Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI ) grants , and 22 Foundation awards . Of the 24 current UR faculty to recently receive NIH-funded Individual Research Career Development Awards , 6 are former Scholars : Roman Eliseev (1K01AR064610- 01), Luke Peppone Pisani (1 K23 MH101449- 01). Additional information about Scholar accomplishments is available in DATA Table 12b. Much of this success has been attributable to the UR-KL2 Program 's Career Development Plan (and supporting administrative structure) , which includes required core elements ( core curriculum, mentored research project ) that fundamentally support faculty career development and individualized component s to meet the research -directed needs of each Scholar (elective coursework and extra- curricular activities) . Each Scholar (and Mentor) implement these elements through the development of a Scholar -directed Research Career Development Plan, which provides a detailed, chronological outline of the Scholar's core and individualized program elements and career and research objectives . This approach facilitates effective communication between the Director, Mentor, and Scholar and has been effectively implemented for program durations of up to three (2009- 2015) or five years (2006- 2009) of development . I.1.1.2 The UR -KL2 Program is dedicated to the evolution of the clinical and translational investigator As emphasized by the NIH in the CTSA PAR, \"Translating biomedical discoveries into clinical applications that improve human health is a complex process with high costs and substantial failure rates.\" Contributing factors include, but are not limited to, increasing data complexity, more stringent regulatory hurdles, health care reform pressures, and failures in traditional translational methods. This climate exerts the pressure to adapt and innovate how research is conducted and how future faculty are mentored, educated, and support ed by their respective institutions and the greater academic community. As outlined in a recent review by leaders and mentors within the UR -KL2 Program , 1,2 data analytics and technological advances have enabled development of new methods, tools, and approaches necessary to overcome many of the current challenges and continue to advance clinical and translational research. Howe ver, few career development programs incorporate training in these areas, which have tremendous cross -disciplinary utility . Additionally, surmounting research hurdles also requires teams with transdisciplinary and cross -sector expertise. However, few early -career faculty have skilled training or experiences in the assembly and operation of diverse research teams or the integration of external research partners. Effective team science requires learned 'hard' and 'soft' skills necessary to leverage the strengths of multiple disciplines, appreciate the limitations of each team member, anticipate future steps, and recognize when to lead and when to be an \"engaged follower\" (i.e.: contributing member of a trans - disciplinary team who does not serve as team leader , but as an effective supporting member ). While a robust core career development curriculum can effectively shape independent leaders, few, if any, provide opportunities to develop skill sets related to the psychosocial dynamics of team science. Future clinical and translational researchers have a tall order to fill; it is up to the career development programs to recognize these needs and ensure that each program balances core development objec tives with individualized training opportunities. I.1.2 The UR is uniquely positioned to support research and educational activities across the translational spectrum I.1.2.1 High-level integration of institutional framework supports translation Three UR s chools participate in the UR-KL2 Program : 1) School of Medicine and Dentistry, 2) School of Nursing, and 3) Arts, Science, and Engineering . The School of Medicine and Dentistry and the School of Nursing are housed within the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), which is within 1000' walking distance from the School of Arts, Science, and Engineering. Physical proximity, a culture committed to collaboration, and a wide array of research disciplines makes t he UR an ide al setting to plan and execute trans -disciplinary approaches to biomedical workforce development. Additionally, URMC functions as a \"learning health system\" by physically and administratively integrating its health care, research, and education systems under the leadership of a Dean/CEO, who directs the activities of URMC -owned teaching hospitals and a two- million person health care system. Within the URMC are over 1,510 full -time faculty and 190 part - time faculty with over 1,200 actively sponsored research projects totaling over $216 million in 2014- 15. The UR has always been strongly committed to its range of research programs and the UR-CTSI reflects and aligns with institutional priorities. The UR substantial ly invested in its computational infrastructu re to support biomedical research ( e.g., $33M for Computational Innovation and $100M for Institute for Data Science), including a nascent Center for Biomedical Informatics. Martin Zand (UR-CTSI PI) is the Director of the Rochester Center for Health Informatics, whose research teams use healthcare data and cutting -edge science to iteratively improve the health of the community. The UR also has a long -standing, cohesive community infrastructure and established practice- based research networks that have enabled the establishment of robust research programs around community -based research. Nancy Bennett (UR-CTSI PI) is the Director of the Center for Community Health, whose goal is to conduct population health research and evaluate community health interventions to improve population health. In addition, many Departments/Divisions (e.g., Neurology, Cardiology, Oncology, Infectious Disease) have a long history of being both a \"hub\" and a \"spoke\" in multi - center observational and interventional research studies, inc luding leadership of large academic study groups and multi- site clinical trials (Karl Kieburtz, UR- CTSI PI). The UR -KL2 Program Director (Robert Holloway) is an Executive Committee member for the NIH -Network for Excellence in Neurosci ence Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT ) and the UR participates as one of 28 clinical research sites . The UR-KL2 Program will leverage these institutional and career development resources that draw on and provide perspective in both leadership and \"engaged followership\". The UR has al ways been strongly committed to the competitiveness of its educational programs and infrastructure and the UR-CTSI plays an integral role in supporting educational advancement . Recently, t he UR-CTSI collaborated with the Departments of Public Health Scienc es (School of Medicine and Dentistry) and Computer Science (Arts, Sciences, and Engineering) to expand the educational offerings related to rigorous , personalized training in methods that can be applied across the research spectrum. This resulted in New Yo rk State Department of Education approval of six new Graduate Certificate Programs of Advanced Study in the following areas: (1) analytic epidemiology, (2) clinical research methods, (3) trial -based clinical research, (4) health servi ces research, (5) publ ic health, and 6) biomedical data science. Additionally, the UR- CTSI has also collaborated with the Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity in the development of a sustainable course in research mentoring, including approaches to mentoring under represented minorities, 3,4 as well as a successful foundational curriculum for all junior faculty engaged in research (in collaboration with the Associate Dean of Faculty Development ).5 I.1.2.2 Institutional programs that support the UR- KL2 Program 's three proposed Translational Specializations The UR-CTSI , along with several Departments (Medicine/Cardiology, N eurology, Psychiatry, Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering) and Centers (Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics, Center for Integrated Research Computing) , have led or participated in collaborative research and education efforts that relate to the unique UR-KL2 translational specializations in Enabling Technologies, Regulatory Science, and Electronic Health Record as a Resource for Research. The Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics collaborates with several groups, including the University of Buffalo and external research partners (e.g. technology firms ) to develop, evaluate, and implement novel clinical research methods, technologies, and approaches to improve study design , reduce outcome measure variability, and reduce participant burden, in the evaluation of novel devices and therapi es.1,6 The UR-CTSI recently led a cross -CTSA collaborative project within its Regulatory Science Working Group to develop broad Core Thematic Areas and specific Competencies to guide Regulatory Science education (e.g.: case studies, courses , and degree programs) , training, and career development programs.7 Additional internal collaborations between the UR- CTSI a Departments of Pharmacology have made the UR well-positioned to implement a Regulatory Science translational specialization within ongoing research programs. Finally, in alignment with broader UR priorities, the URMC has made electronic health record- driven care and research one of its top priorities.8 The UR-CTSI 's informatics group has leveraged UR- CTSI funds with approximately $2 million of additional extramural support in the past year to establish informatics -related clinical research and programs that focus on our institution' s eRecord system (EPIC) . These research programs are supported by the recently approved Advanced Certificate Program in Biomedical Data ( Master's Degree forthcoming). Collectively, these research and education programs and associated infrastructure are operational and ready to support the proposed translati onal specializations . I.1.2.3 Institutional Research Career Development Programs. Institutional Career Development Programs : The Scholars share courses, seminars, workshops, and other educational activities with early career faculty from other Institutional Career Development Programs. These programs include three other K12 Programs and one state- funded career development program. The K12 Program s include: \"Women's Health and the Environment Over the Entire Lifespan (WHEEL)\" ( NIEHS K12 ESO19852; 4 funded slots, each awarded 4 years); \"Translational Molecular Pediatric Research\" (NICHD K12 HD068373; 4 funded slots, each awarded for up to 4 years) ; and \"Rochester Partnership to Advance Research and Academic Careers in Deaf Scholars\" ( NIGMS K12 GM106997; 9 funded slots, each awarded for 3 years). These other p rograms have model ed themselves after the success of the UR-KL2 Program , but remain distinct due to emphasis on either specific Scholar populations (e.g. those who are deaf and hard of hearing ) or specific research disease populations (molecular -based pediatric disorders) . While candidate interest may occasionally overlap the programs, the Directors of all four programs have knowledge of the applicants and will work together to ensure proper fit and sustainability of each Scholar population. The state -funded career development program is a center grant for training clinical researchers, known as the Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program (ECRIP), and is funded by the New York State Department of Health (PI: Robert Holloway; current award 1/1/2014- 12/31/15; upcoming award 1/1/2016- 12/31/2017) . This two-year career development award provides funding for up to six clinical investigators, but is limited to individuals who were educated and trained in New York State and have recently completed their residency or fellowship. As a result, the ECRIP program is oriented towards nascent clinical investigators (those who are not quite ready for KL2- level development) who meet specific geographic restrictions on training ( within New York State only) . Since all six of the trainees for the new award will be selected prior to any award conferral for the UR -KL2 program , they do not present a significant risk to identificat ion and recruitment of Scholars , but instead serve as an applicant recruitment pool for the UR -KL2 Program . In the event of future ECRIP awards and concurrent recruitment with the UR -KL2 program, Dr. Holloway's dual role as UR- KL2 Core Director and ECRIP P roject Director will facilitate appropriate direction of applicant s and monitor ing of each recruitment pool. Institutional Training Grants : The UR has a long and successful track record of securing and sustaining institutional pre - and post -doctoral traini ng and education grants. Currently, the UR sponsors 20 T32- institutional training grants and 4 R25 research- related education grants. These training programs support 66 postdoctoral trainees each year and serve as a source of applicants to the UR- KL2 Progr am. Of the 3 1 Scholars accepted into the program to date, 1 6 of them (52%) were either active matriculates or had recently completed one of our institutional training programs (n=15) or at another institution (n=1). I.1.3 Background Summary The UR-KL2 Program has a n established track record of recruiting and developing Scholars who engage in discipline -directed research, contribute to the overall productivity of the UR, and transition to self -supporting translational research faculty. The UR-KL2 Program will continue this legacy and capitalize on the existing priority and programmatic strengths at the UR to innovate and expand its career development pathways to meet the individual research needs of an evolving generation of clinical and translational fac ulty. CORE I. KL2 CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM I.2 PROGRAM PLAN In the next iteration of the UR -KL2 Program, we will continue the successful, historical career development framework to ensure a strong foundation for development of a successful independent investigator, and expand upon it to incorporate innovative elements that provide our Scholars with 1) specialized training opportunities in novel, cross -disciplinary methods and approaches and 2) applied experience in team science. The core programmatic el ements (core curriculum, mentored research project) will now include a team science component, while the options for individualized components (elective coursework and extra- curricular activities) will be expanded to promote engagement of external research partners and training in one of three translational specializations. The translational specializations have been developed by the UR -KL2 Program to emphasize coursework and research projects aligned with novel, cross -disciplinary methods, including: 1) Enabling Technologies, 2) Regulatory Science, and 3) Electronic Health Record as a Resource for Research. Scholars who choose to incorporate any of these optional specializations into their individual plan will gain fundamental and applied training in methods, approaches, and experiences that are relevant to their field of research and at a time when the potential for biomedical advances is greater than ever. I.2.1 Program Administration I.2.1.1 Core Director, Robert Holloway, MD, MPH Dr. Holloway will serve as Core Director and PI for the UR -KL2 program in the coming grant cycle. He is Professor and Chair of Neurology and Professor of Public Health Sciences at the UR School of Medicine and Dentistry. He has served as Director of the UR- KL2 Program s ince the initial award in 2006. Dr. Holloway is an experienced leader and administrator with a strong personal commitment to research career development. Dr. Holloway completed undergraduate and medical education at the University of Connecticut and completed neurology residency and a Masters of Public Health degree (emphasis on health services and outcomes research) at the University of Rochester. He has been an active and productive member of the UR faculty, contributing to its missions through clinical r esearch, service and leadership, and education and mentoring. Dr. Holloway is an established researcher and scholar in academia and has published over 130 manuscripts and editorials covering experimental therapeutics, outcomes research, financing of biomedical research, the ethics of sham surgery, and the process of research decision- making. Dr. Holloway has extensive experience in therapeutic trials and outcomes research, being both a PI and collaborative investigator on numerous projects. He is an active participant in the NIH -Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT), serving as both the PI of the University of Rochester Clinical Site (since 2011) and current member of the NeuroNEXT leadership team (2014- 2016), as well as past chair of the NeuroNEXT Conflict of Interest Committee (2012- 2014). He is also a member of the CTSA/NeuroNEXT Liaison Committee. Dr. Holloway has been on six Data Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMB), including DSMB Chair for four NINDS - sponsored clinical trials. From 2009- 12, he was an active participant and faculty member at the Clinical Trials Methods course in Neurology, sponsored by the NINDS in Vail, Colorado. He is also the Associate Editor of Neurology Today . Dr. Holloway has a long history of commitment to education and training of future faculty. In addition to the UR - KL2 Program, he is actively involved in two other educational programs: 1) PI for the University of Rochester's Empire Clinical Research Investigator Program and 2) Co- Director (with Dr. Rober t Griggs) and participating program faculty (for over 15 years) for the T32 Training Grant entitled Experimental Therapeutics in Neurological Disease (T32 NS007338- 26). Dr. Holloway has also received past K24 support (2001- 2006) entitled Neurology Outcomes Research: Clinical Trials and Training and has supervised the training of over 20 fellows and early career investigators in clinical investigation, for which he was awarded the URMC Junior Faculty Mentoring Award in 2008. Dr. Holloway's diversified leader ship and service positions further his ability to lead the UR -KL2 Program. As Associate Director of the UR Clinical Trials Coordination Center (1996 -2004), he oversaw the planning, implementation, and reporting of multi -center clinical trials in neurology. As Assistant Quality Officer of UR's Strong Memorial Hospital (2000- 2013), Dr. Holloway implemented quality techniques to improve efficiency, motivate team behavior, and produce results, and as a result, was awarded the Quality Achievement Award for Physi cian Leadership in Performance Improvement. Dr. Holloway is committed to ethical research conduct, and co- directed the annual UR course on Ethics and the Responsible Conduct of Research (2010 -2013) and served as a past member of the UR Institutional and Individual Conflict of Interest committees in research. In summary, Dr. Holloway has built a career dedicated to excellence in research, service, and education and remains committed to the advancement of clinical and translational science through the development of early career faculty via the UR - KL2 Program. I.2.1.2 UR -KL2 Program Administrator, Thomas Fogg, MS, MPH Mr. Fogg has served as the UR-CTSI's Executive Director for Operations since its inception (2006). Mr. Fogg holds a Master of Science degree in Public Policy Analysis and a Master's in Public Health, both from the University of Rochester. Prior to entering academia, Mr. Fogg worked as the Director of Regulatory Affairs at a major gas and electric utility company. Within his UR -CTSI role, Mr. Fogg's primary responsibilities include management oversight of research education programs (including the UR-KL2 career development program), info rmatics programs, and programs in population health. He oversees the annual UR- CTSI program planning process and the associated quarterly performance reporting process, working with all UR- CTSI program managers. Mr. Fogg leads the UR- CTSI's communications team, and is also the UR -CTSI's liaison with the medical school's information technology group, overseeing the planning and management of IT systems developed and maintained for the UR- CTSI. At various points during the evolution of the UR- CTSI, Mr. Fogg has also been responsible for management oversight of the UR -CTSI's evaluation program, and the UNYTE Translational Research Network. Mr. Fogg has been active in the CTSA Consortium , having served as a member of the Consortium Management Group (a team of NI H staff and CTSA administrators charged with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Consortium) from 2009 to 2011, as the first chair of the Consortium's Communications Key Function Committee from 2007 to 2009, on several other Consortium commit tees and teams, and on external advisory committees for the Yale and San Diego CTSA programs. Mr. Fogg has served as the past administrative manager of the CDC -sponsored Rochester Prevention Research Center: the National Center for Deaf Health Research, one of 36 prevention research centers across the country. He also served as administrator for the Coordinating Center for the Cardiovascular Health Intervention Research and Translation Network, a group of six academic health centers across the country. I.2.2 Organization of the UR -KL2 Program The overall structure of the UR- KL2 Program is described in I .2.2.1 and the Organizational Chart i s depicted in Figure I 1. The integration of the UR -KL2 Program with the overall priorities, governance, and operations o f the UR-CTSI is described in I .2.2.2. I.2.2.1 UR -KL2 Administrative Structure The Core Director/PI (Dr. Holloway) will have oversight of the UR -KL2 Program and its leadership, and be responsible for communications with the UR- CTSI and NIH leadership. The Program Administrator (Mr. Fogg) will administer the day -to-day responsibilities of the UR -KL2 Training Program. These two individuals will formally meet monthly (with more frequent email and phone contact as necessary) to revi ew the operations and progress of the program. Additional Administrative Components are described below and include a Steering Committee, Recruitment and Selection Committee, UR -KL2 Evaluation Committee (KEC), and Internal Advisory Committee. A Steering Committee will meet quarterly to review all aspects of the program and will consist of the Core Director (Chair of Committee) , Program Administrator, Ann Dozier, Vivian Lewis, James Dolan, Ray Dorsey, Figure I1. KL2 Administrative Structure and Scott S teele. Ann Dozier, PhD, RN, Professor and Interim Chair of Public Health Sciences, has extensive experience in the evaluative sciences and will oversee the Program Evaluation (see Section I .5). Vivian Lewis, MD, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and V ice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity at the University, will oversee mentor development for the UR -KL2 Program Faculty (see Section I .3.2). James Dolan, MD is Professor of Public Health Sciences and leads the UR- CTSI Translational Workforce Development function (see Section I .2.2.2). Ray Dorsey, MD, MBA is the David M Levy Professor of Neurology and the Director of the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics will be Program Faculty and co- Director of the translational specialization in Enabl ing Technologies (see Section I .4.4.2) , and co -leader of the Trial Innovation Unit (Network Capacity Core) . Scott Steele, PhD, UR Director of Government and Academic Research Alliances and Associate Professor of Public Health Sciences, and leader of the UR- CTSI optional function in Regulatory Science to Advance Precision Medicine, will be Program Faculty and co -Director of the translational specialization in R egulatory Science (see Section I .4.4.3). The UR -KL2 Steering Committee will assist in monitoring the Program and its curricular components, and review the progress of individual Scholars. The UR -UR-KL2 Steering Committee will be supported by the Recruitment and Selection Committee and the KEC. The Recruitment and Selection Committee will meet three time s per year to 1) oversee the approach to marketing the program and initiatives to improve diversity, 2) articulate and implement Scholar application procedures, and 3) review and select Scholars from candidate applications. This Committee will be chaired by the Core Director and consist of a rotating group of five senior faculty with extensive research review experience. The Committee reviews and scores Scholar applications and participates in Scholar interviews as described in Section I .6. This Committee will present recommendations for Scholar appointment to the KL2 Steering Committee and UR-CTSI Executive Committee to ensure alignment with overall mission. The UR-KL2 Evaluation Committee (KEC) will meet annually to monitor overall progra m performance, as well as aggregate data on Scholar and Mentor performance. This Committee will be chaired by Dr. Ann Dozier (leader of the UR-CTSI Evaluation and Continuous Improvement function), and consist of the Core Director, Vivian Lewis, MD, and the primary Mentors of each active Scholar. The KEC will provide annual reports to the KL2 Steering Committee, who will provide summaries to the UR -KL2 Internal Advisory Committee, as well as the UR-CTSI Operations Committee (see Section I .2.2.2). The UR -KL2 Program will seek guidance from an Internal Advisory Committee , which will meet annually to review curricular content, Scholar progress, and evolving program outcome data and provide insight with respect to institutional and national trends in junior facul ty career development. The following UR faculty members have been chosen to lead this effort because of their expertise and excellence in education and career development of early career faculty (see letters of support): 1) Sarah Peyre, EdD, Director, Cent er for Experiential Learning, Assistant Dean for Interprofessional Education, Associate Professor, Department of Surgery, Medical Humanities and Bioethics; 2) Robert Griggs, MD, Professor of Neurology, 3) Linda Chaudron, MD, Senior Associate Dean for Diver sity, Inclusion and Culture Development, Professor, Departments of Psychiatry, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics; 4) Anthony Pisani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry (past UR -KL2 recipient); and 5) Stephen Dewhurst, PhD, Vice Dean for Research, A ssociate Vice President for Health Sciences Research, Chairman and Professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology. I.2.2.2 The UR -KL2 Program is Aligned with UR- CTSI Priorities and Leadership and Integrated with the Operational Cores. Although the UR -KL2 Program is overseen by the Core Director and associated Committees, it will be tightly aligned and integrated with the Overall Vision and Strategic Goals of the UR- CTSI , specifically, UR- CTSI Specific Aim 1 related to \"Workforce Development: To train the next generation of translational science workforce leaders in the collaborative, technical, and regulatory skills necessary to improve the translation of discoveries to clinical application and to improve population health.\" To promote the needed integ ration of the UR-KL2 Program within the UR- CTSI , the UR -KL2 Core Director is a member of the UR- CTSI Executive Team and serves on the UR- CTSI Operations Committee, ensuring the UR -KL2 program is well -integrated with all UR-CTSI cores and functions. The UR-CTSI Executive Team will meet weekly and consist of the three UR- CTSI PIs (Drs. Kieburtz, Bennett, and Zand), the three Executive Directors (Mr. Fogg, Ms. Jensen, and Mr. Rubinstein), and the Core Directors for the TL1 (Timothy Dye) and UR -KL2 (Robert Holl oway) programs. The Executive Team will provide oversight of UR- CTSI programs, projects, and the allocation of UR- CTSI resources, including those activities that support related workforce development activities. When appropriate, the UR- CTSI Executive Team will solicit input from the UR -KL2 Core Director, as well as provide guidance to the UR -KL2 Program regarding institutional priorities, new programmatic initiatives that may impact the program, and national initiatives from NCATs and other agencies, including the development of the Trial and Recruitment Innovation Centers. The Executive Team will solicit advice from a Community Advisory Council, an internal Strategic Leadership Group, and an External Advisory Committee. The UR-CTSI Operations Committee will meet twice each month and consist of the UR- CTSI Executive Team and all UR- CTSI function leaders. The UR-CTSI Cores provide some of the infrastructure required to support the UR -KL2 Program (outlined in Table I 1). The Operations Committee provides critical opportunities for cross - talk among core directors and function leaders and the UR -KL2 Core Director (e.g.: operational changes within the Cores or changes in Scholar needs) in order to ensure the proper programmatic integration of educational and training programs. I.3 PROGRAM FACULTY (MENTORS) I.3.1 The UR has a wealth of qualified Program Faculty (Mentors), who conduct research across the translational spectrum and within the UR-KL2 Program 's Translational Specializations I.3.1.1 Faculty are well -qualified and have research interests that span the tr anslational spectrum Collectively, t he three schools represented in the UR-KL2 Program have approximately 700 faculty who are PIs on sponsored research projects. Thirty -three of these (Table I2) have been chosen as represe ntative Program Faculty (Mentors) (DATA Table 2) based on: 1) expressed interest in mentoring Scholars ; 2) trans - disciplinary represent ation ; 3) expertise across the translational research spectrum; 4 ) strong mentoring track record (postdoctoral trainees or junior faculty ) (DATA Table 5B); and 5) acti ve research funding or special expertise to support the proposed translational specializations. These faculty have experience in leading and coordinating a mentor team in support of a Scholars career development. Eight are prior recipient s of a UR Mentoring Award, eight are prior or current UR- KL2 Mentors, five are PIs for a UR T32 or R25 (which serve as a major source of UR- KL2 applicants) , and three are prior Scholars (Dorsey, Mohile, Heatwole) . This list of potential Mentors is not intended to be fully inclusive of all available mentors at the UR, but provides a Table I1.

In keeping with the UR -KL2 Program's emphasis on career development that is supported by training and experiences in novel methods that can be applied across the translational spectrum, selected faculty have been identified to support career development in the three proposed translational specializations (Enabling Technologies, Re gulatory Science, and EHR as a Resource for Research). Mentors may be added in the future if they meet the minimum criteria enumerated above and a strong interest in the program . The representative Mentors in Table I2 have a breadth of research interests that reflects the transdisciplinary nature of this career development program and its ability to support research projects that span the translational spectrum. The 33 highlighted Mentors comprise faculty with primary appointments in 16 Departments and Cen ters within the three schools , including: Biomedical Engineering, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Center for Community Health, Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics , Computer Science, Center for Oral Biology, Eastman Institute for Oral Health, Anesthesiol ogy, Environmental Medicine, Medicine (including Cardiology, Family Medicine, Infectious Disease, Hematology & Oncology, Public Health Sciences, Pulmonology, Nephrology Diseases Divisions), Microbiology & Immunology, Neurology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Public Health Sciences, and Surgery. This broad range of research disciplines provides flexible career development opportunities for all potential Scholars . Despite a track record of research excellence and mentoring of individuals at various stages of educat ion, we have selected 2 faculty who are early in their career and therefore have not accrued a lengthy record of funding or have limited experience in mentoring early career faculty (Scott Steele, PhD, Charles Venuto, PhD). These faculty have been selected however, given the special niche expertise they have in the translational specializations (see Table I 2). Thus , should a Scholar elect to work with one of these faculty, the UR -KL2 Program will ensure that: 1) a co -mentor is selected from senior faculty with a strong funding and successful mentoring track record, and 2) the early career Mentor is provided with more intensive mentorship training.

Nine faculty have been i dentified based on their unique strengths in enabling technologies (Table I2), which reflect new methods, tools, and approaches that are made possible through specialized technologic advances. Examples of projects that utilize enabling technologies include evaluation of virtual research visits (telemedicine) for orphan conditions (Biglan), analysis of data from smartphone sensors in assessment of Parkinson disease (Dorsey), development of smartphone -based research studies for Huntington disease (Dorsey), us e of smartphones to track potential contacts in an Ebola epidemic (Kautz), evaluating a scale that can measure the QT interval in the home (Zareba) , and using social media to identity adolescents at risk for suicide (Wyman) . I.3.1.3 Faculty with expertise in Regulatory Science Nine faculty have been identified because they participate in areas of research that fit within the spectrum of regulatory science (Table I2), which means that the research is specific to that which develops new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA -regulated products.9 Faculty interests include science and technology policy issues impacting the advancement of Regulatory Science (Steele , and Dorsey ), advanced computational hear t modeling and improved analytic methods to assess drug toxicity (Couderc), brand v ersus equivalence studies for anti -epileptic drugs (Berg), developing animal models to evaluate effects of tobacco and e -cigarettes (Phipps, Sime), and assessing the placebo response for optimizing pain- related clinical trials (Dworkin). Scott Steele recently co-led a collaborative effort for the creation of core competencies for Regulatory Science and is developing a Regulatory Science training network with partners from other CTSA hubs and the FDA Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation. Charles Venuto work s collaboratively with the University of Buffalo School of Pharmacy to develop computer -assisted modeling and simulation programs that reflect the pharm acokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of approved and investigational drugs . I.3.1.4 Faculty with expertise in Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a Resource for Research Eight faculty have been selected for their experience in leverag ing EHR capabilities to conduct research. Mentors have a range of expertise, including utilization of big data from the EHR through the use of graph databases and other novel analytic and visualization applications (Zand) , evaluation of EHR manipulation for the tr eatment of back pain and menopausal vasomotor menopausal symptoms (Dye) , and EHR- linked outcomes research that includes training students to couple EHR data and interventions to statistical measures of health outcomes (Dozier , Mohile, Intrator, Dye, and Noyes). I.3.2 Training and Evaluation of Program Faculty (Mentors) The Mentor Development Working Group (MDWG) will train and evaluate the selected Mentors. The MDWG is chaired by Vivian Lewis, MD, UR- KL2 Steering Committee Member and Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity , and is comprised of 6 senior faculty who develop and implement institution -wide educational material , support services , outside speakers, and professional development programs for research mentors and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s . Thes e programs will be leveraged when providing evidence- based, theory driven specialized mentor training to UR- KL2 Mentors . At the start of the award, all Mentor s must complete the UR's successful hybrid mentoring curriculum .4 The hybrid mentor ing curriculum consists of an online curriculum, followed by an in- person Mentor -the-Mentor workshop, which includes the cohort of new mentors at the beginning of each academic year. The online course takes 1 -3 hours to complete and consists of 10 mentorin g scenarios (cases and short videos), each with open- ended questions and supplemental reading material. The Mentors read and reflect on the content prior to attending the workshop. A member of the MDWG facilitates t he workshop, during which the Mentors discuss the principal domains of mentoring practice in order benefit from the differing perspectives and experiences of mentoring faculty within the UR and to work effectively with other mentors. UR-KL2 Mentors will be evaluated, receive feedback , and, if necessary , receive remediation by members of the MDWG . Data to inform this evaluation come from an annual Scholar survey on Mentor performance, as well as questions about Mentor performance contained in Scholar progress reports (see Program Evaluation, Section I.5). The evaluation criteria cover the presence of six general mentoring competencies: 1) maintaining effective communication; 2) aligning expectations; 3) assessing understanding; 4) fostering independence; 5) addressing di versity and 6) p romotin g professional development. 10 Other important competencies that contribute to the work ing group's assessment include skills related to promoting ethical behavior.11 Overall performance of UR-KL2 Mentors will be discussed at monthly MDWG meetings. If weakness or deficiencies are identified, they are addressed directly with the Mentor, and if nece ssary, the department chair; persistent serious matters may require a change in mentors. I.4 PROPOSED CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM I.4.1 The UR-KL2 Program will be guided by five Career Development Objectives The UR-KL2 Program will expand its successful Career Development Program. We will continue to provide a Scholar -centric framework that includes core programmatic elements ( core curriculum, mentored research project) and is adaptable to individual research - and career -specific goals (elective coursework and extra- curricular activities), but also incorporate new, innovative training in team science (new core element) and provide training opportunities in cross -disciplinary research methods and approaches (new individualized element). This approach ensures that the program is highly responsive to each Scholar's diverse background and career goals , so that the training and mentoring experiences promote successful transition to an independent clinical and translational investigator (individ ual K - or R-award) . To accomplish this vision, t he UR-KL2 Program will be guided by 5 program objectives : 1. To provide each Scholar wit h a foundational curriculum of formal coursework and career guidance . 2. To promote customized research- related education of the Scholar's choosing or aligned with one of three Translational Specializations: a) Enabling Technologies, b) Regulatory Science, and c) Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a Resource for Research . 3. To create a supportive and structured environment for a mentored- research experience, including potential engagement of external research partners . 4. To emphasize the importance of team science through required fundamental coursework and applied experiences in \"engaged followership\" . 5. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the UR- KL2 Program through application of quantitative and qualitative criteria (See Program Evaluation, Section I .5). I.4.2 The UR-KL2 application and acceptance process will establish the foundation for achieving the Career Dev elopment Objectives The mechanism for meeting each of the career development objectives begins with the application process. Applications will be solicited in the fall for a potential award conferral the following spring . Each candi date will prepare an application that require s the development of the following components: 1. A Research Career Development Plan (RCDP) that defines the Scholar's research knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for long- term academic progress, as well as outcome measures that define the specific activities needed to accomplish progress . Components include descriptions of the applicant's : 1) career path to date, 2) short - and long- term career goals, and 3) tailored education needs , including elective didact ic course work and available seminars, workshops and conferences (which may or may not align with one of the UR- KL2 translational specializations ). The UR-KL2 Program will provide applicants with a comprehensive list of available coursework , workshops, and seminars , including those in each of the translational specializations . Applicants will collaborate with their proposed Mentor to develop their RCDP, and both will be encouraged to utilize the UR-CTSI 's Research Help Desk for consultation related to the development of the applicant's RCDP . This will include discussion of the applicant's research area, review of the UR- CTSI resources and website, advisement regarding courses, seminars or workshops , and orientation to the CTSA's core and special interest clinical and translational research competencies.12 2. A proposed primary mentored -research experience that: 1) develops a feasible primary mentored- research project and describes potential engagement of external partners, 2) identifies and justifies a primary mentor, 3) identifies and justifies 2 or more additional co- mentors , which includes individuals from disparate but complementary disciplines from the primary mentor , and 4) details the frequency and type of proposed interactions between the Scholar and the primary Mentor, as well the Mentor team . The UR-KL2 Program will provide applicants with a comprehensive list of available Mentors and associated research areas , with designation of M entors performing research in each of the translational specializations (E nabling Technologies, Regulatory Science, and EHR as a R esource for Research). A Primary mentor must be chosen from the provided list (or if they meet the minimum criteria enumerated in Program Faculty Section I.3.1 ), but the Mentor team members can be chosen from any faculty member at the UR or outside institution in response to Scholar development needs. The UR-CTSI Research Help Desk will be able to educate applicants about relevant, potential M entor s from the UR o r at other institutions (e.g.; CTSA Consortium , National Research Mentoring Network ). When appropriate , the Scholars will be referred to the UR- CTSI 's Office of Special Population Integration (OSPI) or the UR Recruitment Unit to obtain technical assistance or to develop targeted strategies to incorporate into the overall plan. 3. A proposed \"engaged followership\" experience that reflects the need for training in team science and that is directly or indirectly related to the Scholar's research interests. The UR-KL2 Program will provide applicant s with examples of qualifying \"engaged followership\" experiences (explained further in Section I.4.6). Applicants will work with their Mentor to identify and develop an appropriate experience and can find assistance at the UR-CTSI Research Help Desk or with a consultation with the Multi -Disciplinary Team Science (MTS) Group within the Community and Collaborations Core. This later program will train departmentally -based team -science facilitators to be available in year 2 of the funding period. The process of achieving Career Development Objectives will continue when each appointed Scholar -Mentor dyad meets with the Core Director prior to the start date (e.g.: meeting in March or April for July start). The group will discus s overall program expectations and timelines (including submission of individual K - or R- award) and refine t he development experience outlined in the Scholar's RCDP. Each component will then be translated into research and career objectives and metrics , which will enable effective Mentor /Mentor Team - Scholar interaction (See Section I.4.5) and facilitate the formal evaluation process (See Program Evaluation, Section I.5). I.4.3 Program Objective 1. Foundational Curriculum of Formal Coursework and Career Guidance Each Scholar will participate in a foundational curriculum to ensure a minimum standard of career development competencies in research ethics, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training , grant preparation, l eadership and network development . I.4.3.1 . Research Ethics. The UR-KL2 Program is fully invested in the development of early -career faculty who are educated and committed to ethical conduct in research. More detail for each element is provided in the Training in Responsible Conduct of Research section. Course: All Scholars are required to complete and pass the course, Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research (IND506, 1 cr). The one -credit course provides >16 hours of lectures and small -group discussion over a 2- month time period. Any Scholar who has completed this course as part of a UR -based training program will be required to participate as a small group facilitator for the course. Training: All Scholars who work with patient -oriented research, vertebrate animal models, or patient data are required to complete relevant training in human subjects protection, animal welfare, and/or HIPAA . Continuing Education: Scholars will be encouraged to continue ethics -related education by attending widely - available special in vited lectures, online courses, skill-building workshops, and monthly seminar series. I.4.3.2 . Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training. Scholars engaged in clinical trials will receive GCP training . Online Course : Scholars will complete an online GCP training program (via the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) that has been approved by the UR Human Research Protection Program . I.4.3.3 Grant Preparation. We require curricular elements that prepare and guide Scholars in their preparation of an individual K - or R-award application. Course: Practical Skills in Grant Writing (PM 438, 3 cr) All Scholars are required to take this spring semester course during their first year . Course content includes didactic lectures on grant -related topics, opportunities to engage in peer grant review , and presentation of grant -related tools and resources . All participants are required to write a grant and subsequently receive critical review from course faculty and classmates. This course provides Scholars with the invaluable opportunity to write and receive critique on their individual grant application (K- or R-award) , which must be submitted prior to completion of the UR -KL2 program. Research Review Experience: Each Scholar will be required to participate in at least one scientific review experience. Examples include a 1- year experi ence as a member of the UR-CTSI Clinical Research Unit 's review of protocol implementation specifics (PCI -Hub Capacity Core) or provid ing Department -level scientific and ethical review (in a mentee capacity ) of human subjects research proposals intended for IRB review (each URMC Department is required to perform internal scientific review prior to IRB submission). I.4.3.4 Leadership and Network Development : Effective leadership and establishment of a research network are fundamental to the development of any independent investigator. In addition to executing their own research project, Scholars will receive training in the 'hard' and 'soft' skil ls necessary to become an effective leader. Seminar /Online Course : UR Leadership Development Program. This program has two tracks, Management Essential and Leadership Enhanced, and allows participants to engage course content via an independent online curriculum or instructor -led lecture series (eight, 1-hour classes ). The content addresses eight leadership competencies : Leading Change ; Giving and Receiving Feedback ; Building and Leading Teams (including Trust, Accountability and Emotional Commitment); Managing Conf lict; Using Emotions Effectively; Leading and Communicating Vision; Leading Innovation; and Culture and Process Improvement . Seminar : Academic Career Development Series . This monthly seminar is open to any UR early -career scholar or trainee, and covers a broad range of professional skills development , including: 1) Proposal development (specific aims, background and significance , research methods and analysis , career development plan), 2 ) Time management, 3) Working with students/trainees (including how to write individual development plans ), 4) Mentoring, 5 ) CV workshop, 6 ) Biosketch workshop, 7 ) Nuts and Bolts of getting promoted, 8 ) Scientific communication (scientific writing and review , oral presentation, and poster presentation) , 9) Well -being and Balance/Mindfulness workshop, 1 0) Supporting a research program, and 11) Networking. These interactive session s between faculty and participants provide the foundational skills that are relevant to the diverse audience members . Many of the presenters are UR- KL2 Program Faculty. Peer Networking Group : UR Junior Faculty Biomedical Research Association. Scholars will be automatically enrolled in this academic peer group of early stage MD and PhD faculty from basic and clinical res earch backgrounds. Participation promotes early career success in scientific discovery, funding, publications, mentoring through regular newsletters and email communications and in-person meetings (3x/year) that provide a forum to network, discuss challenges of early career start -up, and receive guidance from senior faculty through interactive presentations . I.4.4 Program Objective 2 . To promote customized research -related education of the Scholar's choosing or aligned with one of three Translational Specializations: a) Enabling Technologies, b) Regulatory Science, and c) Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a Resource for Research. I.4.4.1 Flexible UR-KL2 Program elements adapt to individual Scholar education and research needs. Given the cross -disciplinary nature of clinical and translational research, each Scholar has unique prior training and varied research interests . For example, 52% (n=16/31) of accepted Scholars were either an active matriculate or had recently completed an institutional training program (one had recently completed a training program from another institution) . In addition, 2 of them already had MPH degrees. In response, we encourage Scholars to customize and engage in coursework that is supportive of their i ndividual research and career objectives . Scholars are permitted, but not required to complete an advanced certificate or degree. As described in the Background section, we have developed three translational specializations (i.e.: thematic groupings of coursework and research projects) that align with innovative methodological training needs of emerging clinical and translational investigators . The heart of these innovative specializations will be the partnership of tailored education and relevant Mentor -guided research projects, with potential for related supervised networking experiences (described in S ection I.4.5.3 ). Scholars may customize their development experience by supplemental , a la carte coursework , which aligns with their research interests, from any of the UR's wide range of educational programs ( sample offerings presented in Table I 3) or choose to customize their training in pursu it one of the translational specialties (outlin ed in the following sub- sections) . I.4.4.2 Translational specialization in Enabling- Technologies (Co-directors, Drs. Ray Dorsey and Wojciech Zareba; see letters of support) . Novel technologies are poised to revolutionize clinical research conduct. For example, t he need for frequent in- person visits and the resulting time and travel costs are a major burden to participation in clinical trials. 13 Technology -enabled remote research visits (e.g. video conferencing) have had great impact on patient care in the context of telemedicine, but also have great potential for overcoming research participation hurdles like distance, disability, and the distribution of research centers. Additionally, implementation and evaluation of novel measures of disease that are ei ther portable (e.g., smartphone applications ) or wearable can provide objective, frequent, and potentially m ore sensitive assessments that can be conducted almost anywhere.2 Smartphone technology includes applications like Apple's recent ly released open- source ResearchKit and its first five smartphone- based clinical research studies for asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson disease, the latter of which was based in part on work done by University of Rochester researchers.6 Wearable technologies are increasingly diverse and include (sometimes implantable) devices that are capable of measuring outcomes that were previously undetectable (e.g., intermittent atrial fibrillation or QT prolongation) through standard methods . These and other types of research projects are supported by UR -KL2 Mentors (see Section I.3.1.2 ). Table I3.

While other courses are possible, Scholars who choose this pathway will be encouraged to select from the coursework presented . Additionally, Scholars will be encouraged to enhance their education and networks through attendance and, when applicable, presentation at conferences that seek to foster adoption of enabling technologies for conducting research. Examples of these types of conferences include: DPharm Conference : The annual DPharm conference is held in Boston, MA and seeks to advance enabling technologies in clinical trials by assembling leaders from industry, academia, and various technol ogy firms to highlight successes and plan for the future. Topics include virtual clinical trial models, adaptive design, and methods for self-reported participant data. d.health Executive Summit : The annual d.health Executive Summit is o rganized by Dr. Ray Dorsey and assembles thought leaders to focus on fostering technologic solutions to improve the care of aging Americans. Many of the technologies and applications apply to research . Speakers at the inaugural Summit included Senator Tom Daschle and Dr. Dav id Brailer (President Bush's National Health IT Coordinator), the CEOs of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, MC10 (a wearable sensor company), and Sage Bionetworks (a predictive modeling company) , the then Acting Director of NINDS , as well as representatives from 23andMe, Verizon, and IBM. I.4.4.3 . Translational specialization in Regulatory Science (Co-directors Drs. Scott Steele and Robert Dworkin ; see letters of support) . The CTSA PAR highlights that CTSA educational and career development programs should pr ovide knowledge of Regulatory Science. Further, Scholars should have opportunities to gain external experiences in the translational research process such as in \"industry, regulatory agencies, nonprofit patient advocacy groups, or other CTSA hubs with strengths different from their home institution.\" To address these, we will leverage institutional strengths and partnerships in Regulatory Science education and research. Although it is often confused with Regulatory Affairs, Regulatory Science, as defined by the FDA, is \"the science of developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA -regulated products\" . 9 Dr. Scott Steele is one of several UR- CTSI faculty who are leading national efforts to establish core Regulatory Science curriculum standards based on recently establish core competencies , which were developed via collaboration between UR, other CTSA hubs , and the FDA Centers Table I4.

UR- KL2 Scholars who are interested in gaining training and experience in Regulatory Science will have the opportunity to capitalize on faculty expertise and experiences from within the UR (and its UR- CTSI ) and through a collaborative effort with the University of Pennsylvania 's Institute for Tra nslational Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT) . Available research Mentors and associated projects are described in Section I .3.1.3 . We have assembled elective coursework from the UR and a collaborating CTSA institution (UPenn's ITMAT) to support research related t o Enabling Technologies (Table I 5). Several of the UR courses have been proposed to constitute a new Regulatory Science Certificate of Advanced S tudy (NY State approval anticipated in the Fall 2015) . The UR-CTSI has worked closely with UPenn's ITMAT to establish complementary education programs (i.e.: UR proposed certificate program and ITMAT's MS in Regulatory Science) , including on- line course offerings and case studies to support distance learning for trainees at both institutions. Based on mapping existing courses and core strengths at the two institutions, the UR -CTSI will create on -line versions of Pathways to Medial Innovation (BME 431 and 432) and Fundamentals of Science, Technology and Health Policy (PM 4 94), while ITMAT will share online courses in Clinical Study Management (REG 611) and Introduction to Drug Development (REG 612) . Scholars will be able to choose from the available coursework, including the possibility of obtaining the Advanced Certificate in Regulatory Science and a new course in Precision Medicine (See Optional Module).

Examples include: UR-CTSI - UPenn ITMAT webinar series: The and ITMAT will partner to host a monthly webinar series on Regulatory Science Research and Training. Speakers will include experts from the CTSA hubs, FDA and its Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation, NIH, industry , and foundations. Webinars will be recorded and archived, for educational use within the UR -CTSI and ITMAT training programs and as a publically available resource. FDA Science Forum : This annual c onference is held at the FDA's White Oak campus in Maryland to highlight the cutting -edge science conducted at the Agency and demonstrate how FDA's intramural scientific research informs regulatory decision- making. Office of Regulatory Science and Innovation (ORSI) Science Symposium : The annual Symposium is held at the FDA to highl ight active research in its extramural programs to advance FDA's Regulatory Science Initiative . I.4.4.4 Translational specialization in Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a Resource for Research (Co- directors, Drs. Timothy Dye and Martin Zand; see letters of support) . An urgent need exists for workforce training in translational research that utilizes the electronic health record in the following ways: 1 ) as a primary source of research data, 2) as a source of secondary data that needs to be merged with other data sets (e.g. genomic, qualitative, etc.) , or 3) as a tool for gathering additional research data at the point of clinical care. The potential demand for such training at UR is extensive, as evidenced by the > 1,000 clinical -translational researchers conducting ~2,300 active studies and accessing over 8Tb of clinical EHR data at URMC . This specialization will give Scholars the tools and expertise to extract and integrate EHR data with basic science and genomics data , and a robust analytic skill set including database construction, data mining, advanced statistical methods, risk adjustment modeling, analysis of molecular and social networks, and high dimensional data visualization. The pathway builds on the UR- CTSI pioneering development of novel data extraction and integration software tools, including implementation of Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) within the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap ) program. We have assembled elective c oursework to support research related to extraction, incorporation, and analysis of EHR data , including the option of obtaining an Advanced Certificate in Biomedical Data Science (Table I 6) and a new course in Translational Network Science (see Optional Module) . Additionally, formal training in the use of i2b2, REDCap, the integration between i2b2 and REDCap, and the REDCap Dynamic Data Pull is available to Scholars through the Center for Integrated Research Computing.

Examples include: Clinical Research Informatics World Conference : This annual, cross -sector conference is targeted at using big data strategies and innovative processes and technologies to improve clinical research and clinical trials. American Medical Informatics Association's Summit on Clinical Research Informatics : This annual summit assembles leaders and practitioners in clinical research informatics to present the latest accomplishments in clinical research informatics, highlight innovations and best practices for managing Big Clinical Data for observational studi es and clinical trials, and discuss informatics science related to secondary research use of Big Clinical Data . I.4.5. Program Objective 3. To create a supportive and structured environment for the Scholar's career and research program development , including potential engagement of external research partners Each Scholar is required to propose and implement a primary mentored -research project that will establish the foundation for an individual research award (K - or R-award) . We will provide comprehensive , adaptable support for effective Mentor -Scholar relationships, robust project hypotheses and methods, and engagement of external research partners. I.4.5.1 . The UR-KL2 Program will provide ongoing Mentor -Scholar Support and Oversight. We will provide a supportive and nurturing environment for the development of the Scholar' s research program. After the initial Scholar -Mentor -Core Director meeting at the start of the award, a member of the Mentor Development Working Group (MDWG ) will meet with the Mentor and Scholar to review expected mentoring meeting structure (e.g.: frequent email and phone contact, as well as formal meetings at a regular frequency that meets the needs of both Scholar and Mentor ) and the expectations of the Mentor -Scholar relationship at this stage of a Scholar's career. Specific Mentor training is discussed in Section I .3.2. The Scholar will then meet regularly (every 6 months) with the UR-KL2 Core Director and the assigned member of the MDWG to review progress based on the outlined objectives. Approximately one month prior to the meeting, the Scholar will prepare and submit a progress report (via an online program) containing the following elements: 1) progress toward achieving elements of their RCDP, 2) progress toward implementing their primary research project, 3) progress in preparing their next proposal, 4) additional resource needs, 5) potential barriers to achieving goals, 6) summary of recent mentor meeting s; frequency of meetings; level of satisfaction; and potential need for change. The UR-KL2 Core Director and the MDWG member will also be available to meet with the Scholar and Mentor at any point during the Scholar's participation in the program. After each meeting , the MDWG member provides written, formal feedback on progress, barriers and suggestions for improvement and ways to address roadblocks . If serious deficiencies in Scholar progress are identified, a formal probationary action plan will be developed, with potential for removal in the event that the deficiencies persist . A copy of the meeting report will be sent to: 1) Scholars and Mentors , who will have the opportunity to respond to feedback, 2) the UR-CTSI Evaluation Working Group for review of Scholar performance in achieving their Individualized Career Pathway Competencies (ICPC) (See Program Evaluation) , and 3) the Chair of the MDWG to assist with their ongoing evaluation of Mentors (See Section I.3.2). I.4.5.2 . The UR- KL2 Program will leverage existing UR-CTSI support of research project and protocol development. Each Scholar will be required to regularly attend, participate, and present at the bi-weekly UR-CTSI Research Methods Forum . UR-KL2 Scholars will present their research proposal at least twice at the seminar: once at the early stages of project development (usually within 6 months of appointment) , and again when the research design and desired collaborative team is more established (usually within the first 12 months of appointment) . The Seminar is overseen by the UR- CTSI Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) group (Directed by Edwin van Wijngaarden, PhD) . Forum a ttendees include the BERD team, UR-CTSI Regulatory Knowl edge and Support team members, representatives from other UR-CTSI Cores , and invited faculty with research expertise relevant to the work being presented. The interactive forum permits : 1) junior faculty investigators to present their research ideas for review, critique, and recommendations for collaborations; 2) review of preliminary results; 3) discussion of pilot data and idea- generation for future studies; and 4) review of grant proposals. These meetings will provide an opportunity for a free -wheeling and far -reaching discussion of goals, issues, methods, practical limitations and ideas ranging from design and participant recruitment to funding and publication strategies. This yields critical feedback from senior faculty and content experts with complementary research expertise and is based on an approach utilized by the Department of Neurology , which has successfully developed collaborative research teams , enhanced junior faculty's r esearch acumen, and amassed an impressive track record of extramural funding for participants . 14 I.4.5.3 . The UR- KL2 Program encourages the engagement of external research experts and partners to inform the development and execution of their research program. The UR-KL2 Program will encourage and support the engagement of experts outside of the UR and academia in a Scholar's research project , where applicable. These will likely be 'organic' relationships that develop out of necessity for the implementation of the Scholar's primary research project. In many cases, these partnerships will provide elements that are essential to design and execut ion of the project (e.g.: content expertise, research methods, access to a special patient population, or experimental intervention) . Additionally, these are invaluable career development opportunities for the Scholar. T he UR-KL2 Program will work to ensur e that any administrative and contractual hurdles are surmounted. To provide an example of what these external partnerships may look like, a brief list of currently active partnerships within the three proposed translational specializations is provided bel ow: Enabling Technologies : The majority of enabling tools and technologies are being developed outside of academia (e.g. medical device companies and technology firms ), therefore S cholars will be encouraged to have appropriately mentored engagement with external firms to support their research and to understand how technology can reduce the cost and time needed to evaluate new diagnostics and therapeutics aimed at improving health. Existing research collaborations between the UR and outside entities include novel partnerships related to disease modeling (IBM), virtual research visits ( 23andMe, AMC Health, and PatientsLikeMe) ( Apple, MC10 , and BioSensics). See letters of support from 23andMe and MC10. Regulatory Science : Internships or other experiential training opportunities are a key element of Regulatory Science training, ideally developing future research opportunities in academia, industry and government. Scholars will have the opportunity to engage with researchers and staff from partners at other academic institutions (UPenn's ITMAT ), industry (via the PhRMA Foundation), and FDA to gain knowledge and insight into Regulatory Science issues, processes and career paths from another sector. Coordinated virtual mentoring will be utilized in some cases, using web meetings and teleconferences to advise Scholars , when an in-person exchange is not practical. We also have existing relationships with other CTSAs, including the University of Buffalo School of Pharmacy whose faculty and resources and contribute to a Scholar's Regulatory Science experience. See letters of support from PhRMA foundation, UPenn's ITMAT, and University of Buffalo. EHR as a Resource for Research: In order to leverage data for clinical research and patient care, projects will require multi -disciplinary teams of clinical staff, informaticians, and researchers. Evolving partnerships are occurring with external data providers such as the Rochester Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO), a secure electronic health information exchange that gives authorized medical providers access to various types of health- related information. Additionally, internal programs at URMC are developing novel methods to incorporate patient -reported outcomes into department clinical operations. Scholars will have appropriately mentored engagement activities with these dynamic multidisciplinary teams representing clinical research, informatics, and healthcare operations. See letter s of support from the Rochester RHIO and Epic. I.4.6. Program Objective 4. To emphasize the importance of team science through fundamental coursework and applied experiences in \"engaged followership\" While leadership is an essential attribute of any independent investigator, the ability to exec ute team science research sometimes necessitates participat ion as an \"engaged follower\". The principal of \"engaged followership\" is that sometimes contributing members of a trans -disciplinary team are required to serve most effectively in a supporting, rather than a leadership, role. This is particularly germane to clinical and translational science, and requires a meaningful appreciation for team science operations and psychosocial dynamics of larg e, coordinated research effort s. Given the diverse prior experiences of each Scholar, t he UR- KL2 Program will emphasize training in this multi- faceted concept by requiring that Scholars participate in a core course , as well as an individualized, applied \"engaged followership\" experience. I.4.6.1 . Fundamental and Applied Team -Science Instruction and Mentorship. Course: Research Team Science Seminar (PM 403, new course, 1 cr) This 1-credit summer course provides an introduction to the development of skills for successful, team -based translational research including creativity, brainstorming/concept mapping and other group interactive tools, systems thinking, knowledge management, and \"engaged followership\". I.4.6.2 Participation in relevant \"Engaged Follower ship\" Experiences The UR-KL2 Program leadership will work with each Scholar to ensure that the proposed experience is both feasible and relevant to the Scholar's career development , and facilitate the administrative implementation of the experience, when necessary . The following overarching principles will be required to determine a 'qualifying' experience : 1) Scholar obtains career -relevant experiences, gaining new knowledge and skills, 2) Scholar ideally contributes to the work of value to the host Progr am or Center where the experience is occurring, 3) the duration of the experience has to be sufficiently long enough to gain an appreciation of the team science research effort (e.g., one year or longer) , and 4) the Scholar will have to produce a written summary of the experience in their required progress reports . The frequency of involvement will vary by experience, but all experiences will be integrated into the Program Evaluation (see Section I .5). To assist with conceptualization of a qualifying exper ience, five examples of potential \"engaged followership\" experiences are provided below (see letters of support from potential UR groups ). Many of these examples draw upon the UR's unique depth of experience in both running global, multicenter drug and device trials (\"research hub\"), and functioning as a performing site in NIH -funded research networks (\"research spoke\"). Scholars may choose one of these specific examples or propose an alternative qualifying experience that aligns with the overarching principles above and is approved by the UR- KL2 Core Director . Participation in National Research Networks and Academic Study Groups . The UR has been a consistent contributor to mult i-center research groups across a broad range of disease conditions, involving all stages of translation. These networks include the NINDS NeuroNEXT Network (Robert Holloway, Site PI), NIAID AIDS Clinical Trial Group, HIV Vaccine Evaluation Group, NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies, and NINDS funded studies conducted by the Parkinson, Huntington, and Muscle Study Groups. Scholars can elect to be an enrolling site investigator or sub- investigator of a cli nical trial or observational follow -up study within one of the existing networks or serve as an ad -hoc Steering Committee member for one of the Study Groups . Scholars will gain experience in contributing to \"spoke\" activities (e.g., central -IRB reliance models and master contract agreements, clinical trial budgets, considerations for biorepositories, and working with clinical research coordinators and other study personnel) while appreciating the governance and broader organization of Network/Study Group ac tivities. See letter s of support from Ray Dorsey and Wojciech Zareba. Contributor to Operational Activities within an Academic Clinical Research Organization (CRO). The UR has served as a central coordinating center for over 36 NIH funded clinical tri als and observational studies, and over 50 industry - and foundation- funded trials , utilizing hundreds of clinical trial sites across 4 continents. Scholars can elect to participate in one of the academically -based CROs located at the UR (e .g., Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics , the Heart Research Follow -up Program, and the Cancer Control Program as a newly established hub for the NCI Community Oncology Research Program ). These organizations perform a multitude of study -related activities that span study conception, planning, implementation and disseminating results. Given the overall time it takes to complete a mult i-study effort , a Scholar experience will likely require engaging in an active study. Experiences include assist ing with site selection and activation activities (including contracts administration) , serving as a Medical/Clinical monitor of an active study, participating in ongoing implementation meetings to address recruitment/retention concerns, or co-leading efforts to develop clinical protocols, informed consent documents, DSMB reports, or manuscripts. This type of experience imparts knowledge related to \"hub\" activities required to accomplish multi- center efforts , including any compromises and corrective actions . See letter of support from Gary Morrow. Participation within UR's Local Trial Innovation and Recruitment Units . While we await the NCAT S creation of Trial Innovation Centers (TICs) and Recruitment Innovations Centers (RICs), we anticipate the organization of local UR Trial Innovation and Recruitment Units. Our local Trial Innovation Unit will be an outgrowth of our existing Clinical Research Review and Process Improvement Team (CRRPIT) and will be chaired by Karen Rabinowitz , JD, Assistant Dean for Research Administration and Regulatory Affairs and Ray Dorsey, MD . The Unit will monitor and resolve impediments in the research approval process, including establishing protocol s to monitor common metrics to improve our hub efficiency. Scholar s may elect to participate in the Unit's monthly meetings to gain an appreciation of the activities needed to streamline the \"activation period\" to efficiently participate in Network -driven studies . See letter of support from Karen Rabinowitz. Contributor to Community E ngagement Endeavors . The Center for Community Health is directed by Nancy Bennett ( UR-CTSI PI) and has a unique and well -developed infrastructure for developing community - academic partnerships and providing consultation to faculty to establish community -based initiatives and research to reduce health disparities and prevent communicable and chronic disease. Scholars may elect to participate one of several community -engagement expert bodies ( e.g.: Community Advisory Council, Greater Rochester Practice- Based Research Networks, Population Health Interest Group) to gain a n appreciation of the needs of a broad range of stakeholders in research, approaches to special populations, and to improve on approaches to develop culturally competent, population- specific recruitment and retention strategies. See letter of support from Nancy Bennett. Electronic Health Record Clinical Research Integration into the Clinical Enterprise. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is the major institutional re source that forms the basis of a majority of informatics -based research . To support these efforts, the URMC and UR- CTSI have several programs and offices (Office of Innovation and Technology for Clinical Applications and the UR- CTSI 's Informatics Core) that facilitate access to EHR data, liaise with external groups (e .g. other CTSA hubs, tool developers) around development of multi -institutional initiatives, and facilitate use of EHR mechanisms to access populations. Scholars can elect to participate in the monthly meetings to appreciate the needs of different stakeholders, including health care organizational priorities, tec hnical constraints of the EHR, and t he language of bioinformatics. See letter s of support from David Krusch and David Mitten. I.4.7 Summary of the Career Development Program: Example Experiences Table I7 presents example career development experiences for Scholars who choose the core development experience (with individual customization) or those who elect to participate in the UR -KL2-developed translational specializations. I.5 PROGRAM EVALUATION I.5.1 Overview Rigorous and continual evaluation of UR-KL2 programmatic elements will ensure that program objectives are met and refined . The evaluation plan will adopt and use common outcome metrics across the CTSA Consortium . All collected data will remain confidential and only be utilized within the context of the UR -KL2 Program for the purposes of Scholar guidance and programmatic evaluation and refinement . The UR -KL2 Program is committed to creating a sustainable program and disseminating its programmatic elements across the CTSA Consortium and others. Dissemination of the effective practices and training materials developed by the UR -KL2 Program will be led by Dr. Scott Steele, Deputy Director, Goergen Institute for Data Science , who is well integrated in local, regional, and national networks (including the National CTSA Consortium ). With Dr. Steele's assistance, the UR -KL2 Program will actively support the transportability of its career development objectives and other elements by: 1) creating an open educational website that will contain key course materials and activities for download; 2) making program leadership available for consultation and guidance; 3) and disseminating program results through presentations at national meetings and in publications. I.5.2 Evaluation Process The formal evaluation process is summarized in Figure I2 and the composition of each of the engaged committees is described in Sec tion I.2.2.1 . Briefly, the evaluation process will begin with data collection from various assessments related to each of three entities: Program, Mentor, and Scholar. Required data will be regularly collected by UR -KL2 administration and sent to the UR-CTSI's Evaluation Working Group (EWG) for pre-determined analyses. The EWG will perform analyses and provide summary reports for the annual UR -KL2 Evaluation Committee (KEC) meeting. The KEC will utilize these data to evaluate the performance of each entity , as well as their influence on one another, to ensure that programmatic and scholar -specific objectives are met and deficiencies are corrected. The KEC will provide a high level summary of findings and recommend actions to the UR -KL2 Steering Committee to inform programmatic development. In turn the UR -KL2 Steering Committee will provide a summary to the UR- CTSI 's Operations Committee to ensure that the program continues to align with the UR- CTSI mission and to solicit input on any proposed changes to improve the career development experience provided. The UR -KL2 Steering Committee will also present findings to the UR-KL2 Internal Advisory Committee for insight and guidance on any necessary program modifications. I.5.3 Evaluation of UR -KL2 Program Objectives, including innovative Scholar competency assessment tool Table I8 presents an overview of currently proposed cross -sectional and longitudinal outcomes and data to support evaluation of overarc hing UR- KL2 Program objectives (including evaluation of Career Development Objectives 1- 4). Additional outcomes can be developed in response to programmatic needs. Multiple measurement methods include Scholar feedback, Scholar self-assessment , and competency progress , Scholar assessment of mentor; mentor assessment of self and S cholar progress; applicant data collection; scholar tracking during and after program participation; review of prepared program documents. Evaluation of Scholar Competency Assessment tool The primary source of data for Scholar career development progress will be the research and career competencies developed in the Scholar's RCDP, which will be converted to a Scholar -specific Individualized C areer Pathway Competencies (ICPC) Assessment . 15 The ICPC Assessment will be completed online (via RedCAP ) every four months (i.e.: three times per year to provide multiple cross- sectional and longitudinal data points to inform any needed mid -course correction) by both Scholar and Mentor and is modeled after evaluation procedures being used for the Milestone Project by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education to evaluate Graduate Medical Trai nee performance (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) 16 (see letter of support from Diane Hartmann, MD, Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education). The ICPC Assessment Tool requires Scholars and Mentors to indicate level of proficiency for each RCDP competency -derived ICPC by assigning a value between Level 1 (novice - incoming scholar) to Level 5 (expert - aspirational goals). The integration of the research and career competencies into RCDP development process and subsequent utilization of the ICPC Assessment to evaluate progress is an innovative approach to improve individual Scholar and overall UR -KL2 Program performance in supporting career development needs. Evaluation of this assessment method is described in Table I 8 (see Objective: Develop a KL2 Career Development Program that has value and is disseminated across the CTSA Consortium ). Table I8.

Applicant pools include over 375 junior faculty from the participating schools , clinical resident/fellows from the URSMD ( 750 positions within its 80 clinical residency/ fellowship programs ), and post -doctoral trainees from URSMD ( 66). In rare circumstances, a recruit has applied as an incoming junior faculty member to the Program (having acquired a departmental appointment ). The UR-KL2 Recruitment and Selection Committee will leverage previously successful recruitment strategies to identify and recruit the most qualified fellows and junior faculty . To identify and reach potential internal applicants, information and reminders of marketing efforts will be sent to the Chairs, Program Faculty, fellowship and T32 program directors. The UR -KL2 Program will be incorporated into the orientation program for all new junior faculty. The Co-directors of the translational specializations will be charged with identifying candidates and make personal recruiting efforts through their own social network channels. We support recruitment of women and under -represented minorities in biomedical research (see Recruitment and Retention to Enhance D iversity Section ). Applications will be due in early November, the year prior to the start of the award (July 1 of the following year). The 7 -page application will be comprised of a 3-page RCDP , a 4-page description of the proposed research plan, and 1 -page description of the proposed 'engaged followership' experience. As alluded to in Section I .4.2, the RCDP includes a brief career biography, a description of the overall career goals , the competencies to be achieved, identification of primary mentor , co-mentors , and proposed research plans, including potential supervised engagement with external research partners. The proposed research plan will specify the research questions, the study approach, expected outcome of the research, and timeline. The plan will also include a description of how the research project will lead to a proposal for individual, external funding (e .g. individual K- or R-level award) and an outline of the anticipated timing for submitting manuscripts for publication. Letters of recommendation are required from the primary mentor, co -mentors, the mentor team , and the Department Chair/Center Director who must include assurances that non -research responsibilities will be restricted to no more than 25% of the trainee's tim e (or 50% for certain procedure -based specialties ).

In the first stage, each application is evaluated by 4 reviewers, including 2 members of the Recruitment and Selection Committee and 2 UR faculty with content expertise, but without conflicts of interest (defined as no direct involvement in the proposed mentoring or research). The applications will be reviewed using a numerical scoring format (1 -9) that is similar that used for NIH K awards , yielding an overall impact score and scores for the 5 review criteria to determi ne scientific and technical merit: 1) Candidate, 2) Career Development Plan/Career Goals & Objectives/Plan to Provi de Mentoring (including adequacy of the engaged followership experience) , 3) Research Plan, 4) Mentor(s), Co- Mentor(s), Consultants, Collaborators, 5) Environment and Institutional Commitment to the Candidate. All comments and scores are assembled and the Recruitment and Selection Committee select 5 -7 applicants for an interview. In the second stage, the selected applicants are invited for a 20- minute interview with the UR- KL2 Recruitment and Selection Committee . The Committee selects and nominates the final applicants , with additional approval provided by the KL2 Steering Committee and UR-CTSI Executive Committee. Performance and continued eligibility of the Scholars will be evaluated prior to the end of each funding period. Scholars will be reappointed for a second year by fulfilling the evaluation requirements, submitting appropriate progress and annual reports, and making satisfactory or better progress in achieving the their RCDP -defined milestones. If Scholars are successful in obtaining independent NI H funding (e.g., K23, R01) during the course of their award, they will be dismissed from the Program. An alternate Scholar will then be appointed from the most current applicant pool or an additional position will be offered during the next recruitment cyc le. I.7 Institutional Environment and Commitment to the Program The UR -KL2 Program has the strongest possible institutional support from the President, Provost, and respective Dean's of the participating Schools (see letters of support) and is extraordinarily well -aligned with the UR's Strategic Plan and the missions of the participating School s. Indeed, the overarching vision of the University is to \"fortify its position as one of this nation's leading research universities consistent with our core values of academic excellence, academic freedom, diversity, and community.\" Cross -cutting themes of research synergy across the University are translation of research discoveries into practical benefits to soc iety, community engagement, data science, and development of a high quality, productive research workforce . Substantial investments have been made in support of this vision and strategic plan , including the 200,000 sq ft Saunders Research Building , which houses the UR-CTSI and affiliated programs . Assurances are provided that the Core Leader and other Key Personnel within the program have the time allowed to oversee, implement and assure the success of its objectives. For the last decade, the UR- CTSI has built on the UR's innovative research histor y to advance translational research and translational workforce training . The UR -KL2 Program has been an instrumental part of its transformational growth and development. Over the past 5 years, the UR -KL2 program has been the flagship institutional career development program. During this 5 year -period, we received 47 applications from faculty in the Medical School (n= 39), Dental School (n= 2), School of Nursing (n= 4) and the School of Arts and Sciences (n=2). Of the 14 accepted Scholars over the past 5 years, 11 faculty have been from the Medical School, 2 from the School of Nursing, and 1 from the Dental School. The UR -KL2 Program is uniquely positioned to develop the academic pipeline of junior faculty from individuals within our existing training programs. Synergies with existing institutional and UR-CTSI programs will occur when needed at the level of the UR- KL2 Internal Advisory Committee and the UR- CTSI 's Executive Team and Operations Committee. There will be coordinated support for applicants ( UR-CTSI Research Help Desk), and Scholars, including faculty and mentor development support (see Section I.3.2), continued participation in the UR- CTSI Research Methods Forum (see Section I.4.5.2 , and Research Methods Core ), and peer support throug h UR Junior Faculty Biomedical Research Association (see Section I.4.3.4 ). Each Department and Center also has existing programs for faculty development and ongoing annual reviews to ensure career development and success. CORE I. KL2 CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM I.8 Recruitment and Retention Plan to Enhance Diversity Since its initial funding in 2006, the UR -KL2 Program has been successful in the recruitment and retention of women and under -represented minorities (URM) (DATA Table 10). Between 2006 and 2015, the UR -KL2 Program appointed 31 investigators, 58% (n=18) of whom were women and 12.9% (n=4) of whom were URM, including one deaf individual . In 2014, t he proportion of all UR faculty who identified themselves as members of an underrepresented racial or ethnic mino rity group (data include Black, Native American, Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, and Hispanic, but not more than one race) was 3.9% (n=76), compared to 2.6% (n=37) in 2006. For the participating schools, the corresponding percentages in 2014 were 3.7% (School of Medicine and Dentistry) , 4.9% (School of Nursing) , and 4.3% (Arts, Science, and Engineering), compared to the 2014 national average of 5.2% for the designated groups.17 In 2014, 33.9% (n=655) of UR faculty were women, compared to 28.6% (n=411) in 2006. For participating schools, the corresponding percentages were 34.6% (School of Medicine and Dentistry), 86.9% (School of Nursing), and 23.3% (Arts, Sciences, Engineering). The UR, the UR-CTSI , and UR -KL2 leadership remain committed to creating a supportive and inclusive environment for our entire university community including faculty, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, color, national or ethnic origins, or disability. The UR -KL2 Leadership appreciate that there are barriers to education and career development of URMs in biomedical research, and for those with disabilities, including, but not limited to, availability of role models, implicit biases, and microaggressions. 18 Additionally, URMs face challenges obtaining NIH funding,19 to which the NIH has recommended programmatic emphasis on grantsmanship, mentoring, and the peer review process.20 Additionally, while women are not necessarily underrepresented in the training and in the early stages of careers in medicine, it is well documented that there is a need to attend to the retention and advancement of women is required once they are in the field.21 The goal over the next 5 years is to address these barriers and improve the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty to increase the number of Scholars of underrepresented and diverse background into the UR - KL2 program. This will be accomplished by a variety of new initiatives and strategic approaches in partnership with the UR, Medical Center and UR- CTSI . Importantly, UR -KL2 leadership will work closely with Dr. John Cullen, the newly appointed UR-CTSI Director of Diversity and Inclusion , who serves as a champion for research diversity and inclusion efforts and will organize a coordinated and targeted approach to development of a diverse scientific workforce. Dr. Cullen will work closely with Dr. Linda Chaudron, the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean for Inclusion and Culture Development ( and member of UR -KL2 Internal Advisory Committee) to accomplish the following: 1) coordinating communication around diversity and inclusion e fforts and supporting recruitment and retention of diverse faculty, students, and staff; 2) overseeing development of educational curricula related to scientific issues of diversity; 3) overseeing development of web- based resources focused on diversity in research, local and national training programs, and funding opportunities; 4) working with the UR Office for Faculty Development and Diversity on the University's annual research diversity conference with a focus on highlighting UR-CTSI resources, research , and outreach to faculty and students; and 5) expanding UR-CTSI processes for tracking program graduates to improve engagement with URMs. In addition to working with Drs. Cullen and Chaudron, UR -KL2 leadership will work with Dr. Vivian Lewis, UR Vice Prov ost for Faculty Development and Diversity (and Chair of the UR -KL2 Mentor Development Work Group) to ensure that the University -wide initiatives are aligned and integrated into the UR- CTSI and UR -KL2 Program efforts to enhance recruitment and retention eff orts oriented towards developing a more diverse and inclusive program. Specific efforts to achieve UR -KL2 Program diversity goals will include: 1. To develop targeted outreach strategies to Department Chairs, Center Directors and PIs of training programs (e. g.; T32 and R25) to encourage best practices to recruit and to have their URM post -doctoral trainees and junior faculty apply to the program . This will include periodic presentations at monthly University and Medical Center leadership meetings, email announcements marketing the program, and having i nterested URM or women applicants to meet with existing or past URM or female UR -KL2 awardees. 2. To ensure that peer review for Scholar selection is fair and unbiased. The UR-KL2 leadership will ensure balance among reviewers of UR -KL2 applications and diverse representation on the Recruitment and Selection Committee. Since many biases are hidden and unconscious, all members of the UR -KL2 Recruitment and Selection Committee and Steering Committee , as well as UR-CTSI Staff, will undergo annual diversity awareness training, including cultural competence training led by Dr. Cullen. 3. To ensure that diversity training and awareness of bias is part of the mentor training. Engagement of the UR Mentor Development Work ing Gro up (outlined in Section I .3.2 of the Program Plan), which is directed by Dr. Lewis, to provide individual guidance and support. Mentor training provided to the UR -KL2 Mentors includes specific skill related to promoting diversity and addressing bias. 4. To encourage URM applicants, Scholars , and Mentors to participate in national programs such as the Compact for Diversity ( http://compactforfacultydiversity.org/ ) and the National Research Mentor ing Network (nrmnet.net). In addition, we will leverage existing collaborations with the RCMI (Research Centers in Minority Institutions) Translational Research Network (RTRN). RTRN is a national network of 18 predominantly minority -serving institutions that unit es academic researchers, medical professionals and community partners through technology and health science innovation to reduce disparity. The UR presently has existing partnerships with RTRN via currently funded grants and historical relationships ( e.g. Drs. Lewis and Dye). These programs enable URM Scholars and Mentors from the UR to interact with other minority scholars and mentors outside the institution. 5. To encourage Scholars to participate in existing Department and School networking groups for URM and women faculty (e.g.: Women in Neu rology Committee) and encourage Chairs and Center Directors to nominate URM and women faculty to attend national professional development programs. Since 2011, URMC has sent 7 faculty to the AA MC Minority Early Career Faculty Development Seminar and 8 to the AAMC Early Career Wo men Faculty Development Seminar . 6. To provide al l unsuccessful UR -KL2 applicants with specific feedback about ways to become more competitive for future applications. This is of particular concern for URM given that failure to reapply is high. 7. To maintain awareness and vigilance to University -wide resources and opportunities to support diversity and inclusion. Such initiatives and programs include: 1) an annual dinner for URMC science and medicine URM faculty, 2) a Diversity calendar that advertises local and regional multicultural groups and diversity events, 3) an annual Diversity Conference, 4) Faculty Development workshops and lectures, 5) family friendly and career flexibility policies to assist in balancing work and personal/family lives, and 6) special funds (Special Opportunities Funds) and awards (Faculty Diversity Award and Presidential Diversity Award) that promotes and recognize the exceptional contributions and accomplishments of faculty to fostering a diverse and inclusive community. These efforts will be coordinated through the office of the UR- CTSI Director of Diversity and Inclusion. I.8.1 UR-KL2 Program Recruitment and Retention of Individuals with Disabilities . The UR is supportive of the education and training of individuals with disabilities and is committed to providing equal educational and employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, in accordance with state and federal laws and re gulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1991 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The UR employs professional staff committed to eliminating physical and architectural barriers as well as to responding to the needs o f students, faculty, and staff with disabilities. The UR-KL2 Program has been supportive of and proactive in recruitment of individuals with disabilities. One prior Scholar (Michael McKee, MD, MPH) is deaf and successfully obtained a K01 looking at health literacy among deaf ASL users and cardiovascular health risk. Additionally, the UR now has both a pre- doctoral R25 Bridges to the Doctorate for D/HH trainees (Steven L Barnett , 5R25GM107739) and a post -doctoral K12 institutional career development award i n partnership with the Rochester Institute of Technology (Stephen Dewhurst, 1K12GM106997). The UR -KL2 Program will work cooperatively with these programs to ensure sustainability of all programs when recruiting from the deaf and hard of hearing population. I.9 TRAINING IN THE RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH (RCR) FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARS All students and basic and clinical research trainees at the University of Rochester, including those supported by the CTSA career development (KL2) award, receive multi -faceted training in the responsible conduct in research and are expected to exhibit integrity in the practice of scientific investigation. The University of Rochester maintains a University Commitment to Ethical Research and is proud to be fully accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection (AAHRP). In keeping with these standards and in recognition of the broader concepts of responsible conduct and scientific integrity, our Scholars are educated through formal and informal instruction and application of established ethical principles and professional norms in the performance of activities in conducting clinical and translational research. These are outlined below. Required Course: Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research (lecture and small group exercises) All research Scholars at the University of Rochester are required to complete and pass the course, Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research (IND501/503). This includes our pre -doctoral and postdoctoral training grant recipients, master -level students, and K -award recipients (typical class size i s 200- 250 individuals). The two courses integrate both basic and clinical research trainees and Scholars and are offered annually in the fall semester. The course is co- directed by Robert Dirksen, PhD, (basic science component) and Carl D'Angio, MD (integr ation of basic and clinical research) in support of ongoing clinical and translational research efforts. The one-credit course provides greater than 16 hours of face -to-face contact time in both lecture and small -group discussion formats over a 2- month tim e period. Attendance is mandatory and carefully monitored for lecture and small group sessions by an individual sign -in sheet, together with participant photo- identification. Those participants who arrive >10 minutes late to a lecture are required to write a 1-2 page report on the lecture topic. The eight, one- hour group lectures cover the following core content: 1) Introduction to Research Ethics (e.g.: conflict of interest), 2) policies governing human subject research and animal subjects in research, 3) responsible authorship and publication, 4) data sharing and ownership, 5) plagiarism/scientific misconduct, 6) team -science/mentor -prot\u00e9g\u00e9 approaches, 7) contemporary issues (e.g., stem cell research), and 8) Mentor - student relationship. These group lectu res are provided by institutional leaders and successful researchers (Robert Dirksen, PhD, Chair , Department of Pharmacology and Physiology , Carl D'Angio MD, Professor, Department of P ediatrics, Stephen Dewhurst, PhD, Vice Dean for Research and Associate Vice President for Health Sciences Research, Edith Lord, PhD, Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Education, Mark Taubman, MD, PhD, Dean, School of Medicine and Dentistry, James Palis, M D, PhD, Professor of Pediatrics, Ed Puzas, PhD, Professor of Orthopaedics , and Jeffrey Wyatt, DVM, Professor and Director of Laboratory Animal Medicine). Immediately following the 60- minute lecture, the class divides into small groups of 8 -10 students wit h a faculty facilitator who engages the students in open discussions of case studies that are designed to emphasize real - life examples of the topics discussed in the preceding lecture. The 60- minute small group sessions are lead by 20-25 mid- to-senior level faculty who are recruited and managed by the UR-CTSI Mentor Development Working Group. Our course faculty have extensive experience in the integrity and ethical conduct of basic, clinical and translational research to provide a breadth of discussion and experience. This participation also serves as ongoing responsible conduct instruction for the small group facilitators. Additionally, we actively recruit past fellowship trainees and career development award recipients to act as small group facilitators to emphasize the lifelong learning and self -awareness needed for continuous and enlightened responsible conduct. Continuing Education in the Responsible Conduct of Research at URMC Continuing education in Responsible Conduct of Research at URMC is achieved through a combination of special invited lectures, online courses, skill -building workshops, monthly seminar series, and recruitment to participate as a small group facilitator for the IND501/506 Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research courses. A website highlighting these RCR continuing education activities is maintained by the Office of graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs: http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/professional - development/research- ethics/continuing -ed.cfm. All graduate students, postdoctoral appointees, clinical fellow and research faculty at the University of Rochester Medical Center involved in research are required to participate in continued RCR training. Several RCR continuing education activities are provided to accomplish this requirement. First, all Scholars are required to attend the annual Bioethics Lecture held at the medical center each spring. This lecture series, held every year si nce 2011, highlights a different topic in research ethics and professional integrity each year. Invited speakers include leaders and experts on bioethics topics both within the medical and throughout the country. An open social reception following the lect ure is provided to allow Scholars to meet and interact with the speaker following the lecture. The lecture is also streamed to the internet so that Scholars unable to attend can view the lecture in real -time. When approved by the speaker, the recorded lect ure is made available on our website for Scholars that miss the lecture. The Fifth Annual Bioethics Lecture was given by Dr. Margie Shaw on May 11, 2015, which involved a discussion of ethical issues around decisions leading to the early release of promisi ng investigational drugs in clinical trials. As a second mechanism for continued RCR training, individuals that have completed the Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research course (or comparable training) are encouraged to participate as a facilitator in the course as part of their ongoing professional development and training in the responsible conduct in research. Finally, online ethics courses (e.g. CITI Program Human Subjects Protection and Responsible Conduct of Research courses), skill -building workshops, and the Rochester Clinical and Translational and Medical Humanities and Bioethics seminar series are also offered to trainees to further their ongoing RCR training. Required Training for Scholars performing research involving human subjects All Sc holars performing human subjects research are required to complete an online self -study program in human subject protection. The University has selected an on- line program called the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program). A collaborative group of universities (including the University of Rochester) and organizations created the CITI Program to provide a comprehensive selection of educational on- line modules that satisfy institutional instructional mandates in the Protection of Human Research Subjects or on the ethical principles of research outlined in the Belmont Report and other research related issues. Initial instruction takes about 6 -7 hours. Refresher courses are required every 3 years and take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to c omplete. Scholars need to achieve a score of at least 85% to successfully establish and renew their certification. Required Training for Scholars performing research involving animals Similar to requirements for human subjects research, all Scholars working with live vertebrate animals undergo training as part of the institutional animal welfare training program administered by the institutional IACUC, known as the University Committee on Animal Resources (UCAR). This program stipulates training in animal care and handling that is tailored to specific experimental requirements and vertebrate species. Required instructional components for all Scholars include animal resource orientation (1.5hr classroom instruction), rodent colony management training, microis olator technology training, rodent euthanasia instruction, and facility tours. UCAR adopted the CITI online program for basic, species -specific, and surgery training, including topics like aseptic surgery, reducing pain and distress in laboratory mice and rats, and species -specific training for cats, dogs, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamster, mice, non -human primates, rabbits, rats, and swine. Additional training materials (instruction and examination) for research involving ferrets, chickens, and non- human prima tes are available directly from the UCAR Office. Sponsored- Seminars, Workshops, and Coursework Instruction on responsible conduct of research is also available in Sponsored- Seminars, Workshops, and coursework. These are all open to trainees, Scholars, mentors and other faculty at the University. Examples are included below: 1. Monthly Seminar Series: Achieving High Quality Clinical and Translational Research. A monthly seminar entitled, \" Achieving High Quality Clinical and Translational Research\" is integrated within the University -wide UR-CTSI -sponsored Rochester Clinical and Translational (RCTR) Seminar Series , which is held September through June on the second Tuesday of each month. The integration of these lectures emphasizes the high priority pla ced on providing continuous and ongoing ethical instruction to the University community of clinical and translational researchers. The objectives of the embedded seminar are to educate clinical and translational researchers, clinical research coordinators, and support staff in the methods of conducting studies in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) standards and ways to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. Given the growing importance of individual and institutional conflicts of interest (COI) , we will initiate at least 2 lectures per year that cover relevant topics in COI, including national trends, Physician Payment Sunshine Act and local implications, effects of COI bias on research results, and updates on local policies and requirements. 2. Workshops include the monthly series entitled Academic Development Workshops , which address various career development topics (e.g.: team -science, interdisciplinary research, diversity, cultural sensitivity, and promotion), i ncluding those related to responsible conduct of research. 3. Classroom and Online Coursework The individual courses PM 419: Recruitment and Retention of Research Subjects, PM 494: Community -Based Participatory Research, and the online courses in Research Project Administration and Clinical Research Study Finances Training are available to all Scholars (and required for some training groups) and have components specifically addressing diversity, interdisciplinary research, and compliance with ethical standards and regulations. Many courses are based on University documents and policies regarding the ethical conduct of research. For example, the Clinical Research Study Finances Training course was developed from the content of the University of Rochester Cli nical Research Standard Operating Procedures Regarding Financial Oversight and Billing Compliance Individualized Mentoring The UR-CTSI places a high value on individualized mentoring and role modeling standards of behavior for its trainees and Scholars. To assist in this process, the Mentor Development Working Group provides support and instruction (via the Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Curriculum) to faculty in mentor roles and manages a pool of potential mentors based on\" 1) prior track record, 2) attention to diversit y, and 3) funding experience. Members of the Mentor Development Core are all highly regarded and respected mentors in their own right, many of whom have received prior University Mentoring awards. Continuing Participation of Faculty and Scholars in Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible conduct of research and scientific integrity begins and ends with institutional leaders and our faculty. Therefore, we expect active and continuous participation not only in being positive role models, but also in acti ve contributions to the instruction in a variety of ways. Faculty participate as either: 1) members of the Mentor Development Working Group, 2) lecturers or facilitators of small groups in the Ethics and Professional Integrity course, or 3) lecturers/leaders or participants in Skill- Building Workshops, Symposium, or individual courses. Additionally, Scholars are expected to emulate the practices of their mentors and instructors. After Scholars have taken the required coursework and Human Subject Protection and/or UCAR Certification, ongoing and lifelong instruction is planned by signing the compact letters when advising students or career development plan, Human Subject Protection re -certification every 3 years, and educational participation as team leaders or lecturers in on -going programs. I.10 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS Scholars: This is an education and career development grant program. All KL2 Scholars will complete Responsible Conduct of Research Training including certification in Human Subjects Protection, if they plan to conduct work that will involve human subjects ( https://www.rochester.edu/ohsp/education/index.html ). This training includes an on- line program called the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program) prior to conducting any human subject research. This program was developed as a collaborative effort among various universities and organizations (including the University of Rochester) to provide comprehensive training in the protection of human research subjects and is administered by the University of Miami. The program consists of several short learning modules with a brief quiz after each module. Students and faculty working with human subjects choose from three courses depending on the type of research conducted: Greater Than Minimal Risk Biomedical - Conduct ing research that involves drugs, devices, biologics, or medical procedures that involve greater than minimal risk (e.g., biopsies, x -rays, etc.). Greater Than Minimal Risk Behavioral - Conduct ing social/behavioral research that involves sensitive or illegal behaviors (e.g., sexual behaviors, domestic violence, drug abuse, etc.). Minimal Risk - Conduct ing research using minimal risk procedures only (e.g., collection of small amounts of blood or other biologic al materials, surveys, record reviews, etc.). If certification obtained for minimal risk research, but then become involved in a greater than minimal risk study, completing one of the greater than minimal risk research training modules will be required. Initial instruction takes about 6 -7 hours for the \"greater than minimal risk\" and 2- 3 hours for the \"minimal risk\" modules. Re- certification courses need to be taken every 3 years, which take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to complete. Trainees need to achieve a score of 85% to successfully establish and renew their certification. In the conduct of research involving human subjects, the University of Rochester is guided by the ethical principles stated in the Belmont Report. The University's fundamental commi tment to the protection of human subjects applies to all human subject research conducted by University faculty or staff, regardless of funding source or site of the research. The University follows the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regula tions at 45 CFR Part 46, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations at 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56. Research Mentors : The University 's Research Subjects Review Board (RSRB; aka the IRB) reviews and approves all faculty research projects that involve human subjects research pri or to initiation of any studies. This includes all projects on which K12 Scholars may participate. I.11 PROTE CTION OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS Scholars: This is an education and career development grant program. All KL2 Scholars will complete training in the use and care of vertebrate animals for research as part of the Responsible Conduct of Research Training and as s pecifically required by the University Committee on Animal Research (UCAR) depending on the type of animal research undertaken. https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/MediaLibraries/URMCMedia/ucar/policies/documents/5 -12-14-Approved- Assurance- A3292 -01-web.pdf Trainees who use live vertebrate animals as part of their research complete federally -mandated animal Training, and UCAR reviews and approves all research and teaching protocols involving the use of live vertebrate animals and conducts regular inspection and evaluation of facilities in which ani mals are housed and maintained. Research Mentors : The University Committee on Animal Research (UCAR ; aka the IACUC ) reviews and approves all faculty research projects that involve vertebrate animals pri or to initiation o f any studies. This includes all projects on which KL2 Scholars may participate. CORE I. KL2 CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM - REFERENCES CITED 1.

TL1 TRAINING PROGRAM J.1 BACKGROUND J.1.1 Rationale The University of Rochester (UR) has a decades -long distinguished history in innovative clinical research education,1,2 enhanced substantially since 2006 with the establishment and focus of the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Science Institute ( UR-CTSI).3 Building historically on the groundbreaking concept of medical education based on the biopsychosocial model starting in the 1940s with Engel and Romano,2,4 the UR has continued to create paradigm -shifting educational reform integrating research and systematic evaluation with problem -based medical educ ation,5-7 community engagement and population health,8-13 and mentored field experience.14-18 This culture of creativity and innovation in pre- doctoral research training supported through prior TL1 awards is embodied by an institutional focus on research training from molecules to populations. An example is the recent expansion of the UR- TL1-supported PhD program in Translational Biomedical Science (TBS) to include a track emphasizing the translational science surrounding infectio n from molecules to populations . Through this and other means, the UR-CTSI has created an institution -wide focal point for multidisciplinary research training. Further, UR-TL1-supported students in the 50+ year -old UR MD/PhD training program (Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)) have taken advantage of the TBS program and other multidisciplinary graduate training options. In addition, UR-TL1- supported Academic Research Track (ART) further provides a pipeline o f clinical and translational research - prepared academic phy sicians through a comprehensive research training and mentoring experience. Predoctoral training is a priority within Rochester's CTSI, is well -integrated , and has successfully generated productive, employed clinical researchers, both within and outside of academics. The vision for the UR- TL1 in the next era of UR -CTSI is inspired by several critical developments in the healthcare and institutional landscape of Rochester and the US more broadly, namely: 1) Implementation of national health care reform prioritizing evidence- based practice and population health, 19,20 2) rapid emergence of data science and \"Big Data\" analytic opportunities and methodological approaches to healthcare and population health, 21-23 and 3) emergence of precision/personalized medicine research and healthcare delivery using phenotype- genoty pe and biomarker -informed science.24,25 The goals for the next UR-TL1 effort include: 1. To grow a pipeline of clinical and translational researchers able to address new and emerging scientific and methodological domains. We will grow this pipeline by expanding and transitioning the core UR-TL1 components (PhD -TBS, MD/PhD MSTP, Year -out ART) to accommodate flexible individualized training plans in existing and emerging areas of multi -disciplinary, team -science -oriented research that incorporates data science, population health, and precision medicine. 2. To enhance experiential and didactic learning through new training opportunities and partnerships that emphasize team science. We will enhance team science opportunities by expanding the scope of existing educational partnerships to support team science training and practice, with a unique opportunity to participate in range of research placements , including within predominantly minority - serving institutions participating in the Research C enters in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Translational Research Network (RTRN) and within UR Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (UR -BEST) initiative. 3. To stimulate creative and novel population health research that involves leveraging new tools (e. g. Electronic Health Records [EHR]) and methods (e.g. Data Science, Bioinformatics) through establishing a University -wide Post -Doctoral Fellowship in Population Health. We will create this postdoctoral program linking the UR-TL1 Program components togethe r by crossing disciplines, partners, and research clusters to address new, integrative methods and population health problems. 4. To rigorously evaluate the role of the UR -TL1 Training Program on the development of the clinical and translational research pipeline and disseminate learnings from the training program. We will evaluate this program and its components to share best practice, revise and improve strategy, and understand better the rol e of UR- TL1 training within the entire CTSI -wide enterprise. The signature UR -TL1-supported predoctoral training opportunities at UR are historically closely integrated with the KL2 program and workforce and mentor development functions through shared and integrated governance structures, and through a shared mentor base. Figure J1. TL1 Program Goals J.1.2 Training Program History Since inception in 2006, the UR -TL1 Program has supported Trainees from three constituent programs (all of which are described fully below in Section J.2.3, Proposed Program Plan) : 1) the Academic Research Track (ART), which provides a year -out experience for medical students interested in research, 2) the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), which provides medical and doctoral (MD/PhD) education for individuals who want to become clinician- investigators , and 3) the Translational Biomedical Science (TBS) Program, which provides doctoral -level education and training to individuals pursuing careers relating to the translation of basic biomedical research i nto clinical strategies to improve health. In the 2015- 2016 academic year, a new training focus was added to the TBS program, entitled \"Infection and Immunity: From Molecules to Populations (IIMP)\". The IIMP program is funded by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund and is designed to prepare the next generation of researchers who can lead interdisciplinary research that combines population approaches with insights generated at the cellular and molecular level. Table J 1 provides a breakdown of the 87 pre-doctoral tr ainees who have participated in the training program since the beginning of the UR- CTSI in 2006, 57 of which benefitted from UR -TL1 support . Of note, 2 ART students have transitioned to the MSTP with UR-CTSI support, and 3 others transitioned and were supported by other mechanisms. Of the 60 ART students, 24 (40%) have pursued Masters Degrees over a wide range of disciplines (2 MS -CI, 2 MS -TR, 13 MPH, 5 MS in Neurobiology and Anatomy, 1 MS in Biomedical Engineering, 1 MS in Health Professions Education). In total, 66 of 87 trainees have published their findings, 45 as first author . Tabl e J2 provides additional trainee metrics. Of the 16 MSTP students funded to date, enrollment has been in a variety of PhD programs, including Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Epidemiology, Health Services Research, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Neuroscience and Transl ational Biomedical Science. To date, 15 of 16 MSTP trainees have published and have made significant contributions to their mentors' research programs. We currently have thirteen TBS students enrolled (3 of whom are enrolled in the concentration in Infecti on and Immunity: From Molecules to Populations); one additional TBS student starting in January 2016 will pursue a dual TBS/computer science PhD). We received 26 full applications for the 2015 -2016 year (including 9 reported underrepresented minority students). We made offers of admission to 6 outstanding students (2 for TBS, 4 for TBS/IIMP) (2 male, 4 female; 4 underrepresented minority students) with four matriculating in August 2015 and one matriculating in January 2016. J.1.3. Need for this Training Program In the context of a rapid shift toward the \"Learning Healthcare System\" stimulated by major recent health reforms in America, 26 demand for more and varied research to support health policy, practice, and decision- making is similarly rapidly increasing.27 Increasingly available and complex health data is a central component of the emerging clinical and translational research landscape,28 limited by challenges to interoperability, security and privacy concerns, quality, and access.29 Within this new research ecosystem, which demands more research and better access,20 a set of trends challenge the traditional clinical and translational researcher pipeline: increasing competitiveness in obtaining research funding,30 increasing age of successf ul research grant PIs,31 fewer opportunities in academic settings,23,32 and fewer clinicians opting for a research -engaged Table J 1.

This UR-TL1 builds on these recommendations. Similarly, calls for transition in the clinical researcher pipeline focus upon creating a research workforce that is flexible, prepared for integrated research questions that cross disciplines, and engages populations, and increasingly resides outside of traditional academic settings. 30 The University of Rochester has responded rapidly to trends impacting the researcher pipeline through procurement of clinical research training programs that increase research engagement with affected communities, 3,10,35,36 that prepare researchers for new career pathways outside of academia,37,38 that leverage new scientif ic areas,39-41 and that prioritize integration of disciplines to address overarching disease priorities.42-44 This UR-TL1 Training Program leverages the University of Rochester's strong, diverse, and unique institutional environment and partnerships, high quality trainee base, and strength in the emerging contemporary priorities of the science informing precision medicine, data science and big data, and population health. J.1.4 Institutional Environment and Commitment to Training J.1.4.1 UR Graduate and Medical Education The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) is an integrated academic health center that comprises The School of Medicine and Dentistry, including its faculty practice (University of Rochester Medical Faculty Group), Strong Memorial Hospital, Highland Hospital, Golisano Children's Hospital, James P. Wilmot Cancer Center, School of Nursing, Eastman Dental Center, the Visiting Nurse Service, Highlands at Pittsford, and Highlands at Brighton. With over 700 residents and fellows engaged in graduate medical education at the University of Rochester Medical Center, the University was awarded a 6- year institutional reaccreditation by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for sponsorship of residency and fellowship programs. URMC was also recognized by the ACGME's Committee on Innovation in the Learning Environment for creating an atmosphere that is supportive of educational excellence. There are currently 1,510 full-time faculty and 190 part -time faculty in the School of Medicine and Dentistry. In 2014- 2015 there were 1,200 actively sponsored research projects totaling over $216 million, reflecting 55% clinical research, 33% basic research, and 12% education/training programs and other types of research. At the level of the UR- CTSI, we are committed to training the translational science workforce with outstanding and highly productive programs at all levels: pre - and post -doctoral training, support for faculty career development, flexible and innovative didactic training, pioneering programs for research staff development, and commitment to diversity. Overview of the Medical Curriculum at UR UR-TL1 Trainees include students who are engaged with the UR's innovative medical curriculum in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) or the Academic Research Track (ART). The UR's MD curriculum, known as the \"Double Helix Curriculum,\" integrates interdisciplinary coursework in basic science and clinical medicine 'strands ', with required and elective clinical experiences that offer students rural, urban, community and tertiary care patient care experiences. Each element of the curriculum strengthens UR's biopsychosocial tradition by fostering knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors of the physician/scientist/humanist by combining cutting- edge, evidence- based natural and social sciences with the relationship- centered skills that are UR 's distinctive trademark. Additionally, i n the final year, the UR- CTSI -sponsored course \" Process of Discovery\" exposes students to the ways in which new basic science knowledge changes clinical care. The relationships between clinical care and basic, trans lational and clinical research are explored. The students also work in groups, by their planned medical specialty, to develop and present a research plan that addresses how basic research could be applied to solve a clinical problem. Those students in the MSTP and ART who are returning to full -time medical education in the final year participate as 'study section' members, evaluating the final projects of other students. This work extends on their research exposure by providing an evaluator experience. J.1.4.2 Institutional Training and Career Development Programs As seen in Table J3 , the URMC has a robust portfolio of NIH training and career development funding, which is a testament to the high level of mentor expertise and training acumen. Current funding includes 20 T32 grants (80 predoctoral and 45 postdoctoral slots) within clinical (n=12) or basic science (n=8) departments and centers, as well as 9 'other' institutional training grants (an additional 32 predoctoral and 20 postdoctoral slots). Further, URMC trainees and scholars have obtained substantial financial support for their research programs, as evidenced by current funding for 25 individual F awards (5 F30, 16 F31, 4 F32), 28 K awards (5 K01, K07, K12/KL2, 1 K24) , and 8 R25 awards, as well as an additional 27 non- NIH individual career awards from other sponsors (e.g. foundations and National Associations) . These training programs do not directly compete for UR -TL1 candidates. A higher level harmonization of institutional training and career development programs takes place with Stephen Dewhurst, PhD, Vice Dean of Research and Karl Kieburtz, MD, MPH, Senior Associate Dean of Clinical Research and PI, UR -CTSI. These individuals meet at least on a monthly basis and when needed to discuss research training priorities and approaches to potential overlap and synergies across existing and proposed training programs.

The UR-TL1 Program will leverage its many institutional resources, making them available as experiential learning venues and/or education content providers for trainees. The following (and other av ailable resources) are examples of internal units providing unique venues for trainee collaboration: Center for Community Health (CCH) : applies public health, population science, community engagement Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics (CHET) : supports early -phase clinical trials. Center for Medical Technology Innovation (CMTI) : develops technical solutions to clinical problems. Clinical Trials Coordination Center (CTCC) : fosters multi -institutional academic research through the development, management, and reporting of hypothesis -driven, controlled clinical trials. Excell Partners: provides pre -seed and seed stage financing to high- tech start -up companies. Human Resources: provides training in professionalism and career development to UR employees. Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) : oversees recombinant DNA research at UR. Office of Human Subject Protection (OHSP) : oversees human subjects research at UR; research boot camp for and orientation to human subject research Office of Regulatory S upport (ORS) : helps UR scientists navigate complex regulatory requirements. Office of Research Quality and Compliance : quality/ compliance function for GXP -regulated studies Technical Entrepreneurship and Management (TEAM) program : allows students to devel op detailed technical knowledge in their field as well as knowledge of business; offers unique courses. Upstate Stem Cell cGMP Facility (USCGF) : develops and produces novel stem cell -based products. UR Ventures (Office of Technology Transfer) : supports tec hnology development, licensing and transfer; provides a Technology Development Fund to which students and fellows are eligible to apply. J.1.4.4 Participation in networks comprised of minority -serving and global institutions The UR is engaged in research and collaboration with institutions that are part of the NIH -funded Research Centers in Minority (RCMI) Institutions Translational Research Network (RTRN). RTRN was established in 2007 by a memorandum of understanding between the 18 minority research universities, colleges and medical schools of the RCMI program under a common goal of fostering collaborations across RCMI institutions. Collaborations within and beyond the RCMI community promote joint grant applications and publi cations and accelerate the pace of basic, clinical and translational research. The RTRN leverages the collective research infrastructure, resources and expertise of each member institution. The primary goal is to form multi - institutional research collaborations that focus on addressing health disparities. The UR -TL1 Program Director (Dr. Dye) previously directed informatics for an RCMI institution (University of Hawaii) and actively engaged with RTRN's informatics and biorepository clusters. Additionally, D r Vivian Lewis at UR (Mentor Development Core) collaborates closely with Xavier University in Louisiana ( an historically Black college, and RTRN member institution) as it seeks to encourage their faculty and students to conduct research. As an institution funded by the trans -NIH program Building Infrastructure Leading to Diversity (IUL1MD009607- 01), Xavier has support for undergraduates to engage in summer mentored research experiences at partner institutions including the University of Rochester. In addit ion, UR houses numerous large global health programs, including the CDC's Global and Territorial Health Research Network 's (\"Global Network\") Coordinating Center (PI, Dr. Tim Dye, UR -TL1 Program Director). The Global Network partners CDC -funded Prevention Research Centers with institutions in US - affiliated locations in the Caribbean and Pacific to conduct research and intervention to reduce chronic disease burden in low -resource areas. The Global Network has demonstrated partnerships with the University of Hawaii, University of Puerto Rico, Yale University, and the University of Illinois, along with other international partner sites. Trainees can become involved with UR -based research for the Global Network on technology and health in Puerto Rico and the Pacific, with Yale's work on telemedicine in India, or Illinois' work with cervical cancer in Senegal. Several other NIH -funded research projects housed at UR (Dye and Ossip, Multi -PIs) focus on technology and maternal health improvement in Latin America. While all Trainees will have open access to the UR's many areas of excellence and expertise, in particularly within our prioritized research areas (science informing precision medicine, data science/ big data, and population health), Trainees will be strongly encouraged to explore collaboration with one or more of the members of the UR -RTRN partnership or to engage with global health partners and programs. Network partners can be identified for short - and long er-term research experiences and opportunities across all TL -1 trainee types. These partnerships will provide Trainees the opportunity to expand their scientific work and to appreciate the unique research priorities and opportunities provided by predominantly minority -serving institutions, or to enable greater exposure to the scientific needs of global populations and researchers. As a result, Trainees may have invaluable experience with topics and collaborations addressing underserved populations, disparit ies, and needs. J.1.4.5 Institutional Commitment At the Institutional level, the President, Provost, and Deans of the participating Schools (see letters of support) as well as the leadership of the UR-CTSI and related University -wide Centers and Institutes are committed to the success of the UR -TL1 Program , and have ensured that all UR -TL1 senior and key personnel have sufficient time allowed to oversee, implement and assure its success and will facilitate access to institutional programs and resources to benefit our trainees. For instance, Dr. Kieburtz, UR-CTSI PI will work to facilitate externships with partner organizations and UNYTE (UNYTE is the UR-CTSI -sponsored network of biomedical research facilities in the Upstate New York region). Dr. Timothy Dye and Dr. Vivian Lewis will work with pre - existing partnerships in NIH -funded Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) Translational Research Network (RTRN) institutions to identify appropriate external research placement sites and opportunities. Leadership of the UR-CTSI and senior UR institutional leaders have committed to supporting the UR-TL1 Training Program program in a number of ways, described in a number of places throughout this application. Key institutional commitments are delineated in the institutional letters of support. Highlights are: 1. Dr. Mark Taubman, Dean, UR School of Medicine & Dentistry (SMD). Dr. Taubman will ensure that Dr. Dye has adequate time and support to fulfill his duties as program director, will ensure that program faculty have adequate time to mentor trainees, and will encourage all biomedical research trainees, as well as all SMD faculty, to partici pate fully in the UR- TL1 Program , through recruitment of suitable trainees, or in serving as mentors. 2. Dr. Edith Lord, Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs, SMD . Dr. Lord's office will support travel costs for faculty travel for trainee recruitment, will provide 12 months of support for all incoming PhD students, will provide \"backstop\" support for trainees that need support due to mentor's loss of a grant, and will facilitate acces s to a range of skills development programs within the Offices for Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs (OGEPA). 3. Henry Kautz , Director of the Goergen Institute of Data Science , will support program development as it pertains to data science and wil l serve on the UR- TL1 Internal Advisory Committee. 4.

The UR- TL1 Program Director will oversee all aspects of the UR- TL1 Program , will serve as a member of the UR- CTSI Executive Team to ensure communication regarding UR-TL1 matters, will chair the UR- TL1 Steering Committee, and w ill be responsible for communications with the NIH regarding the UR-TL1 Program. The UR-TL1 Senior Administrator will administer the day -to-day responsibilities of the UR- TL1 Training Program. These two individuals will meet monthly to review the progress of the program and will have overlapping membership on the UR -TL1 Steering Committee, the UR- CTSI Operations Committee, and the UR- CTSI Executive Team (see Section J.2.1.5 ) to ensure close coordination and alignment of UR- CTSI functions and UR-TL1 Program operations. The UR-TL1 Steering Committee will consist of the UR-TL1 Program Director, UR-TL1 Senior Administrator, and the directors of the constituent programs (Drs. Ossip, Gross, O'Banion, and Simpson- Haidaris) and will meet quarterly to review all aspects of the program, assess evaluation findings, and promote continuous improvement in the program. The UR-TL1 Recruitment and Selection Committee will oversee trainee application procedures, the selection process, approach to marketing the program, and i nitiatives to improve diversity. This Committee will be chaired by the Program Director, and will include the directors of t he four constituent programs (Drs. Ossip, Gross, O'Banion, and Simpson- Haidaris) , the chair of the Mentor Development Working Group ( Dr. Vivian Lewis ), and the UR-CTSI Director of Diversity and Inclusion ( Dr. John Cullen ). On an annual basis, each constituent program director will recommend candidates to the Committee (each of whom will be nominated and selected according to procedures described below in S ection J.2.5 Trainee Candidates). TL1 trainee selections will be presented to and reviewed by the UR- CTSI Executive Team, and w ith the consensus of the group, the proposed candidates will be accepted into the program. The UR-TL1 Trainee Evaluation Committee will meet twice each year to monitor the performance of each trainee during the course of their appointment. This committee will be chaired by Dr. Lewis (Chair, Mentor Figure J2. Administrative Structure of the UR -TL1 Training Program and Relevant UR -CTSI Entities Development Working Group) and will include each Trainee's primary mentor. Th is Committee will report its findings to the UR- TL1 Steering Committee to ensure that each trainee is making progress appropriate to the goals of his or her program, as well as to the UR-CTSI Mentor Development Core to promote continuous improvement in mentoring practices at the institution. The UR-TL1 Internal Advisory Committee will be chaired by the Program Director and meet annually to review the achievements of the UR-TL1 Program , including trainee progress, and recommend program improvements based upon institutional developments (such as development of new training programs or resources) and national trends. The following UR faculty members, all with significant educational exper ience and expertise, have agreed to serve on this committee: 1) Jim Dolan, MD, Associate Professor of Public Health Sciences, Function Leader for Translational Workforce Development in the UR- CTSI, and Associate Chair for Education in the Department of Pub lic Health Sciences; 2) Ekaterina Noyes, PhD, Professor of Surgery and Function Leader for Collaboration and Multi -Disciplinary Team Science for the UR-CTSI; 3) Ann Dozier, PhD RN, Professor and Interim Chair of Public Health Sciences, and Function Leader for Evaluation and Continuous Improvement for the UR-CTSI; 4) Edith Lord, PhD, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs; 5) David Lambert, MD, Professor of Medicine and Senior Associate D ean for Medical Education; and 6) Henry Kautz, PhD, Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Goergen Institute for Data Science. The chosen members all represent significant expertise and experience in disciplines relevant to the UR- TL1 training p rogram: team science (Dye, Noyes); population health (Dolan, Dozier, Dye, Noyes); science informing precision medicine (Dye, Lord); data science (Dye, Kautz); medical education (Dolan, Lambert); and graduate education in the biomedical sciences (Dolan, Dozier, Dye, Lord). J.2.1.4 Innovation Key program innovations include: Prioritizing training focus around \"new\" and emerging research priorities for NIH that were not yet existing or prominent at the last TL1 renewal. The combined major science drivers of health reform (with its focus on population health management), rapid technological advances in integrated phenotype- genotype biomarker -based research (supporting precision medicine), and biomedical \"big data\" science, were not prominent drivers at the last renewal application in 2011. These emphases are now refocusing our TL1 effort, expanding our prior experience with successful, specific trainee types (e.g. MSTP, ART, PhD-BDS) to reach these new scientific domains through certificates, courses, and degrees. Linkage with RCMI/RTRN Institutions to broaden diversity and disparities base . The partnership between UR and RTRN is unique nationally and leverages the strengths at UR in the three priority areas mentioned above with the strength in diversity and disparities research at RTRN's minority -serving institutions. The ability for students to learn and experience research across institutions will strengthen the ability of both to address disparities in population health, precision medicine, and in data science. Close integration with other related and innovative training and research efforts at UR targeting non- traditional career paths, global health research, and the deaf and hard of hearing population. The TL1 is closely connected through leadership (Dye, Oss ip, Dewhurst, Topham, Simpson -Haidaris) and training options with other innovative, nationally -unique training opportunities targeting populations -in-need (e.g., deaf/hard -of-hearing, global communities, Hispanic and other ethnicities) and that are pioneering new education and career strategies (non-traditional career paths, biomedical data science) . J.2.1.5 Alignment of the UR- TL1 Program with UR -CTSI Priorities and Leadership While UR-TL1 Program will be overseen by the Program Director and the committees described previously, it will be closely aligned and integrated with the Overall Vision and Strategic Goals of the UR- CTSI (Table J4 ). Specifically, UR-TL1 Program leadership has designed and will operate the UR-TL1 Program in such a way as to prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to enter the translational research workforce, prepared to contribute leadership, \"engaged followership\" and expertise in the specific disciplines to be emphasized by thi s program. Through the organizational mechanisms summarized below (and described more fully in the Organization, Governance, Collaboration and Communication function of the UL1 Administrative Core), the UR-TL1 Program will be continuously integrated with t he UR-CTSI and able to benefit fully from UR -CTSI resources. The UR-CTSI Executive Team will meet weekly and be comprised of the UL1 PIs (Drs. Bennett, Kieburtz and Zand), the Program Directors / PIs for the UR-TL1 (Dr. Dye) and UR-KL2 (Dr. Holloway) and the three executive directors (Mr. Fogg, Ms. Jensen and Mr. Rubinstein) . This team will provide senior -level oversight of all programs, projects, and the allocation of resources, including those activities that support workforce development activities , including the UR-TL1 Program . The UR-CTSI Opera tions Committee will meet twice each month, and consists of the UR-CTSI PIs, the Executive Directors, the UR-TL1 and UR - KL2 Program Director s, and the UR-CTSI Function Leaders . This group will provide oversight to ensure coordination, collaboration, and co mmunication across all UR- CTSI cores and training/development programs . The UR-CTSI Mentor Development Working Group will be chaired by Dr. Vivian Lewis (Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity) and is convened and supported by the UR- CTSI thro ugh the Translational Workforce Development function of the UR-CTSI Translational Endeavors core. This group will provide mentor training and individualized instruction for mentors of Trainees , work with trainees and mentor/trainee dyads to guide development of individualized development plans (IDPs) for trainees, and will monitor mentor/trainee relationships to ensure productive working relationships. The support provided by this working group is a UR innovation that has been part of the UR- TL1 Program since 2006. 45 Trainees receive guidance in developing IDPs through a mentor -trainee workshop at the beginning of each program year (see S ection J.2.3.4 below). Mentors receive introductory training through a hybrid online/face -to-face training program, and may progress to a Master Mentors program (described below in S ection J.2.2.2 ). The UR-CTSI Evaluation Working Group is lead by Dr. Ann Dozier and is similarly convened and supported by the UR-CTSI through the Evaluation and Continuous Improv ement function of the Administrative Core. This group will carry out the evaluation plan described in S ection J.2.4 , below. All UR-CTSI cores contribute to supporting the UR- TL1 Program , as described in Table J5 .

Holloway (PI) Collaboration in development of educational resources J.2.2 PROGRAM FACULTY J.2.2.1 Mentors for the UR -TL1 Program fall into three distinct yet overlapping areas of emphasis. The UR-TL1 Program has identified mentors with training experience and complementary expertise who represent breadth, expertise, and productivity in clinical and translational science at URMC. Our three prioritized training areas include: 1) Science informing Precision Medicine; 2) Data Science/ Big Data; and 3) Population Health. In total, of our 60 mentors, 36 have additional secondary appointments, showing thei r commitment to integrative team science; together the mentors have over $209 million in extramural funding. See DATA Tables 2 and 4 for information on rank, appointments and funding. Priority 1 - Science informing Precision Medicine: This mentor cluster includes those faculty focusing upon basic and clinical research that contributes to precision medicine, spanning a range of research including genomic, molecular, pathogenesis, and other s. The 29 mentors identified in this research cluster (18 with secondary academic appointments) represent 18 departments (6 divisions) and 8 multidisciplinary centers. These investigators have $154 million in extramural funding. Priority 2 - Data Science/Big Data: This mentor cluster reflects the UR's large- scale commitment and rapidly growing, world- class capacity in data science (exceeding $100 million investment, including a new dedicated building) . The 12 mentors in this research cluster (3 with secondary academic appointments) represent 16 departments and 2 multidisciplinary centers/institute. These investigators have approximately $47 million in extramural funding. Priority 3 - Population Health: This mentor cluster reflects the priority shaping health reform of population health and population health analyt ics, crossing public health, health services, clinical care, and community engagement. The 19 mentors in this research cluster (14 with secondary academic appointments) represent 17 departments (2 divisions) and 4 multidisciplinary centers. These investiga tors have approximately $51 million in extramural funding . J.2.2 .2 Faculty Mentoring Plan for new UR- TL1 Program Faculty and for those without prior mentoring experience. All UR-TL1 Program faculty, including new faculty and those without prior experience, are expected to participate in our successful hybrid online mentoring curriculum.45 At the beginning of each academic year, the members of the Mentor Development Working Group meet with the Program Faculty/Mentors and Trainees to introduce them to the goals of the curriculum. The course pedagogy is for the mentors to read, reflect on and discuss the principal domains of mentoring practice. The primary reading for the course is \"On Being a Mentor: A Guide to Mentoring in Higher Education\"46 which provides examples and case studies in these key domains, as well as methods of good mentoring. The online course content consists of 10 mentoring scenarios (cases and short videos), each with open- ended questions and supplemental reading material. The online material, which is posted on BlackboardTM, can be completed in 1- 3 hours . All me ntors are then required to attend a Mentor -the-Mentor workshop. De-identified responses to the open - ended questions are aggregated and coded into mentoring themes that are then discussed with all mentors at the workshop. This workshop affords the mentor and opportunity to meet and understand the differing perspectives and experiences of mentoring faculty within the university and to work effectively with other mentors. Advanced mentor training: master mentors program for experienced mentors UR Mentors is an intensive program for mid- level and senior faculty designed to build a community of dedicated, expert Master Mentors who are maximally effective at enhancing the careers of their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. UR Mentors will function as resources within their respective departments, able to coach less experienced mentors and advise department chairs or training program directors who wish to develop mentoring programs. Through a series of interactive workshops and between- workshop assignments, participants can increase their confidence, knowledge and skills in mentoring. The curriculum is centered around the University of Wisconsin- Madison's mentoring curriculum and the basic elements of autonomy supportive mentoring. 47 The Wisconsin program is an 8 hour evidence based program to address a range of mentoring competencies, now being disseminated through the NIH sponsored National Research Mentoring Network. Dr. Lewis, Chair of the Mentor Development Working Group , has completed the 2 -day Train- the Trainer Workshop to be able to offer the curriculum in Rochester. We will include training in autonomy supportive mentoring, which is based on the principals of Self -Determination Theory, a meta- theory of motivation (dev eloped by University of Rochester professors) that holds that individuals are most successful when their basic needs are met for autonomy, competence and relatedness. 48 J.2.3 PROPOSED TRAINING PLAN The UR-TL1 Program will achieve three important goals and will leverage institutional core research strengths (including the UR -CTSI ) and partnerships with other entities and institutions (including the CTSA Consortium ). The primary aim is creating a clinical and translational researcher pipeline devoted to the training of primary researchers and clinician researchers, devel oping research- engaged careers, and enhancing the research capacity of staff and students throughout the enterprise. The UR-TL1 Program will be devoted to the accomplishment of the following specific aims (see Figure J3) : 1. Growing a pipeline of clinical and translational researchers able to address new and emerging scientific and methodological domains. 2. Enhancing experiential and didactic learning through new training opportunities and partnerships that emphasize team science. 3. Stimulating c reative and novel population health research that involves leveraging new tools (e.g. EHR) and methods (e.g. Data Science, Bioinformatics) through establishing a University -wide Post - Doctoral Fellowship in Population Health. These goals for translational science training have been selected because they have coalesced rapidly in science since the last renewal. The UR-TL1 Training program is guided by several principles: Creating a contemporary clinical and translational researcher pipeline requires team exposure across the educational continuum and across training components Designed overlap in content emphasizes practical priorities relating to population health Providing opportunities for trainees to engage in research activities outside of the UR - in par ticular with partner minority -serving institutions that form the RTRN network and also within industry partners - help expand trainee networks, experience scientific cultures and strengths that may differ from the UR, and identify new research priorities. Training needs to be deployed in multiple formats and modalities to meet the needs and plans of supported trainees, guided by structured yet flexible research mentors and Individual Development Plans (IDPs) Trainees must be involved in the continual improvement of best ethical practice, particularly with regard to rapidly evolving areas of emerging technologies, data science, big data, precision medicine, and research use of electronic health record s To enhance the UR researcher pipeline, we continually strengthen research education at all levels, including more formal and intensive training options available for pre -doctoral and post -doctoral trainees, and opportunities for staff, undergraduates, residents and fellows. Table J7 presents the institutional educational offerings within the eight major components of the UR -TL1 Program as they relate to the spectrum of direct and indirect UR- TL1 participants. The range of UR -TL1-related educational options are designed to cover the training and development pipeline, ranging from options that engage and provide research exposure for undergraduates (for instance, new bachelor's degrees in Public Health and in Data Science), to form al Graduate Degrees and Certificates, and to wrap- around continuing education, audit, and credit opportunities in skill- specific areas across the spectrum of the researcher pipeline. UR-TL1 Training Program Components The UR-TL1 Training Program will serve several distinct types of trainees, all of whom will be able to take advantage of a set of flexible educational options that will best support their desired career path. The various programs, educational offerings and other opportunities that fall within the eight major components of the UR - TL1 Program (Table J7, Column 1) are described in detail in the following pages and presented graphically in Figure J3. See the indicated sections for details on each category: Constituent Training Programs (s ection J.2.3.1 ); Priority Didactic Programs (Section J.2.3.2 ); Team Science Training (Section J.2.3.3 ); Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Training (Section J.2.3.4 ); Experiential Learning Opportunities (Section J.2.3.5 ); Skills Training (Section J.2.3.6 ); Research Ethics Training (Section J .4); Research Coursework and Auditing (Section J.2.3.1). Table J6 . UR-TL1 Program Summary Research Training Integrated with Medical Training Graduate Training Post-Graduate Training Other Research Experience/Placement Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD) Academic Research Track (year -out for MD students) PhD Program in Translational Biomedical Science Postdoctoral Fellowship in Population Health Multiple Experiences as Available 2 slots/year 4 slots/year 3 slots per year 1 slot/year As Feasible J.2.3.1 Constituent Training Programs The UR-TL1 Program will directly support a number of trainees (Table J6) in the three existing pre- doctoral programs (ART, MSTP and PhD -TBS) and one, newly proposed post-doctoral program (Population Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship ). Each program has its own director and its own specific requirements. Trainees from each program will benefit from the rich selection of flexible and optional components, and from a wide range of researc h experience opportunities. Constituent Program 1: Academic Research Track (ART) . The 5 -year ART program interdigitates with the UR's Double Helix Curriculum (see Section J.1.4.1) to provide medical students interested in pursuing academic medicine with a n enriched, supplemental experience in basic, clinical, educational, or translational research. This experience includes an established curriculum, with the option to pursue a degree or certificate, and a year -out mentored research experience, which is usually preceded by a summer research rotation. ART participants are eligible for a Certificate of Achievement and for potential MD degree designation of Distinction in Research. Figure J3. UR-TL1 Training Program Model and C omponents The UR-TL1 Training Program will directly support the mentored research experiences (rotation and year - out) and the following activities for four ART students per year : Coursework contributing to Certificate completion, Master's degrees, and continuing education Ethics in Research t raining through the Graduate School (in addition to ethics in the medical curriculum) ; Certification in human subjects protection through the UR Office of Human Subjects Protection; Completion of an optional (strongly encouraged) mentored researc h rotation (~8 weeks long) during the summer between years 1 and 2, to provide exposure to research and to potential research mentors; Completion of a 'year -out' to participate in a mentored research project (between years 2- 3 or 3- 4); Opportunity to collaborate with faculty and research activities in predominantly minority -serving institutions through the UR -RTRN partnership (see Section J.1.4.4) and through UR's Global Network through mentored research placement; Present ation of their research at the UR -CTSI seminar series and attendance at monthly seminars, Table J7. UR-TL1 Trainees and Educational Offerings lectures , and workshops throughout the year, consisting of mini -courses or modules describing medical research topics (e.g.: statistics, study design, conflicts of interest and bias, research communic ation, obtaining funding, and writing for publication ). Completion of a first -author manuscript describing the research and its results (in a form suitable for submission to a peer -reviewed journal ) and/or a master's thesis (for student s in a MS program) . Constituent Program 2: Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP ). The 2015 -2016 academic year marked the MSTP's 57th year in training physician- scientists and 40th consecutive year of NIH MSTP funding. The MSTP selectively recruit s and rigorously train s highly - qualified future physician -scientists across both basic and clinical disciplines, toward the advancement of patient -centered research and care. The MS TP matriculates 7 to 9 students, typically following their graduation from 4 -year undergraduate pr ograms, though as many as 1/3 have had a gap year or more where they typically did research. The MSTP typically admits one student each year from the current medical school class , including transition of ART students to MSTP . Medical Education : For the maj ority of MSTP students, the first two years are spent fulfilling the UR medical curriculum, with select modifications. In the first year, MSTP students participate in the full medical school curriculum and all programmatic events , including dinner seminars and the annual retreat . In addition, MSTP students participate in the Scientific Reasoning in Medicine course during the first two years. This course consists of a two- part journal club held one or two times each month throughout the academic year with th e purpose of engaging students in basic science and the translational implications of research, as well as exposing them to potential research mentors. A laboratory rotation prior to beginning first year is optional, but all MSTP students complete an 8 -10 week laboratory rotation between first and second year. Some programs do not require laboratory rotations and students identifying with those programs utilize other mechanisms to explore potential mentors. For example, students in Health and Population Sciences engage in reading courses arranged with specific faculty, work on a selected methodological application, or participate in a summer mathematics course to prepare them for core coursework. Second- year MSTP students complete the second year curriculum with accommodations for program requirements. After spring break and comprehensive assessment, students study full -time for Step 1 of the USMLE as they complete the Primary Care Clerkship requirements. Graduate Education: After Step 1 of the USMLE, MSTP students may complete additional research rotations over the summer prior to enrollment in graduate school courses in the fall . Students must select their Ph.D. program and a laboratory before matriculating into their graduate program of choice. Individual Ph.D. requirements vary by program, but dual credit for the first two years of medical school basic sciences minimize s graduate school course requirements. All students take the NIH -required Ethics in Research course during fall of the first year. Q ualifying exams are taken in year 2 or 3 of graduate school, and most students defend in 3 -5 years. Throughout graduate school, MSTP students continue to participate in dinner seminars, annual retreats, and other programmatic events. Students also complete 2- 4 Longitudinal Clerkships during graduate school. MSTP students return to medical school upon advisement by their Advisor y Dean and Program Director, typically following dissertation defense and receiving their Ph.D. The UR-TL1 Training Program will directly support the graduate phase of training for two MSTP trainees per year , with particular emphasis on those who enroll in one of the priority PhD programs affiliated with the UR-CTSI (namely, PhD in Translational Biomedical Sciences, Computer Science, Epidemiology, Health Services Research). Currently, UR MSTP students work toward PhD degrees in Biochemistry, Biolog y, Biomedical Engineering, Biomedical Genetics, Biophysics and Structural Biology, Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Brain and Cognitive Science, Chemistry, Epidemiology, Health Services Research, Microbiology/Immunology, Neurobiology & Anatomy, Neu roscience, Pathology, Pharmacology & Physiology, Toxicology, and Translational Biomedical Science. Constituent Program 3: PhD in Translational Biomedical Science (TBS) Program . The UR-TL1 Training Program will support three PhD -TBS enrollees per year, and will encourage Trainees to also concurrently complete one of the participating Certificate programs as part of their training. The UR-CTSI TBS program was initiated in 2008 as one of the first programs of its kind in the world. The TBS program prepares individuals for academic and clinical careers relating to the translation of basic biomedical research into clinical strategies to improve health. Students engage in a flexible c urriculum in basic, translational , and population health sciences and a dual -mentor ed (mentor team includes both a clinical and a basic science investigator) dissertation- based research project. In order to provide a trans -disciplinary approach to educatio n, mentoring, and research, the TBS program is based within the UR -CTSI itself so as to be agnostic of discipline and department. Hence, mentoring faculty are drawn from PhD granting programs in the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry and Arts , Sciences, and Engineering. Students design their proposed training plan by creating an Individual Development Plan, which details coursework (core and elective), mentor team, advisory committee, and research experience. The TBS program currently includes three training tracks: 1) Basic Research, 2) Clinical Research, and 3) \"Infection and Immunity: From Molecules to Populations\" (IIMP). The IIMP training track is funded by a new 5- year Burroughs Wellcome grant and the program is designed to combine equal training in basic science in infection and immunity with population sciences. A fourth training track in Big Data Science called \"Biomedical Data Science Translator Program\" is pending funding of an institutional T32 training grant (PIs: Topham/Dwarkadas/Strawderman). This proposed track will offer in -depth training in biomedical and lab- based science, computer (programing) science and biostatistics. Innovative elements include appointment of multi - disciplinary mentor teams (faculty from each of the three represented disciplines) and the opportunity for trainees to take bridging courses to strengthen foundational knowledge in an area of less familiarity . Regardless of formal funding for the T32 , the proposed curriculum and f aculty expertise are in place for incoming students who choose to obtain training related to big data science. For example, one of our current TBS PhD students is pursuing a dual PhD focus in TBS and Computer Science through an individualized program of study devised by the program directors (TBS and Computer Science) and Deans from the Schools of Arts & Sciences and Medicine and Dentistry. TBS Didactic Component . Each track requires participation in didactic required and elective coursework that meets the specialized need s of the Trainees designated training track and research interests. The majority of the coursework is completed in the first two years . Sample course plans currently offered are provided in the Appendix. This coursework will expand to meet the needs of the three proposed priority areas (e.g.: science that informs precision medicine, data science and big data, population health and analytics). TBS Research Component . TBS students are required to do three research rotations during the first year of study, one in the Fall and two in the Spring. These rotations introduce the student to a range of scientific paradigms and methods. Students gain experience in research, attend research seminars, practice their communication skills , and are introduced to prospective advisors for their mentored research project . Students choose a primary mentor and co- mentor at the end of the first year, and embark on a Ph.D. thesis research program. Primary mentors must be a faculty member in the School of Medicine and Dentistry Interdisciplinary Graduate Program with sufficient funds to support the student. TBS students supported by other mechanisms (UR-TL1 or other) will be encouraged to explore mentors and research programs from the UR -RTRN research partnership or global research network. Both avenues provide expanded opportunities for high- impact research. TBS Qualifying Exam . The qualifying examination occurs at the end of the fourth semester , (or with committee permission by the end of the fifth semester) and consists of a written research proposal (focused on the thesis project) and an oral examination by the student's advisory committee. The committee consists of the co -mentors and at least two additional faculty members from different disciplines relevant to translational research. The oral examination is based on the written proposal and will evaluate ability to use information to analyze research problems, offer solutions, and to propose unique directions for future research. No comprehensive examination of formal coursework is intended, however, adequacy of knowledge and appreciation are assessed. TBS Dissertation. Prior to writing or defending a thesis, all advisory committee members must agree that the student has accomplished a sufficient body of work . Following approval, each Ph.D. candidate writes their thesis and present s their research results at a public seminar , which is immediately followed by the final oral examination. A range of formats for the thesis is possible, suited to the student's needs. Once a candidate passes the oral examination, the advisory committee completes an annual evaluation form to approve completion of the thesis research, pending revision and submission of the final thesis. Constituent Program 4: Population Health Research P ostdoctoral (PHRP) Fellowship Overview and commitment to translational training in population health The newly -proposed PHRP Fellowship program will recruit individuals (Fellows) with doctoral degrees that span the translational spectrum and provide them w ith one year of postdoctoral training related to population health research . In this instance, we define population health as targeting both enrolled populations (e.g. clinical cohorts ), whole communities (e.g.: geographic and/or political entities ), and population subgroups that share common characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity).49 The goal of this program is to produce a cadre of interdisciplinary researchers, who are trained in team science and competency -based skills in order to conceptualize and execute systematic lines of research that draw on their core areas of expertise and follow the translational continuum through population health impact. In addition to customized, competency -based coursework (with an option fo r obtaining a certificate or degree) (see Section J.2.3.2 ) and a mentored research project, the program will be structured to enhance translational research across the continuum in several ways: The mentoring team will include at least one member whose research is at a different point in the translational continuum from that of the Fellow's background and from the chosen research project; The Fellow will be encouraged to select one mentor from another CTSA hub or the Rochester -RTRN partner sites working i n a related area across any level of the translational continuum; The Fellow will complete at least one 2 -week rotation in a research and/or community setting at a different translational level from that of the trainee's background. For example, a Fellow with a basic science background who plans to examine phenotypes and biomarkers for disease across diverse populations to guide population -based disease screening might opt for a rotation in a community -based research project examining health disparities. We anticipate that this structure will provide benefits for both fellows and mentors in that it will increase the engagement of both groups in team science that conceptualizes research across the translational continuum. Each Fellow will detail their customized experience in an Individual Development Plan. The PHRP Fellowship will build on the substantial collaborative and translational science resources at the University of Rochester, including: 1) analytic infrastructures through the Institute for Data S cience and the Center for Biomedical Informatics; 2) population health networking infrastructures through the Center for Community Health, the UR Population Health Interest Group (PHIG), and the Global and Territorial Health Research Network; 3) population health research and educational programs through the Department of Public Health Sciences and other departments and centers ( Section J.2.3.2 ); and 4) the strong UR mentoring and professional development infrastructures ( Section J.2.3.4 ). The UR-CTSI serve s as the hub or portal to these research and training opportunities (Table J8 ). In addition, requiring the formation of trans -disciplinary mentoring teams for each post -doctoral Trainee will not only benefit the Trainee's research experience, but also enhance translational research capacity among fellows and faculty from the UR and at other CTSA hubs. Fellowship Pathways . The PHRP Fellowship program is structured around three research tracks, which align coursework, training methods, and research experiences related to the population of interest (Table J8). Fellows will identify a pathway and potential research teams with which to work in their application, and will finalize th ese choices in month 1 of their appointment. To ensure that Fellows gain the most from a one- year research experience, they will develop their own research project from within an existing research program . 1) Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a Resource for Research. This pathways will apply methods in utilization of EHR for research involving enrolled populations (e.g.: clinical cohort) and will focus on population health endpoints. For example, F ellows might leverage UR's experience in extraction of phenotype data from the E HR and pairing with biomarkers to identify risk factors for diseases (and variations by diverse populations) , which can inform implementation of health systems to target at -risk populations . This pathway will emphasize tools for data extraction, coursework (either credit -bearing or Table J8.

These trainings are conducted in hands -on, instructor led, interactive sessions or as one- on-one instructor led trainings. 2) National, Regional, and Local Database Analytics . This pathway will apply methods in database analytics for research involving whole communities, in order to examine factors like impact of health policies on population health outcomes, and disparities in population health. The UR -CTSI Inform atics Core 3) maintains a Research Data Warehouse and provides access to many federal National Center for Health Statistics -sponsored large surveillance systems and data, in addition to a range of local, unique data systems (e.g. the Regional Perinatal Data System). 4) Population Health Behavior Change. This pathway will provide a dual focus on social, behavioral and broader environmental determinants of health at the community level, as well as multi -level interventions for health behavior change to impact population health outcomes (i.e. how understanding broader determinants of health can be translated into population level interventions and outcomes assessment). The focus will be on examining and modifying systems (e.g., behaviors of health systems, polic ymakers), community supports (knowledge, attitudes, access at the community level), as well as individuals (healthcare providers, community members) to maximize population impact and sustainability of interventions. This pathway will differ from usual clinical trials training, in that the denominator for effect analyses will be the entire target population of interest (e.g. the entire targeted geographic sector) rather than just enrolled subjects motivated to change. Didactic and hands -on learning experiences across all of the tracks will include dissemination and implementation science methodologies, adaptive randomized designs, quasi -experimental designs, and program evaluation, as well as standard epidemiological surveillance and randomized controlled t rial methodologies. Course content (credit -bearing and/or audit) includes individual courses (e.g., Social and Behavioral Medicine, Program Evaluation), certificate programs ( e.g., Public Health, Clinical Research Methods, Biomedical Data Science), and masters programs (e.g., MS -CI, MS Biomedical Data Science, MPH if transfer credits from prior training available to allow 1- year completion) . Additionally, Fellows can participate in coursework or training opportunities (online community -based participatory r esearch modules) at other institutions. Additional Training Experiences Research Rotations . In addition to their core mentored research project, Fellows can select up to three rotations of 2- 8 weeks each for exposure to multiple, complementary areas relev ant to population health. One rotation must be with a research team at a different translational level. Community rotation sites already available through other UR training programs (e.g. the UR Preventive Medicine Residency), include the Monroe County Health Department, American Cancer Society, Anthony Jordan Health Center (a federally qualified health center); and the NYS Department of Health. Sites available within the UR include the Institute for Data Science, the UR -CTSI Informatics Core, the Rochester Center for Health Informatics, the Center for Community Health, the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics, the Heart Research Follow -Up Program, the URMC Department of Quality Assurance and Clinical Practice Evaluation, University Health Service, the James P. Wilmot Cancer Institute, and various population health research teams within the Departments of Public Health Sciences, Psychiatry and Environmental Medicine, and others. The mentoring team and fellow may identify additional sites tailored to the needs of the fellow. Career Development . Fellows and their mentors will identify career development opportunities as part of the Individual Development Plan, accessing the range of professional development opportunities described in Section J.2.3. 4 this UR-TL1 proposal. Overall, Fellows will select relevant core and elective coursework (indicating pursuit of a masters or certificate program ), participate in 1 one grant review through their home department's internal review structure; participate in the UR Population Health Interest Group (PHIG); attend or complete a combination of at least 10 internal seminars, workshops, and online modules; present their research at a minimum of one local and one national scientific conference, and publish their researc h findings. Both academic and non- academic career paths will be supported, with fellows interested in non- academic careers linked to the UR -BEST program at the University of Rochester. J.2.3.2 Priority Didactic Programs UR-TL1-supported Trainees from all four constituent programs choose to complete specific Master's or Certificate program as part of their training. These programs offer enhanced, stackable credentials in specific priority areas for the UR-TL1 (science supporting precision medicine, data sci ence and big data, and population health and analytics). Depending on Trainee needs, courses may be available to take independently (not as part of a Master's, PhD, or Certificate program), and potentially audited. For selected Trainees , these courses may form a useful component of their IDP and include the range of courses offered in the priority programs of this UR -TL1, shown in the Appendix . Priority Master's Programs. The Master's of Public Health , MS Data Science, MS Clinical Investigation, and the proposed MS Biomedical Data Science all directly address priority areas of this UR-TL1 Training Program . Where feasible within their existing training programs, Trainees will be encouraged to consider concurrently completing one of these specialized Master's programs. The foundational MPH program and MS Clinical Investigation are based in the Department of Public Health Sciences and provide general training in public health in a research -oriented degree. The new MS Data Science is based in the Department of Computer Science and provides in- depth training in biostatistics and computer science, with a Biomedical Track for those interested. The proposed MS Biomedical Data Science will provide a more concentr ated focus in clinical, translational, and public health applications of data science and is an extension of the Certificate of Advanced Study in Biomedical Data Science. Priority Certificate Programs . Graduate Certificates of Advanced Study are a post-Baccalaureate course of academic study (12 -15 credits) designed for students and practitioners who seek to enhance their professional development . Those available to Trainees include, Public Health, Biomedical Data Science, Regulatory Science ( pending State Approval ), Analytic Epidemiology, Clinical Research Methods, Trial based Research, and Health Services Research. The Certificates are designed to be flexible, focused, and stackable, complementing other educational and experiential credentials. Up to 10 cr edits can be applied to a subsequent Master's degree if desired (see Certificate details in the Appendix) . J.2.3.3 Team Science Training Course in Team Science . Trainees will enroll in Research in Team Science Seminar (PM403) , a one credit introduction to the concepts, practices, and challenges of Team Science and collaborative research environments. Students will be exposed both to team science initiatives and the science of team science as presented through practical examples from local research teams and researchers, focusing upon the practical implications of a team science approach to biomedical research requiring large- scale data analysis. Team Science experience. The UR-TL1 Training Program , including its thematic focus priorities (science supporting precision medicine, data science and big data, population health and analytics) and its component training opportunities (ART, MSTP, TBS -PhD, PHRP Fellowship ) are inherently team science oriented and multidisciplinary. More than 60% of all UR- TL1 faculty h ave appointments in more than one Department or Center, demonstrating the primacy and value placed upon cross -disciplinary and team science work in Rochester. Further, some of the core topics of research at the University (optics, immunology and infection, data science, public and global health, neuroscience) are inherently multidisciplinary, team science- oriented fields. Data science practicum courses . Any Trainee can enroll in a 1-credit Data Science practicum (PM 400). The purpose of the practicum is to provide an opportunity to participate in a biomedical research topic involving data science via a lab, research group, or center at the UR or at one of its partners. The experience integrates practical, field -based methods and will include participants in a team science environment. Students can expect to apply their classroom learning during the practicum experience, which is organized and offered in advance by interested researchers. Cross -training. Team Science requires work with other disciplines, prof essionals, and with researchers using different methods. Each component program involves co- training and cross -training across a range of disciplines, including medical and non- medical students, nurses, public health professionals, basic scientists, inform aticists, and social scientists. Further, many of the offered skill-building and seminar opportunities involve multiple disciplines and levels of participants, from undergraduate to senior faculty, again reinforcing the value and required skills to enable, team science and cross -professional communication. J.2.3.4 Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Training Use of the Individual Development Plan In use since our first CTSA award in 2006, the UR -TL1 Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a simple spreadsheet format that includes: short and long- term goals in the key domains for translational researchers, the research skills and knowledge needed to reach those goals, and timeline and means of verification. The IDP is an important tool that will be used to support all Trainees across the component programs. At the start of each academic year, newly -appointed mentors and Trainees participate in an orientation meeting, which includes discussion of the IDP as a tool to: 1) center the learning process on the prot\u00e9g\u00e9; 2) promote prot\u00e9g\u00e9 autonomy and motivation to learn; 3) encourage reflective practice for both the mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9; and 4) enhance mentor -prot\u00e9g\u00e9 communication. Each Trainee is tasked with creat ing an IDP with assistance from his or her co -mentors after the orientation. A member of the Mentor Development Working Group (see Section J.2.3.4 ) will then meet with each Trainee individually to discuss his or her IDP and offer any additional support (seminars, workshops, programs, names of additional faculty with relevant expertise) needed in the fall of each academic year. The Mentor Development Working Group follows up over the course of the year with each mentor (separately) and also the mentor -prot\u00e9g \u00e9 dyad (together). This process helps assure that the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's plans are updated as needed and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s remain on track in accomplishing their goals. Mentor Training Opportunities The UR Mentor Curriculum, required for all new or early -stage program faculty, and the Master Mentors course for experienced mentors, are described S ection J.2.2 .2. J.2.3.5 Experiential Training Opportunities In addition to many placement opportunities internally at the University of Rochester, several unique opport unities provide students with expanded research placement options, in part through coordination with other training awards to the institution and through collaboration with the R TRN. RTRN (see Section J.1.4.4) . Potential collaboration within any of the RTRN's 18 institutions offers Trainees a unique opportunity to engage with diverse researchers in predominantly minority -serving institutions. Collaborations with RTRN investigators will help our Trainees better understand underserved communities' health r esearch needs (crossing the thematic spectrum of this application, from science supporting precision medicine, data science, and population health), build network connections between Trainees and associated Mentors, colleagues, and classmates with the RTRN institution(s) , and also provide RTRN institutions a substantive connection within the CTSA Consortium . Extended networking could lead to additional future opportunities including research collaboration, minority supplements to existing research, and Trainee recruitment and placement. Current partnerships exist on funded grants (e.g., the CDC's Global and Territorial Health Research Network) and through historical relationships (e.g. Dr. Lewis' relationship with Xavier University, and Dr. Dye's relationshi ps with the University of Hawaii and the University of Puerto Rico). UR-BEST . The new UR Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (UR -BEST; NIH 1DP7OD020315) program seeks to address a major unmet need of biomedical research trainees, by preparing them for more diverse careers. This program will be made available to all UR- TL1 Trainees (see letters from Dr. Dewhurst and Dr. Baas ): UR-BEST Training Pathways. UR- BEST Training Pathways provide access to aligned educational programs and experiential learning opportunities, such as short -term internships and shadowing experiences. To maximize flexibility, Trainees may select any course or experience from any pathway - as best meets their own individual learning objectives and goals. There are currently 3 UR -BEST pathways: (1) Industry, Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship, (2) Regulatory Affairs, Compliance and Review, and (3) Science and Technology Policy. Experiential Learning Opportunities in Diverse Career Pathways. The UR -BEST internship and externship programs will be made available to UR-TL1 Trainees . These include experiential learning opportunities of 1- 3 months' duration with a wide range of external partners (including biotech companies, foundations, government offices, investment companies, and more) as well as hands -on learning experiences within units or departments at the University that are not traditionally available to students (e.g., the UR's technolog y transfer office, the Stem Cell cGMP Facility, the Center for Human Experimental Therapeutics, Excell Partners, and others).

Trainees will benefit from additional program specific training elements, targeted to their needs, unique opportunities not otherwise available, and shared scientific experiences that include mentoring opportunities, and academic -industry partnering. Goals of these additional training elements are to: (1) enrich training , (2) create awareness of diverse research career options, and (3) build community through shared learning experiences. Seminar series: Several UR Departments and Centers offer regular, open seminar series of potential interest to Trainees. These include the Depart ment of Computer Science, Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, as well as a Biomedical Informatics Seminar and the UR -CTSI seminar series . The CTSI seminar series provides weekly seminars related to rotating topics (each semester is devoted to a new topic, see Table J9) like \"Population Health\" and \"Advancing Regulatory Science: Research, Training and Partnerships.\" Trainees in the TBS component program are required to attend the UR-CTSI Seminar . Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC) : The CIRC hosts a number of annual and seasonal events focused on high performance computing with the aim of increasing access an d awareness of the infrastructure. Many of these events are held in conjunction with the Health Sciences Center for Computational Innovation (HSCCI ), home to the URMC High Performance Computing infrastructure. Some of the events are: CIRC Symposia : Faculty, staff, and student researchers convene to learn about research projects utilizing the CIRC/ HSCCI resources, meet potential collaborators, and learn about new technologies and trends in research computing. CIRC Poster Session: At this annual ev ent, attendees discover the wide range of research at the UR that is enabled by computation. This event provides an informal venue to share computational and data analytics techniques and methodologies with colleagues from a wide variety of disciplines. CIRC Summer School : Every July, CIRC hosts a six- week training session on various operating systems, programming languages, computational programs and libraries, and data analytics tools for the research community. Extra emphasis is placed on using the vario us languages, libraries, etc. specifically on the 190 petaflop BlueHive Linux cluster and the 210 petaflop BlueGene/Q. CIRC Winter Boot Camp : A multi- week winter program to help students, postdocs, research staff, and faculty learn new programming languages and sharpen their computing and data analytics skills. Institute for Data Science: IDS events include a Colloquium series (faculty and guests speakers); Industrial Affiliates days, which will include talks and interviews by visiting scientists working i n industry; Summer schools on topics in data science; and Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences, which will include opportunities for graduate students in the training program to mentor undergraduate projects. In addition, a new interdisciplinary, cros s-campus NSF National Research Training award in Computer Science and Cognitive Science awarded to IDS Director Dr. Kautz include Immersive Professional Encounters that will be open to students across the university. Miner Library's Bioinformatics Consult ation and Education Service. This service offers an extensive set of guided workshops and self -study modules addressing a range of bioinformatics skills, including the Bioinformatics Basics Workshop, Data for pattern identification tools, Data for pathway identification tools, the Integrated View of the Genome Workshop, and the Cancer at the Systems Level Workshop. EHR Research Tools Training (i2b2, REDCap, Epic). The UR-CTSI and its partners in medical informatics provide training in tools for accessing EHR information from the institution's Epic installation. i2b2 (Integrating Biology and the Bedside) is an open- source software system that allows users to query clinical data to estimate the size of clinical cohorts available for specific studies, allows for the creation of \"data marts\" to support the requirements of particular studies, and supports an efficient mechanism to transfer clinical data directly to REDCap. The UR- CTSI offers training in basic and advanced i2b2 use, in addition to consultation s ervices to researchers accessing EHR via i2b2. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web- based application for building and managing online surveys and databases. Using REDCap's streamlined process for rapidly developing projects, resear chers may create and design projects using both surveys and databases (or a mixture of the two). UR -CTSI offers basic and advanced REDCap training. Epic is the clinical EHR system used at UR. For non- clinician researchers, it may be useful to complete Epic training to better understand its implementation and how to access data via i2b2 and REDCap . The course focuses on chart review, documentation and orders, and overview of all Epic functionality. Resources Available Through The Center For Professional Development (CPD): The UR's CPD seeks to better prepare students for more diverse career options. The CPD's programs are focused on: Careers: Assists Trainees identify relevant job opportunities, internships, and outreach and educational opportunities; col laborates with the Graduate Student Society to better identify trainee needs; educates mentors about non- academic career options for their mentees; provides assistance with IDPs. Grants: Provides assistance with indentifying active funding opportunities (emphasis on fellowships). Writing : Provides both remedial and advanced assistance with diverse writing projects (fellowships and grants, abstracts, papers, CVs and cover letters); resource for designing scientific posters; organizes workshops to improve t rainee writing skills. Graduate Women in Science (GWIS) : The GWIS program mentors women throughout their graduate and post -doctoral careers through a monthly meeting and one -on-one interactions, with the goal of improving the representation of women in sci ence. Meetings/Workshops : Active participation in scientific meetings and workshops is essential for predoctoral training. To this end, trainees are expected to present their work at least once a year at local, national, or when fiscally possible, international meetings. All Trainees are encouraged to present their work at the annual meeting of the Association for Clinical and Translational Science, which organizes an extensive program for pre- doctoral trainees. Survival Skil ls and Enrichment Presentations : A yearlong series of Survival Skills and Enrichment Seminars is provided through the office of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs. These cover topics ranging from developing scientific communication skills, writing grants and fellowships, and professionalism , to financial planning and buying a house. Training in Cutting -Edge Scientific Methods : The URMC Shared Resource Laboratories provides all students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to train on its cutting- edge scientific instrumentation, which includes : confocal and conventional microscopy; e lectron microscopy (both scanning and transmission); flow cytometry (including analytical, sorting, imaging and mass cytometry); m ultiphoton imaging (including intravital microscopy); pathway screening (including high- throughput cell screening with chemical and siRNA libraries); p roteomics (including mass spectrometric analysis of proteins, peptides and small molecules); and genomics (including high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing, pathway analysis and bioinformatics) . Teaching Experience and Instruction in Teaching: Trainees interested in teaching may take the Graduate Experience in Science Education course, which provides an overview of some of the major theories, principles and concepts of science education, and also provides instructional and lesson- planning skills. J.2.4 UR-TL1 Training Program Evaluation Plan The UR-TL1 Program evaluation includes: 1) Program Development and Implementation; 2) T rainee Experience and 3) Career Development (trainees, mentors). The evaluation will be overseen by the UR- CTSI Evaluation Working Group (EWG ; described in the Evaluation and C ontinuous Improvement function of the Administrative Core). Dr. Ann Dozier, chair of the EWG and UR- CTSI Evaluation Lead, will coordinate evaluation of the UR- TL1 Program and will serve on its Internal Advisory Committee. The EWG will coordinate its activities with Dr. Lewis (chair of the MDWG ). The EWG will oversee data collection of process and outcome measures that reflect program implementation, trainee/mentor feedback (via periodic online surveys), assessment of competencies,50 exit interviews and document review (e.g. IDPs, applications, progress reports). Program graduates will be surveyed annually utilizing 15- year-old mechanism of contact, and in addition to items noted in the table, will include data elements described in the recent AAMC report.51 Monitoring and evaluation reports, aggregated across foundational programs will be provided t o the UR- TL1 Steering Committee semi -annually. Program Development and Implementation . We will assess track feedback about planned and actual training activities (e.g. courses, skill training; team science experiences) , utilization (through IDP/progress reports), satisfaction (activity/experience specific survey; course evaluation) and the overall experience (exit interview with EWG member). Particular attention will be paid to individual and aggregate data related to Trainee's 1) actual activities compared to the goals of the training area; 2) participation in team science training; and 3) utilization of external experiences (availability of options, barriers/ facilitators, fit of experience to competency/ training program goals; use of RTRN institutions) . The new PHRP Fellowship will also be evaluated using individual and aggregate data (applicants, experiences/course selected, Fellow productivity). Trainee Experience . In addition to IDP development, the mentor and T rainee will identify the competencies to focus on during their training (including the CTSA's Clinical Translational Research and special interest competencies). Identified competencies will be converted into Individualized Career Pathway Competencies (ICPC) , which will be built into an online ICPC Assessment Tool. This innovative approach is modeled after evaluation procedures being used for the Milestone Project by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education to evaluate Graduate Medical Trainee performance (Accreditation Council for Graduat e Medical Education (ACGME). Completing the ICPC Assessment Tool, trainees and mentors indicate level of Table J 10. UR-TL1 Evaluation Plan Short Term Outcomes Intermediate Outcomes Long Term Outcomes UR-TL1 Program Diverse applicant pool and program trainees (URG, gender, discipline) Trainees completing program represent proposed diversity (URG, gender, discipline); Trainees mentors represent diverse disciplines Extent of trainee graduates participating in research teams in areas of precision medicine, data science/ big data, population health represent proposed diversity (URG, gender, discipline) Measure: Track applicant and trainee profile data, mentor profile, constituent program participation/completion (exit interview) and longitudinal research related participation/involvement (annual trainee status update) Specific Aim 1.

Assessment of cumulative exposure to teams across eac h trainee (experience surveys; progress reports); Publications/products related to \"engaged followership \": Specific Aim 3. Establish Population Health post -doc Trainee activities/work completed aligns with PH post -doc goals PH post -doc is a transportable program for peer institutions/ other programs Measure : Program established, applicant interest; longitudinal research involvement Trainees Implement and monitor Individualized Career Pathway Competencies within the trainee's Individualized Development Plan Refine team science competencies Increase in trainee competency in selected research and team science competencies Scholarly productivity as appropriate to training program (i.e. paper, presentation) Trainee: Ongoing participation in or involvement with research (e.g. teams, publications) Trainee: Population health is part of ongoing research work/involvement including team participation, scholarly productivity, funding Measure: IDP development/modification/completion; progress on competencies (novice toward expert) asses through trainee self-report and mentor assessment (using online individualized tool); Exit interview ; longitudinal research related involvement (team participation faculty appointment, publications) Enrollment in/completion of training in specified trai ning area Increase in awareness/positive attitudes/intention to engage in research in selected training area Trainee: Participation or involvement in research related to precision medicine, data science, population health or other training area MSTP Traine e: Established program of research in precision medicine, data science, population health or other area Measure: Trainee profile; annual survey of attitude intentions; Exit interview; longitudinal tracking (annual trainee status update) Mentor Pool of trained mentors available across training areas Positive trainee experience with mentor; Disciplinary diversity of mentor teams Increase in number of UR (master) Mentors Measure: Mentor pool profile for each training area; completion of mentor training; annual mentor self -assessment of competence; trainee feedback of mentoring experience (through Mentor Development Working Group and Exit Interview) proficiency for each competency -included, assigning a value between Level 1 (novice - incoming trainee) to Level 5 (expert - aspirational goals). This innovation provides an assessment at baseline and ongoing every 4 months (for trainees in year -long programs) and every 6 months (for trainees multi -year programs ). Changes in Trainees views about team science and their selected training area represent ano ther important outcome to assess during the program (via trainee survey) and through their longer term research related work (e.g. research team involvement/participation; scholarly productivity in training area) (via annual status updates). Career Development. Annual updates will provide for longitudinal assessment of UR- TL1 graduates. Using historical comparisons we will demonstrate the extent to which former T rainees are pursuing our three training (or other) areas differ from prior trainees in te rms of type of research, involvement with research teams, scholarly productivity and research related productivity measures (publications, grants). Evaluation of the Competency Assessment Process. The integration of competencies in the IDP process via dev elopment of the IDP and ongoing assessment of progress based on these identified competencies is an innovative approach to improve individual trainee and overall UR- TL1 Program performance in supporting career development needs. Using a quasi -experimental design including historical comparisons (previous Trainees ) we will determine whether the incorporation of competency assessment resulted in different career outcomes. The proc ess evaluation will assess of the utility of this approach. The ICPC- based assessment, trainees and mentors will answer questions about the utility of the competency process to their assessment of progress. Data will be aggregated across Trainees and mento rs and the EWG will provide the UR -TL1 Steering Committee with feedback and recommendations for modifications . The outcome evaluation will compare career outcomes such as publications and type of research involvement (see Table J10 ) between pre-2016 trainees and current trainees (2016 and going forward). J.2.5 Trainee Candidates Recruitment activities for the UR -TL1 Program will be conducted in partnership with the UR Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and the National Center for Deaf Health Resea rch through UR's CDC Prevention Research Center to ensure continued engagement of a diverse sample of trainees to our UR- TL1 Program . Further, we will leverage our partnerships with other CTSA hubs, the RTRN minority -serving institutions, and our CDC Globa l and Territorial Health Research Network partners to recruit potential trainees with specialized research interests (in science informing precision medicine, data science/ big data, and population health) and to recruit a diverse trainee base. J.2.5 .1. Predoctoral Programs We will conduct pro -active outreach efforts to recruit trainees to this program. First, we will advertise the UR- TL1 Training Program widely - on UR websites (including that of the Office for Graduate Education & Postdoctoral Affairs - OGEPA), through emails to current trainees, by discussion at student interview weekends, by inclusion in on- boarding events for new trainees, and through presentations to targeted trainee groups. Second, we will work closely with \"grassroots\" trainee organizations (i.e., the URMC Graduate Student Society and Postdoctoral Association). Third, the UR-TL1 Program leadership will attend department and center faculty meetings and retreats throughout the URMC, to build support. Fourth, the program will be presented to all trainees participating in UR \"pipeline\" programs (including the summer undergraduate research program, the R25 BRIDGES program with RIT/NTID, and the PREP program for post -bacc alaureate trainees). To fill the 4 ART (year -out), 2 MSTP (MD/PhD), and 3 PhD -TBS slots, we will solicit four+ applicants / slot. J.2.5 .2. Postdoctoral Program The UR-TL1 fellowship program will recruit 1 trainee/year. Candidates will include those not typically trained in population health research (e.g., MDs post residenc y; doctoral level nurses; basic science PhDs), as well as those trained in public health sciences, social and behavioral medicine, or related fields who want to expand their focus to population health. Both targeted and national recruitment strategies will be used. Targeted recruitment will occur through electronic and posted announcements to: 1) UR departments and schools representing the full translational continuum, to include all departments listed in the mentor table for the full UR-TL1 Program ; 2) UR internal programs (TBS doctoral progra m, MSTP graduates; 3) other CTSA hubs; 4) the UNYTE Translational Research Network, consisting of 18 upstate New York universities, colleges, and health systems currently collaborating on translational science projects ; and 5) passive recruitment through position posting on the UR -CTSI website. National recruitment will be conducted throug h professional society listserv s and electronic job boards, postings at regional and national meetings, and emails from core mentoring faculty across the translational spectrum to universities and residency programs nationally. J.3 RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PLAN TO INCREASE DIVERSITY The University of Rochester, and this UR- TL1 team, has enacted an innovative set of partnerships to recruit a diverse trainee base, reflected in Table J11. UR -CTSI and the UR -TL1 has prioritized recruitment and training of a diverse workforce in this renewal, reflected in new strategic approaches. Overall, the ethnic background of UR-TL1 trainees to date reflects the same ethnic distribution of trainees enrolled in graduate programs throughout the USA52. Additionally, UR -TL1's female gender distribution reflects a larger proportion than nationally (48.3% v. 43.0%, respectively)52. In this context, UR President Joel Seligman has str engthened diversity initiatives across the University , initiated an annual Diversity Conference, and provided funds to support recruitment of a more diverse faculty and student body. Diversity recruitment efforts follow. J.3.1 On-campus P ipeline Programs for Persons from Groups Underrepresented in Biomedical Research The UR-TL1 Training Program will be directly marketed to trainees in all of the following pipeline programs Undergraduate summer research program . The UR SMD funds a major summer undergraduate biomedical research program from which 20- 25% are from minorit y populations. UR undergraduates . Many undergraduates in public health, data science, and the biological sciences are involved with research activity, with 15- 20% of these students from minority groups. Masters students who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing: NI H Bridges program. UR has partnered with the Rochester Institute of Technology/National Technical Institute for the Deaf (RIT/NTID) to form the \"Rochester Bridges to the Doctorate for D/HH Students\" program. This R25 award is the nation's first educational program specifically tailored to the preparation of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) master's degree students for Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences. Post -baccalaureate minority trainees: NIH PREP program . The UR's NIH- funded Post -Baccalaureate Research and Education Program (PREP) was competitively renewed recently for a 4th cycle. PREP prepares students from underrepresented groups for matriculation into Ph.D. programs in biomedical research. About half of all past PREP graduates (n=80) have entered the Ph.D. programs at the UR . J.3.2 Outreach Approaches t o Persons from Groups Underrepresented i n Biomedical Research Information on the UR-TL1 Program program will be included in all marketing and outreach efforts listed below Partnership with RTRN. URMC has an existing partnership with RTRN, which represents many institutions that predominantly serve minority populations. We will work with RTRN where feasible to both recruit trainees and to place trainees within research opportunities. Annual visits to targeted minority -serving institutions : UR faculty regularly visit minority -serving institutions, and UR has also developed ties with RIT/NTID and other minority -serving programs in Western New York. A significant number of our current Ph.D. trai nees came to UR because of these efforts. Attendance and outreach at national diversity conferences: UR faculty members (including Vice Provost Lewis, Dr. O'Banion, and Dean Lord) and trainees attend major national diversity conferences - Annual Biomedical Research Careers for Minority Scientists and Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science meetings (for instance), to conduct outreach and recruitment. Participation in national diversity initiatives/networks. The UR is part of the National GEM Consortium, which provides graduate fellowships for underrepresented minorities, and allows us to learn about and recruit minority students. UR also participates in the Graduate Visitation Program, in which minority students visit the campus and meet representatives of UR programs. Targeted mailing list: Dean Lord's office has developed a targeted mailing list that includes: NSF BIO REU Site Directors, MARC program directors, and department chairs at minority -serving institutions. Trainees with disabilities. Our partnership with Deaf and Hard of Hearing populations will provide a unique opportunity for recruitment. With the CDC -funded National Center for Deaf Health Research located at UR (the only center of this kind in the US), this repres ents a unique opportunit y. Table J11.Ethnic Background of UR-TL1 Trainees To Date Ethnicity # % Asian 13 14.9 Black 8 9.2 Hispanic 3 3.4 Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander 1 1.1 White 62 71.3 Total 87 100.0 J.3.3 Support and Retention Efforts to Persons from Groups Underrepresented in Biomedical Research UR and the UR- CTSI emphasize retention of students in their programs, particularly students from underrepresented backgrounds. Once matriculated, every effort is made to retain students in the program. This is accomplished by close, personal attention to the progress of students , in particular through trainee monitoring by the progr am leads (ART, MSTP, PhD -TBS, PHPF ) and by the TL1 Trainee Evaluation Committee. The TL1 will provide both personalized and group retention strategies for its trainees through: Referring to existing and developing new \"Bridging\" courses for those entering highly interdisciplinary fields, s uch as data science (e.g. summer Boot Camp courses offered by the UR-CTSI, CIRC, and IDS in programming and informatics) Program directors meet regularly with new students in the program to asses needs, match students with rotation mentors with compat ible learning/ teaching styles, liaise with t utors, facilitate access to other University services Referral to and inclusion of Graduate Students of Color , which is a UR student affinity group open to all graduate students . GSOC seeks to grow the diversity of academic pipeline and holds various networking and professional development events to that end. Student National Medical Association: UR's chapter of this 135 yr. old organization is dedicated to increasing divers ity in the physician population through community service, mentoring and mutual support UR's Bridges to the Doctorate is one of the only programs in the country that serves Deaf and Hard of Hearing students. For students with disabilities that may affect learning, or with other health needs, full access is provided to the University Health Service and students can receive up to 10 mental health counseling visits free of charge. The Senior Associate Dean of Graduate Education works with each student to ensure that needed help is available. The UR is committed to providing equal educational and employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations, i ncluding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1991 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. To ensure equality of access for students with disabilities, UR provides reasonable accommodations, including modifications to courses, programs, services, activities or facilities, and auxiliary aids (including assigned ASL interpreters for deaf trainees). Director of Diversity and Inclusion : To assure and organize a coordinated and targeted approach to development of a diverse scientific workforc e, we have appointed Dr. John Cullen as the Director of Diversity and Inclusion to serve as the champion for research diversity and inclusion efforts. Dr. Cullen is responsible for: 1) coordinating communication around diversity and inclusion efforts and s upporting recruitment and retention of diverse students, faculty, and staff; 2) overseeing development of educational curricula related to scientific issues of diversity; 3) overseeing development of web- based resources focused on diversity in research, local and national training programs, and funding opportunities; 4) working with the UR Office for Faculty Development and Diversity on the university's annual research diversity conference with a focus on UR-CTSI resources, research, and outreach to student s and trainees from diverse backgrounds; and 5) expanding UR- CTSI processes for tracking program graduates to improve engagement with and tracking of graduates of UR pipeline programs for underrepresented students. Partnership with RTRN . The UR-CTSI's partnership with RTRN and specifically with RCMI institutions (e.g. Xavier University, U Puerto Rico, U Hawaii) provides opportunity for trainees to engage in meaningful disparities -related applications of their work, and to collaborate with student s and faculty from predominantly minority -serving institutions. Summary In summary, in this application the UR -CTSI builds upon its prior experience with TL1 training and its component programs, leveraging the University's rich and creative resources toward developing, inspiring, and sustaining a vibrant, diverse, and innovative pipeline of biomedical researchers, trained specifically to address the interdisciplinary and rapidly -emerging scientific areas driving biomedical research in the future. The clinical research landscape at Rochester is unique, productive, and has yielded groundbreaking discoveries. With decades of innovative research training and with deep involvement in the CTSA movement since its inception, our TL1 trainees are expected to contribute directly, and through networked participation, with the spectrum of clinical research, throughout the wide range of partner institutions in the CTSA Consortium and beyond. J.4 TRAINING IN THE RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH (RCR) FOR PRE - AND POSTDOCTORAL TRAINEES All students and basic and clinical research trainees at the University of Rochester, including those supported by the CTSA Training ( UR-TL1) award, receive multi -faceted training in the responsible conduct in research and are expected to exhibit integrity in the practice of scientific investigation. The University of Rochester maintains a University Commitment to Ethical Research and is proud to be fully accredited by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection (AAHRP). In keeping with these standards and in recognition of the broader concepts of responsible conduct and scientific integrity, our scholars are educated through formal and informal instruction and application of established ethical principles and professional norms in the performance of activities in conducting clinical and translational research. These are outlined below. Required Course: Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research (lecture and small group exercises) All research scholars and trai nees at the University of Rochester are required to complete and pass the course, Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research (IND501/503). This includes our pre- doctoral and postdoctoral training grant recipients, master -level students, and K -award reci pients (typical class size is 200- 250 individuals). The two courses integrate both basic and clinical research trainees and scholars and are offered annually in the fall semester. The course is co- directed by Robert Dirksen, PhD, (basic science component) and Carl D'Angio, MD (integration of basic and clinical research) in support of ongoing clinical and translational research efforts. The one- credit course provides greater than 16 hours of face- to-face contact time in both lecture and small -group discussion formats over a 2 -month time period. Attendance is mandatory and carefully monitored for lecture and small group sessions by an individual sign -in sheet, together with participant photo -identification. Those participants who arrive >10 minutes late to a l ecture are required to write a 1-2 page report on the lecture topic. The eight, one- hour group lectures cover the following core content: 1) Introduction to Research Ethics (e.g.: conflict of interest), 2) policies governing human subject research and ani mal subjects in research, 3) responsible authorship and publication, 4) data sharing and ownership, 5) plagiarism/scientific misconduct, 6) team -science/mentor -prot\u00e9g\u00e9 approaches, 7) contemporary issues (e.g., stem cell research), and 8) Mentor - student rel ationship. These group lectures are provided by institutional leaders and successful researchers (Robert Dirksen, PhD, Chair , Department of Pharmacology and Physiology , Carl D'Angio MD, Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Stephen Dewhurst, PhD, Vice Dean for Research and Associate Vice President for Health Sciences Research, Edith Lord, PhD, Senior Associate Dean for Graduate Education, Mark Taubman, MD, PhD, Dean, School of Medicine and Dentistry, James Palis, MD, PhD, Professor of Pediatrics, Ed Puzas, PhD, Professor of Orthopaedics , and Jeffrey Wyatt, DVM, Professor and Director of Laboratory Animal Medicine). Immediately following the 60- minute lecture, the class divides into small groups of 8 -10 students with a faculty facilitator who engages the students in open discussions of case studies that are designed to emphasize real - life examples of the topics discus sed in the preceding lecture. The 60- minute small group sessions are led by 20-25 mid- to-senior level faculty who are recruited and managed by the UR -CTSI Mentor Development Working Group. Our course faculty have extensive experience in the integrity and ethical conduct of basic, clinical and translational research to provide a breadth of discussion and experience. This participation also serves as ongoing responsible conduct instruction for the small group facilitators. Additionally, we actively recruit past fellowship trainees and career development award recipients to act as small group facilitators to emphasize the lifelong learning and self -awareness needed for continuous and enlightened responsible conduct. Continuing Education in the Responsible Conduct of Research at URMC Continuing education in Responsible Conduct of Research at URMC is achieved through a combination of special invited lectures, online courses, skill -building workshops, monthly seminar series, and recruitment to participate as a small group facilitator for the IND501/506 Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research courses. A website highlighting these RCR continuing education activities is maintained by the Office of graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs: http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/education/graduate/professional - development/research- ethics/continuing -ed.cfm. All graduate students, postdoctoral appointees, clinical fellow and research faculty at the University of Rochester Medical Center involved in research are required to participate in continued RCR training. Several RCR continuing education activities are provided to accomplish this requirement. First, all trainees are required to attend the annual Bioethics Lecture held at the medical center each spring. This lecture series, held every year since 2011, highlights a different topic in research ethics and professional integrity each year. Invited speakers include leaders and experts on bioethics topics both within the medical and throughout the country. An open social reception following the lecture is provided to allow trainees to meet and interact with the speaker following the lecture. The lecture is also streamed to the internet so that trainees unable to attend can view the lecture in real -time. When approved by the speaker, the recorded lecture is made available on our website for trainees that miss the lecture. The Fifth Annual Bioethics Lecture was given by Dr. Margie Shaw on May 11, 2015, which involved a discussion of ethical issues around decisions leading to the early release of promising investigational drugs in clinical trials. As a second mechanism for continued RCR training, individuals that have completed the Ethics and Professional Integrity in Research course (or comparable training) are encouraged to parti cipate as a facilitator in the course as part of their ongoing professional development and training in the responsible conduct in research. Finally, online ethics courses (e.g. CITI Program Human Subjects Protection and Responsible Conduct of Research courses), skill -building workshops, and the Rochester Clinical and Translational and Medical Humanities and Bioethics seminar series are also offered to trainees to further their ongoing RCR training. Required Training for Trainees performing research involvi ng human subjects All trainees performing human subjects research are required to complete an online self -study program. The University has selected an on- line program called the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI Program). A collaborati ve group of universities (including the University of Rochester) and organizations created the CITI Program to provide a comprehensive selection of educational on- line modules that satisfy institutional instructional mandates in the Protection of Human Res earch Subjects or on the ethical principles of research outlined in the Belmont Report and other research related issues. Initial instruction takes about 6 -7 hours. Refresher courses are required every 3 years and take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to compl ete. Trainees need to achieve a score of at least 85% to successfully establish and renew their certification. Required Training for Trainees performing research involving animals Similar to requirements for human subjects research, all trainees working wi th live vertebrate animals undergo training as part of the institutional animal welfare training program administered by the institutional IACUC, known as the University Committee on Animal Resources (UCAR). This program stipulates training in animal care and handling that is tailored to specific experimental requirements and vertebrate species. Required instructional components for all trainees include animal resource orientation (1.5hr classroom instruction), rodent colony management training, microisolat or technology training, rodent euthanasia instruction, and facility tours. UCAR adopted the CITI online program for basic, species -specific, and surgery training, including topics like aseptic surgery, reducing pain and distress in laboratory mice and rats , and species -specific training for cats, dogs, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamster, mice, non -human primates, rabbits, rats, and swine. Additional training materials (instruction and examination) for research involving ferrets, chickens, and non- human primates are available directly from the UCAR Office. Sponsored- Seminars, Workshops, and Coursework Instruction on responsible conduct of research is also available in Sponsored- Seminars, Workshops, and coursework. These are all open to trainees, scholars, mentors and other faculty at the University. Examples are included below: 1. Monthly Seminar Series: Achieving High Quality Clinical and Translational Research. A monthly seminar entitled, \" Achieving High Quality Clinical and Translational Research\" is integrated within the University -wide CTSI Seminar Series, which is held September through June on the second Tuesday of each month. The integration of these lectures emphasizes the high priority placed on providing continuous and ongoing ethical instruction to the University community of clinical and translational researchers. The objectives of the embedded seminar are to educate clinical and translational researchers, clinical research coordinators, and support staff in the methods of conducting studies in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) standards and ways to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research. Given the growing importance of individual and institutional conflicts of interest (COI) , we will initiate at least 2 lectures per year that cover relevant topics in COI, including national trends, Physician Payment Sunshine Act and local implications, effects of COI bias on research results, and updates on local policies and requirements. 2. Workshops include the monthly series entitled Academic Development Workshops , which address various career development topics (e.g.: team -science, interdisciplinary research, diversity, cultural sensitivity, and promotion), including those related to responsible conduct of research. 3. Classroom and Online Coursework The individual courses PM 419: Recruitment and Retention of Research Subjects, PM 494: Community -Based Participatory Research, and the online courses in Research Project Administration and Clinical Research Study Finances Traini ng are available to all scholars (and required for some training groups) and have components specifically addressing diversity, interdisciplinary research, and compliance with ethical standards and regulations. Many courses are based on University document s and policies regarding the ethical conduct of research. For example, the Clinical Research Study Finances Training course was developed from the content of the University of Rochester Clinical Research Standard Operating Procedures Regarding Financial Ov ersight and Billing Compliance Individualized Mentoring The UR-CTSI places a high value on individualized mentoring and role modeling standards of behavior for its trainees and scholars. To assist in this process, the Mentor Development Working Group prov ides support and instruction (via the Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Curriculum) to faculty in mentor roles and manages a pool of potential mentors based on\" 1) prior track record, 2) attention to diversity, and 3) funding experience. Members of the Mentor Development Cor e are all highly regarded and respected mentors in their own right, many of whom have received prior University Mentoring awards. Continuing Participation of Faculty and Trainees in Responsible Conduct of Research Responsible conduct of research and scientific integrity begins and ends with institutional leaders and our faculty. Therefore, we expect active and continuous participation not only in being positive role models, but also in active contributions to the instruction in a variety of ways. Faculty participate as either: 1) members of the Mentor Development Working Group, 2) lecturers or facilitators of small groups in the Ethics and Professional Integrity course, or 3) lecturers/leaders or participants in Skill -Building Workshops, Symposium, or individual courses. Additionally, trainees are expected to emulate the practices of their mentors and instructors. After scholars have taken the required coursework and Human Subject Protection and/or UCAR Certification, ongoing and lifelong instruction is planned by signing the compact letters when advising students or career development plan, Human Subject Protection re- certification every 3 years, and educational participation as team leaders or lecturers in on- going programs.
