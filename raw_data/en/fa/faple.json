The vaccine was made in cells, rather than grown in eggs as is usually the case with vaccines.\" This announcement came just a day after the World Health Organization [declared H1N1's spread to be a pandemic](http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/06/11/1725204/WHO-Declares-H1N1s-Spread-Officially-a-Pandemic?from=rss). The vaccine has [not been tested in humans yet](http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/12/novartis-swine-flu-markets-equity-pharmaceuticals.html), so the first batch is set to be used in clinical trials and pre-clinical testing. If all goes well, the new production method would allow Novartis to get the drug to market in large quantities by this fall. Other drug companies, such as Baxter International, have confirmed that they're in [\"full-scale production\" of H1N1 vaccines](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/13/AR2009061301360.html)as well.
