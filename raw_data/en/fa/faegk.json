It's possible to build almost anything with wood if we develop our expertise and adjust our attitudes, an expert says.", "sitename": "AaltoUniversity", "date": "2020-04-17", "cleaned_text": "The built environment gobbles up half of the world's raw materials and generates one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions. For comparison: air traffic accounts for 2.4% of greenhouse gas emissions. Instead of flight shame, perhaps we should be feeling building shame - or at least looking for more sustainable construction solutions. A good place to start can be found in the arrivals hall of Helsinki airport, the venue of an Aalto University exhibition called Wood Wonders. More than a copy Since February, passengers waiting for their baggage have been able to examine feats of wood construction from furniture to a transitional shelter for emergency zones, and from pavilions to Little Finlandia, a reusable temporary building acting as a partial replacement to Finlandia Hall during its renovation. It is a fine, finished construction material that grows in our forests with little farmer input and has many as-of-yet unexplored and under-utilised properties, says Pekka Heikkinen, Professor of Wood Architecture and one of the creators of this exhibition. Finnish home-builders love timber: some 90% of single-family homes are built from wood. Wood accounts for about a fifth of public buildings like schools and daycare centres, but for only five percent of multi-storey buildings. There's room for growth. Finland's forests produce enough carbon-binding wood to cover the nation's entire annual housing production needs in a single summer day. But why should we increase wood construction? The most important reason is the environment, especially the need to fight climate change. The manufacture of building products causes about a tenth of global carbon dioxide emissions, with more than 90% of these emissions associated with the production of steel and cement. Cement is the key ingredient of concrete - and concrete is the world's most used construction material. The suburban building boom of the 1960s made it the norm in Finland, too. A manufacturer of concrete modules and builders to erect them can be found in every city. The carbon footprint of constructing a concrete multi-storey building is 75% higher than that of a wooden structure. Now, the Finnish government, which has made a commitment to meet demanding climate objectives, wants to double the volume of wood construction over the next four years. 'I hope that wooden buildings aren't made by copying concrete houses; instead, we should exploit wood's good, unique properties and also take account of its limitations,' Heikkinen says. "}
