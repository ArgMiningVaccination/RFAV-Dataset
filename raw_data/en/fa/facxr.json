In his book How to Attain Knowledge of the Higher Worlds , Rudolf Steiner writes: It should be remarked that artistic feeling, coupled with a quiet, introspective nature, is the best preliminary condition for the development of spiritual faculties. Artistic feeling pierces through the surface of things, and by so doing reaches their secrets. We will be inviting therapists and artists to run these workshops. As in the past we will maintain an open space with the possibility for spontaneous meetings, the sharing of various initiatives or simply taking a quiet space. Evenings This year we have two wonderful evenings planned. On the Saturday we will feature inspiring artistic performances and on the Sunday night we have made a whole evening available to hear from various initiatives from around the country and possibly overseas. We look forward to not only seeing and hearing what is afoot but also to allow time for conversations and sharing. If you have an initiative that you would like to present during this evening please contact Silke Carter: silke @auck.hohepa.org.nz YOU CAN REGISTER ONLINE: www.anthroposophy.org.nzSPEAKERS: Ron Dunselman will be our guest international keynote speaker from the Netherlands. Ron is a co-founder of the Goetheanum Meditation Initiative Worldwide and wrote the book In Place of the Self: How Drugs Work . He is a psychologist specialising in health care, and an art therapist. He worked for nearly 30 years in ARTA, the National Anthroposophical Centre for treatment of drug and alcohol addicts in the Netherlands and was one of its founders. Ron has been chairman of the Dutch Anthroposophical Society and until recently was the General Secretary. Ron has also been a class holder since 1991. Ron and his wife Milou will be running an afternoon workshop entitled 'Questions about anthroposophical meditation and its practice' Emily Fletcher is co-founder and facilitator of Alamandria: Art of Meditation & Mindfulness, a designer, artist and storyteller. Her talk Finding the Inner Hero will speak to the courage and nobility which is intimately connected with spiritual tasks. She says: 'The task of every human being is one of continual ennoblement through a path of self- knowledge. Interestingly, the root word meaning of 'noble' is 'to know'. To 'know' ourselves requires courage - inner courage to face, acknowledge and transform what and who we are, in all our failings and shortcomings. For thousands of years human communities have always had heroes, both real and mythic, to inspire and support the will to overcome and transcend lower tendencies in groups and individuals. Heroes speak to something in us that we admire and aspire to. They can represent an archetype of higher, more universal values, and can also be seen as the countenance MEDITATION IN ACTION Finding the Will to Transform Our intention for this conference is to explore and discuss the power of Meditation, fostering a discussion between the tension of inner and outer work. How do we find the right balance to live in the 21st century and to respond to the needs of the world and of our time? Meditation as a deed or as an inner soothing need? How can Meditation empower change, transformation and social justice. Meditation is commonly used for relaxation, inner peace, healing and personal empowerment, to strengthen and enhance ones personal and professional life and has become a part of daily work-life in many leading global corporations and workplaces to improve workplace wellbeing and performance. However, as a path of self- knowledge, meditation can open the human soul to the deep spiritual foundations of its own existence. Meditation also offers insight into the forces and effects that lie behind material phenomena, and those that shape and influence the social, cultural and political environment in which we live. These forces can be both beneficent and malign. Knowing the nature and depth of what we are experiencing gives us the opportunity of making right decisions and actions, and in this sense meditation can become an active and positive force in the world. Self-development, self-awareness and self-mastery are the fruits of a true meditative practice. The biggest challenge we meet in meditation is finding our will to do it, the will to make it a practice, the will to sustain the meditation process when we are in it, and the will to integrate its transformative fruits back into the world. The Anthroposophical approach to meditation requires Will forces, otherwise it simply won't happen. It takes firm will forces to hold thinking and feeling together so that the meditation progresses. This is why I like calling Anthroposophical meditation 'Threefold meditation.' Thinking, feeling and willing are flowing one into the other during a meditation, however, the will is such a key component in holding it all together - and it is the will which is being undermined so powerfully and tragically in today's world. - Mark Geard of Alamandria: Art of Meditation & Mindfulnessof the 'Higher Self' that overarches our persona - our everyday self. Regardless of what ones destiny situation is, the path of meditation, which is the ultimate path of self- development, can be the path of (or 'to') the hero; a path which is available to every human being. By cultivating and drawing on courage and our forces of will we can ennoble ourselves and our deeds in the world.' A third speaker is still to be announced for the Friday evening. "}
