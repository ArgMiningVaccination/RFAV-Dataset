Jordan) ABSTRACT In the Southeastern United States, a co mbination of climatic and management factors have severely degraded soils over th e past 200 years. Rest oration of soil organic matter to degraded soils like the \"Georgia red clays\" is necessary to sustaining and maintaining a productive agriculture in the regi on. The goal of this work was to create an \"ecologically ideal\" production system designed to restore soil organic matter, a holistic indicator of soil productivity. Experiment al techniques included alley cropping with Albizia julibrissin hedgerows, use of winter cover cr ops, conservation tillage, organic management and application of compost and straw mulch. A 3-year field study was conducted to a ssess the short term effects of the experimental treatments on soil characterist ics and plant production. No cultivated treatments were able to maintain soil C or N without the of addition compost. Results indicated that alley croppi ng can maintain and sequester soil C and N beyond organic conservation tillage and more than conventiona lly tilled, chemically fertilized treatments. A soil organic matter model was developed to determine the effect of these techniques over a decadal time period. Model residue and soil organic matter dynamics are structured after the CENTURY model. Simu lation runs for 15 and 30 years demonstrated increases in active and slow or ganic matter C in all treatments. Model trends indicate that organic amendments can increase soil organic matter in both the short and intermediate-term, and that alley cropping can sequester slow C to a greater extent than organic management alone. Costs and labor requirements for the treatmen ts were also recorded to contribute to the minimal amount of organic production cost information available in the Southeast. Enterprise budgets are presented for orga nic production of okra, hot peppers and a corn/winter squash intercrop. Net returns on high-labor, organic crops were over $15,000 per acre in some treatments. The enterpri se budgets provided ev idence that organic, conservation tillage systems can restore soil productivity and command high returns per acre with sufficient labor.

biodiversity loss, and air and water pollution. Lal ( 2004) recently reported that conversion of forested lands to agricultu re can deplete soil organic carbon stocks by 60% in temperate soils and up to 75% in tropi cal soils. Leachates from fertilizers have rendered ground water in many parts of the Un ited States' mid-secti on contaminated with nitrate (Burkart & Stoner, 2002) , surface waters contaminated with excess nutrients, and zones in the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic (Burka rt & James 1999; Donner, Kucharik & Foley, 2004). With increasing recognition of these imp acts, a new perspectiv e in agriculture is emerging. This ecological agriculture (Soule & Piper, 1992; Magdoff, 2007) is a holistic one, in that it is concerned not only with production, but also with sustaining the ecological, social, and economic systems upon which agricultural production depends. This includes restoring biodiversity in ag roecosystems, adaptively working with the cycles and the services of nature above and below ground, and repairing damage from land uses past. The term ecological agricultur e is used in the context of this work as a subset of sustainable agriculture . It is used to convey a holistic, systems perspective on agroecosystem design, as opposed to a prescrip tion for particular practices. It is an approach that deals adaptively with the cycl es of nature to meet the challenges of agriculture, including 1) meeting crop fertility needs without the use ch emical fertilizers, 22) reducing soil erosion, 3) managing pest and pathogen populations without the use of synthetic pesticides and 4) managing weed populations without the use of synthetic herbicides. In this holistic, systems approach, soil organic matter (SOM) is considered an umbrella indicator of agronomic soil \"quality\" for the \"keystone\" role is occupies in soil (Swift, Izac & van Noordwijk, 2004). Alt hough SOM comprises only 1-5% of soil by volume, it is often the single most important driver of plant produc tivity (Paul & Clark, 1996). SOM is important to nutrient release and retention, to buffering erosion, herbicide and pesticide runoffs, to soil structure a nd aggregation, and in water storage and infiltration (Paustian, 1994; Paul & Clark, 1996; Magdoff, 2007). More recently, the role of SOM as a soil carbon sink has been an impor tant issue in the debate on global climate change (Lal, 2004; Lal, 2006). For its infl uences on these myriad of soil functions, restoration and maintenance of SOM is necessary for an ongoing productive agriculture (Nguyen & Klinnert, 2001). Historically, agriculture has relied on the \"natural capital\" (Jordan, 1998) of standing SOM stocks to support production. This capital is mineralized when forests, prairies or fallow soils are put into cultivation and can become degraded under exploitative management. Ecological agricu lture recognizes this degradation is not inevitable, but is a function of management regime and climate (Swift, Izac & van Noordwijk, 2004). Ecological agriculture is especially challenging where abundant rainfall and high temperatures result in high rates of decomposition. The Southeastern US is characterized by such a climate, w ith mild winters, long, warm summers and abundant moisture. In the Georgia Piedmont , centuries of row cropped monocultures in 3these climatic conditions have created heavily weathered soils that often lack O and A horizons, significant organic matter or availa ble nutrients (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). While there have been a number of studi es of ecological agriculture in other regions of the U.S. (Altieri, 1994; Gliessma n, 2000; Pimentel et al., 2005; Center for Environmental Farming Systems 2007; Kell ogg Biological Station, 2008) there has been little work in the Southeast, with a few not able exceptions in North Carolina (Center for Environmental Farming Systems 2007). There has been esse ntially no systems-oriented, restorative agroecology work done in the Southe astern Piedmont. The goal of the work presented here is to evaluate the ecologi cal and economic costs and benefits of an ecological agricultural system in the Georgia Piedmont. This work was designed to be synthetic, building upon ecological theory, mana gement suggestions from previous work in the region, and what are considered sound management practices in sustainable agriculture for the maintenance and restorati on of soil organic matter. In addition to SOM, other agronomic indicators of soil \"q uality\", crop production, and the economics of such a system are also examined. This chapter reviews the literature informing the design and management of the experimental system that is the focus of this dissertation. Ecological Approaches to Soil Organic Matter Restoration in Agricultural Systems Agroforestry Trees are common features of traditional tropical agricultural systems, pre-dating European exploration (Sanchez, 1995; Ka ss, Sylvester-Bradley & Nygren, 1997). Several hundred different types of agrofore stry (AF) systems have been identified throughout the tropics (Mont agnini & collaborators, 1992; Long & Nair, 1999), 4performing an array of ecological functi ons and economic diversification. As heterogeneous in design as they are, Long a nd Nair (1999) observed that AF systems tend to be alike in parts of the world with sim ilar climate and land management challenges. For example, alley cropping systems were developed by farmers on sloping lands throughout the tropics to control erosion and conserve soil. Complex, multi-species systems and home gardens were develope d on populous, fertile lowlands, to meet subsistence agriculture need s on remarkably small amounts of land. Silvopastoral systems are found throughout non-fertile lowlan ds and temperate systems (Long & Nair, 1999). For the past 50 years, western research ers have been experimenting with AF techniques in economically depressed tropi cal countries (Long & Nair, 1999). AF techniques are being researched there as alte rnatives to traditional shifting cultivation practices as fallow periods are being incr easingly shortened a nd agriculture moves increasingly to marginal lands due to popul ation pressure and soil degradation. AF techniques can be generalized as economically enriched fallows, designed to economically diversify agricultural systems with tree crops, or as biologically enriched fallows, to improve soil fertility by the planti ng or leaving of legumi nous tree species. In industrialized (predominantly temperate) c ountries, economically enriched fallows are more common, with intercropping under ha rdwoods for nut or timber production dominating the research. In North America, black walnut-based AF systems are studied more than any other AF practice (Campbe ll, Lottes & Dawson, 1991). In Europe, Australia and China, poplar is the common canopy species (as well as Paulownia spp. in China) (Long & Nair, 1999). In such sy stems designed for economic diversification 5purposes, hay, row crops or vegetables are gr own in spaces left open between immature trees, and this inter-tree pr oduction gradually phased out as the trees mature and are maintained as orchards or timber sta nds (Workman, Bannister & Nair, 2003). Biologically improved fallows are much more common in tropical developing countries, where access to chemical fertilizers is limited and growth and decomposition rates favor development of biological alte rnatives. These techniques ar e discussed in further detail below. Introduction Alley cropping is an AF technique where food crops are grown between hedgerows of trees. Alley cropping is known under a variety of other names throughout the world, including hedgerow intercropping by th e International Center for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), alley farming when small ruminant production is integrated (Sumberg et al., 1987; Long & Nair, 1999) , and avenue cropping in Sri Lanka (Wijewardene & Waidyanatha, 1984; Long & Nair, 1999). Like other biologically improved fallows , alley cropping (AC) was developed to conserve soil and improve soil fertility in the humid tropics in areas where traditional fallow periods were being shortened or elim inated (Kang, Reynolds & Attra-Krah, 1990). In these systems, shoots of leguminous he dgerow plants are pruned and applied as a mulch and green manure for adjacent crop plan ts (Kang, Reynolds & Attra-Krah, 1990). AC has been recommended in tropical climat es for restoration of SOM and to control erosion on slopes and eroded uplands (Ka ng & Gutteridge, 1994 ; Nguyen & Klinnert, 2001). 6Most AC research has been centered in Africa (Govindarajan et al., 1996), India (Singh, Ong & Saharan, 1989; Rao et al., 1991) , Southeast Asia (Nguyen & Klinnert, 2001; Faegerstrom et al., 2002) and Latin Amer ica (Haggar et al., 1993). More recently, researchers have recognized that AC with leguminous shrubs may have utility in subtropical climates in industr ialized countries, and specifically in organic or other labor- intensive production systems (Matta-Macha do, Neely & Cabrera, 1994; & Jordan, Jordan, 2004). Hedgerow and Yields Hedgerow biomass in tropical alley croppi ng systems varies tremendously based on hedgerow species, management practices (e. g. pruning and irrigation), and age of the hedgerows. In the Georgia Piedmont , dry weight annual production of Albizia julibrissin has reached 18.4 Mg/ha (Jordan 2004), but valu es of 4-5.5 Mg/ha are more common with consistent pruning practices (Matta-Mach ado & Jordan, 1995; Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). These prunings contributed 118 kg/ha N and 2.5 tons C/ha to alley cropped plots (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). A number of studies have found that hedgerow residues have the potential to supply a significant portion of crop nutrien t demand (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998; Faegerstrom et & McGraw, 2006). However, when hedgerow prunings are applied as surface green manure, only a fraction of plant-produced nitrogen is taken up by the crop plant , with losses attributed to leaching, immobilization and volatilization (Kass, Sylveste r-Bradley & Nygren, 1997). Kang et al. (1991) found that incorporation of the prunings increased N upt ake by the crop plant, but tillage is a 7controversial management technique in heav ily weathered, tropical soils, as will be discussed further. Additionally, AC residues ma y be mineralized too slowly to be synced with crop demand, and thus AC systems ma y require supplemental short-term N (Leblanc, Nygren & McGraw, 2006) and/or P so urces (Faegerstrom et al., 2002) to meet crop nutrient demand throughout the growing season. Synchronization of litter nut rient release with crop uptake is site specific and difficult to measure (Kass, Sylvester-Br adley & Nygren, 1997; Leblanc, Nygren & McGraw, 2006). Building on the pioneering de composition work of Vigil and Kissel (1991) and others, litter decomposition and re sulting mineralization are now understood to be largely a function of nitrogen, lignin and polyphenol contents (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994 ; Mafongoya, Giller & Palm, 1997). There have been attempts to categorize hedgerow residue according to general \"quality\" indices in order to better time decomposition dynamics with crop uptake (Tian, Brussaard & Kang, 1995; Mafongoya, Giller & Palm, 1997). However, these frameworks have not been widely adopted and thus nutrient syncing remains a critical resear ch issue for optimizi ng the utility of AC systems. Several experimental design limitations ar e common to AC studies, and limit the scope and scale to which hedgerow productivity results can be interpre ted. As Kass et al. (1997) reviewed, (Kass, Sylvester-Bradley & Nygren, 1997) AC residue production is often measured solely as pruned biomass, and litter fall from seasonal plant senescence is often ignored. This may be of particular re levance in temperate systems, where a large nutrient pulse could be expected with a bove ground seasonal die back. Additionally, only a handful of works reviewed were conduc ted in established, maintained AC systems 8(Kang & Gutteridge, 1994 ; Leblanc, Nygr en & McGraw, 2006). In the Georgia Piedmont, studies were conducted either in newly planted AC systems within their first 3 years of establishment (Matta-Machado, N eely & Cabrera, 1994; Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998; Green, 2001), or in older AC systems that were not maintained prior to the beginning of the study (Reichlen, 2004). Add itionally, most AC studies reviewed have examined short-term nutrient dynamics and yi eld effects in the c ontext of AC systems being able to replace chemical fertilizers in resource limited situations, but have focused little on long-term effects and non-ec onomic factors (Long & Nair, 1999). In their review of AC systems throughout the tropics, Kang and Gutteridge (1994) noted crop yield performance was largely driv en by water relations, specifically by water competition between the hedgerow and crop plant. It is unclear to what effect this occurs in other climates and how moisture dynami cs change as AC systems mature. Water relations relative to other agricultural practices are discussed further below. Effects on Soil Properties In their reviews, Kang and Gutteridge (1994 ) and Kass et al. (1997) concluded that experimental AC-based cropping sy stems generally increased total SOM and decreased soil erosion decreased in AC syst ems in the tropics. Hedgerows have been found to mobilize N, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ from deep layers and transfer them to upper soil layers by application of hedge row prunings as green manure, where they made available to the crop plant (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994). Haggar et al. (1993) hypothesized that the build up of SOM and other nutrients in th e readily mineralized soil organic matter fraction were the most significant contributions of AC systems to soil fertility. However, AC experiments on tropical soils with hi gh SOM exhibited N and SOM losses (Kass, 9Sylvester-Bradley & Nygren, 1997). Ultimat ely, the effects of AC systems on soil properties are a function of the base fertility of the soil and the litter quality, especially lignin and polyphenol content, of the he dgerow species (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994 ). In the Georgia Piedmont, previous studies found Albizia julibrissin hedgerows influenced NH 4+-N and NO 3--N & Kettler, 1998), and nitrification rates (Matta-M achado, Neely & Cabrera, 1994) but did not significantly affect total C,N, or SOM pools beyond that of controls (Matta-M achado & Jordan, 1995; Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). Rhoades et al. (1998) hypothesized this was due to the difficulty for the kaolinitic clays characteristic of the region to sequester carbon. Weed Suppression In shaded tropical AC systems (e.g. coffee), weeds can be largely suppressed if a closed tree canopy can be maintained (Yamoah, Agboola & Wilson, 1986; Anoka, Akobundu & Okonkwo, 1991). However, this not possible in systems where crop plants require full sun, or in shaded temperate sy stems where seasonal leaf die-back opens up the canopy above the alleys. In these systems, hedgerow mulch may aid in weed suppression (Jordan, 2004), but current research suggests that this quantity of biomass production is challenging and further rese arch needs to be conducted to maximize hedgerow management for improved weed control (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994 ). Challenges Success stories of AC systems increasi ng SOM, nutrient supply, and decreasing erosion can be found throughout the literature, spanning diffe rences in climates and management regimes (Kang et al. 1994, Kass et al. 1997). However, AC systems do have limitations. Space occupied by hedgero ws can reduce production area by up to 25 10percent (Matta-Machado & Jordan, 1995) when sp aced in rows 4-6m apart, as is standard in studies in the humid tropics (Kang, Reynolds & Attra-Krah, 1990). Such land loss may be an economic hardship where the qua ntity of arable land limits agricultural productivity, such as in regions of land scar city or in large monocultures. Previous researchers in the Georgia Piedmont have sugge sted that AC systems may be best suited to production of organic or sm all-acreage, high value horticultu ral crops due to the space and labor required for hedgerow manageme nt (Matta-Machado & Jordan, 1995) and (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). Light and moisture competition between hedgerows and crop plants are often hypothesized as limiting crop productivity. Hedger ows are generally pruned to a height of 0.5 m to 1 m to decrease light competiti on for the crop plant. Previous work found light competition from hedgerows generally compromised yields in maize if hedgerows are not managed properly (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994). Moisture and nutrient competition are often cursorily mentioned, but are much le ss studied explicitly. Kang and Gutteridge hypothesize this is probably due to the pre ponderance of studies being done in fertile, moist lowlands where water competition is less of an issue. In these areas, yields were improved or maintained in humid and fertile lo wlands, even over long term trials such as Kang's work in Nigeria with ICRAF (Kang & Gutteridge, 1994). However, in arid or upland areas, moisture competition can be quite severe and depress yields and deplete SOM and nutrients compared to non-AC c ontrol systems (Singh, Ong & Saharan, 1989; Campbell et al., 1994). 11Cover crops The use of annual cover crops dates back nearly to the Agricultural Revolution, and has been a necessary part of improving and maintaining agricultural soil fertility before the advent of chemical fertilizers (Fageria, 2007). Ancient Greeks incorporated fava beans into the soil for \"fertility\", wh ile the Romans grew favas and lupines to \"improve soils.\" Farmers throughout Southeas t Asia continue to practice the ancient tradition of incorporating green manures into rice production. In No rth America as early as the 1700s, colonists commonly used buckwheat , oats and rye to add organic matter to the soil. Early literature reviews (e.g. Pieters 1917, in Fageria 2007) documented the existence of research into green manures on nascent agricultural experiment stations. Since the advent of chemical fertilizers afte r World War II, the use of green manures and crop rotations has declined in the US, China, and Asia (Fageria 2007). The Organic Farming Research Foundation (Miles & Chen, 2001) reports that the use of cover crops is widespread in organic agri culture, but research is s potty on successful species combinations and results are often site sp ecific (Cherr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006b). A variety of terms are used in reference to this type of improved fallow. The Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) defines cover crops as \"Close-growing crop that provides soil protection, seed ing protection, and soil improvement between periods of normal crop production, or between trees in orchards and vines in vineyards. When plowed under and incorporated into the soil, cover crops may be referred to as green manure crops.\" The SSSA defines green manur es as \"Any crop grown for the purpose of being turned under while green or soon after maturity fo r soil improvement.\" (Soil Science Society of America, 2008). This de finition of green manure excludes the use of 12surface applied residues for soil improvement , as is common in conservation tillage practices. Conservation tillage techniques that leave more than 30% of the cover crop on the soil surface is described as \"mulch ti llage\" by the SSSA, but this term is not commonly used by practitioners. In this work, the terms \"cover crop\" and \"green manure\" are used in reference to their appli cation in conservation tillage systems. The term \"mulch tillage\" is not employed. Wh ile this term may be a more accurate description of residue management by SSSA defi nitions, it is not used colloquially in the study area by practitioners or by researchers. The use of cover crops is integral to ecological agriculture and fills a variety of management niches throughout the seasons (Shirley, Bowman & Cramer, 2001). These include providing on- site soil fertility, c ontributing to the formation of soil organic matter and soil aggregates, preventing erosi on, conserving soil moistu re, aiding in weed suppression and helping manage pathogens (Magdoff & van Es, 2000; Shirley, Bowman & Cramer, 2001). Cover crop adoption should be viewed in light of this multitude of agroecosystem service they provide. However, as Cherr (2006) points out, cover crops are often valued for certain immediate-term management factors in technology adoption, such as N-fixation poten tial and pathogen control. Nutrient supply Net cover crop N-fixation varies by climat e, soil type, water relations, cover crop species and net amount of N in the soil (Che rr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006b). As with AC systems discussed above, mineralization is subject to decompos ition dynamics, which vary depending on green ma nure quality, soil physical and biological properties, and climate (Fageria, 2007). While results may be highly variable by site and species, in the 13Southeastern US, common species of legum inous cover crops grown during winter fallows produced ten times the N of a w eedy fallow control treatment (hairy vetch producing ~250 kg/N ha and weeds ~20 kg N/ha, respectively) (Sainju, Singh & Whitehead, 2002). While N production by legum es will ultimately decrease off-farm nutrient inputs, such as conventional fertilizer s, composts or animal manures, they are still subject to nutrient cycling inefficienci es that contribute to nutrient pollution common in modern agriculture. This may be especia lly true in the hot, humid climates that experience rapid decomposition of residues. In their study of the use of several \"up and coming\" cover crops for potential use in the Southeastern US (sunn hemp, blue lupi ne and white cahaba vetch) Cherr et al. (2006a) found high rates of N loss from decompos ing residue, even in highly lignified, slower decomposing species. They concluded that incorporation of winter cover crops into the soil leads to excessive N losses via leaching and volatilization. They suggest conservation tillage, a practice that leaves at least 30% of crop resi due on the soil surface (SSSA 2008), as a strategies for better sync ing cover crop nutrient release with crop uptake. They also suggest that hot, wet environments require quick turn-around time between cover crop kill and crop planting will decrease leaching and volatilization because plants would be available to upt ake excess N from the system that would otherwise be lost. In addition to N losses, conservation til lage may decrease SOM losses compared to tilled treatments. While these strategies may not halt SOM losses entirely, soil organic carbon (SOC) may be increased with the use of a cover crops, as reviewed by Jarecki & Lal (2003). However, SOC increases may be negated when cover crops are incorporated 14into the soil, as residues decompose rapidly a nd completely when incorporated. In their work in the Georgia Piedmont, Sainju et al. (2002) found that no till management of a rye winter cover crop increased SOC 12-14%, whereas hairy vetch and crimson clover increased SOC 3% - 8%. Tilled treatments with cover crops had slight decreases in SOC, and extensively tilled control treatments usi ng inorganic fertilizer declined markedly in both soil C and N. From these results, Sainju et al. suggested using a mix of legume and non-legume winter cover crops with no-till ma nagement to provide crop N and maintain SOM. Despite the apparent folly of tillage, in cooler climates this practice may be a management necessity. Soil under heavy winter cover crop residue may remain too cool and wet in the spring to plant summer cr ops during economically desirable planting windows. In such cooler conditions, removal or incorporation of resi due is necessary to adequately warm soils. A portion of the SOC increases observed in cover cropped fields may be due to erosion control resulting from vegetative c over in what would otherwise be bare, fallow fields. Cover crops are often integrated into crop rotations during fallow periods, like winter or early spring, when soils would othe rwise be uncovered and susceptible to wind and rain erosion. The cover crop canopy thus shields the soil from rain drop impact (West et al., 1992), while roots bind soil in place, and are especially effective if residue is left on the surface after cover crop kill (Magdoff & van Es, 2000). Cover crops have much potential util ity in weed and pest suppression. Allelopathic properties of some species' residues can suppress weed germination and growth (Shirley, Bowman & Cramer, 2001) , and surface-applied cover crop residues have proven effective as a weed-suppressing mu lch in no-till organic management where 15herbicides use is not allowed (Infante & Mors e, 1996; Carrera et al ., 2005). While there are a myriad of cover crop management possi bilities, ultimately effectiveness in weed suppression is dependent on cover crop mana gement practice, vegetation and edaphic factors. These include the extent of cover crop soil coverage over the soil surface (Fisk et al. 2001), soil nutrient availability (Fisk et al., 2001), and weed establishment, germination, establishment and release dynamics (Teasdale & Daughtry, 1993; Cherr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006b). C over crops may also help break pest cycles, and have proven effective in controlling pathogenic ne matodes. However, cover crop selection must be pest-host plant specific to be effec tive (Cherr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006b). The reviewed cover cropping articles re veal several shortcomings in the experimental results. Although common in re search activities, the bulk of reviewed studies take place over 2-5 year periods (C herr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006b). Long term changes in soil C pools, food web dynami cs and nutrient cycling pathways may take significantly longer than this to equilibrate. In their review, West and Post (2002) estimated that SOM content takes 60-100 y ears to equilibrate after conversion to conservation tillage and integration of cover crops into crop rotations. Additionally, most studies utilize only 1-2 cover crop species, wh ich has limited applicability in diversified, organic systems. Organi c production systems may incorporate as many as 2-3 leguminous species and 1-2 grass species in an attempt to tighten nutrient cycles and increase agroecosystem diversity (Miles & Chen, 2001). Certainly the variability of incorporating this type of diversity into e xperimental designs is challenging. However, the current state of research in ecological ag riculture lags far behind the practice, and for 16research to elucidate mechanisms and provide information to help farmers hone practices they are already employing, at some poi nt this gap must be bridged. Conservation tillage Conservation tillage has a long history in US agriculture, dating back to the formation of the Soil Conservation Service in the 1930's in response to soil losses of the Dustbowl of the 1930's . After decades of research th roughout the country, conservation tillage is widely accepted as one of the best ways to prevent soil erosion and preserve SOM stocks (Hendrix et al., 1986; Langdale et al., 1992; West et al., 1992; West & Post, 2002). In recent years, it has gained interest for potential C sequestration (Jarecki & Lal, 2003; Lal, 2004). Results from long-term experi ments indicate that reducing tillage is the most successful way to sequester soil C (Jar ecki & Lal, 2003), with peak rates of C increase during the 5-10 years after conve rsion to conservatio n tillage, and with equilibrium reached after 15-20 years (West and Post, 2002), assuming crop rotations are kept the same as prior to conversion. In the Southeastern US, no-till is the mo st frequently adopted conservation tillage strategy (Tyler et al., 1994). As reviewed by Tyler et al.(1994), no-till has been shown to increase yields and SOM contents, decrease runoff and soil loss, a nd protect surface and ground waters from siltation and nutrient load ing. In the Georgia Piedmont, no-till increases grain crop yields by up to 32% and soybeans up to 43%, largely due to increased soil moisture (Denton & Wagger, 1992). Similarly, both winter and summer grain crops were more productive under the NT treatments than in the CT treatments over the course of a 3-year study of double-cropped corn and winter wheat (Franzluebbers & Stuedemann, 2007). While yield increases may be largely attributed to increased soil 17moisture under NT treatments on a seasonal ba sis, increased SOM and a resulting effect on soil quality may also play a role in the long term. In synthesis work examining the ability of 3 soils representative of the Georgia Piedmont, Hendrix et al. (1998) summarized the changes after conversion to conservation tillage systems. No-till decreased less in so il C than conventionally tilled in riverine soils, and soil C levels remained unchanged in a Cecil sandy loam after 11 years of conversion to no-till. The aut hors attribute the differences between the two soils to the higher clay content of the Cecil soil, whic h afforded a greater degree of aggregate protection. They found that co nservation tillage increased so il C levels 11 Mg/ha over 10 years of no-till management on a degraded Madison, clayey, kaolinitic soil. Following this chronosequence, the Madi son soils would reach regional equilibrium for forested ecosystems after 36 years in NT management. Their results indicate that conservation tillage may be especially effective in sequester ing soil C in clayey soils due to the greater degree of aggregate protection afforded by the clay, and that this technique may have a restorative effect on degraded soils on re latively short ecological timelines. Noting extensive soil losses from centur ies of conventional tillage, the erosion control potential for conservation tillage has been of keen interest to both researchers and farmers. As Hargrove (1990) found, the m echanisms by which no-till protects soil from erosion are two-fold. During individual rain fall events, residue left on the soil surface reduces the energy of raindrop impacts and de creases the erosive potential of rainfall. Over the course of years, the residue incr eases organic C and wate r stable aggregates, which increases infiltration rates, as wa ter flows down through, and not over the soil (Hargrove, 1990). As West et al. (1992) found, these effect s over time are significant. 18They found that rill erosion in no-till plots was only 23% of that in conventionally tilled plots. After 5 years, organic C was 40% highe r in the no-till, whic h also had 50% higher water stable aggregates in the 0-80 mm soil layers. The literature is lacking in studies us ing organic management and conservation tillage. In one of the few works reviewe d, Teasdale (2007) found that common organic farming techniques can increase soil organic ma tter and build fertility more rapidly than conventional no-till, but in combined organic, reduced tillage systems weed control is a serious management challenge. Indeed, some researchers and many growers accept cultivation as a management reality for weed control in organic farming systems. While some extension programs are working to develop no-till organic techniques that effectively control weeds (Schonbeck & Morse, 2004; The Rodale Institute, 2008) there is little peer reviewed research in the literature. Strategies that appear to suppress weeds in no-till, organic farming systems utilize dense plantings of cover crops. When terminated, the cover crops create a surf ace litter layer thick e nough to suppress weeds until crop plants are of sufficient size to out compete weeds (Infante & Morse, 1996; Schonbeck, 2003). Organic production practices This section is not intended to be an over view of the state of research in organic production practices, per se. It is instead intended to review the literature investigating how organic farming systems differ from conven tional systems in their approaches to the major challenges facing modern agriculture today. Organic and ecological agriculture are not synonymous terms, but often times do have similar perspectives in addressing such issues. 19Organic and ecological agriculture share the perspective of assuming holistic, systems approaches to managing fertility and pests. While conventional production systems rely on chemical fertilizers to m eet crop nutrient demand, organic agriculture often depends on composts, animal manures and byproducts, or mineral deposits in sand or gravel dusts to supply so il fertility (Altieri, 1995). The philosophical differences in these management practices have been summari zed as approaches that \"feed the plant\" (conventional) versus those that \"feed th e soil\" (organic) (Magdoff & van Es, 2000). Organic farming generally takes a holistic ap proach to managing nutrients, soil organic matter, erosion and weeds through techni ques such as crop rotation, extensive diversification and integrated pest management. While organic farming is often considered more \"sustainable\" than chemically- intensive agriculture, some i ndividual practices may be res ource intensive or otherwise ecologically damaging. For example, some or ganic vegetable growers rely on resources that are transported from long distances fo r nutrient supply and improving general soil fertility, such as fish emulsion and other se a-based products, specialty sands and/or soil amendments. Additionally, most organic fa rmers use tillage as their primary weed control mechanism (Jordan, 2004), subject to the criticisms of tillage reviewed previously. In an interdisciplinary summary of 22 years of long term organic cropping systems trials at the Rodale Institute (the \"Rodale Rotations\"), Pi mentel et al. (2005) assessed the ecological and economic differenc es between conventional, animal-manure based organic, and legume-based organic cr opping systems. After 20 years, organic C had increased 2 and 2.4% in the animal and le gume-based organic systems, respectively. 20The organic systems retained considerably more nitrogen, with 47% remaining in the animal-based organic system, 38% in the legume-based organic systems, and only 17% retained in the conventional system. Howeve r, nitrate leaching in the organic systems was equal or greater than the conventional sy stem. In the legume-based organic system, 32% of the N applied in cover crops was leached, followed by 20% in the manure-based and 20% in the conventional system. Pimentel et al. attribute the hi gher leaching rates in the legume-based organic to the initial pulse of soluble N following the hairy vetch cover crop kill. Corn yield was similar during nor mal rainfall years, but during drought years organic yield were considerably higher. Fossi l-fuel energy inputs were 23 and 32 percent less in animal- and legume-based cropping systems compared to the conventional, respectively. While the organi c systems required about 35% mo re labor, but this input is spread throughout the season, so net labor costs were the sa me as the conventional and were more evenly spread throughout the year. Enterprise budgets indicated net returns for both systems were similar, but costs were lower and less variable in organic systems. (Pimentel et al., 2005) In a systems-level comparison of Califor nia tomato farms, Drinkwater et al. (1995) found both small and large organic farmers had higher SOM contents, more potentially mineralizable N and less mineral N in the soil. They had higher actinomycete diversity but similar fungal and bacterial di versity compared to conventional farming systems. Yields were not significantly differe nt between groups, but did vary three-fold between farms in the conventional and orga nic groupings, indicating yields depended on the quality of farm management rather than organic or conventional production techniques. Similarly, they found cultural factors (time of transplant) were a better 21indicator of herbivorous insect damage than management regime. However, predatory parasitoids and other natural enemies were significantly higher in organic systems. Carpenter et al. (2000) compared trea tments with two types of organically- prepared compost to chemical fertilizers and found increased soil microbial biomass, substrate induced respiration, earthworm a bundance and biomass and soil respiration. They concluded the differences between the so il response in the treatments was due to the application of organic versus synthetic amen dments, but differences in response variables were not significant between composts of di fferent qualities. Carpenter et al.'s work illustrates that many of the differences in ag ronomic soil factors and soil biology between organic and conventional production systems may be due to the application of soil amendments such as manure, composts and cove r crop residues. It s hould be noted that these practices are no t exclusive to organic producti on, and are applied in non-organic cropping systems as well. Some researchers suggest that nutrients derived from application of organic amendments cycle in a fundamentally different way than inorganic fe rtilizers, and that the tools traditionally used to measure soil fe rtility and quality do not adequately explain the differences between conventional and orga nic agricultural practi ces (Wander et al., al., & Piotrowska, al., 2005). Haneklaus et al. (2005) sugge st that since one goal of organic agriculture is to increase the biological activity of soil, a different tool set is needed to assess soil health beyond microbial biomass and nutrient content. They suggest enzyme activity, field- based visual assessments and even \"energetic analysis.\" Other attempts have been made to combine measures of soil biological activity into aggreg ate indices (Koper & 22Piotrowska, 2003; Myskow et al ., 1994), but it appears a hand ful of European researchers are the only advocates of this approach (e.g. (Saviozzi et al., 2001; Riffaldi et al., A number of agronomic and biotic variable s may be of interest in evaluating the effects of management on soil and plant pr oduction. Without a synt hetic framework to integrate this multitude of variables, maki ng holistic conclusions about cropping system- level effects is difficult. There are two ba sic integrative approaches to assessing soil function: indexing or scoring variables and mechanistic modeling. Andrews and Carroll (2001) describe the underlying differences in these syntheses: index approaches interpret and prioritize data based on empirical re lationships or expert judgments, whereas outcomes of mechanistic models are extrapol ations of relationships based on known data points (Karlen, Andrews & Doran, 2001). A number of common terms have been used to refer to soil function, such as \"soil tilth,\" \"soil fertility,\" \"soil health,\" and \"s oil quality.\" However, many take issue with the application of such umbrella concepts. Some are critical of applying a value-laden term, like soil quality, to ecol ogical function, as being \"cont extual, subjective, value- laden, outcome driven and infinite in possi bilities\" (Sojka & Upchurch, 1999). Others find such aggregate terms amorphous and not particularly useful, captured in such memorable statements as \"If soil has healt h, then where do I stick the thermometer?\" (Crossley, D.A. personal communication ). As reviewed by Karlen et al. (2001), despite philos ophical debate on terminology and approach, research interest in synthetic frameworks for evaluating \"soil quality\" 23increased dramatically in the 1990's in both rese arch and agricultural extension. On field and farmer scales, a number of frameworks were developed to r oughly quantify overall agricultural soil quality, including test kits , farmer-based scorecards and soil resource management programs. On the research scale, soil quality indices used multivariate statistical approaches to synthesize soil da ta (Karlen et al., 19 97; Andrews & Carroll, 2001). The factors considered in frameworks at both scales are listed in Table 1.1. While index approaches are s ynthetic, they are static, ca pturing soil conditions at the moment of sampling. Mechanistic models offer a temporally dynamic approach, and may explain historic changes or predict fu ture trends based on known interactions between soils, climate and management. These approaches tend to be either research-oriented, seeking to elucidate mechanisms driving soil processes, or management- oriented, used to inform decision making on th e effects of manageme nt practices. They may have particular utility for understandi ng processes where changes are observable experimentally only over long periods of time, such as SOM dynamics (Christensen, 1996). A number of soil organic matter models predict soil organic matter trends with acceptable accuracy (Paustian, 1994). After reviewing several potential process-based models, the CENTURY model was selected for this research for a variety of reasons. CENTURY has a specific agroecosystem vers ion (version 4.0), is being increasingly incorporated into other cropping system s models (Gijsman et al., 2002), and can effectively simulate C accumulation duri ng soil formation (Parton et al., 1987). CENTURY's soil organic matter submodel consists of multiple soil organic matter, surface and soil residue pools with different maximum decomposition rates 24(Figure 1.1). CENTURY partitions soil organi c matter into active, slow and passive pools, with turnover rates of 1 to 5 years, 10's to 100's of years, and 100's to 1000's of years, respectively. Residue is divided into above and below ground metabolic and structural pools. Metabolic pools decompose rapidly and cycl e soluble and labile inputs, while structural pools deco mpose more slowly and cont ain metabolically resistant compounds, including plant lignin (Part on, 1996). Interactions between the compartments are influenced by soil texture, moisture, temperature, initial soil organic matter content and plant production dynamics . The CENTURY mode l was originally designed to simulate soil organic matter dynami cs in temperate grasslands, but has since been modified to fit a number of agroecosy stems, savannas and forests. The original model functioned on a monthly time step, but subsequent modifications of maximum decay rates and temperature and moisture factors have allowed the model to function on a daily time step, which may be more appropriate for agricultural or pulse-driven systems (Parton et al., 1994). CENTURY has been used to some extent in organic systems, although not nearly as often as in conventional agricultural studies . It successfully simulated the changes in SOM stocks when converting from conventiona l to organic agriculture, using a 100-year calibration data set (Foereid & Hogh-Jense n, 2004). The model predicted SOM stocks increasing for 50 years after conversion, a nd reaching a dynamic equilibrium after 100 years. While the model accurately descri bed the decomposition dynamics, the plant production submodel did not accurately simulate observed plant growth or yields. The authors hypothesize that either the plant grow th model was not correct ly adjusted for the plant growth dynamics at their study site in Scandinavia, or that the model did not 25correctly account for the amount of plant bioma ss returned to the soil in the experimental systems. As global production and market share of organic agri culture continues to grow, the role of the long-term ecological e ffects of these systems becomes increasingly relevant. Economic Dimensions The USDA estimates that certified or ganic crop land doubled from 1992 to 1997, to 1.3 million acres nationally in 1997 (Dimitri & Greene, 2002). This is acreage expansion is probably due to rapid economic growth in the organic sector and organic price premiums for producers. A market resear ch firm, Packaged Facts, reported that the US organic industry has grown by more than 20 percent annually si nce 1990, with sales in 2000 totaling $7.8 billion industry-wide. Fres h produce is the top-selling category in organic food production, with sales in this sector gr owing by 51.4% from 1999-2000. Fresh produce accounted for 42% of all orga nic food sales in 2001 (Dimitri & Greene, 2002). The US market is representative of the global growth in organics, which have increased 20-30% per year worldwide (Geier, 2003). Despite the burgeoning market for organi cs on the consumer-level, surprisingly little production cost and profitabi lity data exists, and even le ss synthetic or review work is available. Economic analysis of the l ong term data set from the Rodale Rotations, discussed previously, found that organic systems have about the same net returns as conventional when price premiums are not ap plied. When price pr emiums are applied, organic systems are more profitable for grai n and soybean rotations (Pimentel et al., 2005). 26Many economic comparisons of organic and conventional production practices come from studies conducted on USDA Agricult ural Research Service (ARS) stations. However, one review study identified potential pitfalls in comparison data from these sites. Kaval (2004) collated nearly 30 years of variable cost data fo r organic, alternative and conventional experiments from ARS statio ns and on-farm studies. The profitability for identical production practi ces differed depending on whether ARS or on-farm data were used. In every on-farm comparis on, alternative cropping systems (including organic, no-till and reduced-inputs) were more profitable than their conventional counterparts. In contrast, conventional system s were more profitable when analyzed with ARS data. Kaval hypothesized that experi ment stations do not have the economic pressure to produce harvestable crops, and ma y be more apt to neglect failing crops in alternative systems, whereas growers will increase their attention to a crop to ensure it is marketable. Another explanation for this disc repancy could be differences in experience and efficiency using non-conventional produc tion practices. Farmers experienced in alternative agricultural systems they have developed for their production system may be more efficient and effective at producing ma rketable products than ARS researchers and field managers. There are very little published yield or production cost data for organic production in the Southeast (Estes, Kleese & Lauffer, 2003). Organic farms in this region are characterized by small, diversified acreag es, making consistent field-level studies difficult. In the single study found for dive rsified, organic vegetables grown in the southeast, yields and labor we re the most variable data. Additionally, analysis were conducted on a square foot basis, rather than a acreage or hectare scale, which is further 27evidence of the scale and diversity of or ganic farms in the region (Estes, Kleese & Lauffer, 2003). While budgetary information is necessary for producers to make sustainable economic decisions, it says nothing of e nvironmental impacts and the long-term ecological effects of production practices. Fo r producers to make management decisions that are sustainable in both regards require s an interdisciplinary, synthetic approach. Bioeconomic modeling approaches attempt to engage this cross-disciplinary dialogue by incorporating economic dimensions into mechanistic ecological models. In his review of bioeconomi c model structures, Brown (2000) notes the difficulty in effectively incorporating both biological processes and economic optimization without losing the integrity of either pe rspective. The 21 models revi ewed vary in approach from those that are primarily ecological, with some economic data attached, to economic optimization models, with some biophysical da ta attached. The handful of models they feel are accurate and useful to both fa rmers and researchers include the following features: - a dynamic modeling environment that is responsive to en vironmental and other inputs changes - the ability to operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to the stakeholder using the model - the ability to be predictive or prescriptive, rather than just explanatory of the consequences of management practices -they are relevant to the unit of decision making, from household to policy levels 28-they contain effective integration and linkages between biological and economic components -there is an understanding of the uncertainty inherent in each model, so practitioners can interpret model results in light of the ri sks management decisions informed by model outcomes. A bioeconomic approach has been applie d in at least two studies of organic production in the southeast. Paudel, Lohr & Cabrera (2007) comp ared a number of conservation tillage and organic amendment management combinations for Georgia cotton production, using the er osion productivity impact calculator (EPIC) for the biological component, and the environmental po licy integrated climate model (EPIC) for the economic component. They ultimately determined that the profitability of a particular practice, even in the short term, was determined by the N cycling efficiency as mediated by the SOM response to the treatment. In other words, the profitability and ability for the system to withstand potentia l market changes (including those induced by global climate change) depended on building an d maintaining SOM for efficient nutrient cycling. Ultimately, they concluded that treatments incorpora ting poultry litter and reducing tillage were more prof itable than conventional fertil izer because of their effect on N-cycling and SOM dynamics, even under short-term scenarios. Andrews, Lohr & Cabrera (1999) devel oped a bioeconomic decision making tool for winter squash production in Georgia. Th eir nutrient cycling submodels were based on N and P cycling in the EPIC model (Godwin & Jones, 1991). Economic information included enterprise budgets and decision ma king tools from University of Georgia Agricultural and Environmental Sciences C ooperative Extension. Their model included 29flexibility for a spectrum of management goals, from those that are strictly profit driven to those that preserve environmental quali ty. The nutrient cycling submodels did not accurately simulate observed values, but th is did not prohibit the use of the multi- disciplinary framework embedded in the tool to make policy-level suggestions. For the variety of production practices and stakeholder values analyzed in the model, Andrews, Lohr & Cabrera concluded that the most harmonious management practice for all stakeholders was to apply poultry litter and co mposts to meet crop P needs, as opposed to other application rates. Research introduction The goal of this work was to create an \"ecologically ideal\" production system, incorporating the concepts reviewed in this chapter, as well as recommendations from previous sustainable agricultural research in the Georgia Piedmont. This research was intended to be locally applicable to th e challenges facing farmers in the Georgia Piedmont, but using techniques that have prove n successful in similar climates across the globe. As such, the resulting experimental treatments include alley cropping with Albizia julibrissin hedgerows, use of winter cover cr ops, employ conservation tillage, are organically managed, and are amended with co mpost for nutrient supply and straw mulch for weed suppression. The study site is part of the Center for Subtropical Agroforestry (CSTAF). The following chapters are based on the re sults of three years of a 3-year field experiment using these techniques. Chap ter 2 reports the effects on a number of indicators of soil quality with an emphasis on soil organic matter, Chapter 3 presents enterprise budgets and a discussion of the economic utility of the experimental 30treatments, and Chapter 4 is a nutrient cycl ing model used to explore the mechanisms governing the soil organic matter dynamics in experiment over time periods longer than that of the field study.

Jo rdan. To be submitted to Agriculture, Ecosystems and the Environment. 50Abstract This work presents the results of a 3-year field study of an agroecosystem designed to restore soil organi c matter to degraded soils of the Georgia Piedmont. The agroecosystem incorporated organic manage ment, alley cropping, conservation tillage, and the application of compost and mulch, winter cover crops and a summer vegetable crop rotation. The effects on soil characteri stics and plant producti on were studied. No cultivated treatments were able to maintain soil %C or %N w ithout the addition of compost. In alley cropping treatments with compost additions of both 10 and 20 U.S. tons/acre, %C was maintained, and increased in non-mulched treatments. In non-alley cropped organic treatments, soil %C declined, even at the 20 tons/acr e application rate. Results were identical for soil %N. The study demonstrated that alley cropping can maintain and sequester soil C and N beyond or ganic conservation tillage and more than conventionally tilled, chemically fertilized treatments. The spring winter cover crop residue provided an effective weed barrier for 4 to 6 weeks after cover crop kill, but additional hand weeding was required throughout the summer. Crop yields did not vary by treatment. This work demonstrates that agroforestry techniques, conservation tillage and compost applications can increase soil C in degraded, clayey soils while they are in cultivation. Introduction In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the impacts of industrialized food and fiber production on so ils, waters and the atmosphere. The extensive tillage commonplace in industrial agri culture alters soil food webs (Hendrix et al., 1986), increases nitrogen turnover (House, Stinner & Crossley, 1984) and erosion 51(West et al., 1992), and has been the source of surface and groundwater nitrate (Burkart & Stoner, 2002) and other nutrient contamin ation (Burkhart, 1999; Donner, Kucharik & Foley, 2004). Conversion of forest lands to agriculture from native ecosystems depletes soil carbon (Lal 2004; Lal 2006), as does tillage in general (Jarecki & Lal, 2003; Lal, 2004; Lal, 2006). These agricultural manage ment practices are common worldwide, and are gaining increasing recognition for their pot ential roles in global climate change. In the Southeastern US, centuries of row croppe d monocultures have eroded vast tracts of surface soil horizons. The exposed, heav ily weathered subsoil often lacks any appreciable organic matter or available nutrients (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). In addition to this land use legacy, farmers in th is region must also manage for the dynamics of farming in a subtropical climate. In this hot, humid climate w ith abundant rainfall, organic amendments and soil organic matter decompose rapidly, a nd pest, pathogen and weed pressures are high. The combination of these factors results in an environment where successful implementation of sustainabl e agriculture technique s is challenging. A number of techniques have been researched to address these issues, each with their own benefits and limitations. Improved fallows Use of winter cover crops has proven e ffective in increasing soil organic matter (SOM) and soil C and N stocks in the Sout heastern U.S. (Sainju, Singh & Whitehead, 2002; Sainju, Whitehead & Singh, 2005). Winter cover crops produced ten times more N in vegetation (kg/ha) compared to a winter weed fallow. However, if the cover crop residue is incorporated in to the soil via till age, potential gains in SOM and soil C may be negated (Sainju, Singh & Whitehead, 2002; Ja recki & Lal, 2003; Sa inju, Whitehead & 52Singh, 2005), Additionally, incorporation of cover crop residue can lead to rapid N- losses, even in highly ligni fied cover crop species (Che rr, Scholberg & McSorley, 2006a). Agroforestry techniques have also b een suggested as improved fallows. One technique, alley cropping, utilizes hedgerow s of trees or shrubs grown between rows (alleys) of crop plants (Kang, 1991). Alley cropping techniques ar e practiced in some parts of the United States, but most of these systems are designed for economic diversification (Long & Nair , 1999; Workman, Bannister & Nair, 2003). In the humid tropics, alley cropping systems with leguminous shrubs are more common (Rao et al., 1991; Govindarajan et al., 1996; Long & Nair, 19 99). In these systems, shoots of the hedgerow plants are pruned and applied as a mulch and green manure for adjacent crop plants (Kang, Reynolds & Attra-Krah, 1990). Alley cropping with leguminous species has been suggested for the Southeastern U.S ., as hedgerow species have the potential to produce of large quantities of nitrogenous biomas s in situ in this subtropical climate, reducing the need for off-farm inputs and tig htening nutrient cycles (Jordan, 2004). However, hedgerows may take up 25 percent or more of arable cropland (Matta-Machado & Jordan, 1995), and require labor to coppice an d apply prunings. Previous works in the region have suggested that alley cropping may be best suited for labor-intensive production systems, such as organic or ot her high-value horticultural crops (Matta- Machado, Neely & Cabrera, Jordan, 2004). 53Conservation In the Southeast, farmer adoption of c onservation tillage, especially no-till, has been consistently increasing for a number of years (Tyler et al., 1994). Conservation tillage research in the region has been s hown to increase yields, soil organic matter (SOM) content, protect surface and ground wate rs from excess nutrient pollution (Tyler et al., 1994), and to decrease erosion (Langdale et al., 1992; West et al., 1992). Jarecki & Lal (2003) concluded that re ducing tillage is more effective than fallows and crop rotations in sequestering soil C with rates of soil C increase pe aking 5-10 years after conversion to conservation tillage. However, decades may be required for soil C levels to reach equilibrium (Hendrix, Fran zluebbers & McCracken, 1998). While increases in soil C under conser vation tillage are widely reported, conservation tillage as it is most commonly pr acticed is dependent on herbicides for weed management and termination of cover crops . Although conservation tillage can reduce herbicide runoff by 70 percent compared to conventional tillage, agrochemicals are still transported in runoff events, and may be partic ularly high in heavy ra infall events after herbicide application in no-till fields (Sims, Buhler & Turco, 1994). Additional ecological impacts of herbicide use include herbicide drift, weed resistance and the energetic costs of herbicide production, transport and applicat ion are rarely incorporated into conservation tillage research. Organic agriculture Organic agriculture frequently empl oys systems approaches to managing nutrients, soil organic matter, erosion and weeds. Soil fertility needs are met via application slow-release nutrien t sources such as composts, cover crops, animal manures, 54or mineral deposits in sand or gravel dusts (Altieri, 1995). These techniques have both benefits and costs to the pr oducer and the environment. In a synthesis of long term organic farming trials at the Rodale Institute, Pimentel et al. (2005) reported increased levels of soil organic C in organic systems a nd yields in these treatments were similar or higher than the conventional. Additionally, the organic treatments required less fossil fuel inputs than conventional treatments. De spite relying on organic sources for fertility, which are thought to release nut rients more slowly than ch emical fertilizers, organic systems can still have high nutrient loss rates. Pimentel et al. (2005) hypothesize that the high nitrate rates in the organic treatments at the Rodale site are due to initial pulses of soluble nitrogen after application of manures or cover crop kill. In organic systems utilizing animal manures, phosphorus run-off can also be quite high, as well as difficult to measure (Vadas, Kleinman & Sharpley, 2004). In addition to nutrient management issues, most organic farmers use tillage as their primary weed control mechanism (Jorda n, 2004), subject to the trade-offs discussed above. Many other common organic farming pr actices can be resource intensive, for example, relying on inputs from far off- farm for micronutrients supply and other management issues. Labor inputs in organic systems are also highe r per acre (Altieri, 1995; Pimentel et al., 2005). With these potential benefits and trade-o ffs of these techniques in mind, the term perhaps best describing the systems approach taken in this work is ecological agriculture (Soule & Piper, 1992; Magdoff, 2007). This term is used in this work to refer to as a subset of sustainable agricultu re, one that employs an ecological systems perspective to agroecosystem design and management, rather th an a particular suite of practices. This 55perspective emphasizes a holis tic, systems-oriented appr oach emphasizing restoring biodiversity in agroecosystems and adaptiv ely working with biogeochemical, plant and animal population cycles (Soule & Piper, 1992) . The objective of this study was to explore to what effect an \"ecologically id eal\" agroecosystem could restore soil C and improve other characteristics associated with \"soil quality\" (National Resource Conservation Service, 1999) in degraded Pied mont soils. This work was designed to be integrative, using an ecological agricultura l approach that includes well accepted sustainable agricultural techniques, conclu sions and recommendations from previous studies, into experimental cr opping systems that are the be st blend of techniques as agroecological theory affords. To our knowle dge, this is the only organic, conservation tillage, agroforestry experiment of its kind in the Southeastern U.S. The four experimental cropping systems are: 1) Alley cropping with organic vegetables using strip tillage (AC treatments), 2) Organic vegetables us ing strip tillage (no alle y cropping, OST treatments), 3) Conventionally fertilized, conventionall y tilled vegetables (CT treatment), and 4) A mowed fallow (Fallow treatment). Materials and Methods Site description The study site is located in the Georgi a Piedmont, near Athens, Georgia USA (33\u00b057'N lat. 83\u00b019'W long). The soil is cl assified Pacolet sandy clay loam (kaolinitic, thermic typic hapludults). Th e soil of the experimental plots was highly eroded, and consisted only of a B horizon of heavily compacted red clay. The site was chosen to test the methods on an extremely poor soil. The site is on a 100-acre historic 56farm that has been in cultivation since 1864, with cotton, cattle, sorghum and soybean grown on the site until 1993. At this time, intense cultivation on the site ceased, and management shifted to a mowed fallow of past ure grasses and weeds. In 2001, an alley cropping system was planted along an east faci ng slope on the site, with hedgerows of Albizia julibrissin spaced 5 m apart. Between 2001 and 2004, the alley ways were planted with a variety of vegetables and cotton, to test various cultiv ation techniques. In summer of 2004, the alleys were surface tilled with a rototiller to a depth of 5 cm to expose mineral soil. A summer cover crop of sunn hemp ( Crotalaria juncea ) was broadcast sown, and killed w ith a mechanical grass roller (a \"roller crimper\") in September, when this work began. Experimental Design In early October, summer vegetation was killed using the roller crimper, and a blend of legume and grass cover crops was broadcast sown. The cover crop blend and seeding rates a cultipacker wa s passed over the soil to shake any cover crop seed from surface litter, ensuring seed cont act with the mineral soil. In the spring (mid-April), the winter cover crop was mechanically killed using a roller crimper, which rolls the vegetation down and crimps the vascul ar tissue of the plant, killing the shoots and leaving a uniform layer of cover crop resi due on the soil surface. Winter cover crops were managed identically in both the AC and OST cropping systems. 57After approximately 2 weeks, plots were strip-tilled using a disc followed by a 5 cm wide shank to rip a planting furrow a pproximately 25 cm wide by 15 cm deep. Vegetable crops were direct seeded (Years 1 and 3) or transplanted (Year 2) into the furrow by hand. All plots were hand weede d. Conventionally tilled treatments were disked and roto-tilled approximately 1 week prior to vegetable planting. All vegetable crops were irrigated using dr ip irrigation, which was insta lled prior to planting each spring and removed each fall. Following standard practice for diversif ied organic vegetable production in the region, summer vegetables were rotated annually, with the following crops: Year 1: Okra the AC cropping system, 6 treatme nts with combinations of compost applications of 0, 10 and 20 U.S. tons/acre/ year with and without straw mulch were randomly distributed, with 4 replicates per tr eatment. AC plots were 5 m wide (the spacing between the hedgerows) by 4.8 m-7.3 m in length. The OST cropping system consisted of 3 treatments with compost appl ications of 0, 10 and 20 tons/acre/year, with all treatments receiving straw mulch, and 4 re plicates per treatment randomly distributed throughout the system. OST plots were 5 m by 5 m. Complete treatme nt descriptions are listed in Table 2.1. Compost was comprised pr imarily of poultry li tter and wood ships. Straw mulch was comprised of wheat straw in year 1 and pasture hay in years 2 and 3. Compost and straw mulch were applied by hand in all treatment s. Conventional 58treatments were broadcast fertilized with inorganic fertilizers (10- 10-10 percent N, P and K respectively) in bands adjacent to crop rows within 10 cm of crop plants, according to the University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Cooperative Extension guidelines for N requirements for each crop species (Table 2.2). After broadcasting, fertilizer was lightly ra ked into the soil without disturbing the transplants or the seedbed. Albizia hedgerows were pruned 1 to 3 times each summer to a height of 1 m when they began to shade crop plants. Prunings we re evenly applied to the cultivated plots in adjacent alleys. The AC, CT and Fallow cr opping systems were established in 2004 and studied for 3 years, and the OST system was es tablished in 2005, and studied for 2 years. Sampling Soils were sampled for C and N at 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm depths in the fall of each year, prior to fall compost application and winter cove r crop planting. Soils were sampled for NH 4+ and NO 3- from 0-30 cm depths 6 times over 3 years, in the spring prior to mechanically killing the cover crop, and in the fall prior to mechanically killing the summer crop. Soil microbial biomass from 0-5 cm depths was sampled 6 times over 3 years, in the winter (February) and spring (l ate April) of each year. These dates were chosen because they approximate base and peak microbial biomass estimates, respectively. Soil microbial biomass and NH 4+ and NO 3- samples were placed in a cooler with ice prior to transport to the laborator y. For each sampling period, three cores from a 2-cm diameter soil probe were collected randomly from the middle portion of each plot, oven dried at 50 \u00b0C, and bulked for a single analys is. Bulk density was sampled according to the USDA Soil Quality Test K it Guide (National Resource Conservation 59Service, 1999), with one sample collected fr om the middle portion of each plot. Care was taken not to sample in a planting furrow. A PVC ring 15 cm in diameter was placed on the mineral soil surface, a wooden block placed over the ring and a r ubber mallet used to hammer the ring 5 cm deep into the soil. The sample was carefully removed, and a flat-bladed knife used to scrape excess soil fr om the bottom of the PVC ring. Aggregate stability was sampled in the spring of 2004 in the AC treatments, and in the fall of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in all treatments, according to th e USDA soil quality test kit protocol (National Resource Conservation Service, 1999). Three 0-5 cm cores were bulked from each plot, carefully collected so as not to dist urb the soil aggregates, and air dried. Vegetation was sampled in the spring a nd fall, corresponding to the end of the winter cover crop and summe r cropping seasons. One 0.25 m 2 sample was collected randomly from the middle portion of each plot . Roots were carefu lly excavated with a shovel and left attached to plant shoots. L oose dirt was gently shaken off each sample, and roots and shoots transported in paper bags to the lab for further processing. In 2005 and 2006, crop yields were recorded throughout the summer. Crop fruits from 4 marked plants were weighed in the fiel d from 4 marked plants per pl ot, and yields from 1 marked plant transported to the lab fo r dry biomass determination and nutrient analysis. Fruits harvested throughout the season were bulked fo r each marked plant at the end of the season for a single nutrient an alysis. In 2007, this methodolog y was modified, due to the difficulty of isolating 4 indi vidual winter squash plants per plot. In 2007, all winter squash fruits in each plot were weighed for yield determinations, and 1 fruit per plot was collected for nutrient analysis. Corn yields were estimated from kernel counts on 10 ears of corn per plot, total numb er of corn plants per plot were recorded, and yields 60determined by assuming an average of 90,000 kernels/bushel and average mass of 24.36 kg/bushel, determined by dry weights of a known quantity of oven dry kernels. Corn nutrient content was obtained from ears collected in 0.25 m2 vegetation samples. Albizia and straw mulch additions were sampled at the time of application, with one, 1 m2 sample collected from the middle portion of each plot. Laboratory Analysis Soils C and N samples were oven dried at 50 \u00b0C to a constant mass, passed through a 2-mm sieve, ground on a Spex mill to a particle size < 250 \u00b5m. They were weighed into tin capsules and analyzed for C and N by micro-Dumas combustion assay at the University of Georgia (UGA) School of Ecology Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (ACL). pH was determined from these sample s in a solution of equal volumes of soil and water. NH 4+ and NO 3- samples were extracted within 1 week of field sampling, and were stored in sealed plastic ba gs in refrigeration until time of extraction. Samples were extracted by placing 4 g of wet weight sample in 20 mL of 2 M KCl solution, placed on a shaker for 1 hour at medium speed, and filtered through Whatman #42 filter paper into scintillation vials. Sample s were analyzed by continuous flow colorimetry at the UGA chloroform fumigation extraction method (Vance, Brookes & Jenkinson, 1987). Sa mples were processed within 24 hours of collection, and hand sorted to remove visi ble roots and rocks. Hand sorting was used throughout the experiment as soil at the initia l sampling date were too wet and clayey to pass through a 2-mm sieve, thus proce ssing was handled identically at succeeding sampling dates. 10 g of each sample were fumigated with chloroform under a vacuum 61for 5 days, because this duration maximizes extraction of microbial biomass C in wet, clayey soils (Motavalli, 1994). After fumigation, desiccation chambers were allowed to vent overnight and TOC extr acted by adding 40 mL 0.5M K 2SO 4 to the fumigated sample. Beakers with the soil in the K 2SO 4 solution were placed on a shaker for 1 hour at medium speed, and the solution filtered through Whatman #42 filter paper into scintillation vials. Non-fumigated samp les were extracted by same procedure immediately after sorting. Extracted samples we re stored frozen until they were analyzed on a Shimadzu 500 Total Organic Carbon analyz er at the UGA School of Ecology ACL. Microbial biomass C was calculated as the difference between fumigated and non- fumigated samples using a k c value of 0.45 (Joergensen, 1996). Aggregate stability was measured by we t sieving by hand, according to procedure in the USDA Soil Quality Test Kit (Nationa l Resource Conservation Service, 1999). A 10 g sub-sample of air dry soil from each pl ot were passed through a 2-mm sieve, gently wetted, and wet sieved in a deionized water ba th through a vertical distance of 1.5 cm at a rate of 30 oscillations per minute for 3 minutes . After wet sieving, samples were dried in a 100\u00b0C drying oven for 24 hours, weighed, and then dispersed in soap (Calgon) solution. Sieves were soaked for 5 minutes, during which time they periodically moved up and down. After 5 minutes, sieves were rinsed with running water until only sand remained. Samples were again dried in a 100 \u00b0C drying oven and weighed. Water stable aggregates were calculated as % of soil > 0.25 mm = (mass of dry aggregates - sand) / (mass of dry soil - sand). Roots from 0.25m2 vegetation samples were carefully washed over a 2-mm sieve before drying to remove adhered soil. The entire dried plant samples were sorted into 62weed and crop categories, and roots removed fr om the plant, allowing for accurate root species identification. Spri ng cover crop samples were sorted into legume and rye categories. Above and below-ground biomass for each category was recorded, then sorted samples were bulked into root and shoot categories for each plot for nutrient analysis. Albizia, straw mulc h, vegetation biomass, and crop yi elds except winter squash were dried in a 50 \u00b0C drying oven until a constant ma ss was achieved, and dry mass recorded before nutrient analys is. Winter squash was dried in an American Harvest Food Dehydrator to a constant mass, because samples tended to mold in the drying oven due to high moisture content and sugar content. A ll biomass from vegetation samples were first passed through a Wiley mill with a 2-mm screen to homogenize the sample and reduce particle size. Subsamples from the entir e milled biomass were ground to less than 250 \u00b5m particle size in a Spex mill. Samples we re weighed into tin capsules and analyzed by micro-Dumas combustion assay for C and N at the UGA School of Ecology ACL. Results Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using a repeated measures mixed model in SAS Version 9.1 for PC (SAS Inc., 1989-2007). Least squares means were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method. Significance was determined for all results at p <0.05. The experiment was analyzed as a randomized block, with plot as the random variable. Treatment effects were nested within cropping system (AC, OST, CT and Fallow). The nested effect was necessary to account for the placement of plots of each treatment within adjacent cropping systems and not randomly throughout the complete block. Separation 63of cropping systems was necessary to separate the effects of hedgerow roots from other treatments. Soil Characteristics Bulk density (g/cm3) from 0-5 cm differed significantly by treatment over time (F[17, 67] = 1.90, p = 0.0332), decreasing in AC trea tments, remaining relatively constant in Fallow, CT and OST1 and OST2 treatment s, and increasing in OST3 (Figure 2.1). Within AC treatments, bulk density increased in Year 2 in treatments not receiving compost or mulch additions, but declined to va lues comparable to the other treatments by Year 3. Mean values for all treatments were uncharacteristically low for the region. Water stable aggregates (WSA's) > 250 \u00b5m in the 0-5 cm soil depth changed significantly over time (F [2, 61] = 27.12, p = <0.001) but not by treatment. Mean WSA's from all treatments increase d from Year One (65.97% + 7.12%) to Year 3 (80.17% + 1.66%), then decreased from Year 3 to Year 4 (58.45% + 6.17%). pH was higher in the 0-5 cm depth than in 5-15 cm depths, (F [1, 235] = 117.55, p = <0.0001), with significant effect by treatment over time with depth (F [31, 235] = 1.79, p = 0.0086). All AC and the OST3 treatment incr eased in pH from 0-5 cm. OST 1, OST2 and Fallow treatments decreased, and the CT incr eased in Year 3, but fell to initial levels by Year 4 (Figure 2.2). pH in all organic tr eatments decreased in their first year in cultivation, but AC treatment s rapidly increased after th e initial drop, whereas, OST treatments did not. From 5-15 cm, all trea tments increased in pH, except the fallow (Figure 2.3). Soil total percent C (%C) was greater fr om 0-5 cm than from 5-15 cm in all treatments (F [1, 161] = 284.02, p = <0.0001) and significan tly different by treatment by 64depth (F [10,161] = 2.32, p = 0.0140) (Figures 2.4 and 2.5, respectively). Changes in soil total %C were significant over time (F [3,161] = 5.71, p = 0.0010), as were treatment by time interactions (F [24, 161] = 1.97, p = 0.0073), but not by Irrespective of depth, AC1, AC2, AC4, OST1 and OST3 AC5 increased, while AC6 and OST2 did not change significantly. The CT treatment decreased, while the Fallow treatment increased (Figure 2.6). So il microbial biomass carbon (\u00b5g C/g dry soil) fluctuated seasonally, with higher biomass C in sp ring than in winter (F [5, 151] = 6.58, p = <0.0001), but did not differ significantly by treatment or by treatment over time. Soil total percent nitrogen (%N) was higher from 0-5 cm than 5-15 cm in all treatments (F [10, 146] = 2.39, p = 0.0116) (Figure 2.7 and Figure 2.8, respectively). Total %N differed significantly by treatment over time (F [24, 146] = 2.12, p = 0.0035), but not by treatment by time by depth. Irrespective of depth, the AC and Fallow treatments had consistently higher %N than OST treatments. Percent N declined in treatments AC1, AC2, OST3 and CT. Percent N increased in AC4 and AC6 during the experiment, but after the third year of cultiv ation, changes were not different from the initial treatment means. AC3 and AC5 increased significantl y. OST treatments all declined in after 2 years of cultivation, but OST1 and OST2 increas ed in Year 3. The Fallow was relatively unchanged (Figure 2.9). Data for NH 4+-N from 0-30 cm were significant by date (F [5, 161] = 3.56, p = 0.0045), generally with higher values in the spri ng than in the fall (F igure 2.10). Changes in soil NO 3--N (\u00b5g NO 3-/g dry soil) from 0-30 cm were significant by treatment (F [10, 161] = 11.37, p = <.0001), date (F [5, 161] = 29.89, p = <0.0001) and treatment by date (F [44, 161] = 3.99, p = <0.0001). Treatment responses were va riable, but in general all treatments 65increased between spring and fall sampling da tes each year. All cultivated treatments were higher in NO 3- at the end of the 3 years than thei r initial values. During all spring sampling dates, AC treatments had higher NO 3- than OST and CT treatments (Figure 2.11). Means and standard errors for NO 3- and NH 4+ date appear in Table 2.3. Vegetation characteristics Spring vegetation samples consisted of above and below ground biomass of winter cover crops and weeds. Spring vege tation data were only available for 2005 and 2007, as 2006 samples molded in storage prior to analysis. Spring above ground biomass (kg/ha), differed signif icantly by treatment (F [10,19] = 11.14, p = <0.0001) and date (F [1, 19] = 9.76, p = 0.0056), but not treatment by date. In general, AC treatments planted in winter cover crops had greater vegetation biomass than CT and Fallow treatments. The latter was comprised of volunteer vegeta tion. Above ground biomass decreased from 2005 to 2007 in all treatments except AC3. Declines in AC5 and AC6 were less precipitous than other tr eatments (Figure 2.12). In addition to biomass changes, the composition of the spring vegetation community shifted from 2005 to 2007. The weed above ground biomass increased significantly over the 3 year experiment (F [1, 19] = 6.86, p = 0.0168). In 2007, after 3 years of the AC experiment, mulched tr eatments had less weed biomass than non- mulched treatments. Rye above ground biomas s declined in all tr eatments over time (F [1, 19] = 6.86, p = 0.168) and differed significantly by treatment (F [10, 19] = 6.28, p = 0.0003) not did not differ significantly by treatm ent by date. Clover above ground biomass generally decreased from 2005 to 2007 (F [1, 19] = .0168), and varied significantly by treatment (F [10, 19] = .0003), but not by treatment over time. In the CT and Fallow 66treatments, the biomass of leguminous and fo rb plants increased, while grass biomass decreased. Above ground biomass C (kg C/ha) producti on in spring vegetation decreased in all treatments (except AC3) over time (F [1, 19] = 15.00, p = 0.0010) (Figure 2.13), with responses varying by treatment (F [10, 19] = 6.06, p = 0.0004) but not by treatment by time (F[7, 19] = 2.20, p = 0.0812). In 2005, C productio n was significantly higher in AC treatments compared to the CT and Fallo w, with the exception of AC3. In 2007, C production was more variable, but in general, treatments receiving compost (AC3, AC5, AC6, and OST3) had higher C production than those not receiving compost additions (Figure 2.13). Above ground biomass N pr oduction (kg N/ha) decreased in all AC treatments over time except AC3 (F [1, 19] = 11.18, p = 0.0034 ). N production in AC treatments differed significantly by treatment (F [10, 19] = 4.66, p = 0.0020) and treatment by date (F [7, 19] = 2.75, p = 0.0374). AC treatments not receiving compost (AC1 and AC2) decreased more than those receiving compos t. In the year of data available for the OST treatments, N production in creased with increasing leve ls of compost application (Figure 2.14). Shoot C/N ratio did not differ significantly by treatment or date. Fall vegetation above ground biomass (kg/ha) consisted of crop plants and weeds, and differed significantly by treatment (F [9, 51] = 2.85, p = 0.0085), but not by date. Crop biomass (kg/ha) differed significantly by treatment (F [10, 51] = 2.15, p = 0.0368) and over time (F [2, 51] = 12.43, p = <0.0001), but not treatment by time. In 2005, AC treatments produced more above ground biomass than th e CT treatment, with mulch treatments generally producing more biomass than non-mu lched treatments (Figure 2.15). In 2006, there was less of a visible mulch effect, and biomass in CT treatments was on par with 67the AC treatments, although the CT treatment had more weed biomass. The less marked differences between mulched and non-mulche d treatments is proba bly an outbreak of Fusarium wilt in mulched treatments, which lead to higher mortality, discussed further below. Weed biomass (kg/ha) decrea sed in all treatments over time (F [15, 51] = .0549), with lower weed biomass in mulched treatments (F [10, 51] = 2.94, p = 0.0054). Changes in weed biomass over time were significant (F [15, 51] = 1.84, p = 0.0549). By the final vegetation sampling date, fall weeds in mulche d treatments were n early non-existent. Shoot C/N ratio differed by treatment (F [10, 49] = 0.0039), date (F [2, 49] = treatment by date (F [15, 49] = <0.0001) (Figure 2.16). Shoot C (kg/ha) differed significantly by date (F [2, 51] = <.0001), but not by treatment or treatment and date. Shoot N differed by treatment (F [10, 51] = 0.0004), but not by treatment or date. Fall vegetation shoot C and N treatment means (+ standard error) are pres ented in Table 2.6. Below ground biomass data was incomp lete in spring vegetation biomass samples, because root samples were not taken in 2005, and samples molded prior to analysis in 2006. Below ground fall vegetati on biomass (kg/ha) increased significantly from 2006 to 2007 (F [1, 30] = 24.36, p = <0.0001), reflecting changes in biomass with different species in the crop rotation. Differe nces were not significant by treatment or treatment by date, but differences were signifi cant when looking specifically at weed and crop root biomass. Differences in crop a nd weed below ground biomass were variable, but significant by treatment over time (F [9, 30] = 12.87, p = <0.0012, F [9, 30] 2.30, p = 0.0356, respectively). In 2006, diffe rences between crop and weed root biomass were not striking, other than that OST treatments had higher weed biomass than the AC and CT treatments. In 2007, weed and crop below gr ound biomass increased in all treatments, 68the crop due to the deep and pr olific rooting of the corn pl ants and the weeds due to an outbreak of crab grass late in the season. Of note is the decreased root biomass in the mulched treatments compared to the non-mu lched treatments (AC3 and AC5). If the mulch was retaining significant moisture, as we hypothesize, in non-mulched treatments, plant roots would have to root deeper to access water, and increase in root biomass. Weed root biomass was higher in no n-mulched treatments (Figure 2.17). Crop yields (fruit biomass) did not differ significantly by treatments, but differed significantly by year (F [5, 258] = 10.29, p = 0.0002), due to differences in biomass of crop fruits in the various crop species in the crop rotation. Mean yields (+ standard error) for all treatments by year we re: Okra (2005) = 3535 + 360 kg/ha, hot peppers (2006) = 4633 + 272 kg/ha, and corn and winter squash intercrop (2007) = 2718 + 255 kg/ha. Although treatment differences were not significant, ther e were trends based on mulch applications. Non-mulched AC treatments had lower yiel ds than mulched treatments in 2005 and 2007, but higher yields in 2006, due to disease damage. Crop yields (mean + standard error) for all treatments from 2005 to 2007 are presented in Table 2.4. Yield nut rient data is not presented here, as 2005 yields were damaged in storage by pests prior to analysis, and data from corn yields in 2007 was incomplete. Albizia pruning biomass ranged from 578.57 + 211.29 kg/ha to 2780.00 + 935.31kg/ha, corresponding to inputs of 15.93 + 6.91 and 75.77 + 22.74 kg N/ha, respectively. Pruned biomass va ried significantly over time (F [5, 48] = 15.44, p = <0.0001), with greater biomass fr om the first annual prunings than succeeding prunings. C and N inputs (kg/ha) varied significantly over time (F [5, 48] = 15.73, p = <0.0001 and F [ 5, 48] = 14.88, p = <0.0001, respectively), as did the C:N ratio (F [5, 48] = 10.29, p = 69<0.0001). During 2005, biomass and C/N ratios declined throughout the season over the course of 3 prunings. In 2006, biomass and C/N ratios increased. On April 9, 2007, a hard spring frost severely damaged the Albizia and killed developing new shoots. The frost, combined with a severe drought, led to very slow Albizia development in 2007, and pruning was only necessary in the late summer . Mean values for each pruning date are presented in Table 2.5. Discussion The decline in aggregate st ability (WSA's > 250 \u00b5m) is likely a function of severe drought in the last year of the experime nt. In 2007, drought c onditions in Georgia deteriorated to \"exceptional\" levels, a c ondition expected only once every 100 years (Stooksbury, 2008), and soils were exceedingly dry, friable and compacted during the fall sampling date. Differences in pH between 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm soil depths are to be expected, as pH generally decreases deeper in the soil profile. The pH increases in alley cropping treatments were incremental. Howe ver, they demonstrate that alley cropping with no-till management can increase surface soil pH beyond organic no-till without alley cropping, except for in the heavily composted no-ti ll treatment. All cu ltivated treatments increased in pH from 5-15 cm, probably due to root-derived organic matter inputs. Furthermore, the pH in the CT treatments increased in both the 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil depths. This is probably due to the increased vegetation production re lative to the initial degraded condition that was made po ssible by fertilizer additions. Changes in soil total %C may be explai ned by the quantity of compost additions and the presence or absence of mulch. All AC treatments increased in %C from 0-5 cm, except for AC1 and AC2, which did not rece ive compost. All other AC treatments 70increased in %C, however, the mulched trea tments increased less than non-mulched treatments receiving the same level of compost. While the straw mulch treatment was initially assumed to improve weed suppressi on, it probably also helped to conserve moisture during dry, hot conditi ons. The additional moistu re present under the mulch may have increased decomposition of compost and/or soil organic matter, leading to less marked increases in %C in the mulched treatments. When comparing AC treatments with OST treatments with the same level of compost and mulch additions, AC treatments accumulated soil total %C, while OST were just able to maintain soil total %C. These results demonstrate that for this site, a lley cropping can maintain surface soil C beyond that of organic, conservation tillage systems alone. At deeper soil depths (5-15 cm) %C in the AC treatments declined in all mulched treatments regardless of compost additions. However, %C increased in AC treatments with compost additi ons without mulch. Because the organic treatments were not tilled, organic amendments were not incorporated mechanically in to the soil. The increas ed moisture under the mulch probably increased decomposition deeper in the soil than non-mulched treatments, but the only resources available to decompose at this depth were root input s and existing SOM. In OST treatments, %C was maintained onl y in OST3, which received 20 tons/acre compost application, but the tre nds indicate a decline in this treatment as well. This indicates that biomass additi ons and potential sequestrati on under conservation tillage alone cannot compensate for higher decomposition rates under mulch. It is well established that conservation til lage conserves soil C (West et al., 1992; Hendrix, Franzluebbers & McCracken, 1998; Ja recki & Lal, 2003). However, it is possible in this case that root biomass additions and a microclimate favorable to 71decomposition may have created a \"microbial priming effect,\" hypothesized by Fontaine et al. (2004). Root exudates and dead root biomass additi ons may have activated the microbial community, which then consumed the root carbon as well as existing soil C in mulched treatments. Additionally, it was a ssumed the conservation tillage would slow organic matter cycling and conserve, and perh aps increase soil C, it is unknown whether some tillage would have increased soil C at deeper depths by incorporating organic amendments. These results indicate that alley cropping and cons ervation tillage with moderate compost application are enough to maintain and build surface soil C. However, winter cover crops and compos t additions are not enough to maintain soil C at deeper depths in alley cropping or cons ervation tillage organic system s in clayey soils, and that these conclusions are confounded by the in teractions between compost and mulch additions. The fallow treatment increased most markedly between years, and was without the addition of composts . We would expect a relativel y stable state in the fallow, with moderate increases in soil C due to l ack of disturbance and vegetation inputs from occasional mowing. The relatively large increa ses in %C may be due to an increased frequency of mowing on the site during the expe rimental time period in an effort to keep the site appearing well-managed. In any case, increases in soil C in the fallow are evidence that fallow land uses can restore soil organic matter. However, the utility of this management technique is dependent on the future land uses and current economic goals, which will be discussed in further detail below. While soil %N results did not have significant treatment by time by depth interactions, treatment by time interactions followed similar patterns as soil %C results. In AC treatments, compost additi ons were required to maintain %N. The lack of increase 72in %N in mulched treatments supports th e hypothesis that higher decomposition rates were occurring under the mulch, and that slowing decomposition through moisture limitation can sequester soil N. Because all OST treatments were mulched, it is unknown whether organic, conservation tillage practices without mulch additions would have similar effects to AC treatments with identical compost applications. With the current experimental design, it is impossible to determine whether the declining trends in soil N in OST treatments are due to lack of organic matter inputs from hedgerows, or from high decomposition rates under the mulch. Throughout the course of the study, the OST treatments had lower soil %N than the AC and Fallow treatments at both 0-5 cm and 5-15 cm depths. Difference in initial %N between the cropping systems may be e xplained by the establishment period of the alley cropping treatment. The hedgerows were planted 3 years prior to initiation of this experiment. During this time, inputs from occasional Albizia prunings, root sloughing, and crop and weed residues may have contributed N to the soil. Albizia biomass production and C/N of pruni ngs were variable, and probably a function of plant response to pruning, precipitati on and temperature. Biomass from the first pruning in 2005 was quite woody, with ma ny large branches as the plants had not been pruned regularly since establishment. The succeeding growth consisted of more lush, green growth, but by th e third pruning the hedgerows were developing more woody growth. In 2006, biomass was similar between the two prunings, but again the biomass from the second prunings was considerably mo re nitrogenous than the first. As only pruned biomass was sampled for this wo rk, nutrient input estimates are likely underestimates of actual C and N inputs from the hedgerows. Hedgerows could 73contribute additional N and C inputs from root biomass, including root exudates and large pulses of dying fine roots that senes ce after pruning (\"root sloughing\") (Seiter & Horwath, 1999), above and below ground inpu ts from seasonal senescence in the fall (Kass, Sylvester-Bradley & Nygren, 1997). It was initially theorized that the Albizia pruning biomass would also aid in weed suppression (Jordan, 2004). Pr uned biomass was not sufficient to suppress weeds for any length of time, in part due to the wide spaci ng of the hedgerows, and in part due to leaf morphology. It is possible that reducing space between the hedgerows, biomass production would have been sufficient to suppress weeds. However, additional hedgerows would also reduce available cr opland. It is also possible that Albizia residues do not have the capacity to suppress weeds at any planting density due to this species' extremely fine leaflets. L eaflets fell from the rachis of the compound leaf within 48 hours of pruning, leaving sparse woody material on the surfa ce with insufficient biomass to smother weeds. Weed biomass increases in spring ve getation in the AC treatments can be explained by a build up of pernicious early s eason weeds in the plots, such as Carolina horse nettle ( Solanum carolinense perenne) . More diligent, timely weed ma nagement in the early season could have minimized this problem. That said, or ganic farmers identified weed control as their biggest management challenge (Stockdale et al., 2001) and tillage is considered the most effective method of weed suppression in or ganic farming (Pekrun, El Titi & Claupein, 2003). Successful weed suppression in orga nic, conservation tillage systems depends upon dense spring cover crop production, and timel y transplant and quick establishment 74of vegetable crops (Infante & Morse, 1996; Ca rrera et al., 2005). In this work, weeds declined in fall biomass sampling, as mature crop plants could better compete with weeds, and as the late summer weed comm unity shifted from spring grasses towards easier to manage forbs. Declines in spring vegetation shoot bioma ss, C, and N production could be due to decreased cover crop seed germination in th e increasingly thick no-till litter layer. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the increased spring biomass found in mulched treatments, which had a thicker litter layer than non-mulched treatments. It is more likely that declines spring growth were a function of depleted nutrient content at the time of cover crop sowing in the fall, which took place at the end of the summer growing season. Treatments receiving fall compos t (AC5, AC6 and OST3) had less marked decreases in spring vegetation biomass than treatments not receiving fall compost. Fall crop biomass and yield results may be partially explained by rainfall and crop susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. In 2005, okra yields in mulched treatments were higher than in non-mulched treatments receivi ng the same quantity of compost. This is probably due to the water conser ving effect of the mulch and that okra is susceptible to few soil borne pathogens. Yield results in 20 07, a drought year, show ed similar trends. However, in 2006, yields in the mulched treatme nts were lower, as the pepper plants in these treatments had a higher incidence of Fusarium wilt. It is possible this fungal disease was exacerbated under wetter soil conditi ons and in the organic matter rich litter layers of the composted treatments. As discussed above, the presence of mulc h influenced both the nutrient dynamics and vegetation growth of the cropping systems. It is also likely influenced interactions 75between plant and soil. In mulched treatment s, increased moisture content could have increased microbial activity, which led to greater nutrient mine ralization and plant growth. Similarly, increased moisture w ould have improved the ability for root penetration into the soil, increasing the plan ts' ability to uptake nutrients, but also increasing sloughing of root exudates as the ro ots move through the soil. This would create a positive feedback l oop, as the soil food web feeds on root exudates, and then excretes mineralized nutrients that would available for plant uptake. Conclusions This experiment was established to see to what extent an \"ecologically ideal\" cropping system, based on proven and experime ntal approaches recommended for the region, can reduce off-farm inputs, maintain and sequester nutrients, and effectively manage weed populations. No cultivated treatments were able to maintain soil %C or %N without the addition of compost. In alley cropping treat ments with compost additions of both 10 and 20 tons/acre, %C wa s maintained, and increased in non-mulched treatments. In non-alley cropped organic treatm ents (OST), soil %C declined, even at the 20 tons/acre application rate. Similarly, %N did not change in treatments receiving compost and mulch in either the OST or AC system. Percent N increased in non- mulched AC treatments receiving compost a dditions, and all AC treatments maintained greater %N than OST treatments. Thus, alle y cropping can maintain and sequester soil C and N beyond organic conservation tillage and certainly more than conventionally tilled, chemically fertilized treatments. However, interactions between compost additions and mulch treatments are non-additive. That is, if effects were additive, we would expect to see twice the N and C increases in the 20 t ons/acre compost additions than in the 10 76tons/acre addition. While the increases in soil %C and %N are larger in 20 tons/acre treatments than in 10 tons/acre without mu lch, differences between the two levels of compost in mulched AC treatments are not significant. The OST shows an even more pronounced trend, with lower %C and %N in the higher level of compost application. The declines in %N under highe r compost applications may be explained by increased shoot biomass N (kg/ha) in heavily compos ted treatments, as N was mineralized and taken up by crop plants. However, lack of ch ange in %C may be evidence of microbial priming. Both the OST and AC systems involved c onsiderable organic amendments in the form of winter cover crop residue, com post additions, and in the AC systems, Albizia inputs. The mechanisms for incorporation of nutrients from these surface applied amendments would be through all uviation into the soil during rainfall or irrigation events and translocation of nutrients and organic mate rial by soil organisms. It is unknown what quantity of nutrients were volatilized or re spired from the surface amendments, and if nutrients could have been better sequeste red through incorporati on. While tillage is generally considered to decr ease soil %C through increa sed decomposition rates, it is possible that incorporation of carbon in lignified materials, such as Albizia residue, could have sequestered more carbon deeper into the soil profile and appropriately timed tillage could have offered more weed control. These questions highlight the need for additional research into the interactions between til lage regime, residue quality and nutrient dynamics in soil restoration efforts. While the spring cover crop residue provided an effective weed barrier for 4 to 6 weeks after cover crop kill, it was not enough to suppress weeds throughout the season. 77The mulched treatments required considerably less labor to weed in summer. Labor and production economics are considered in further detail in the economic analysis of this experiment in Chapter 3. Briefly, the trad e-offs in labor and nutrient dynamics driving the decision of whether or not to mulch are ultimately dependent on the resources available to the grower and th e paramount land management goal. If a farmer is labor- limited, as many small, diversified organic fa rmers in the region are (Estes, Kleese & Lauffer, 2003), mulching to reduce labor may outweigh the effects of increased decomposition under mulch on C and N sequestration. Similar trade-offs must be weighed when interpreting the results from the mowed fallow treatment. This treatment was included in this work, as it is a common alternative land use for nutrient and SOM de pleted agricultural lands in the Southeast. Ultimately the efficacy of mowed fallow for soil restorati on is subject to the subsequent land use. While mowed fallows may increase soil C and keep N-cycling relatively tight, mowing favors grasses and grazing adapted forb sp ecies, which can be aggressive weeds in agricultural systems. Thus, if the fallowed land is intended for agri culture, particularly organic, where herbicide use is not allowed, an improved fa llow, such as alley cropping with winter cover crops, may be more effective at preparing a future cropping system for cultivation. Our results demonstrate that while res ource and labor intensive, alley cropping with compost additions may provide farmer s on degraded Southeastern U.S. soils a cropping system that can restore soil C and ot her soil properties, wh ile maintaining lands in cultivation. 78Acknowledgements This work was made possible by funding from the United States Department of Agriculture Sustainable Agriculture Resear ch and Education Program (Grant number LS06-190) and the Center for Subtropical Agroforestry.

Escalante and C.F. Jordan. To be submitted to Review of Agricultural Economics. 98Abstract This work documents the costs and la bor requirements for an experimental agroecosystem, and complements a 3-year field study of the ecological effects of experimental farming techniques on soils degr aded in soil organic matter. Enterprise budgets are presented for organic production of okra, hot peppers and a corn/winter squash intercrop under 10 different producti on scenarios, 9 of which were based on organic conservation tillage. Other experi mental techniques in cluded alley cropping (an agroforestry technique using perennial le gumes), use of winter cover crops, and applications of compost and straw mulch. Th e organic treatments ha d less tractor labor and fuel costs than conventional treatments due to the extensive tillage required in conventional farming. The organic treatments had little pest and pathogen pressure, with the exception of Fusarium wilt in some treatments receiving straw mulch. Weed suppression by straw mulches reduced labor re quirements by an average of 23%. Yields in all treatments were lower than conventional yields from other stud ies in the region, due to the degraded nature of the soil on the st udy site. However, net returns on high-labor, organic crops were over $15,000 per acre in some treatments. This is evidence that organic, conservation tillage systems can restore soil productivity and command high returns per acre if labor requirements can be met. Introduction The organic industry has grown by more than 20% annually since 1990 in both producer and consumer sectors of the ec onomy (Dimitri & Greene, 2002). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that acreage of certified organic cropland doubled from 1991 to 1997 (Dimitr i & Greene, 2002), although certified 99organic cropland still only account ed for only 0.5% of agricult ural lands in the US in 2005 (USDA ERS 2007). Fresh produce is th e top-selling category in organic food production (USDA ERS 2007), and a ccounted for 42 percent of all organic food sales in 2001, with sales increasing 51.4% from 1999-2000 (Dimitri and Greene 2002). The growth in organics is demonstrable in the \"mainstream\" marketplace, with retailers like Wal-Mart offering a wide selection of orga nic products at competitive prices (Warner, 2006). The organic consumer base has become increasingly diversified as well. A recent study of consumer data found some minority gr oups consume more fresh organic produce per capita than the stereot ypical white, young, middle-class consumer (Stevens-Garmon, Huang & Lin, 2007). However, compared to the rest of the U.S., Georgia is underrepresented in the acreage and number of certifi ed organic operations. In 2005, the USDA reported only 53 certified organic operations in the stat e, totaling 977 acres, putting the state 31st in the country in number of certified operations and 43rd in total number of certified organic acres (USDA ERS 2007). While the producer supply may be limited in comparison to other states in the U.S., consumer demand for local and/or organic products has been increasing remarkably in the past several y ears. The Southern and Western U.S. have been identified as the two fastest growing organic markets in th e country (Stevens- Garmon, Huang & Lin, 2007). Ge orgia Organics, the state-wi de umbrella organization for organic agriculture, has experienced treme ndous growth in the past 5 years, nearly tripling their membership from 300 to 800 members. The organization's annual conference attendance has increased from 150 in 2004 to a capped enrollment of 700 in 2008 (Rolls, A. personal communication ). Perhaps the largest potential consumer of 100Georgia-produced organics is Emory Universi ty in Atlanta, GA. Emory recently launched a \"Sustainable Food Initiativ e,\" in which they are committe d to provide 75% of their dining facilities' food from local producer s by the year 2015 (Emory Sustainability Committee, 2006). Georgia is in a unique position to meet consumer demand for organic produce, given the composition of agri cultural acreage in the state. In 2005, Georgia had 178,000 acres in vegetable production (Boatright & McKissick, 2005), and ranks in the top four states nationally for fresh market vegetables in area harvested, production and value (Center for Agribusiness and Economic Development 2006). However, the greatest income by county in the state comes from coun ties in the coastal plain of South Georgia, on farms of large acreages, whose production pr actices vary greatly from that of the smaller, diversified organic farms more typi cal of the north Geor gia Piedmont. These smaller operations in north Georgia cater prim arily to burgeoning lo cal markets in urban areas. While consumer demand may be growing in the state, especially in urban areas, the Southeast is one of the most difficult places in the country to farm organically. The hot, humid climate leads to rapid pest and disease outbreaks, high weed pressure, and rapid decomposition of soil amendments such as compost and manures. These management challenges require grower expert ise in managing diversified systems, and may require higher production costs for com posts, organically-approved pesticides and labor for cultivation and weed ing. These climatic challenges are in addition to the barriers to organic adoption identified by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS). These may include increased managerial and labor costs in organic systems, lack of 101knowledge ors exposure to organic systems, a nd/or undeveloped or insufficient access to markets and marketing infrastructures. Desp ite potential obstacles , adoption of organic farming practices is growing as farmers seek to lower input costs from agrochemicals, conserve nonrenewable resources and capit alize on organic marketing price premiums (USDA ERS 2007). Economic decision making tools may help alleviate the risk associated with converting to new production pract ices; enterprise budgets are one such tool. Enterprise budgets estimate the costs and returns associ ated with the production of a product, or enterprise (Chase, Smith & Delate 2006). While common for conventionally produced commodities, few enterprise budgets exist for organic agriculture, and even fewer for the southeast. There are enterprise budgets for or ganic commodity crops in the Midwest, and for vegetables in California, Wisconsin a nd New Jersey (Born, 2004). Only 1 study of enterprise budgets of small, diversified vegetables in the southeast, in North Carolina (Estes, Kleese & Lauffer, 2003). At the time of this writing, no enterprise budget or production cost information was found for orga nic conservation tillage or agroforestry- based systems anywhere in the U.S. The goal of the field experiment complementing this economic analysis was to design an ecological agricultural system to restore degraded soils based on best management practices and recommendations from previous agroecology works in the region. These techniques include conserva tion tillage, incorporation of perennial legumes, crop rotation and use of winter cove r crops and composts. The goal of this analysis is to assess the economic costs a nd benefits of the experimental systems on degraded soils using an enterprise budget appr oach. This analysis is not intended to be 102comprehensive, evaluating th ese techniques under a wide variety of conditions on a number farms. Rather, it is intended to ga in a general understanding of the potential profitability of experimental technologies on degraded lands, and to aid in grower decision making in technology adoption, based on production cost information from the field experiment. This approach was chosen to make a much needed contribution to this basic information that is lacking in the regi on, and also to provide an entry point into a discussion of the economic costs and trade-offs of these systems in terms of soil organic carbon sequestration. Production Practices and Methods The study site is located in the Georgi a Piedmont, near Athens, Georgia USA (33\u00b057'N lat. 83\u00b019'W long) on a 100-acre hi storic farm. The farm has been in cultivation since 1864, with cotton, cattle, so rghum and soybean previously grown on the site until 1993. At this time, the site was removed from extensive cultivation and management shifted to a mowed fallow of pa sture grasses and weeds. An alley cropping system was established on the site in 2001. In 2004 an experiment was initiated that compared 4 cropping systems over a 3-year ve getable crop rotation for their effects on soil characteristics, plant production and yields. These systems included two organic systems in conservation tillage, one conventio nally tilled system and a mowed fallow, outlined further below. The subheadings below the cropping systems describe experimental treatments which employed varyin g levels of compost for nutrient supply (0, 10 and 20 tons/acre/year) and mulch for weed suppression. For a complete description of the experimental desi gn and rationale, see Chapter 2. The four cropping systems and their treatments are: 1031) Alley cropping with organic vegetables using strip tillage (AC treatments), a) AC1: Alley cropping w ith winter cover crops b) AC2: AC1 + straw mulch c) AC3: + fall compost + spring compost + mulch 2) Organic vegetables using strip ti llage (no alley cropping, OST treatments) a) OST1: Winter cover crops b) OST2: OST1 + spring compost c) OST3: OST1 + fall + spring compost 3) Conventionally fertilized, conventionall y tilled vegetables (CT treatment), and 4) A mowed fallow (Fallow treatment). Timing of practices such as harvest and hedgerow pruning in AC treatments varied slightly each year, but a general out line of annual production practices for each treatment is detailed in Figure 3.1. For the AC and OST treatments, in October of the year preceding the summer crop, the previous year's crop residues were killed using a commercial grass roller, or roller crimper , with one pass over each bed. Compost comprised primarily of composted poultry li tter and wood chips was spread by hand in designated treatments at a rate of 10 tons/acre, and winter cover crops broadcast sown by hand. In late April, winter cover crops were killed with the rolle r crimper with 2 passes over each bed, and a planting bed prepared using strip tillage to create 2 planting furrows per bed 18\" apart, with 36\" between each be d. Compost (10 tons/acre) was spread in 104designated treatments and drip irrigation tape installed. Approxima tely 2-3 weeks after roller crimping, summer vegetable crops were either direct seeded or transplanted by hand. This time period between roller crimpi ng and planting was allo w to pass to allow allelopathic compounds in the rye cover crop residue to brea k down, so as to not inhibit crop plant germination and establishment. Once weeds began to emerge from the cover crop residue layer, generally 4-8 weeks from planting, plots were hand weeded and a 1\" thick layer of mulch applied to designated treatments. Weeding continued throughout the summer as needed, until it was deemed that weed competition would not interfere with crop plants and/or crop plant canopy cover effectively suppresse d weed proliferation. In AC treatments, hedgerows were coppiced usi ng a gas/oil powered pole saw. Hedgerows were coppiced from 1 to 3 times per summer when the leaves began to shade the adjacent crop plants. Prunings were applied by hand to adjacent cropped areas as a green manure. Harvest generally began in July, and was conducted by hand until crops stopped producing in late September/earl y October or were frost killed, when this description of the production cycle repeated. Production timing for CT treatments was si milar, with tillage conducted at the same time as spring roller crimping in the other treatments. Fert ilizer was applied by hand as a side dressing in bands adjacent to crop plants according to University of Georgia Cooperative Extensi on fertilizer guidelines for specific crops (Colditz, 1999; Kelley, 2001; Kelley, 2006) at the time of planting. The mowed fallow treatment was mowed 3-4 times per summer, as needed to keep grasses below approximately 12 inches high. 105Costs and Returns Production input costs for okra, hot peppers , and the corn/winter squash intercrop are presented in Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, respec tively. Budgeting periods for each crop begin with sowing of winter cover crop seed in October of the fall preceding the summer crop, and ends with the final ha rvest of the summer crop. While the site was not certified organic, it was organically managed and pr oduction costs reported here are for USDA Certified Organically-approved materials. Production inputs were calculated on a 1 acre scale. Estimates for AC treatments incl ude a 25 percent loss of production acreage to space occupied by hedgerows, which is equivalent to 134 beds (3' wide by 100' long) per acre with 3' wide hedgerows between. Spacing for OCT and CT treatments included 194 beds (3' wide by 100' long) beds, as these did not include hedgerows. Production Input Costs Organic crop and cover crop seed prices reflect 2007 costs from the average price of 3 common organic farming supply sources and did not include shipping and delivery charges. Estimates from the Georgia Ve getable Budgets (UGA Extension Applied and Agricultural Economics, 2008b) were used for conventional corn and okra seed costs. Conventional winter squash and pepper s eeds costs were the av erage price from 3 common farm supply sources for the region, as no data were found for the region with these figures. Compost costs were calculated from the only organically-approved compost provider in the state, and do not include deliver y costs, as these vary by distance from the supplier. Straw mulch costs are the price pa id local to the experimental site for an approximately 1 short ton round bale, de livery included. Costs for conventional 106fertilizers were based on estimates from th e Georgia Vegetable Budgets (UGA Extension Applied and Agricultural Economics, 2008b). Irrigation costs for each crop include annual purchase of drip tape, and a life span of mainline and connectors of 3 years. Connector and mainline costs were distributed evenly over 3 years. Irrigation system co sts for pumps and buried infrastructure are included in the Whole Farm Costs (Table 3.5). The straw mulch estimates are based on a pplication rates calculated from a 1 m2 sample taken from experimental plots that ha d mulch applied to a depth of approximately one inch. Extrapolating application rates from this sample size yielded application rates of approximately 1 short ton round bale per acre, which is an underestimate of mulch used over the entire experimental area, and is likely a function of variation in the depth of mulch applied and does not account for mulch lost in the spreading process. Thus, mulch costs reported here are probably less than actual costs. Tractor variable costs include fuel and lubrication, based on an average diesel price of $3.00 per US gallon and a fuel consum ption rate of 1 US gallon per hour for the 40 hp tractor. Irrigation pump costs were ba sed on an average gasoline price of $3.00 per US gallon and pump gasoline consumption ra te of 0.5 US gallons per hour (Jordan, personal communication ). Lubrication costs were calcul ated as a standard 15 percent of fuel costs (Born & Baier, 2005). The no-till ri g cost was the cost for the University of Georgia machine shop to fabricate a simple piece of equipment to perform the strip tillage, and does not reflect the cost of a no-till seed drill or other similar commercially available no-till equipment. 107Conventional herbicides a nd pesticides were not us ed in this work. The experimental farm is primarily an organica lly-managed, diversified operation with a large community outreach component, and it was deci ded that the use of agrochemicals for experimental purposes needed to be minimal and limited to nutrient application only. Therefore the production input budgets do not include the use of these chemicals, considered standard in conventional farming operations, and are underestimates of actual agrochemical costs. Under realistic pr oduction scenarios, the CT enterprise budget would include costs for herbicide, and labor and equipment costs for application. Labor Labor estimates were calculated from r ecorded labor for each experimental plot (25-45 m2) throughout the season, and the mean to tal labor value for each treatment converted to hours per acre estimates. Due to the experimental nature of this work, consistency from plot to plot was needed for all management practices. Practices such as compost and fertilizer application, hedgero w pruning application, seeding and weeding were all conducted by hand, and probably overestimate labor requirements for these practices on a production-oriente d farm. All harvesting was done by hand, with harvest labor calculated by the same method as non-harvest labor, described above. An hourly wage was not applied to all la bor costs, because the labor supply on organic farms in the region is highly variable , consisting of family, paid farm workers, interns and volunteer labor unde r a heterogeneous blend of compensation schemes (Estes, Kleese & Lauffer, 2003). Instead, it was deci ded to only apply a dollar value to hired labor when it would be required for each treatment. In their 2004 National Organic Farmers Survey, the Organic Farming Res earch Foundation estimated that 67% of 108organic farmers worked on the farm full-time, with an average of 2 full-time, year-round household employees. Additional costs for hourly hired labor wages were included in the enterprise budgets when labor for any 7 day period exceeded 80 hours (40 hours per week per household employee). No wage la bor data were found for workers on organic farms in Georgia, but wage data from su rveys of organic farms in Wisconsin and California estimated wages ranging fr om $3.32 - $14.90 per hour and $9.00 - $11.25 per hour, respectively. Based on these ranges, a wage of $10.00 per hour was applied to hired labor. Labor and produc tion costs do not include mark eting costs or associated labor. For production practices requiring trac tor work, a 15 minute set up time was assigned per task (the average from this study) to allot for time spent changing equipment, refueling, etc., and spread ev enly across all treatme nts that task was performed upon. Whole Farm Equipment Costs Equipment costs for items used throu ghout the farm are reported in Table 3.4. These include tractor and irrigation infrastructu re, which have a strai ght line depreciation and 10% salvage value. Fuel and lubrication required for production of specific crops is accounted for in the production input costs for each crop. A number of operations were performed by hand, as previously discussed. Whole farm costs accounted for here include only equipment used in the production methods outlined, and not common equipment costs that are part of standard operations in the region, such as seeders, manure spreaders, and storage buildings. 109Yields and Returns As was previously discussed, budgetary information for organic, conservation tillage systems is sparse. Some yield and production cost information exists for either organic production or conservation tillage, but rarely the two. A few notable exceptions were found that used living mulches interplant ed with vegetables in Biazzo & Masiunas, 2000; Carrera et al., 2005). While yields from the field experiment were not statistically differe nt between treatments in each year (Chapter 2), differences in re turns between treatments, discussed further below, may be significant to the farmer. Okra yields averaged 3395 lbs/acre, cat egorized as \"worst production category\" yield estimates for conventional okra producti on by University of Georgia Extension Agriculture Economics Department budget es timates (Flanders & Flanders, 2001). However, yields were comparable to organically-managed, conservation tillage experimental yields the Midwest (Biazzo & Masiunas, 2000). Hot pepper yields averaged 4187 lbs/acre, and were comparable to yields in some of Biazzo and Masiunas (2000) treatments in the same study. It should be noted that the yields from the conservation tillage, living mulch treatments in Biazzo and Masiunas (2000) work were 1/5th to \u00bd of the yields of their conventiona l treatments. In our work, conventional treatments generally had lower yields than th e organic treatments. This is probably due to the highly degraded soil on the site, wh ich had been abandoned for conventional agricultural purposed due to lack of productivity. Experimental corn yields from our work averaged 13 bushels per acre, and were a fraction of estimates for strip tilled conventional yields (UGA Department of Ag ricultural Economics 2008a). According to 110the UGA Agricultural Economics Department yi eld estimates, yields for strip tilled conventional corn average 185/bu acre for a co rn monoculture in S outh Georgia. This would equate to yields of 92.5 bushels per acre when reducing the production space by \u00bd to account for the area in which winter squash was grown. The low yields of corn can be attributed to low germination in all treatment s, due in part to the severe drought in 2007, as well as the use of an heirloom corn variet y that was not particularly drought tolerant. Table 3.5 presents a modification of yield da ta for the corn crop, based on complete germination, using the kernel weights from th e existing yields to modify the bushels per acre estimates. No studies including winter squash or hot pepper yields for either conservation tillage or organic produc tion were found for the southeast. All yield data in this study must be interpreted in the light of the degraded soils in which the experiment took place. Frequentl y, yield estimates in enterprise budgets are from agricultural experiment stations where the soil is often the best in the region, which may be misleading to farmers seeking to duplicat e these results. The soils in this study were chosen because they were the worst soil s on the experimental farm to test these techniques, and are characteris tic, if not worse, than th e sandy, clay loams commonly found in the region. Organic crop prices for okra, hot peppers and winter squash were determined from an average of prices from 3 organic farmers in the region and the average market price at a certified organic market in Atlanta, GA, the nearest major metropolitan market. The organic corn price was an average va lue for #2 yellow corn from 9 nationwide markets reported on the New Farm Organic Price Index (New Farm, 2008) for the 2007 crop. Conventional prices for okra and corn we re prices reported in the University of 111Georgia Vegetable Budgets (UGA Extensi on and Applied Agricultural Economics 2008b). No prices for conventional winter squash or hot peppers were found for the state. Instead, winter squash and cayenne pepper prices from the Louisiana State University Research and Extension Ag Ce nter were used (LSU AgCenter 2006). Organic okra and hot pepper production had the highest net returns to management, although the harvest labor require ments for these crops were 10 to 15 fold higher than the corn/winter squash inte rcrop. The okra produc tion did not require additional hired labor for any of the treatments, but the hot peppers did require additional harvest labor. Previous alley cropping resear ch in the region has suggested that due to higher labor and land requirements, alley croppi ng systems may be best suited for high value horticultural and/or organic crops (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998). However, the labor associated with hedgerow manageme nt was not as great as was expected, and was spread throughout the season, averaging 12 hours per pruning event per acre. This time includes application of residues, and is probably overestimates of actual labor requirement due to experimental design necessity. Discussion Both the overall net returns to manageme nt and the returns to management per hour of labor were higher for okra and hot peppers, which are high-yielding, labor intensive crops with significant organic pri ce premiums. However, if these labor needs can be met, these two crops had much greater returns to management per hour of labor than crops with lower labor requirements, justifying the expense of hired labor when required. In general, the yields between tr eatments within each cropping system did not show a clear trend favoring one set of manage ment practices over another for all years. 112This is in part due to vari ation in the yield data from th e field study, which did not differ significantly by treatment. It is also due to the varying responses of the individual crops to each treatment. For example, okra, corn and winter squash yields in the mulched treatments were higher than non-mulched treatm ents receiving the same level of compost application. These crops pr obably benefited from the in creased moisture under the mulch, which created a more favorable micr oclimate for root growth and suppressed weeds. However, the hot peppers had th e opposite response to mu lch. The increased moisture under the mulch led to an outbreak of Fusarium wilt in the pepper plants in mulched treatments, decreasing yields. This indicates that mulch in addition to the roller crimper killed cover crop residue may be best suited for dry years a nd for plants that are not susceptible to soil borne pathogens. The effects of compost additions are less clear cut, were highly variable, and non- additive. That is, 20 tons/ acre of compost did not yiel d consistently higher than treatments with 10 tons/acre or no compos t. This indicates that the ecological interactions in restorative agroecosystems on degraded soils are more complicated than what would be predicted by simply adding mo re amendments. Generally, the organic treatments had higher yields than the c onventional treatment. When accounting for organic price premiums, the organic treatments had consistently hi gher net returns to management than the conventional treatment. In 2005 and 2006, mulched AC treatments required 23% less labor than non- mulched treatments, due to effective weed suppression. In 2007, mulch only reduced labor requirements by 4%, due to a lack of w eed pressure in the extreme drought. All of the OST treatments were mulched, so there is no way to compare labor in mulched versus 113non-mulched labor requirements in this system. Mulches are frequently used in organic farming systems to suppress weeds, control er osion, retain soil moistu re and to build soil organic matter through the decomposition of th e mulch. However, the results of soil carbon and nitrogen analysis in the field study in dicate the latter may not always be true. Applications of mulch in the AC and OS T treatments resulted in significantly lower soil carbon levels than non-mulched treatments receiving the same level of compost. Carbon comprises about 58 percent of soil organic matter, and is often a more accurate measure of soil organic matter than direct assays, esp ecially in clay soils (Nelson & Sommers, 1996). In the hot, subtropical climate of the Southeastern US, evapotranspiration rates in the summer are high and soils dry down rapidly, decreasing biological function. Increased soil moisture under mulch could have led to increased soil food web activity and root growth, and thus higher decomposition rates of organic amendments and soil organic matter (see Chap ter 2 for complete results and further discussion). Conclusions Organic farming and other ecological a pproaches to agriculture employ long- term, systems approaches to nutrient and pe st management. These systems frequently incorporate the use of winter cover crops, fallow periods and organic amendments to increase soil organic matter and thus incr ease the long-term pr oductive capacity of the soil (Altieri, 1995). The goal of this work was to gain a general understanding of the economic costs and benefits of experimental agroecosystems designed to restore highly degraded soils in the Georgia Piedmont using a suite of these techni ques in combination. 114The organic conservation tillage treatments had less tractor and labor costs than the conventional treatment. The winter cove r crop residue layer suppressed weeds for up to 4-6 weeks, but was not enough to eff ectively suppress weeds throughout the season and thus required additional weeding la bor. Application of mulches effectively suppressed weeds and reduced weeding labor requirements by an average of 23% during non-drought years. The yield responses to mu lch were higher in crops benefiting from increased moisture under the mulch, but led to increased soil-borne pathogen damage in a crop highly susceptible to this pressure. However, the in creased moisture conservation under the mulch led to higher decomposition rates and reduced al ready depleted soil carbon levels. This indicates that the short te rm potential benefits of mulches in reducing labor and increasing yields c ould compromise long term so il restoration in organic, conservation tillage systems with high deco mposition rates. The effects of compost applications in yields and net returns to ma nagement were highly variable and did not demonstrate a clear advantage of any one level of compost application. Yields in all experimental treatments were lower than in conventional studies found for the region. This was expected due to the nature of the soil at the study site, which had been abandoned for conventi onal row crop production due to lack of productivity for a number of years. Howeve r, returns on high-labor, organic crops were over $15,000 per acre in some treatments. Th is is evidence that organic, conservation tillage systems can restore so il productivity and command hi gh returns per acre, allowing land to remain in cultivation wh ile improving soil quality. 115Acknowledgements This work was funded by a United States Department of Agriculture Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program grant.

Hendrix and C.F. Jordan. To be submitted to Ecological Modelling. 124Abstract In the Southeastern United States, a co mbination of climatic and management factors have severely degraded soils over th e past 200 years. This model simulates the long term soil organic matter dynamics of an agroecosystem designed to restore soil organic matter, and is based on a 3-year fi eld study in the Geor gia Piedmont. Model residue and soil organic matter dynamics are structured after the DAYCENT version of the CENTURY model. A simplified plant gr owth model simulates a 3-year summer vegetable crop/winter cover cr op rotation. The mode l fit the 3-year validation data for slow C and passive C pools, but overestim ated active C and vegetation production in some treatments. Simulation runs for 15 y ears and 30 years demonstrated increases in active and slow organic matte r C in all treatments. Simulation values are likely overestimates of attainable C, as soil C was allowed to in crease without limit. Model trends indicate that applicat ion of organic amendments can increase soil organic matter in both the short and intermediate-term, and th at alley cropping with leguminous hedgerows can sequester slow C to a greater extent than organic management and conservation tillage alone. The model provides a framewor k for exploring the potential for organic, conservation tillage and agrofore stry-based agroecosystems to restore soil organic matter on degraded lands. Introduction The Georgia Piedmont, like much of the S outheastern United States, has a warm, wet climate, with high decomposition rates. Centuries of row cropping in this climate have resulted in heavily w eathered and eroded soils, which now often lack O and A horizons, any appreciable organic matter or available nutrients (Rhoades, Nissen & 125Kettler, 1998). In these degraded systems, agricultural production is dependent on external inputs to meet crop nutrient demand, of ten in the form of inorganic fertilizers. The cycle of fertilization with inorganic nutrients increases ve getation production, but without addition of organic amendments, wi ll further decrease soil organic matter, creating a negative feedback l oop that continues to depauper soil food webs and decrease soil productivity. This is a production cycle th at keeps soil organic matter at levels that are too low to support crop produc tion without substantial inor ganic subsidies. In these soils, restoration and maintenance of soil organic matter is necessary for agriculture that is not dependent on energy intensive inputs (Nguyen & Klinnert, 2001 ; Jordan, 2004). Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a \"keyston e\" role in soils (Swift, Izac & van Noordwijk, 2004). Although it comprises only 1-5% of soil by volume, it is often the single most important driver of plant pr oductivity (Paul & Clark, 1996). SOM plays important roles in nutrient retention and release, in bu ffering erosion, herbicide and pesticide runoffs, in soil structure and aggreg ation, and in water stor age and infiltration (Paustian, 1994; Paul & Clark, 1996; Magdoff, 2 007). More recently, the role of SOM as a sink for carbon has been an important issue in the debate on global warming (Lal, 2004; Lal, 2006). Furthermore, soil organic matter both consists of and is the resource for heterotrophic soil food webs. A number of practices have been prov en effective in increasing soil organic matter in Southeastern U.S. soils. Conserva tion tillage techniques, especially no-till practices, have proven effective in conservi ng and restoring SOM stocks in the region (Langdale et al., 1992; West et al., 1992; Tyler et al., 1994 ; Hendrix, Franzluebbers & McCracken, 1998). Application of winter co ver crops or other improved fallows have 126also been successful in sequestering soil orga nic matter in the Geor gia Piedmont (Sainju, Singh & Whitehead, 2002; Sainju, Whitehead & Singh, 2005). Among other practices, agroforestry techniques have been suggested to tighten nutrient cycles and produce organic amendments in situ (Matta-Machado & Jordan, 1995; Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998; Green, 2001; Jordan, 2004; Reichlen, 2004). Use of organic amendments, such as poultry litter has proven effective in the re gion (Paudel, Lohr & Cabrera, 2007), and compost application has also been sugge sted (Jarecki & Lal, 2003; Lal, 2004). However, organic matter formation, like many other soil processes, functions on long-term ecological timelines. Restor ation of soil organic matter by altering management practices is usually only eviden t experimentally over extended time periods of several years and perhaps decades (Christe nsen & Johnston, 1995). An approach that could give insight to the l ong-term effects of suggested management practices without decades or longer of study would be useful ecologically, as well as informative to long- term management decisions and technology adoption. A modeling approach not only elucidates mechanisms driving long-te rm SOM dynamics, it can aid in honing experimental production practi ces and increasing efficien cy of field experiments (Jorgensen & Bendoricchio, 2001). As reviewed by Powlson (1996), a numb er of soil organic matter models accurately reflect short and long-term soil or ganic matter dynamics (e.g. Molina et al., 1983; Parton et al., 1987; e.g. Godwin & J ones, 1991). The CENTURY model (Parton et al., 1987) was chosen for the soil organic matter submodel in this work because it has been used to simulate C accumulation duri ng soil formation and is being increasingly used in agroecosystem modeling (e.g. CENT URY version 4.0, (Gijsman et al., 2002)). 127This model was created to complement a 3-y ear field experiment in which treatments were designed to restore soil organic matter using a combination of best known management practice and suggestions from pr evious work in the region (for complete experimental design and rationale , see Chapter 2). The goal of this modeling effort is to gain mechanistic insight into short-term SO M dynamics and predict trends in organic matter dynamics beyond the experimental timelin e. Techniques employed in the field experiment include use of conservation tilla ge (strip tillage), winter cover crops, application of organic amendments and orga nic management, and alley cropping. In the latter technique, leguminous shrubs are planted in hedgerows between crop plants, pruned periodically, and the prunings applied to adjacent crop plants as a green manure (Kang, Reynolds & Attra-Krah, 1990). Alley cr opping techniques were used to see if a perennial legume was more effective in addi ng C to the soil than an annual legume alone; mulch was used to evaluate whether they aided in weed suppression and the resulting inputs on the soil carbon pool; composts were used to see if there were additional benefits to crop growth and soil C. Experimental trea tments are described in further detail below. Materials and Methods Site description The study site is located in the Georgi a Piedmont, near Athens, Georgia USA (33\u00b057'N lat. 83\u00b019'W long). The soil is cl assified Pacolet sandy clay loam (kaolinitic, thermic typic hapludults). Th e soil of the experimental plots was highly eroded, and consisted only of a B horizon, h eavily compacted red clay. The site was chosen to test the field expe riment methods on an extremely poor soil. The site is on a 100-acre historic farm that has been in cultivation since 1864, with cotton, cattle, 128sorghum and soybeans grown on the site until 1993. At this time, intense cultivation ceased, and the site began to be managed as a mowed fallow of pasture grasses and weeds. In 2001, an alley cropping (AC) syst em was planted along an east facing slope on the site, with hedgerows of a perennial legume, Albizia julibrissin spaced 5 m apart. Between 2001 and 2004, the alley ways were plan ted with a variety of vegetables and cotton, to test various cultivation techniques. In the fall of 2005, this work was initiated, beginning with the sowing of winter cover cr ops and the beginning of a 3-year vegetable crop rotation. A conventionally tilled, chemi cally fertilized treatment was added to an area adjacent to the alley cropping system. In fall 2006, an additional cropping system of organic, strip-tilled plots (OST) without alle y cropping were added to the experiment in an area adjacent to the alley cropping system to determine if the use of leguminous hedgerows has an effect on soil organic matter dynamics beyond that of organic management and conservation tillage. Treatment Description The 7 treatments modeled are a subset of treatments from the field experiment, and consist of combinations of alley cropping (AC) , organi c strip tillage without alley cropping (OST), compost and/or mulch appli cations, and an inorganically fertilized (conventional, CT) treatment. All treatment s except the conventional were organically managed and cultivated using strip tillage. Th e field experiment cons isted of 4 replicates of each of the following treatments: AC1: organically managed, alley cropping AC2: AC1 + straw mulch (applied upon su mmer weed emergence, approx. 2.5 cm thick) 129AC3: AC1 + compost (10 tons/acre, applie d in to planting) mulch AC4: AC1 + compost + conventional tillage a nd inorganic fertilizer All organic treatments were sown in a winter cover crop mix of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum ), Austrian ( Secale cereale ), which was mechanically killed with a modified commercial grass roller (roller crimper) in mid-April of each year, and prepared for planting with strip tillage. Compost and straw mulch were applied by hand in the respective treatments. Albizia hedgerows were pruned 1-3 times each summer to a heig ht of 1 m when they began to shade crop plants. Prunings were evenly applied to the cultivated plots in adjacent alleys. Conventional treatments were fertilized by si de-dressing with inorga nic fertilizers in bands adjacent to crop rows within 10 cm of crop plants. Fert ilizer was applied according to the University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Cooperative Extension guidelines for N requirements for each crop (Colditz, 1999; Kelley, 2001; Kelley, 2006). All treatme nts were hand weeded throughout the summer, and weeds left in place. Summe r crops were mechanically killed in all treatments using the roller crimper prior to broadcast sowing of winter cover crops. The 3-year summer vegetable crop rotation consisted of okra ), Analysis Soils were sampled from a 0-20 cm depth in mid-April of 2005, 2006 and 2007. Three soil cores were randomly taken from th e middle portion of each plot and bulked for a single analysis. Bulk density samples from 4 plots within each cropping system were collected in spring 2007 to dete rmine total soil mass for each modeling block (1 m x 1 m x 20 cm depth). Soil total organic carbon (TOC) was determined by acidifying air dry soil samples with 3 applications of 30% HCl over 3 days, with samples stored in a 50 \u00b0C oven between acid applicati ons. Soil samples were analyzed by micro-Dumas combustion assay at the University of Georgi a Analytical Chemistry Laboratory (ACL). Immediately upon returning to the lab, soils were passe d through a 2-mm sieve and assayed for microbial biomass by chlorofo rm extraction (Vance, Brookes & Jenkinson, 1987). Non-fumigated sa mples were extracted in 0.5 M K 2SO 4 within 24 hours of collection. TOC was determined for microbial bioma ss by continuous flow colorimetry at the University of Georgia ACL. Light fraction C was determined using a modification of Greenland and Ford's (1964) method, reviewed by Motavalli et al. (1994). One g of air-dried soil was suspended in 20 mL sodium polytungstate (1.85 g/cm3 density) and sonicated at 5.57 Js-1 in 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes, using a Branson Model 200 soni cator with an 3-mm wide tip, submerged 3 cm into the solution. The sonication probe was encased in a 10 cm diameter x 15 cm deep polystyrene foam in sulator with a lid. The output energy was calculated according to method outlined by North (1976), measuring the temperature change of a known mass of water for a specifi ed amount of time after the displacement method of Roscoe et al. (2000), using 50 g wa ter for 60 seconds. After dispersion, soil 131suspensions were evacuated under 70 kPa suc tion for 10 minutes, and allowed to settle for 12 hours at room temperature. The light fraction material on the surface of the suspension was aspirated onto glass fiber filters and rinsed with deionized water. Filters and samples were then dried in a 50 \u00b0C drying oven, weighed to obtain mass of the light fraction, and sample material carefully scra ped into silver capsules. Samples were acidified with 30% HCl to remove inorgani c C, and analyzed for TOC by micro-Dumas combustion assay at the Univer sity of Georgia ACL. Above and below ground vegetation biom ass was collected each spring and fall prior to roller crimping, w ith the exception of spring 2005, when only above ground vegetation was sampled. Vegetable crop yields were collected throughout the growing season. Vegetation samples were dried in a 50 \u00b0C drying oven and sorted into weed and crop biomass, and mass recorded for each group. Crop fruits were separated from vegetative biomass for separate analysis. So rted vegetative portions were compiled into above and below-ground components, a nd passed through a 2-mm Wiley Mill to homogenize the sample. Albizia and straw mulch were sampled in 1 m2 biomass samples from each plot within 24 hours afte r application and dried in a 50 \u00b0C drying oven. Compost was sampled at the time of applica tion. Subsamples of homogenized vegetation samples were ball milled on a Spex mill and analyzed for C and N by micro-Dumas combustion assay at the University of Georgi a ACL. Fiber analysis was conducted on vegetation roots, shoots, Albizia and straw mulch by sequen tial detergent digestion (Vansoest, 1963) on an ANKOM 200 fiber an alyzer to obtain lignin content. 132Model description The model was developed using Stella 8.1 software. The model scale is 1 m2 to a depth of 20 cm. The model consists of a soil organic matter pools based on the DAYCENT version of the CENTURY model a nd a simple plant production submodel. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools are stoichiometrically linked, with the N mineralized from residue decomposition and inter-SOM pool transfers driving a simple plant growth model. Organic amendments , including compost, straw mulch and alley cropping residue are used as residue inputs to the model. The model uses DAYCENT temperature and moisture factors to drive de composition and plant gr owth (Parton et al., 1994). The SOM submodel partitions SOM into active, slow and passive pools, with residence times of less than 1 year, 10's of years, and 100's to 1000's of years, respectively (Figure 4.1). Th e active carbon pool consists of soil microbial biomass and soluble carbon. The slow pool consists of lignified plant material and metabolically resistant byproducts processed by the active pool. The passive pool consists of highly recalcitrant products of micr obial metabolism, including humi fied materials. All pools decay by first order rate kinetics as a func tion of carbon content, soil temperature and moisture factors according to the follow ing general equation supplied by Parton et al.(1987): dC i/dt = K i * M d *Td *C i, where C i = Carbon in the pool i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 for structur al and metabolic surface litter, structural and metabolic soil litter, and active, slow and passive soil fractions, respectively. The model uses the DAYCENT ve rsion of decay rates and temperature and 133moisture factors (Part on et al., 1994), where K i = the maximum decomposition rate (per day) for the ith state variable, and where K 1 = 0.0107, K 2 = 0.0405, K 3 = 0.0132, K 4 = 0.0164, K 5 = 0.02, K 6 = 0.0005, and K 7 = 0.000012; M d = the moisture effect on decomposition, as a function of the ratio of daily precipitation (PPT ), irrigation (Irrig) and stored water to potential evapot ranspiration (PET) (Figure 4.2); and T d = the effect of average daily soil temperature on decompos ition in the 0-20 cm soil layer (Figure 4.3). The maximum decay rates are used in th e above equation for decay of metabolic surface and soil litter, and for slow and passi ve soil organic matter pools. The active pool maximum decay rate (K 5) is modified by a texture factor to account for the protection of organic from decomposition by clay c ontent. The structural surface (K 1) and soil (K 3) decay rates are modified by lignin content of plant residues to account for resistance of lignin to decomposition. Litter is partitioned into metabolic and structural pools as a function of the lignin to nitr ogen ratio (Figure 4.1). Nitrogen flows are stoichiometrically linked carbon flows in the surface and soil structural, active, slow and passive pools. C/N ratios for the pools are: Surface and soil structural pool: 150 Active soil organic matter: 8 Slow soil organic matter: 11 Passive soil organic matter: 11 The metabolic surface and soil pools vary acco rding to the nutrient content of the inputs. Excess nitrogen is mineralized from the transfer of N from a pool with a lower C/N ratio to a pool with a higher C/N rati o. The mineral N enters a mineral N pool, 134where it is made available for reuptake to the SOM pools via immobilization or for plant growth. N is immobilized with the breakdown of structural litter. The water submodel is greatly simplified from that of the CENTURY model, and consists of a single 0-20 cm soil depth, in which water is considered uniformly distributed throughout. Stored water is the sum of rainfall and irrigation minus potential evapotranspiration. The temperature factor is a function of soil temperature, with a maximum effect at 35 \u00b0C. The plant growth submodel consists of a series of simplified crop growth curve functions, modified by nitrogen avai lability, a temperature factor, T g (Figure 4.4), and a moisture factor, M g (Figure 4.5). The growth curv es follow the general exponential growth model provided by Hunt (1982): W = a*(1-be-ct) Where W is the plant biomass at any tim e (t); a = maximum plant biomass, b = initial plant biomass; and c = the inherent cap acity for plant growth. The constant, c, was determined for each growth curve from the tr eatment mean with the highest biomass in the field. Plant growth curves cycle on a 3-ye ar crop rotation and ar e detailed in Table 4.1. Growth is modeled according to the first order equation: Ncrop * VU daily * T g * M g * 0.013 Where N crop is the nitrogen available from th e mineral N pool after immobilization N uptake from the SOM pools, VU daily is the daily vegetation biomass growth, 0.013 is a mean biomass N content, and T g and M g are temperature and moisture factors affecting 135plant growth according to CENTURY Version 4.0 (the Agroecosystem version). M g reduces crop growth according to the graphical function in Figure 4.4 when: (Precipitation + irrigation + stored water)/Potential evapotranspiration < 0.8. Tg relates soil temperature to relative plant production according to a Poisson density function (Figure 4.5) with a maximum soil temperature of 45 \u00b0C and an optimum soil temperature of 30 \u00b0C (Metherell et al., 1993). Plant biomass N is partitioned into ro ot, shoot and yield pools. Plant C is calculated by multiplying plant biomass N in each pool by the C/N ratio of the plant material. Plants roots and shoots enter the soil and surface residue pools when they are killed by the roller crimper at the end of the growing season. Plant yields are permanently exported from the system. Results Model Calibration and Validation Field data from treatment AC3 were used to calibrate the model with three years of soil and vegetation data. SOM pools were initialized from spring 2005 data. Active C was the sum of microbial biomass C and so luble C, which was obtained from the non- fumigated K 2SO 4 extraction, according to the method out lined by Motavalli et al. (1994). Masses of the light fraction C isolated from the soil sonication were much greater than CENTURY model structure would predict. Although the method was followed carefully, it is possible the sonication was conducted at a higher energy output or that the high clay content of the soil was bound to the aspirated material and led to higher light fraction values. It was impossible to determine the s ource of the error, and so the light fraction data was considered invalid. Instead, the passive pool was assumed to be 50% of the 136TOC for the soil sample, and the slow pool th e difference between the soil TOC and the sum of the passive and active pools. In itial values for N pools were based on stoichiometry of the pools, described above. Daily soil temperature (10 cm depth m ean daily temperatur e), precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data were obtained from the USDA-ARS J. Phil Campbell Natural Resource Conservation Center in Watkinsville, GA, approximately 15 km from the study site. Irrig ation dates and amount of tim e irrigated were recorded throughout the field experiment. Irrigation input volume was estimated from drip tape specifications from the manufacturer (DripWorks & Everliner, 2008). Residue pools were initialized with sp ring 2005 vegetation sample data. Inputs included root and shoot C, N a nd lignin content. After this initial input, crop growth is the output of the plant growth submodel. The fractions of growth partitioned to root, shoot, yield, and lignin content are specifi c to each treatment a nd are based on mean values for the treatment from the vegetation data collected each season. The date at which plant growth enters th e residue pools at the end of the winter and summer growing seasons was determined by the date of rolle r crimping in the fiel d study. The calibration data set for fixed parameters appears in Table 4.2. A 2-level Taguchi sensitivity analysis (Clemson et al., 1995) was conducted on 15 fixed model parameters with level 1 and level 2 set at 10% above and below the calibration value, respectively. This technique obtains the average effect of a parameter on the model using orthogonal arrays to assign parameter values in the sensitivity runs, and increases the efficiency of the sensitivity analysis. The parameters and level values are listed in Table 4.3. Differences between th e values of level 1 and level 2 on the final 137day of the validation run (day 839) were tested for significance in each parameter on active soil C, slow soil C, passive soil C and cumulative vegetation production using PROC ANOVA in SAS Version 9.1 (SAS Ins titute Inc.). Model parameters with significant differences between the average effe cts of level 1 and level 2 at a p<0.10 were K2 (the metabolic surface li tter decay rate, p<0.0218), K 5 (the active pool maximum decay rate, p<0.0900) and the initial winter co ver crop carbon input (p<0.0867). P-values for all treatments are listed in Table 4.4. Model fit was analyzed using lack of f it (LOFIT) statistics te chnique described by Whitmore (Whitmore, 1991) in Microsoft Excel. This technique partitions error between observed and simulated values (the residual sum of squares, RSS) and error attributed to variation in the data (the sum of squares of pure error, SSE), where: LOFIT = RSS - SSE Mean Squared LOFIT LOFIT/ (degrees of freedom (df) RSS - df SSE.) Mean Square Error (MSE) = SSE/df SSE F = MSLOFIT/MSE If the resulting F-statistic was less th an the F value for significance at (df MSLOFIT, df SSE, 0.05), then the model was judged a good fit to the simulation results. That is, the observed and the simulation data were not significantly different. LOFIT statistics were conducted to assess model fit on to active C, slow C, passive C and vegetation shoot C. This vegetation metric was used because it c onstitutes the largest portion of the vegetation biomass pools, and is considered representative of results for 138total biomass. The model provided a good f it to the calibration da ta soil and vegetation data at a p-value < 0.05 (Table 4.5). The model was then validated using 3-year data sets from the existing treatments. Initial winter cover C, N and lignin, Albizia pruning C, N and lignin, and initial SOM pool C and N contents were specific to each validation, based on mean values from each treatment. Compost and straw mulch inputs were identical for al l treatments receiving these inputs. The fraction of plant growth attributed to roots, shoots and yields was identical for all validation runs. LOFIT st atistics were conducted on each treatment, as described above. Results for all tr eatments appear in Table 4.5. In general, the model provided a good fit to the data in the slow and passive soil C pools, and some active C pools, but did not accurate ly predict active so il C in treatments receiving straw mulch additions (AC2, AC4, and OST2). The model overestimated production in the AC4 and OST1 and OST2 treatments, all of which received straw mulch. Given that the model generally fitted the data in most parameters in all treatments except OST2, simulations be yond the time period of the validation were conducted for all treatments, but with care in interpreting results in areas where the model did not acceptably fit the data. Simulations Results The objective of this model was to determin e to what extent the treatments had an effect on soil organic matter dynamics over a time period longer than that of the accompanying 3-year field study (Chapter 2). To this end, simulations were run for 15- year and 30-year time periods by cycling w eather, organic input and crop rotation data used in the 3-year validation runs. The 30- year length was chosen as a maximum length 139of time relevant to management decisions, although further model development would be useful to assess when a stea dy state would be achieved. Soil organic matter pools Lack of fit statistics demonstrated that the model was not a good fit to the Active C data for AC2, AC4 and OST2 treatments, so simulation results must be interpreted conservatively. Since active C in these treatm ents followed general trends exhibited in the rest of the treatments, these treatments will be included in a general discussion of simulation trends. After ~5 years, active C begins to oscillate seasonally and increase steadily in all treatments (Figure 4.7). Treatme nts increased at least 2-fold after 15 years, and 10-fold over 30 years, with the exception of AC2 (Table 4.6). Treatments within the AC and OST systems generally increased in active soil C with incr easing organic inputs after 15 years, but trends are more idios yncratic after 30 years. The CT treatment increased in active C on par with AC treatments, but these results should be interpreted carefully, discussed further below. In all treatments, slow C d eclined during the first severa l years of the simulations, as outputs to the active C pool and respiration were greater than inputs from the active C and structural residue pools. The simulati ons show a trend that increasing quantity of organic inputs minimizes initial slow C dec lines and decreases the time needed for the system to begin sequestering slow soil C. Th e point at which treatments the treatments recovered from this initial decline and began to increase in slow C varied by treatment. AC treatments both declined to a lesser extent and recovered faster from initial declines than the OST treatments (Table 4.7). These results indicate that organic amendments can buffer declines in soil C stocks, and that woody input from AC systems is considerably 140more effective in buffering this change th an organic, conserva tion tillage alone. Simulation results for the CT treatments were similar to the AC treatments, likely due to active C changes driven by the large vegetation input s predicted by the model that were a poor fit to the field data. Passive soil C in all treatments change d very little, decr easing by 1% in all treatments after 15 years and by 0-2% over 30 years. Vegetation Dynamics Lack of fit results indicated that the model was not a good fit to vegetation dynamics and so comparing treatments would be an overstatement of the significance of the data. In general, all treatments increas ed in vegetation biomass production over time, with the bulk of plant growth occurring rapidly early in each cropping season, discussed further below. Discussion The lack of fit of the model to the active soil C validation data is likely due to the simplicity of the soil water submodel and the effect of the moisture factor on decomposition. The model assumes the wa ter content is homoge nous throughout the 0- 20 cm soil profile, and thus surf ace litter decays as a function of soil moisture at the 10 cm depth. This overestimates the decompositi on of surface litter, wh ich drives increases in active soil C. This discrepancy between field and simulated effects are probably more pronounced during the intense heat of the southern summer, when litter was observed to dry rapidly in the field and when warm soil temperatures increase decomposition rates. The sensitivity analysis supports this conclusi on, as it indicated that the model was highly sensitive to surface metabolic inputs. The model did not accurate ly predict slow and 141passive soil C dynamics in the OST2 treatment. The field total organic C field data were markedly lower in the second sampling date co mpared to the first, although values from both dates were exceptionally low in total soil C for unknown reasons. Vegetation production was driven by simp le, exponential plant growth curves, which simulated rapid growth early in each cropping season, likely overestimating early season growth. A more complex model with higher order exponential equations or a smoothing function would more closely simu late the characteristic sigmoid shape generally associated with plant growth curv es (Hunt, 1982). Despite the simplicity of the plant production submodel, simulated ve getation production was a good fit to the validation data in AC treatments 1-3 and OST1. The model overestimated vegetation production in AC4 and OST2, probably due to high simulated mineralization rates from decomposing straw mulch and rapid active C cy cling from the combination of mulch and compost inputs. While vegetation data for treatments AC4 a nd OS2 did not meet lack of fit criteria at p<0.05, they could still be considered reasonable approxi mations of the field data behavior. Lack of fit for the CT treatmen t, however, was exceptionally bad, probably due to the simplicity of the N-submodel. In this treatment, vegetation gr owth is a function of mineralization from spring weed fallow and crop residues and inorga nic fertilizer. The model grossly overestimated vegetation producti on, which likely drove rapid increases in the active C pool in this treatment. The m odel assumes there is no N-volatilization or leaching, and thus all N is available to the crop plant, which is a questionable assumption with the use of inorganic fer tilizer on degraded soil. 142While small discrepancies in active C a nd vegetation production had little effect in the short term (3 years) and did not affect other parameters in determining model fit, they can have cascading effects through the model as simulation time increases. When the model overestimates straw mulch decomposition, it not only overestimates active soil C, it increases N-mineralization from the metabolic residue and from the active soil pool to the other soil pools. This, in turn, increases plant growth, which then enters the residue pools when it is roller crimped, creating a pos itive feedback loop that can amplify errors in active and slow soil pools and plant pr oduction. Thus, simulation results from AC2, AC4 and OST2 must be interpreted with cau tion. However, all treatments did show the same general trends in increas ing active and slow soil C a nd plant productivity, bolstering the validity of these treatments, and is the ju stification for reporting th e results here. Care simply needs to be taken in comparing the effects between treatments. Comparing AC and OST treatments that vary only in whether they have Albizia hedgerow inputs demonstrates that alley croppin g can sequester slow soil C more rapidly and to a greater extent over 15 years than conservation tillage and organic farming practices alone. AC2 increased in slow so il C 16% more than OST1 after 15 years and began to increase in slow C 7 years before OST1. After 30 years, OST1 had a higher percentage increase in slow C from initial conditions than AC2, due to the very low initial slow C content in the OST1 rela tive to AC2. After 30 years, AC2 had a considerably higher slow soil C content on a g C/m 2 basis (Table 4.7). Similarly, AC4 increased in slow soil C 52% more than OS T2 over 15 years, and began to sequester carbon 2.12 years before OST2. However, after 30 years, OST2 had more slow soil C on a g/m2 basis than AC4. These differences are due in part to the additional woody inputs 143from Albizia residues in AC treatments, in which the lignified portion transfers directly to the slow soil C pool, and also in part to the low initial active C orga nic matter content in the OST treatments. Within AC and OST cropping systems, increasing the quantity of organic amendments increased slow C accumulation rates. The lack of change in passive C was exp ected as a model convention, as this pool is highly recalcitrant, with tu rnover times from 100's to 1000' s of years. Large changes in this pool would not be expected as a f unction of the model's de sign, but also indicate that the treatments are not sequestering soil C into the longest term storage pools. This may be an appropriate function of model convention, or it may not accurately reflect long-term organic matter dynamics in highly de graded systems receiving large quantities of organic inputs, discussed below. The CENTURY model specifies active C to comprise 3 to 5% of total organic carbon and slow C to comprise 36 to 50% (P arton et al., 1987). After the 30-year simulations, the active C in the AC and CT treatments were 8 to 12% of TOC. OST treatments increased from 6 to 10% of TOC after 15 years to 13 to 21% of TOC after 30 years. After 15 years, slow C comprised 55 to 64% of TOC in AC and CT treatments, and OST treatments were 51 to 60%. These tren ds in slow C were further exacerbated in the 30-year simulation. This deviation from the CENTUR Y model assumptions are a function of the model structure. The model allows soil C pools to increase without limit and does not correct for shifts in relative pool contribution to total soil organic matter. These structural issues would not have a large effect on va lidation results, which ran only 3 years, but over time the model begins to violate the assumptions implicit in the model structure. Future improvements in the m odel should determine whether these results are 144accurate, and indicative of a highly degraded system receiving and large amount of organic inputs or whether the model require s a correction factor needs to contain SOM pools in limits specified by the CENTURY mode l structure for extended simulation runs. Approach to \"capping\" the growth of organi c matter pools would be to use one of the methods described by Olson (Olson, 1963) to ad just the K constants in the model as function of the steady state maximum organic ma tter content, or to adjust each pool to the maximum attainable C estimated for soils in the region (Ingram & Fernandes, 2001). Despite the need for future model developmen t, the validation data sets and long-term simulations demonstrate that increasing plant productivity and biomass cycling on degraded soils through agricultural land uses can increase soil organic matter, especially labile and slow pools. An additional model assumption is worth noting. The 15-year and 30-year simulations assume the Albizia hedgerows will continue to pr oduce prunings at the rate of the first several years of treatme nt, or that replacement of dyi ng plants will be a gradual and the net effect of hedgerow death and replanting will be negligible on pruning biomass. The Albizia hedgerows at the field site have been growing for approximately 7 years, with occasional pruning prior to the field study, and show no signs of weakness or mortality. However, trees local to the study site are known to suffer from mimosa vascular wilt, a disease wi de spread throughout the sout heast caused by a species of Fusarium fungus. Most infected trees are killed within one year of infection (Goldsmith & Smith, 2004). Longevity of healthy shrubs managed as hedgerows is unknown. 145Conclusions Using the DAYCENT version of the CENT URY model and a simple vegetation production submodel, the model provided a good f it to the 3-year validation data in the slow soil C and passive soil C pools. Simula ted active soil C and vegetation production data fit well to observed validation data in treatments not receiving straw mulch additions. Long term simulations demonstrated increases in active and slow soil C pools and increased vegetation production in all treatments. Model results indicate that restoration of soil organic matter on degraded lands is sensitive to the quantity and quality of organic amendments. Simulation results demonstrated that alley cropping with legumi nous hedgerows can sequester soil C more rapidly and to a greater extent than organic, conservation tillage pr actices alone, but after 30 years these differences become less mark ed. While the model could benefit from more complete soil water and nitrogen submode ls, it provides a framework for exploring the potential for organic, cons ervation tillage and agroforestry-based agroecosystems to restore soil organic matt er on degraded lands.

Over the next decade, researchers unde rtook a series of studies in the region (Rhoades, Nissen & Kettler, 1998; Green, 2001; Reichlen, 2004), but even after this pioneering work, the question remained: Is alley cropping \"worth it\"? Furthermore, under what circumstances and to whom would it be valuable? This work was intended to address th ese questions by using a mature alley cropping system and best known management practices and recommendations from previous research to test to what extent \"ecologically ideal\" agroecosystems can restore soil organic matter (SOM) and to assess the eco nomic costs and benefits. The research design incorporated winter cover crops and conservation tillage to prevent soil erosion and increase soil N and C (e.g. West et al., 1992 ; Jarecki & Lal, 2003), mulch to evaluate whether it aided in weed suppression and the resulting inputs on the soil carbon pool, and compost to see if there were additional benefits to crop growth and soil C. These techniques were tested over a 3 year field experiment and complemented by a modeling approach to examine long-term SOM dyna mics, since changes in SOM induced by 164management practices may take extended time pe riods to see experimentally (Christensen & Johnston, 1995). Results from the 3 year field study indi cate that compost applications were necessary for the maintenance and restorati on of soil C in all cr opping systems studied (Chapter 2). Moreover, alley cropping with compost increased soil C, whereas organic strip tillage (OST) with the same quantity of compost application could, at best, maintain soil C. Results were similar for soil N. Model simulations indicate that all treatments would increase active and slow soil C over decadal time scales, but that over 15 years, AC treatments would increase sl ow soil carbon faster and to a greater extent than the OST treatments (Chapter 4). Over the course of 30 years, differences between treatments are less marked. Applications of mulch de creased non-harvest labor requirements by up to 23 percent (Chapter 3), but increased decomposition rates and summer below-ground biomass production. This led to le ss of an increase in soil C and N in mulched treatments compared to non-mulched treatments receivi ng the same application of compost. AC treatments had positive effects on long-term cycling soil characteristics, reducing bulk density and increasing soil pH. Yields were not significantly different by treatment in terms of biomass, but net economic returns were quite different by treat ment and crop. Labor-i ntensive, high-value organic crops had the highest net returns per acre (Chapter 3). During a drought year, like the one experienced in 2007, mulch was need ed for a positive net return, but in other years results depended on the crop variety's response to incr eased soil moisture under the mulch. Compost applications did not consistent ly affect yields or increase profitability over the 3 years. All organic treatments were more profitable than conventionally tilled 165(CT) treatments receiving inorganic fertilizer s. The results from this study indicate additional model development is needed to ev aluate the effects of these techniques over decadal time periods. Additional field studies of organic conservation tillage practices without the use of mulches would strengthen comparisons between organic conservation tillage and alley cropping systems. However, based on the results of this work, we can better engage questions of \"worth,\" rela tive to stakeholder perspective and land management goals. As a legacy of centuries of widespread conventional agriculture throughout the southeast, many farmers must decide how best to manage degraded soils. In situations where productive arable land is limited, alley cropping w ould not be practical, as hedgerows can occupy up to 25 percent of the cultivated area. Organic strip tillage without alley cropping can provide a productive and pr ofitable alternativ e. Conventional tillage was not productive or profitab le regardless of scale. When labor is limited , the use of mulch can decrease non- harvest labor. However, seas onal reduction in labor could decrease long-term soil orga nic carbon sequestration. In resource limited situations, alley cropping can provide in situ fertility and build more SOM than organic conservation tillage alone, potentially decreasing future inputs. In the short term, though, compost application was necessary to maintain soil carb on. When the main management goal is to decrease off-farm inputs , for example to counter rising tran sportation and fuel costs, alley cropping residues can provide up to 75 kg N/ha and increase soil pH, which may decrease the need for future application of agricultural lime. In cases where immediate profitability is paramount, planting of high value crops with significant organic price premiums is indicated, as is mulch applicati on in drought years. The use of compost had 166inconsistent effects on yields, but is generally considered a necessity in organic farming systems. In cases of degraded lands where restoration of SOM is the primary goal, the field study shows alley cropping increases so il C over 3 years and could increase slow carbon faster and to a greater extent than or ganic conservation tillage in the long term. While the mowed fallow treatment did increase soil C over 3 years, improved fallows, such as alley cropping and winter cover crops , would aid in future weed management. These easier to manage cultivated varieties can break weed cycles by out-competing volunteer vegetation. In practice, these cases are rarely mutually exclusive, so the combination of techniques appropria te for a given site will vary. The results of this research provide a dditional techniques an d perspectives for those working to repair the damage of land uses past. This work reports the effects of an agroecosystem that is as \"ecologically ideal \" as could be conceived, contributing to agroecological theory and resear ch synthesis. It makes a mu ch needed contribution to the small body of research in organic conserva tion tillage and the production economics of organic agriculture in the southeast. The multi-disciplinary framework applied to this work is an opening to dialogue to answering if these techniques ar e indeed \"worth it,\" over what timeline, and to whom.
