The exact causes are not completely understood, but emerging research suggests there could be a link between eczema and gut health. Some scientists think your [skin health and gut health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317022/) may be connected and that the makeup of your [gut microbiome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021588/) \u2014 the community of bugs that live in your gut \u2014 could play a part. Researchers have also looked at whether probiotics can help with eczema. Probiotics are microorganisms similar to the \"good\" bacteria in your microbiome and may improve your gut health. You can buy them as supplements, but they are also found naturally in certain fermented foods. At ZOE, we run the [largest nutrition and gut microbiome study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01183-8) of its kind and can help you find the best foods for your gut health. You can [take our free quiz](https://joinzoe.com/quiz) to learn more about how the ZOE program can help you. Below, we'll consider the possible links between your gut microbiome and the most common type of eczema, atopic dermatitis. We'll also look at whether boosting the health of your gut with probiotic foods and supplements can help. What is eczema and what causes it? Eczema is a condition that makes your skin dry, itchy, and cracked. It often starts [in babies or children](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32481318/) but can continue into adulthood. Eczema can cause severe discomfort and can significantly affect your quality of life. There are several different [forms of eczema](https://journals.co.za/doi/10.10520/EJC-10955e048d), which may have different triggers: Atopic dermatitis: This is the most common form of eczema. It is the result of an inappropriate response by your immune system and [may be linked to stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704139/). Your genes [impact your risk of developing it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399565/). Contact dermatitis: This is an inflammation caused by exposure to allergens or irritants, like soap or household cleaning products. Seborrheic dermatitis: This is a type of eczema that affects areas of your body with sebaceous glands, like your scalp. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be due to [particular yeast species](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/0201/p185.html)that live on your skin. Discoid dermatitis: This is a type of eczema that causes round patches of dry skin. Dyshidrotic dermatitis (or pompholyx): These are itchy blisters \u2014 usually on your hands and feet \u2014 that can be triggered by stress or allergy. Moisturizers, steroid creams, or antihistamines can help with symptoms like itching and dryness. Atopic dermatitis and gut health Atopic dermatitis is the [most common](https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/types-of-eczema/) type of eczema and the most researched. People with atopic dermatitis often also have a [food allergy](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30491-9/fulltext) and may experience flare-ups as a reaction to a specific food, such as [cow's milk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723735/). In recent years, scientists have also found multiple links between [atopic dermatitis and gut health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317022/). Your gut microbiome is involved in regulating your [immune system](https://joinzoe.com/learn/gut-health-and-immune-system), which may, in turn, affect [the health of your skin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01459/full). [Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021588/) have shown that people with atopic dermatitis may have a smaller range of gut bugs than those who don't have eczema. Many researchers agree that a more [diverse gut microbiome](https://joinzoe.com/post/gut-bacteria-diversity) with many beneficial bacteria is generally a healthier one. A small number of studies have found that people with atopic dermatitis are more likely to have higher or lower amounts of certain [types of bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6021588/) in their gut microbiomes. However, there's still a long way to go before scientists understand exactly how much of an influence the composition of your gut microbiome might have on eczema. Can probiotic supplements help with eczema? If your gut health is linked to the health of your skin, could probiotic supplements help with eczema by boosting your gut microbiome? [One study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pai.13018) found that infants who took probiotics called Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis every day for 6 months were less than half as likely to develop eczema during that time as those who didn't take the supplements. A review of [seven other studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/impact-of-maternal-supplementation-with-probiotics-during-pregnancy-on-atopic-eczema-in-childhood-a-metaanalysis/0DD5C549F687188AC97E9E1EB10AEEE9) found that children whose mothers took Lactobacilli probiotics during pregnancy had a lower chance of developing eczema between the ages of 2 and 7. However, for those who took a blend of other types of probiotic bacteria, there was no less risk of developing eczema. These findings suggest that probiotic supplements may reduce the risk of developing eczema if taken at a young age. However, it is questionable whether probiotics can help if you already have eczema symptoms. A review of [39 clinical studies](https://www.cochrane.org/CD006135/SKIN_probiotics-treating-eczema) involving people who already had eczema found that the probiotics they took made little or no difference to symptoms such as itching or loss of sleep, and it led to no improvements in their overall quality of life. Can foods that boost gut health help with eczema? Fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, miso, sauerkraut, and aged cheeses \u2014 like cheddar and parmesan \u2014 are naturally rich in probiotics that [are good for your gut health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics-what-you-need-to-know). Eating significant amounts of fermented foods appears to be linked to a lower risk of having eczema as an adult. One study with almost 10,000 participants from Korea found that adults who ate a diet high in fermented foods were [significantly less likely](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271531715002912) to have eczema. However, it's worth noting that this meant eating fermented foods an average of at least three times a day over the course of a month. Supporting these results, [a study in Japan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24759553/) showed that the babies of mothers who had eaten natto (fermented soybeans) every day during their pregnancy were less likely to have developed eczema than those whose mothers ate it only two to three times per week. How to eat to improve your gut health ZOE's scientific co-founder Prof. Tim Spector recommends [eating a small amount of probiotic-rich foods each day](https://joinzoe.com/post/tim-spector-gut-tips) to help maintain your general gut health. You should also eat plenty of plants containing fiber, called [prebiotics](https://joinzoe.com/learn/how-to-improve-gut-health), which feed your gut microbes and help them to thrive. Examples of prebiotic foods include onions, bananas, asparagus, legumes like chickpeas and lentils, and whole grains. These are broad guidelines everyone can follow, but at ZOE, we know that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to gut health and nutrition. Our scientists identified [15 \"good\" gut bugs](https://joinzoe.com/post/good-bugs-bad-bugs) linked to markers of better health and 15 \"bad\" bugs that are indicators of worse health. With the [ZOE at-home test](https://joinzoe.com/how-it-works), you find out which of these \"good\" and \"bad\" bugs live in your gut. The test also analyzes your unique blood sugar and blood fat responses, which are all important aspects of your [metabolic health](https://joinzoe.com/learn/what-is-metabolic-health). The ZOE program gives you personalized nutrition advice to help you pick the best foods for your gut and your overall health.

The specific causes of eczema are unknown, but emerging research suggests that some forms may be linked to gut health. Studies have found that people with atopic dermatitis \u2014 the most common form of eczema \u2014 may have a less diverse gut microbiome than people who don't have eczema. Research also suggests that the presence of specific types of gut microbes is associated with eczema. Adults who eat a diet very high in fermented foods containing natural probiotics may be less likely to have eczema. Eating fermented foods every day while pregnant could significantly reduce the chance of your child developing eczema. Taking probiotic supplements containing Lactobacilli bacteria regularly during pregnancy, or as an infant, might also lower the risk of eczema in children. However, probiotic supplements have little or no effect on symptoms in people who already have eczema. With the [ZOE program](https://joinzoe.com/how-it-works), you can find the best foods to improve your gut health.
