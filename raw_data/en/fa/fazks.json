With great excitement, a touch of trepidation And with deep gratitude I give thanks To all the scientists who toiled day and night So that I might receive this tiny vaccination That will protect me and all souls around this world. With the pandemic still raging I am blessed to do my part to defeat it. Let this be the beginning of a new day, A new time of hope, of joy, of freedom And most of all, of health. I thank You, God, for blessing me with life For sustaining my life And for enabling me to reach this awe-filled moment. Amen Rabbi Naomi Levy, Spiritual Leader, Nashuva (Los Angeles) Prayer Before a Vaccination May it be Your will, God and God of our Forefathers, that the vaccinations that we are about to receive will bring health, blessing and redemption, and protect us from suffering and terrible diseases. May this vaccination work quickly with minimal pain and side effects. Through this vaccine, may we merit blessing and protection for infants, the elderly, and the sick who cannot be vaccinated. May it be your will that the nurses and doctors who provide our vaccines enjoy long and peaceful life, financial security and success. May the merit of their preservation of our health stand in their stead until the end of days. Through the merit of observing the commandment \"you should guard yourself carefully\" (Deuteronomy 4:15), may we be privileged to raise children to Torah, the marriage canopy, and good deeds. Blessed is the One who hears prayer.

Praised are You who brings healing to all flesh and does wonders. Rabbi Andrew Sacks, Director of the Masorti [Conservative] Movement's Rabbinical Assembly in "}
