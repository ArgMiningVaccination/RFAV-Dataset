Instances of Public Officers proceeding without senior official authorization IV. CONCLUSION ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NOVA SCOTIA ANNUAL REPORT ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT JUSTIFICATION PROVISIONS 1. INTRODUCTION Sections 25.1-25.4 of the Criminal Code provide a limited justification for otherwise illegal acts and omissionscommitted by law enforcement officers (and those actingunder their direction) while investigating an offence underfederal law, enforcing a federal law, or investigatingcriminal activity.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 36 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.The law enforcement justification provisions also establish a system of accountability under which thecompetent authority, the Attorney General of NovaScotia, is required 1 to make public an annual report on the use of specific portions of the law enforcementjustification provisions by members of the municipalpolice agencies designated by the Attorney General ofNova Scotia. In particular, the Attorney General must report: !how many times a senior official made temporary designations under the provisions; 2 !how many times a senior official authorized apublic officer to commit an act or omission thatwould otherwise constitute an offence, and thatis likely to result in loss of or serious damage toproperty, or directed an agent to commit an actor omission that would otherwise constitute anoffence; 3 !how many times a pub lic officer proceeded without such an authorization from a seniorofficial, due to exigent circumstances; 4 !the nature of the conduct being investigated inthese instances; 5 and !the types of justified acts or omissions whichwould otherwise constitute offences committedin these instances. 6 This report addresses use of specific portions of the law enforcement justification provisions from February 1,2005 - January 31, 2006 for municipal police membersdesignated by the Attorney General of Nova Scotia.The Minister of Public Safety and EmergencyPreparedness (Canada) is responsible for and hasreported on the same provisions for all members of theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police. II. OVERVIEW OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT JUSTIFICATION REGIME In April 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in R. v. Campbell and Shirose declared that under the common law, police were not immune from criminalliability for criminal acts they committed during aninvestigation. The Court also stated that, \"if some form of public interest immunity is to be extended to thepolice......it should be left to Parliament to delineatethe nature and scope of the immunity and thecircumstances in which it is available.\" 7 On December 18, 2001, Bill C-24, An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (Organized Crime and Law Enforcement), received Royal Assent. While most portions of Bill C-24came into force on January 7, 2002, the law enforcementjustification provisions, set out in sections 25.1-25.4 of the Criminal Code , were only proclaimed on February 1, 2002, to allow time for the training and preparation of lawenforcement personnel. The law enforcement justification provisions respond to the judgment in Campbell and Shirose by providing a limited justification for otherwise illegal acts andomissions committed by law enforcement officers (andothers acting under their direction) while investigating anoffence under federal law, enforcing a federal law, orinvestigating criminal activity. They also establish asystem of accountability. An essential element of the law enforcement justification provisions is that they apply to designated public officersonly. 8 In the case of RCMP members, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (Canada) isthe competent authority responsible for makingdesignations. 9 In the case of Municipal Police Officers in Nova Scotia, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia is thecompetent authority responsible for making designations.The Attorney General of Nova Scotia did not designateany public officers (in Nova Scotia municipal policeofficers potentially from eleven (11) different municipalpolice forces) during this reporting period, namelyFebruary 1, 2005- January 31, 2006. The law enforcement justification provisions provide a designated public officer with a defence in law to theextent that his or her conduct is reasonable andproportional under the circumstances. Certain types ofconduct, such as intentionally causing bodily harm,violating the sexual integrity of a person and willfullyattempting to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course ofjustice, are excluded from the justification provisions. 10 The Attorney General is responsible for designating a senior official, who then advises the Attorney General onpublic officer designations. 11 Under ordinary circumstances, only the Attorney General may issuepublic officer designations to municipal police members;however, in exigent circumstances, the senior official maymake temporary public officer designations. The seniorofficial may designate a public officer for a period of 48hours or less if the senior o fficial believes that due to exigent circumstances, it is not feasible for the AttorneyGeneral to designate a public officer and under thecircumstances, the public officer would be justified incommitting an act or omission that would otherwiseconstitute an offence. 12 The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 37 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.A public officer must receive a written authorization from the senior official for acts or omissions that wouldotherwise constitute an offence and that would likelyresult in loss of, or serious damage to, property, or fordirecting another person to commit an act or omissionthat would otherwise constitute an offence. 13 A public officer may only proceed without a written authorization from a senior official for acts or omissionsthat would otherwise constitute an offence and thatwould likely result in loss of or serious damage toproperty, or for directing another person to commit anact or omission that would otherwise constitute anoffence, under very limited circumstances. He or shemust believe, on reasonable grounds, that the groundsfor obtaining an authorization exist, but it is not feasibleunder the circumstances to obtain the authorization, andthat the act or omission is necessary to: !preserve the life or safety of a person; !avoid compromising the identity of a publicofficer acting in an undercover capacity, aconfidential informant, or a person actingcovertly under the direction and control of apublic officer; or !prevent the imminent loss or destruction ofevidence of an indictable offence. 14 III. STATISTICS I. Temporary Designations Paragraphs 25.3(1)(a), (d) and (e) of the Criminal Code require the following information to be made public: !The number of temporary public officerdesignations made by the senior official. 15 !The nature of the conduct being investigated inthese cases. !The nature of the justified acts or omissions,which would otherwise constitute offences, thatwere committed by the designated publicofficer. From February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006, there were no designations made by senior officials. II. Authorizations for Specific Acts and OmissionsParagraphs 25.3(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Criminal Code require the following information to be made public: !The number of cases in which the senior official: <authorized a public officer to commit a justified act or omission that would otherwise constitute an offence and that would likelyresult in loss of or serious damage toproperty, or <authorized a public officer to direct another person to commit a justified act or omission that would otherwise constitute an offence.16 !The nature of the conduct being investigated inthese cases. !The nature of the justified acts or omissions,which would otherwise constitute offences, thatwere committed. From February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006, no authorizations were granted for directing another personto commit a justified act or omission that would otherwiseconstitute an offence. From February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006, no authorizations were granted to public officers to commitjustified acts or omissions th at would otherwise constitute offences and that would likely result in loss of or seriousdamage to property. III. Instances of Public Officers Proceeding Without Senior Official Authorization Paragraphs 25.3(1)(c), (d) and (e) of the Criminal Code require the following information to be made public: !The number of times that public officersproceeded without the senior official'sauthorization, based on reasonable grounds tobelieve that the grounds for obtaining anauthorization existed and that the justified act oromission that would otherwise constitute anoffence was necessary due to exigentcircumstances. 17 !The nature of the conduct being investigated whenpublic officers proceeded in this manner. !The nature of the justified acts or omissions,which would otherwise constitute offences thatwere committed when the public officersproceeded in this manner. The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 38 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.From February 1, 2005 through January 31, 2006, no public officers proceeded without the senior official'swritten authorization in these circumstances. IV. CONCLUSION Between February 1, 2005 and January 31, 2006, no powers under the law enforcement justifcationprovisions have been exercised by municipal police inNova Scotia. Nova Scotia's focus regarding the law enforcement justification provisions has been on learning from andbuilding upon the implementation experience of theMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness(Canada) and the RCMP. We have moved forward in2004-2005 offering training to municipal police whichresulted in very limited designations whichsubsequently expired in 2006. Despite the designations,no powers under the law enforcement justificationprovisions have been exercised, indicating that the localmunicipal forces are approaching their provisionscautiously, consistent with the training provided.

Web version.Introduction This National Instrument (the Instrument) contains both rules and accompanying commentary on those rules. The Canadian Securities Administrators (the CSA or we), have made these rule s under authority granted by the securities legislation of their jurisdiction. The commentary may explain the implications of a rule, offer example s or indicate different ways to comply with a rule. It may expand on a particular subject without being exhaustive. The comme ntary is not legally binding, but it does reflect the views of the CSA. Commentary always appears in italic type and, outside of this introduction, is titled \"Commentary\". Part 1 Definitions and application 1.1 Investment funds subject to Instrument (1) This Instrument applies to an inve stment fund that is a reporting issuer. (2) In Qu\u00e9bec, this Instrument does not a pply to a reporting issuer organized under (a) an Act to establish the Fonds de solidarit\u00e9 des tr availleurs du Qu\u00e9bec (F.T.Q.) R.S.Q., F3.2.1; an Act de d\u00e9velopement de la et l'emploi (R.S.Q., chapter F3.1.2) ; and (c) constituting Capital r\u00e9gional et coop\u00e9 ratif Desjardins (R.S.Q., chapter C 6.1). Commentary1. This Instrument applies to all publicly offered mu tual funds and nonredeemable investment funds. Investment funds subject to this Instrument include: labour sponsored or venture capital funds; scholarship plans; mutual funds and closedend funds listed and poste d for trading on a stock exchange or quoted on an overthecounter market; and investment funds not governed by National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds (NI 81-102) . 2. This Instrument does not regulate mutual funds that are not reporting issuers (commonly referred to as pooled funds), for example, mutual funds that sell securitie s to the public only under capital raising exemptions in securities legislation. 1.2 Definition of \"conflict of interest matter\" In this Instrument, \"a conflict of interest matter\" means (a) a situation where a reasonable person would consider a ma nager, or an entity related to the manager, to have an interest that may conflict with the manager's ability to act in good faith and in the best interests of the investment fund; or (b) a conflict of interest or self-dealing provision listed in Appendix A that restricts or prohibits an investment fund, a manager or an entity related to the manager from proceeding with a proposed action. Commentary1. Section 5.1 of this Instrument requires that a manage r refer all conflict of interest matters to the independent review committee (IRC). 2. The CSA do not consider the 'reasonable person' test described in paragraph (a) to capture inconsequential matters. It is expected that, among the factors the manager will look to for guidance to identify conflict ofinterest matters caught by this Instrument, will be industry best practices. The CSA expect, however, eachThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 50 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.manager to consider the nature of its investment fund ope rations when making its decisions about which conflict of interest matters it faces for the funds it manages. 3. The types of conflicts of interest faced by the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser (or sub-adviser) or any other entity related to the manager this Instrument captures re late to the decisions made on behalf of the investment fund that may affect or influence the manager's ability to make decisions in good faith and in the best interestsof the investment fund. This Instrument is not intended to capture the conflicts of interest at the service provider level generally. The CSA expect the manager to consider whether a par ticular portfolio manager or portfolio adviser or any other 'entity related to the manager' would have any conflicts of interest falling within the definition. For example, paragraph (a) might, depending on the circum stances, capture these conflicts of the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser: portfolio management processes for th e investment fund, including allocation of investments among a family of investment funds; and trading practices for the investment fund, including ne gotiating soft dollar arrangements with dealers with whom the adviser places portfolio transactions for the investment fund. 4. The CSA contemplate that an 'entity related to th e manager' will have its own policies and procedures to address any conflicts of interest in its operations. It is expected the manager will make reasonable inquiries of these policies and procedures. The conflicts of interest facing these entities, including any third party portfolio manager or portfolio adviser, may affect, or be perceived to affect, the manager's ability to make decisions in the best interests of the investment fund. The manager is expected to refer such conflicts to the IRC under this Instrument. 5. For greater certainty, paragraph (b) requires that a 'conflic t of interest matter' includes any course of action that the investment fund, the manager or an entity related to the manager would otherwise be restricted orprohibited from proceeding with because of a conflict of interest or self-dealing prohibition in securities legislation. These include the types of transactions described under subsection 5.2(1) of this Instrument. 1.3 Definition of \"entity related to the manager\" In this Instrument, \"entity related to the manager\" means (a) a person or company that can direct or materially a ffect the direction of the management and policies of the manager or the investment fund, other than as a member of the independent review committee; or (b) an associate, affiliate, partner, director, officer or s ubsidiary of the manager or of a person or company referred to in paragraph (a). Commentary1. The CSA consider an 'entity related to the manager' in paragraph (a) to include: the portfolio manager or portfolio adviser (or sub-advis er) of the investment fund, including any third party portfolio manager or portfolio adviser; the administrator of a scholarship plan; and any person or company that can materially direct or affect the manager's management or policies, including through contractual agreements or ownership of voting securities. 1.4 Definition of \"independent\" (1) In this Instrument, a member of the independent revi ew committee is \"independent\" if the member has no material relationship with the manager, the investment fund, or an entity related to the manager. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a material relations hip means a relationship which could reasonably be perceived to interfere with the member's judgment regarding a conflict of interest matter.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 51 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.Commentary 1. Under subsection 3.7(3), all members of the IRC must be independent of the manager, the investment fund and entities related to the manager. The CSA believe that a ll members must be independent because the principal function of the IRC is to review activities and transactions that involve inherent conflicts of interest between an investment fund and its manager. Given this role, it is important that the members of the IRC are free from conflicting loyalties. 2. While the members of the IRC should not themselves be s ubject to inherent conflicts or divided loyalties, the CSA recognize that there may be inherent conflicts relating to interfund issues where a single IRC acts for a family of investment funds. In those cases, this Instrument requires members to conduct themselves in accordance with their written charter and in accordance with the standard of care set out in this Instrument. The CSA do not consider the IRC's ability to set its ow n reasonable compensation to be a material relationship with the manager or investment fund under subsection 1.4(1). 3. A material relationship referred to in subsection 1. 4(1) may include an ownership, commercial, charitable, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting or familial relationship. The CSA expect managers and IRC members to consider both past and current relationships when determining whether a material relationship exists. For example, depending on the circumstances, the followi ng individuals may be independent under section 1.4: an independent member of an existing advisory board or IRC of an investment fund; an independent member or former independent member of the board of directors, or of a special committee of the board of directors, of an investment fund; a former independent member of the board of directo rs, or special committee of the board of directors, of the manager; an individual appointed as a trustee for an investment fund; and an independent member of the board of directors, or of a special committee of the board of directors, of a registered trust company that acts as trustee for an investment fund. By way of further example, the CSA consider it unlikely that the following individuals would be independent under section 1.4: a person who is or has recently been an employee or executive officer of the manager or investment fund; and a person whose immediate family member is or has recently been an executive officer of the manager or investment fund. The CSA also consider that it would be rare that a member of the board of directors, or special committee of the board of directors, of a manager could be 'indepe ndent' within the meaning of this Instrument. One such example of when a member of the board of dir ectors of a manager could be 'independent' may be \"owneroperated\" investment funds, sold exclusively to de fined groups of investors, such as members of a trade or professional association or cooperative organization, w ho directly or indirectly, own the manager. In the case of these investment funds, the CSA view the interests of the independent members of the board of directors of the manager and investors as aligned. 1.5 Definition of \"inter-fund self-d ealing investment prohibitions\" In this Instrument, \"inter-fund self-dealing investment prohibitions\" means the provisions listed in Appendix B that prohibit (a) a portfolio manager from knowingly causing any invest ment portfolio managed by it to purchase or sell, or (b) an investment fund from purchasing or selling,the securities of an issuer from or to the account of a res ponsible person, an associate of a responsible person or the portfolio manager.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 52 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.1.6 Definition of \"manager\" In this Instrument, \"manager\" means a person or company that directs the business, operations and affairs of an investment fund. Commentary1. The CSA are of the view that the term 'manager' shoul d be interpreted broadly. The term \"manager\" is intended to include a group of members on the board of an investm ent fund or the general partner of an investment fund organized as a limited partnership, where it acts in the capacity of 'manager'/decisionmaker. 2. The CSA have, in connection with prospectus reviews, on occasion encountered investment funds structured in unusual ways. The CSA may examine an investment fund if it seems that it was structured to avoid the operationof this Instrument. 1.7 Definition of \"standing instruction\" In this Instrument, \"standing instruction\" means a wri tten approval or recommendation from the independent review committee that permits the manager to proceed with a proposed action under section 5.2 or 5.3 on an ongoing basis. Part 2 Functions of the manager 2.1 Manager standard of care A manager in exercising its powers and discharging its dutie s related to the management of the investment fund must (a) act honestly and in good faith, and in the best interests of the investment fund; and(b) exercise the degree of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances . Commentary1. This section introduces a required standard of care fo r managers in certain jurisdictions and is intended to create a uniform standard of care provision for manage rs of investment funds subject to this Instrument. 2.2 Manager to have written policies and procedures (1) Before proceeding with a conflict of interest matter or a ny other matter that securities legislation requires the manager to refer to the independent review committee, the manager must (a) establish written policies and procedures that it must fo llow on that matter or on that type of matter, having regard to its duties under securities legislation; and (b) refer the policies and procedures to the inde pendent review committee for its review and input. (2) In establishing the written policies and procedures describe d in subsection (1), the manager must consider the input of the independent review committee, if any. (3) The manager may revise its policies and procedures if it provides the independent review committee with a written description of any significant changes for the independent review committee's review and input before implementing the revisions. Commentary1. Section 2.2 contemplates that a manager should identify for each investment fund the conflict of interest matters it expects will arise and that will be required to be referred to the IRC under section 5.1, and review its policies and procedures for those matters with the IRC.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 53 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.Section 2.2 further requires the manager to establis h policies and procedures for other matters it expects will arise and that will be required by securities legisla tion to be referred to the IRC, for example, certain reorganizations and transfers of assets between re lated mutual funds under Part 5 of NI 81-102. 2. A manager is expected to establish policies and procedures that are consistent with its obligations to the investment fund under securities legislation to make decisions in the best interests of the fund. Paragraph (1)(a) is intended to reinforce this obligation. A manager that manages more than one investment fund may establish policies and procedures for an action or category of actions for all of the investment funds it manages. Alternatively, the manager may establish separate policies and procedures for the action or category of actions for each of its investment funds, or groups of its investment funds. However structured, the CSA expect the written policies and procedures the manager establishes to be designed to prevent any violations by the manager and the investment fund of securities legislation in the areas that thisInstrument addresses, and to detect and prom ptly correct any violations that occur. 3. A manager is expected to follow the policies and procedures established under this section. In referring a matter to the IRC under section 5.1, the CSA expect the manager to inform the IRC whether its proposed action followsits written policies and procedures on the matter. If an unanticipated conflict of interest matter arises for which the manager does not have a policy and procedure, the CSA expect the manager to bring the matte r and its proposed action to the IRC for its review and input at the time the matter is referred to the IRC. 4. Small investment fund families may require fewer written policies and procedures than large fund complexes that, for example, have conflicts of interest as a re sult of affiliations with other financial service firms. 2.3 Manager to maintain records A manager must maintain a record of any activity that is subject to the review of the independent review committee, including (a) a copy of the policies and procedures that address the matter;(b) minutes of its meetings, if any; and(c) copies of materials, including any written repor ts, provided to the independent review committee. Commentary1. This section is intended to assist the CSA in determ ining whether the manager is adhering to this Instrument, and in identifying weaknesses in the manager's policies and procedures if violations do occur. The CSA expect managers to keep records in accordance with existing best practices. 2. A manager is expected under this section to keep minutes onl y of any material discussions it has at meetings with the IRC or internally on matters subject to the review of the IRC. The CSA do not view this section or this Instrume nt as preventing the IRC and manager from sharing record keeping and maintaining joint records of IRC and manager meetings. 3. The CSA expect a manager to keep records of the actions it takes in respect of a matter referred to the IRC. This includes any otherwise restricted or prohibited transac tions described in subsection 5.2(1) for which the manager requires the IRC's approval under Part 6 of this Instrument or under Part 4 of NI 81-102. 2.4 Manager to provide assistanceThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 54 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(1) When a manager refers to the independent review comm ittee a conflict of interest matter or any other matter that securities legislation requires it to refer, or refers its policies and procedures related to such matters, the manager must (a) provide the independent review committee with information sufficient for the independent review committee to properly carry out its responsibilities, including (i) a description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the matter;(ii) the manager's policies and procedures;(iii) the manager's proposed course of action, if applicable; and(iv) all further information the independent review committee reasonably requests; (b) make its officers who are knowledgeable about the matter available to attend meetings of the independent review committee or respond to inquiries of the indepe ndent review committee about the matter; and (c) provide the independent review committee with any othe r assistance it reasonably requests in its review of the matter. (2) A manager must not prevent or attempt to prevent the i ndependent review committee, or a member of the independent review committee, from communicating with the securities regulatory authority or regulator. Part 3 Independent review committee 3.1 Independent review committee for an investment fund An investment fund must have an independent review committee. Commentary1. A manager is expected to establish an IRC using a stru cture that is appropriate for the investment funds it manages, having regard to the expected workload of that committee. For example, a manager may establish oneIRC for each of the investment funds it manages, for several of its investment funds, or for all of its investment funds. 2. This Instrument does not prevent investment funds from sharing an IRC with investment funds managed by another manager. This Instrument also does not prevent a third party from offering IRCs for investment funds. Managers of smaller families of investment funds may find th ese to be cost-effective ways to establish IRCs for their investment funds. 3.2 Initial appointments The manager must appoint each member of an inve stment fund's first independent review committee. 3.3 Vacancies and reappointments (1) An independent review committee must fill a vacancy on the independent review committee as soon as practicable. (2) A member whose term has expired, or will soon expire, may be reappointed by the other members of the independent review committee. (3) In filling a vacancy on the independent review committ ee or reappointing a member of the independent review committee, the independent review committee must consider the manager's recommendations, if any. (4) A member may not be reappointed for a term or terms of office that, if served, would result in the member serving on the independent review committee for longer than 6 y ears, unless the manager agrees to the reappointment.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 55 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(5) If, for any reason, an independent review committee has no members, the manager must appoint a member to fill each vacancy as soon as practicable. Commentary1. Consistent with the manager's role to appoint the first members of an IRC, if at any time the IRC has no members, the manager will also appoint the replacement members. The CSA anticipate that the circumstances contemplated in subsection (5) will occur rarely, such as in the event of a change of manager or change incontrol of the manager. In these circumstances, manage rs should consider their timely disclosure obligations under securities legislation. 2. The manager may suggest candidates and may provide assi stance to the IRC in the selection and recruitment process when a vacancy arises. Subsection (3) requires the IRC to consider the manager's recommendation, if any, when filling a vacancy or reappointing a member of the IRC. The CSA believe that allowing the IRC to select its own members and decide the term a member can serve will foster independentminded committees that will be focussed on the best interests of the investment fund. The CSA also consider the members of the IRC to be bestpositi oned to judge the manner in which a prospective member can contribute to the effectiveness of the IRC. 3. The maximum term limit of 6 years specified in subsection (4) for a member to serve on an investment fund's IRC is intended to enhance the independence and effec tiveness of the IRC. An IRC may reappoint a member beyond the maximum term, but only with the agreement of the manager. 3.4 Term of office The term of office of a member of an independent review committee must be not less than 1 year and not more than 3 years, and must be set by the manager or the independent review committee, as the case may be, at the time the memberis appointed. Commentary1. To ensure continuity and continued independence from the manager, the CSA recommend that the terms of all IRC members be staggered. 3.5 Nominating criteria Before a member of the independent review committee is appointed, the manager or the independent review committee, as the case may be, must consider (a) the competencies and skills the independent review committee, as a whole, should possess; (b) the competencies and skills of each other me mber of the independent review committee; and (c) the competencies and skills the prospective memb er would bring to the independent review committee. Commentary1. Section 3.5 sets out the criteria the manager and the IRC must consider before appointing a member of the IRC. Subject to these requirements, the manager and the IRC may establish nominating criteria in addition to thoseset out in this section. 3.6 Written charter (1) The independent review committee must adopt a writte n charter that includes its mandate, responsibilities and functions, and the policies and procedures it will follow when performing its functions.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 56 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(2) If the independent review committee and the manager ag ree in writing that the independent review committee will perform functions other than those prescribed by securities le gislation, the charter must include a description of the functions that are the subject of the agreement. (3) In adopting the charter, the independent review comm ittee must consider the manager's recommendations, if any. Commentary1. The CSA expect the written charter to set out the necessa ry policies and procedures to ensure the IRC performs its role adequately and effectively and in compliance with this Instrument. An IRC acting for more than one investment fund may choose to establish a separate charte r for each fund. Alternatively, an IRC may choose to establish one charter for all of the investment funds it oversees or groups of investment funds. 2. The IRC should consider the specific matters subject to its review when developing the policies and procedures to be set out in its charter. 3. Without discussing all of the policies and procedures t hat may be set out in the written charter, the CSA expect that the written charter will include the following: policies and procedures the IRC must follow when reviewing conflict of interest matters, criteria for the IRC to consider in setting its compensation and expenses and the compensation and expenses of any advisors employed by the IRC, a policy relating to IRC member ownership of secur ities of the investment fund, manager or in any person or company that provides services to the investment fund or the manager, policies and procedures that describe how a member of the IRC is to conduct himself or herself when he or she faces a conflict of interest, or could be perceived to face a conflict of interest, with respect to a matter being considered or to be considered by the IRC, policies and procedures that describe how the IRC is to interact with any existing advisory board or board of directors of the investment fund and the manager, and policies and procedures that describe how any subco mmittee of the IRC to which has been delegated any of the functions of the IRC, is to report to the IRC. 4. The manager and the IRC may agree that the IRC will perfor m functions in addition to those prescribed by this Instrument and elsewhere in securities legislation. Th is Instrument does not preclude those arrangements, nor does this Instrument regulate those arrangements. 3.7 Composition (1) An independent review committee must have at least three members. (2) The size of the independent review committee is to be dete rmined by the manager, with a view to facilitating effective decisionmaking, and may only be changed by the manager. (3) Every independent review committee member must be independent.(4) An independent review committee must appoint a member as Chair.(5) The Chair of an independent review committee is re sponsible for managing the mandate, and responsibilities and functions, of the independent review committee. Commentary1. To ensure its effectiveness, a manager should consider the workload of the IRC when determining its size. The CSA expect that the manager will seek the input of the IRC prior to changing the size of the IRC. 2. The CSA anticipate that the Chair of the IRC will lead IRC meetings, foster communication among IRC members, and ensure the IRC carries out its responsibilities in a timely and effective manner.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 57 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.The CSA expect the IRC Chair will be the primary person to interact with the manager on issues relating to the investment fund. An IRC Chair and the manager may agree to have regular communication as a way for the IRCChair to keep informed of the operations of the investment fund between meetings, and of any significant eventsrelating to the investment fund. 3. The requirement that all members of the IRC be i ndependent does not preclude the IRC from consulting with others who can help the members understand matters that are beyond their specific expertise, or help them understand industry practices or trends, for example. 3.8 Compensation (1) The manager may set the initial compensation and expenses of an independent review committee that is appointed under section 3.2 or subsection 3.3(5). (2) Subject to subsection (1), the independent review co mmittee must set reasonable compensation and proper expenses for its members. (3) When setting its compensation and expe nses under subsection (2), the indepe ndent review committee must consider (a) the independent review committee's most recent assessm ent of its compensation under paragraph 4.2(2)(b); and (b) the manager's recommendations, if any.Commentary1. This section permits the manager to determine the amount and type of compensation and expenses the IRC members will initially receive. To avoid undue influen ce from the manager, subsection (2) requires that, subsequent to the initial setting of compensation and other than in th e unusual circumstance described in subsection 3.3(5), members of the IRC have the sole authority for determining their compensation. TheInstrument permits the manager to recommend to the members of the IRC the amount and type of compensationto be paid, and requires the IRC to consider that recommendation. 2. The CSA expect the IRC and the manager to decide the IRC's compensation in a manner consistent with good governance practices. Among the factors the IRC and manager should consider when determining theappropriate level of compensation are the following:the number, nature and complexity of the investment funds and the fund families for which the IRC acts; the nature and extent of the workload of each member of the IRC, including the commitment of time and energy that is expected from each member; industry best practices, including industry averages and surveys on IRC compensation; and the best interests of the investment fund. 3. The CSA expect that the IRC and the manager will disc uss any instance where the IRC disagrees with the manager's recommendations under paragraph (3)(b), in an a ttempt to reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both the IRC and the manager. 3.9 Standard of care (1) Every member of an independent review committee, in ex ercising his or her powers and discharging his or her duties related to the investment fund, and, for greater certainty , not to any other person, as a member of the independent review committee must (a) act honestly and in good faith, with a view to the best interests of the investment fund; and (b) exercise the degree of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. (2) Every member of an independent review committee must comply with this Instrument and the written charter of the independent review committee required under section 3.6.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 58 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(3) A member of the independent review committee does not breach paragraph (1)(b), if the member exercised the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would ex ercise in comparable circumstances, including reliance in good faith on (a) a report or certification represented as full and true to the independent review committee by the manager or an entity related to the manager; or (b) a report of a person whose profession lends credibility to a statement made by the person. (4) A member of the independent review committee has comp lied with his or her duties under paragraph (1)(a) if the member has relied in good faith on (a) a report or certification represented as full and true to the independent review committee by the manager or an entity related to the manager; or (b) a report of a person whose profession lends credibility to a statement made by the person.Commentary 1. The standard of care for IRC members under this section is consistent with the special relationship between the IRC and the investment fund. The CSA consider the role of the members of the IRC to be similar to corporate directors, though with a much more limited mandate, and therefore we would expect any de fences available to corporate directors to also be available to IRC members. 2. The CSA consider the best interests of the investm ent fund referred to in paragraph (1)(a) to generally be consistent with the interests of the securityholders in the investment fund as a whole. 3. It is not the intention of the CSA to create a duty of care on the part of the IRC to any other person under paragraph (1)(b). 3.10 Ceasing to be a member (1) An individual ceases to be a member of an independent review committee when (a) the investment fund terminates;(b) the manager of the investment fund changes, unless the new manager is an affiliate of the former manager; or (c) there is a change of control of the manager of the investment fund. (2) An individual ceases to be a member of an independent review committee if (a) the individual resigns;(b) the individual's term of office expi res and the member is not reappointed; (c) a majority of the other members of the independe nt review committee vote to remove the individual; or (d) a majority of the securityholders of the investment f und vote to remove the individual at a special meeting called for that purpose by the manager. (3) An individual ceases to be a member of the independent review committee if the individual is (a) no longer independent within the meaning of section 1.4 and the cause of the member's nonindependence is not temporary for which the member can recuse himself or herself;The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 59 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(b) of unsound mind and has been so found by a court in Canada or elsewhere; (c) bankrupt;(d) prohibited from acting as a director or officer of any issuer in Canada; (e) subject to any penalties or sanctions made by a court re lating to provincial and territorial securities legislation; or (f) a party to a settlement agreement with a provinc ial or territorial securities regulatory authority. (4) If an individual ceases to be a member of the indepe ndent review committee due to a circumstance described in subsection (2), the manager must, as soon as practicable, no tify the securities regulatory authority or regulator of the date and the reason the individual ceased to be a member. (5) The notification referred to in subsection (4) is satisfied if it is made to the investment fund's principal regulator. (6) The notice of a meeting of securityholders of an invest ment fund called to consider the removal of a member under paragraph (2)(d) must comply with the notice requirement s set out in section 5.4 of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds . (7) For any member of the independent review committee who receives notice or otherwise learns of a meeting of securityholders called to consider the re moval of the member under paragraph (2)(d), (a) the member may submit to the manager a written statement giving reasons for opposing the removal; and(b) the manager must, as soon as practicable, send a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (a) to every securityholder entitled to receive notice of the meeting and to the member unless the statement is included in or attached to the notice documents required by subsection (6). Commentary1. The CSA do not anticipate that the securityholder vote contemplated in paragraph 3.10(2)(d) will be routine. When a manager calls a meeting of securityholders to cons ider the removal of a member, subsection (7) requires that the member will have an opportunity to respond to the manager's notice. 2. In the circumstances described in paragraphs 3.10(1)(b) and (c), all members of the IRC will cease to be members. This does not preclude the new manager from reappointing the former members of the IRC undersubsection 3.3(5). 3. Paragraph 3. 10(3)(a) is meant to exclude a situation wh ere a member may face, or be perceived to face, a conflict of interest with respect to a specific c onflict of interest matter the IRC is considering. 3.11 Authority (1) An independent review committee has authority to (a) request information it determines useful or necessary from the manager and its officers to carry out its duties; (b) engage independent counsel and other advisors it dete rmines useful or necessary to carry out its duties; (c) set reasonable compensation and proper expenses for any independent counsel and other advisors engaged by the independent review committee; and (d) delegate to a subcommittee of at least three members of the independent review committee any of its functions, except the removal of a member under paragraph 3.10(2)(c).The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 60 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(2) If the independent review committee delegates to a subc ommittee under paragraph (1)(d) any of its functions, the subcommittee must report on its activities to the independent review committee at least annually. (3) Despite any other provision in this Instrument, an independent review committee may communicate directly with the securities regulatory authority or regulator with respect to any matter. Commentary1. The CSA recognize that utilizing the manager's staff and i ndustry experts may be important to help the members of the IRC deal with matters that are beyond the level of their expertise, or help them understand different practices among investment funds. While this Instrument does not require legal counsel or other advisers for the IRC to be independent of the manager or the investment fund, there may be instances when the members of the IRC believe they need access to counsel or advisers who are free from conflicting lo yalties. Paragraph (1)(b) gives the IRC the discretion and authority to hire independent legal counsel and other adv isers. The CSA expect that the IRC will use independent advisors selectively and only to assist, not replace, IR C decisionmaking. The CSA do not anticipate that IRCs will routinely use external counsel and other advisers. 2. Paragraph (1)(d) is intended to allow an IRC of more than three members to delegate any of its functions, except the removal of an IRC member, to a subcommittee of at least three members. The CSA expect in such instances that the written charter of the IRC will include a defined mandate and reporting requirements for anysubcommittee. The CSA do not consider delegation by the IRC of a function to a subcommittee to absolve the IRC from its responsibility for the function. 3. Subsection (3) specifies that the IRC may inform the secu rities regulatory authority or regulator of any concerns or issues that it may not otherwise be required to re port. For example, the IRC may be concerned if very few matters have been referred by the manager for review, or it may have found, or have reasonable grounds to suspect, a breach of securities legislation has occurre d. However, the IRC has no obligation to report matters other than those prescribed by this Instrume nt or elsewhere in securities legislation. 4. The CSA do not consider that this section or this In strument prevents the manager from communicating with the securities regulatory authorities with respect to any matter. 3.12 Decisions (1) A decision by the independent review committee on a conflic t of interest matter or any other matter that securities legislation requires the independent review committee to review requires the agreement of a majority of the independent review committee's members. (2) If, for any reason, an independent review committe e has two members, a decision by the independent review committee must be unanimous. (3) An independent review committee with one member may not make a decision. Commentary1. This section requires a decision of the members of th e IRC to represent the majority. Should the IRC find itself with two members, subsection (2) permits the IRC to c ontinue to make decisions on conflict of interest matters provided the remaining two members agree. 3.13 Fees and expenses to be paid by the investment fund The investment fund must pay from the assets of its fund a ll reasonable costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the compliance of this Instrument.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 61 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.Commentary 1. A manager is expected to allocate the costs associated with the IRC on an equitable and reasonable basis amongst the investment funds for which the IRC acts. This Instrument does not prohibit a manager from reimbursing the investment fund for any of the costs associated with compliance with this Instrument. It is expected that the prospectus will disclose whether or not the manager will reimburse the investment fund. 2. The CSA do not expect costs that the manager or investment fund would ordinarily incur in the operation of the investment fund without the presence of the IRC (for example, rent) to be charged to the investment fund underthis section. Among the costs the CSA expect will be c harged to the investment fund under this section are the following: the compensation and expenses payable to the membe rs of the IRC and to any independent counsel and other advisers employed by the IRC; the costs of the orientation and continuing education of the members of the IRC; and the costs and expenses associated with a special meeting of securityholders called by the manager to remove a member or members of the IRC. 3.14 Indemnification and insurance (1) In this section, \"member\" means: (a) a member of the independent review committee;(b) a former member of the independent review committee; and(c) the heirs, executors, administrators or other legal repr esentatives of the estate of an individual in (a) or (b). (2) An investment fund and manager may indemnify a member against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, reasonably incurred by the person in respect of any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other proceedi ng in which the member is involved because of being or having been a member. (3) An investment fund and manager may advance moneys to a member for the costs, charges and expenses of a proceeding referred to in subsection (2). The member must repay the moneys if the member does not fulfill theconditions of subsection (4). (4) An investment fund and manager may not indemnify a member under subsection (2) unless (a) the member acted honestly and in good faith, with a view to the best interests of the investment fund; and (b) in the case of a criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by a monetary penalty, the member had reasonable grounds for believing that the individual's conduct was lawful. (5) Despite subsection (2), a member referred to in that s ubsection is entitled to an indemnity from the investment fund in respect of all costs, charges and expenses reasonabl y incurred by the member in connection with the defence of any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other proceeding to which the member is subject because of the member's association with the investment fund as descri bed in subsection (2), if the member seeking indemnity (a) was not judged by the court or other competent author ity to have committed any fault or omitted to do anything that ought to have been done; and (b) fulfills the conditions set out in subsection (4). (6) An investment fund and manager may purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any member referred to in subsection (2) against any liability incurred by the member in his or her capacity as a member.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 62 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.Commentary 1. This Instrument requires that members of an IRC be acc ountable for their actions. At the same time, this section does not prevent an investment fund or a manager from limiting a member's financial exposure throughinsurance and indemnification. 2. This section permits an investment fund and the manager to indemnify and purchase insurance coverage for the members of the IRC on terms comparable to those applicable to directors of corporations. The broad goalsunderlying the indemnity provisions are to allow for reimbursement for reasonable good faith behaviour, therebydiscouraging the hindsight application of perfection to the IRC's actions. Under this section, the investment fund is required to indemnify an IRC member who has been sued and has successfully defended the action, subject to certain c onditions. If the IRC member does not defend the action successfully, the investment fund and manager may indemnify the member in certain circumstances. Theintention of indemnity is to encourage responsible behaviour yet still permit enough leeway to attract strong candidates. The two conditions which must be satisfied in either instance under this section for an IRC member to be indemnified are: the IRC member must have acted in a manner consistent with his or her fiduciary duty with respect to the action or matter for which the IRC member is seeking the indemnification; and the IRC member must have had reasonable grounds for believing that his or her conduct was lawful. The CSA expect any such coverage to be on reasonable commercial terms. 3. It is open to members of the IRC to negotiate contractual indemnities with the manager and the investment fund provided the protection is permissible under this section. 3.15 Orientation and continuing education (1) The manager and independent review committee must provide orientation consisting of educational or informational programs that enable a new independent review committee member to understand (a) the role of the independent review committee and its members collectively; and(b) the role of the individual member. (2) The manager may provide a member of the independent review committee with educational or informational programs, as the manager considers useful or necessary , that enable the member to understand the nature and operation of the manager's and investment fund's businesses. (3) The independent review committee may reasonably supplement the educational and informational programs provided to its members under this section. Commentary1. The CSA expect members of the IRC to regularly partici pate in educational or informational programs that may be useful to the members in understanding and fulfilling their duties. Section 3.15 sets out only the minimum educational pr ograms that a manager and IRC are expected to provide for members of the IRC. Educational activities coul d include presentations, seminars or discussion groups conducted by: personnel of the investment fund or manager, outside experts, industry groups, representatives of the investment fund's various service providers, and educational organizations and institutions.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 63 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.2. The CSA expect a discussion of a member's role referred to in paragraph (1)(b) to include a reference to the commitment of time and energy that is expected from the member. Part 4 Functions of independent review committee 4.1 Review of matters referred by manager (1) The independent review committee must review and pr ovide its decision under section 5.2 or under section 5.3 to the manager on a conflict of interest matter that the manage r refers to the independent review committee for review. (2) The independent review committee must perform any other function required by securities legislation. (3) The independent review committee has the authority to choose whether to deliberate and decide on a matter referred to in subsection (1) and (2) in the absence of the manage r, any representative of the manager and any entity related to the manager. (4) Despite subsection (3), an independent review committ ee must hold at least one meeting annually at which the manager, any representative of the manager or any entity related to the manager are not in attendance. (5) The independent review committee has no power, authority or responsibility for the operation of the investment fund or the manager except as provided in this section. Commentary1. The Instrument requires the IRC only to consider matte rs referred to it by the manager that involve or may be perceived to involve a conflict of interest for the manager between its own interests and its duty to manage an investment fund. Securities legislation also requires the IRC to consider other matters. For example, a change in a mutual fund's auditor and certain reorganizations and transfers of assets between related mutual funds under Part 5 of NI 81-102 require the review and prior approval of the IRC for the manager to proceed. 2. The manager and the IRC may agree that the IRC will perfor m functions in addition to those prescribed by this Instrument and elsewhere in securities legislation. Th is Instrument does not preclude those arrangements, nor does this Instrument regulate those arrangements. 3. Subsection (3) permits the IRC to decide who, other than IRC members, may attend any IRC meeting other than the meeting referred to in subsection (4). Subsection (3 ) also does not preclude the IRC from receiving oral or written submissions from the manager or from holding mee tings with representatives of the manager or an entity related to the manager or any other person not independe nt under this Instrument. The CSA believe utilizing the manager's staff and industry experts may be important to help the members of the IRC understand matters thatare beyond their specific expertise, or help them understand different practices among investment funds. 4. The requirement that the IRC hold at least one mee ting without anyone else present (including management of the investment fund) is intended to give the memb ers of the IRC an opportunity to speak freely about any sensitive issues, including any concerns about the manager. The CSA are of the view that subsection (4) is sa tisfied if the IRC holds a portion of any meeting annually without the presence of the manager, any representati ve of the manager or any entity related to the manager. 4.2 Regular assessments (1) At least annually, the independent review committee must review and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of (a) the manager's written policies and procedures required under section 2.2; (b) any standing instruction it has provided to the manager under section 5.4;The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 64 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(c) the manager's and the investment fund's compliance with any conditions imposed by the independent review committee in a recommendation or approval it has provided to the manager; and (d) any subcommittee to which the independent review co mmittee has delegated, under paragraph 3.11(1)(d), any of its functions. (2) At least annually, the independent review committee must review and assess (a) the independence of its members; and(b) the compensation of its members. (3) At least annually, the independent review committee must re view and assess its effectiveness as a committee, as well as the effectiveness and contribution of each of its members. (4) The review by the independent review committee requi red under subsection (3) must include a consideration of (a) the independent review committee's wr itten charter referred to in section 3.6; (b) the competencies and knowledge each member is exp ected to bring to the independent review committee; (c) the level of complexity of the issues reasonably expect ed to be raised by members in connection with the matters under review by the independent review committee; and (d) the ability of each member to contribute the necessary time required to serve effectively on the independent review committee . Commentary1. Section 4.2 sets out the minimum assessments the inde pendent review committee must perform. Subject to these requirements, the IRC may establish a process for ( and determine the frequency of) additional assessments as it sees fit. 2. The annual selfassessment by the IRC should improve performance by strengthening each member's understanding of his or her role and fostering better communication and greater cohesiveness among members. 3. When evaluating individual performance, it is expected that the IRC consider factors such as the member's attendance and participation in meetings, continuing e ducation activities and industry knowledge. The manager may also provide IRC members with feedback which the IRC may consider. It is expected the selfassessment should focus on bot h substantive and procedural aspects of the IRC's operations. When evaluating the IRC's structure and effecti veness, the IRC should consider factors such as the following: the frequency of meetings; the substance of meeting agendas; the policies and procedures that the manager has established to refer matters to the IRC; the usefulness of the materials prov ided to the members of the IRC; the collective experience and background of the members of the IRC; the number of funds the IRC oversees; and the amount and form of compensa tion the members receive from an individual investment fund and in aggregate from the fund family. 4. The CSA expect the members of an IRC to respond appropriately to address any weaknesses found in a selfassessment. For example, it may be necessary to improve the IRC members' continuing education, recommend ways to improve the quality and sufficiency of the information provided to them, or recommend tothe manager decreasing the number of investment funds under the IRC's oversight.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 65 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.In rare circumstances, the IRC may consider removi ng a member of the IRC as contemplated under paragraph 3.10(2)(c) as a result of the selfassessment. 4.3 Reporting to the manager The independent review committee must as soon as practicable deliver to the manager a written report of the results of an assessment under subsection 4.2(1) and (2) that includes (a) a description of each instance of a breach of any of the manager's policies or procedures of which the independent review committee is aware, or that it has reason to believe has occurred; (b) a description of each instance of a breach of a c ondition imposed by the independent review committee in a recommendation or approval it has provided to the manager, of which the independent review committee isaware, or that it has reason to believe has occurred; and (c) recommendations for any changes the independent review committee considers should be made to the manager's policies and procedures. 4.4 Reporting to securityholders (1) An independent review committee must prepare, for each fi nancial year of the investment fund and no later than the date the investment fund files its annual financial statemen ts, a report to securityholders of the investment fund that describes the independent review committee and its activities for the financial year and includes (a) the name of each member of the independent review committee at the date of the report, with (i) the member's length of service on the independent review committee;(ii) the name of any other fund family on whose independent review committee the member serves; and(iii) if applicable, a description of any relationship th at may cause a reasonable person to question the member's independence and the basis upon which the independent review committee determined that the member isindependent; (b) the percentage of securities of each class or series of voting or equity securities beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, in aggregate, by all the members of the independent review committee of the investment fund (i) in the investment fund if the aggreg ate level of ownership exceeds 10 percent; (ii) in the manager; or(iii) in any person or company that provides serv ices to the investment fund or the manager; (c) the identity of the Chair of the independent review committee;(d) any changes in the composition or membership of the independent review committee during the period; (e) the aggregate compensation paid to the independent review committee and any indemnities paid to members of the independent review committee by the investment fund during the period; (f) a description of the process and criteria used by the independent review committee to determine the appropriate level of compensation of its members and any instance when, in setting the compensation and expenses of itsmembers, the independent review committee did not follow the recommendation of the manager, including (i) a summary of the manager's recommendation; and(ii) the independent review committee's reasons for not following the recommendation;The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 66 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(g) if known, a description of each instance when the manage r acted in a conflict of interest matter referred to the independent review committee for which the independent review committee did not give a positiverecommendation, including (i) a summary of the recommendation; and(ii) if known, the manager's reasons for proceeding without following the recommendation of the independent review committee and the result of proceeding; (h) if known, a description of each instance when the manager acted in a conflict of interest matter but did not meet a condition imposed by the independent review committee in its recommendation or approval, including (i) the nature of the condition;(ii) if known, the manager's reasons for not meeting the condition; and(iii) whether the independent review committee is of the vi ew that the manager has taken, or proposes to take, appropriate action to deal with the matter; and (i) a brief summary of any recommendations and approvals the manager relied upon during the period. (2) The report required under subsecti on (1) must as soon as practicable (a) be sent by the investment fund, without charge, to a securityholder of the investment fund, upon the securityholder's request; (b) be made available and prominently displayed by the ma nager on the investment fund's, investment fund family's or manager's website, if it has a website; (c) be filed by the investment fund with the s ecurities regulatory authority or regulator; and (d) be delivered by the independent review committee to the manager.Commentary1. The report to be filed with the securities regulat ory authorities should be filed on the SEDAR group profile number of the investment fund as a continuous disclosure document. The CSA expect that the investment fundwill pay any reasonable costs associated with the filing of the report. 2. It is expected the report will be displayed in an easily visible location on the home page of the website of the investment fund, the investment fund family or the manage r, as applicable. The CSA expect the report to remain on the website at least until the posting of the next report. 3. The disclosure required in subparagraph (1)(a)(iii) is exp ected to be provided only in instances where a member could reasonably be perceived to not be 'independent' under this Instrument. 4.5 Reporting to securities regulatory authorities (1) If the independent review committee is aware of an instan ce where the manager acted in a conflict of interest matter under subsection 5.2(1) but did not comply with a conditi on or conditions imposed by securities legislation or the independent review committee in its approval, the independe nt review committee must, as soon as practicable, notify in writing the securities regulatory authority or regulator. (2) The notification referred to in subsection (1) is satisfied if it is made to the investment fund's principal regulator. CommentaryThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 67 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.1. Subsection (1) captures a breach of a condition imposed for an otherwise prohibited or restricted transaction described in subsection 5.2(1), for which the manager has acted under Part 6 of this Instrument or under Part 4 of NI 81-102. This includes a breach of a condition imposed by the IRC as part of its approval (including a standing instruction), or, for example, any conditions imposed for interfund trading under section 6.1 of thisInstrument or section 4.3 of NI 81-102, for transactions in securities of related issuers under section 6.2 of this Instrument, and for purchases of securities underwritten by re lated underwriters under section 4.1 of NI 81-102. The CSA consider that a breach of a condition imposed by securities legislation (including this Instrument) or by the IRC in a transaction described in subsection 5. 2(1) will result in the transaction having been made in contravention of securities legislation. In such in stances, the securities regulatory authorities may consider taking various action, including requiring the manager to unwind the transaction and pay any costs associatedwith doing so. 2. The CSA expect that the IRC will include in its notification the steps the manager proposes to take, or has taken, to remedy the breach, if known. 3. Notification under this section is not intended to be a mechanism to resolve disputes between an IRC and a manager, or to raise inconsequential matte rs with the securities regulatory authorities. 4. The CSA do not view this section or this Instrume nt as preventing the manager from communicating with the securities regulatory authorities with respect to any matter. 4.6 Independent review committee to maintain records An independent review committee must maintain records, including (a) a copy of its current written charter;(b) minutes of its meetings;(c) copies of any materials and written reports provided to it;(d) copies of materials and written reports prepared by it; and(e) the decisions it makes.Commentary1. Section 4.6 sets out the minimum requirements regar ding the record keeping by an IRC. The CSA expect IRCs to keep records in accordance with existing best practices. 2. The IRC is expected under paragraph (b) to keep minutes only of any material discussions it has at meetings with the manager or internally on matters subject to its review. The CSA do not view this section or this Instrume nt as preventing the IRC and manager from sharing record keeping and maintaining joint records of IRC and manager meetings. 3. The CSA expect the IRC to keep records of any actions it takes in respect of a matter referred to it, in particular any transaction otherwise prohibited or restricted by secu rities legislation, as described in subsection 5.2(1), for which the manager has sought the approval of the IRC.

Web version.(a) determine what action it proposes to take in respect of the matter, having regard to (i) its duties under securities legislation; and(ii) its written policies and procedures on the matter; and (b) refer the matter, along with its proposed action, to th e independent review committee for its review and decision. (2) If a manager must hold a meeting of securityholders to obtain securityholder approval before taking an action in a conflict of interest matter, the manager must include a summary of the independent review committee's decision under subsection (1) in the notice of the meeting. Commentary1. Section 5.1 recognizes that a manager may not be able to objectively determine whether it is acting in the best interests of the investment fund when it has a conflict of interest. This section requires managers to refer allconflict of interest matters - not just those subject to prohibitions or restrictions under securities legislation n to the IRC so that an independent perspective can be brought to bear on the manager's proposed action. A decision tree for different types of conflict of intere st matters is set out in Appendix A to the Commentary. While the CSA expect the IRC to bring a high degree of ri gour and skeptical objectivity to its review of conflict of interest matters, the CSA do not consider it the ro le of the IRC to secondguess the investment or business decisions of a manager or an entity related to the manager. 2. Section 5.1 sets out how the manager must proceed when faced with a conflict of interest matter. Referring proposed actions involving con flict of interest matters to the IRC for its review is not considered by the CSA to detract from the manager's obligations to the investment fund under securities legislation to make decisions in the best interests of the fund. Subparagraph (a)(i) is intended to reinforce this obligation. 3. In referring a matter to the IRC, a manager is expected to inform the IRC whether its proposed action follows its written policies and procedures on the matter under section 2.2. If an unanticipated conflict of interest matter arises for which the manager does not have an existing written policy and procedure, the CSA expect the manager to bring the matter and its proposed action to the IRC forits review and input at the time the matter is referred to the IRC. 4. There may be matters that are subject to a securityholde r vote that also involve a \"conflict of interest matter\" under this Instrument. For example, increases in the charges of the manager to the mutual fund will be a conflictof interest matter as well as a matter subject to a secu rityholder vote under Part 5 of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds . For these matters, subsection (2) requires a manager to refer the matter first to the IRC before seeking the approval of securityholders, and to include a summary of the IRC's decision in the written notice to securityholders. 5.2 Matters requiring independent review committee approval (1) A manager may not proceed with a proposed action under s ection 5.1 without the approval of the independent review committee if the action is (a) an interfund trade as described in subsection 6.1(2) of th is Instrument or a transaction as described in subsection 4.2(1) of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds ; (b) a transaction in securities of an issuer as de scribed in subsection 6.2(1) of this Instrument; or (c) an investment in a class of securities of an issuer underwritten by an entity related to the manager as described in subsection 4.1(1) of National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds .The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 69 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(2) An independent review committee must not approve an ac tion unless it has determined, after reasonable inquiry, that the action (a) is proposed by the manager free from any influence by an entity related to the manager and without taking into account any consideration relevant to an entity related to the manager; (b) represents the business judgment of the manager uninfluen ced by considerations other than the best interests of the investment fund; (c) is in compliance with the manager's written policies and procedures relating to the action; and(d) achieves a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund.Commentary1. For the transactions described in subsection (1), pr ovided the manager receives the IRC's approval under this section, and satisfies the additional conditions imposed under the applicable sections of Part 6 of this Instrument or Part 4 of NI 81-102, the manager will be permitted to proceed with the action without obtaining regulatory exemptive relief. The IRC may give its approval for certain actions or cate gories of actions in the form of a standing instruction as described in section 5.4. If no standing instruction is in effect, the manager is required to seek the IRC's approval prior to proceeding with any action set out in subsection (1). An IRC may consider as guidance any conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities when contemplating the appropriate terms and conditions in its approval. 2. If the IRC does not approve a proposed action described in subsection (1), the manager is not permitted to proceed without obtaining exemptive relief from the secur ities regulatory authorities. The CSA consider it in the best interests of the investment fund, and ultimately inves tors, for the IRC to be able to stop any proposed action which does not meet the test in subsection (2). 3. The CSA would usually expect that, before the IRC appr oves a proposed action described in subsection (1), it will have requested from the manager or others a report or certification to assist in its determination that the test in subsection (2) has been met. 4. The CSA expect that the manager will discuss with the IRC any instance where the IRC does not approve a proposed action, so that an alternative action satisfa ctory to both the manager and the IRC can be found, if possible. 5. The CSA consider that the ability of the manager to seek the removal of a member or members of the IRC under paragraph 3.10(2)(d) sufficiently addresses any con cern that a manager may have about an IRC's ongoing refusal to approve matters. 5.3 Matters subject to independent review committee recommendation (1) Before a manager may proceed with a proposed action under s ection 5.1 other than those set out in subsection 5.2(1), (a) the independent review committee must provide a recommendation to the manager as to whether, in the committee's opinion after reasonable inquiry, the proposed action achieves a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund; and (b) the manager must consider the recommendation of the independent review committee. (2) If the manager decides to proceed with an action in a conflict of interest matter that, in the opinion of the independent review committee after reasonable inquiry, does not achieve a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund under paragraph (1)(a), the manager must notify in writing the independent review committee before proceeding with the proposed action.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 70 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(3) Upon receiving the notification described in subsection (2), the independent review committee may require the manager to notify securityholders of the investment fund of the manager's decision. (4) A notification to securityholders under subsection (3) must (a) sufficiently describe the proposed action of the manager, the recommendation of the independent review committee and the manager's reasons for proceeding; (b) state the date of the proposed implementation of the action; and(c) be sent by the manager to each securityholder of the invest ment fund at least thirty days before the effective date of the proposed action. (5) The investment fund must, as soon as practicable, file the notification referred to in subsection (4) with the securities regulatory authority or regulator upon the notice being sent to securityholders. Commentary1. This section captures all conflict of interest matte rs a manager encounters other than those listed in subsection 5.2(1). This includes conflict of interest matters prohibite d or restricted by securities legislation not specified in subsection 5.2(1), and a manager's business and commerc ial decisions made on behalf of the investment fund that may be motivated, or be perceived to be motivat ed, by the manager's own interests rather than the best interests of the investment fund. Examples include: increasing charges to the investment fund for costs incurred by the manager in operating the fund; correcting material errors made by the manager in administering the investment fund; negotiating soft dollar arrangements with dealers with whom the manager places portfolio transactions for the investment fund; and choosing to bring services inhouse over using thirdparty service providers. The CSA expect that, in seeking guidance in identifying conflict of interest matters caught by this Instrument, among the factors the manager will look to for guidance to identify conflict of interest matterswill be industry best practices. However, the CSA also acknowledge that each manager will need to consider the nature of its investment fund operations in determining a conflict of interest matter. 2. The CSA expect the IRC's recommendation to state a positi ve or negative response as to whether they view the proposed action as achieving a fair and reasonable result for the investment fund. 3. For a proposed action in a conflict of interest matter under this section that is prohibited or restricted by securities legislation (but not specified in subsection 5.2(1)), a manager will still need to seek exemptive relief from the securities regulatory authorities. 4. Subsection (2) recognizes that, in exceptional circumstances, the manager may decide to proceed with a proposed course of action despite a negative recommendati on from the IRC. In such instances, subsection (2) requires the manager to notify the IRC before proceeding with the action. If the IRC determines that the proposed action is sufficiently important to warrant no tice to securityholders in the investment fund, the IRC has the authority to require the manager to give such notification before proceeding with the action. The CSA anticipate that the situation of a manager pro ceeding with a conflict of interest matter, despite a negative recommendation by the IRC, will occur infrequently. 5. The notification referred to in subsection (5) shoul d be filed on the SEDAR group profile number of the investment fund as a continuous disclosure document. 5.4 Standing instructions by the independent review committee (1) Despite section 5.1, the manager is not required to refer a conflict of intere st matter nor its proposed action to the independent review committee if the manager complies with the terms of a standing instruction that is in effect.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 71 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(2) For any action for which the independent review committee has provided a standing instruction, at the time of the independent review committee's regular a ssessment described in subsection 4.2(1), (a) the manager must provide a written report to the independent review committee describing each instance that it acted in reliance on a standing instruction; and (b) the independent review committee must (i) review and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the manager's written policies and procedures on the matter or on that type of matter with respect to all actions permitted by each standing instruction; (ii) review and assess the manager's and investment fund's compliance with any conditions imposed by it in each standing instruction; (iii) reaffirm or amend each standing instruction;(iv) establish new standing instructions, if necessary; and(v) advise the manager in writing of all changes to the standing instructions. (3) A manager may continue to rely on a standing instru ction under subsection (1) until such time as the independent review committee notifies the manager that the standing in struction has been amended or is no longer in effect. Commentary1. Section 5.4 recognizes that there are certain actions or categories of actions of the manager for which it may be appropriate for the IRC to choose to provide a standing instruction. For example, this may include amanager's ongoing voting of proxies on securities held by the investment fund when the manager has a business relationship with the issuer of the securities, or, a manager's decision to engage in interfund trading. 2. The CSA expect that, before providing or continuing a standing instruction to the manager for an action or category of actions, the IRC will have: reviewed the manager's written policies and procedures w ith respect to the action or category of actions; requested from the manager or other persons a report or certification to assist in deciding whether to give its approval or recommendation for the action or categor y of actions under subsection 5.2(1) or 5.3(1), as the case may be; considered whether a standing instruction for the par ticular action or category of actions is appropriate for the investment fund; and established very clear terms and conditions surrounding the standing instruction for the action or category of actions. An IRC may consider including in any standing instruc tion any terms or conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities. 3. As part of the IRC's review under subparagraph (2)(b)(ii) , the IRC is expected to be mindful of its reporting obligation under section 4.5 of this Instrument, which includes notifying the securities regulatory authorities of any instance where the manager, in proceeding with an action, did not meet a condition imposed by the IRC inits approval (this includes a standing instruction). 4. This section is intended to improve the flexibility and timeliness of the manager's decisi ons concerning a proposed course of action in a conflict of interest matter. Part 6 Exempted transactions 6.1 Inter-fund trades (1) In this sectionThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 72 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(a) \"current market price of the security\" means, (i) if the security is an exchangetraded secu rity or a foreign exchange-traded security, (A) the closing sale price on the day of the transac tion as reported on the exchange upon which the security is listed or the quotation trade reporting system upon which the security is quoted, or (B) if there are no reported transactions for the day of th e transaction, the average of the highest current bid and lowest current ask for the security as displa yed on the exchange upon which the security is listed or the quotation trade reporting system upon which the security is quoted, or (C) if the closing sale price on the day of the transacti on is outside of the closing bid and closing ask, the average of the highest current bid and lowest current ask for the security as displayed on the exchangeupon which the security is listed or the quotation trade reporting system upon which the security isquoted; or (ii) for all other securities, the average of the highest cu rrent bid and lowest current ask determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry; and (b) \"market integrity requirements\" means (i) if the security is an exchange-traded security, the purchase or sale (A) is printed on a marketplace that executes trades of the security; and(B) complies with the market conduct and display requi rements of the marketplace, its regulation services provider and securities regulatory authorities; or (ii) if the security is a foreign exchange-traded secur ity, the purchase or sale complies with the requirements that govern transparency and trading of foreign ex change-traded securities on the foreign exchange or foreign quotation and trade reporting system; or (iii) for all other securities, the purchase or sale is th rough a dealer, if the purchase or sale is required to be reported by a registered dealer under applicable securities legislation. (2) The portfolio manager of an investment fund may purchase a security of any issuer from, or sell a security of any issuer to, another investment fund managed by the same manage r or an affiliate of the manager, if, at the time of the transaction (a) the investment fund is purchasing from, or selling to, a nother investment fund to which this Instrument applies; (b) the independent review committee has appr oved the transaction under subsection 5.2(2); (c) the bid and ask price of the security is readily available;(d) the investment fund receives no consideration and the onl y cost for the trade is the nominal cost incurred by the investment fund to print or otherwise display the trade; (e) the transaction is executed at the current market price of the security; (f) the transaction is subject to market integrity requirements; and(g) the investment fund keeps written records, including (i) a record of each purchase and sale of securities;(ii) the parties to the trade; andThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 73 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.(iii) the terms of the purchase or sale for five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the trade occurred, the most recent two years in a reasonably accessible place. (3) The provisions of National Instrument 21-101 Marketplace Operation , and Part 6 and Part 8 of National Instrument 23-101 Trading Rules , do not apply to a portfolio manager or portfolio adviser of an investment fund, or an investment fund, with respect to a purchase or sale of a s ecurity referred to in subsection (2) if the purchase or sale is made in accordance with that subsection. (4) The inter-fund self-dealing investment prohibitions do not apply to a portfolio manager or portfolio adviser of an investment fund, or an investment fund, with respect to a purchase or sale of a security referred to in subsection (2) if the purchase or sale is made in accordance with that subsection. (5) The dealer registration requirement does not apply to a portfolio manager of an investment fund, with respect to a purchase or sale of a security referred to in subsection (2 ) if the purchase or sale is made in accordance with that subsection. (6) In subsection (5), \"dealer registration requirement\" has the meaning ascribed to that term in National Instrument 14- 101 Definitions . Commentary1. The term \"inter-fund self-dealing investment prohibitions\" is defined in section 1.5 of this Instrument. It is intended to capture the prohibitions in the securities legislation and certain regulations of each securities regulatory authority regarding inter-fund trades. 2. This section is intended to exempt investment funds from the prohibitions in the securities legislation and certain regulations that preclude inter-fund trades. It is not in tended to apply to securities issued by an investment fund that are purchased by another fund within the same fund family. The CSA are of the view that this section applies to inter-fund trades between fund families of the same manager provided the purchase or sale is made in accordance with subsection (2). 3. This section is also intended to provide a portfolio manager with a dealer registration exemption, where necessary, for inter-fund trades made in accordance with this section, but will not apply to any other activities of the portfolio manager. The exemption is based on co mpliance with this Instrument and the limitation of its application to prospectus-qualified investment funds. The CSA note that the Registration Reform project mayre-examine this exemption. 4. This section sets out the minimum conditions for inte r-fund trades to proceed without regulatory exemptive relief. An IRC may consider including in any approval any terms or conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities. 5. This section does not specify the policies and procedures that a manager must have to effect inter-fund trades. However, the CSA expect the manager's policies to include factors or criteria for allocating securities purchased for or sold by two or more investment funds managed by the manager; and ensuring that the terms of purchase or sale will be no less beneficial to the investment fund than those generally available to other market participants in arm's-length transactions. 6. The CSA expect that the IRC may give its approval in the form of a standing instruction under section 5.4, to give the manager greater flexibility to take advantage of perceived market opportunity. 7. Paragraph (2)(c) requires that the market quotations for the transactions be transparent. The CSA expect that if the price information is publicly available from a marketplace, newspaper or through a data vendor, for example, this will be the price. If the price is not public ly available, the CSA expect the investment fund to obtain at least one quote from an independent, arm's-length purc haser or seller, immediately before the purchase or sale.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 74 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.8. The CSA consider the requirement in paragraph (2)(f) to be a way to facilitate price discovery and integrity. The CSA believe this is essential to well-functioning and efficient capital markets. Subparagraph (1)(b)(iii) is intended to capture, for corporate debt securities, th e requirement, if applicable, to report the trade to CanPx, and for illiquid securities, the requirement, if applicable, to report the trade to the Canadian Unlisted Board(CUB). 9. Paragraph (2)(g) sets out the minimum expectations regarding the records an investment fund must keep of its inter-fund trades made in reliance on this section. Th e records should be detailed, and sufficient to establish a proper audit trail of the transactions. 6.2 Transactions in securi ties of related issuers (1) An investment fund may make or hold an investment in the s ecurity of an issuer related to it, its manager, or an entity related to the manager, if (a) at the time that the investment is made, (i) the independent review committee has approve d the investment under subsection 5.2(2); and (ii) the purchase is made on an exchange on which the securities of the issuer are listed and traded; and (b) no later than the time the investment fund files its a nnual financial statements, the manager of the investment fund files with the securities regulatory authority or regulator the particulars of the investment. (2) The mutual fund conflict of interest investment restrictions do not apply to a mutual fund with respect to an investment referred to in subsection (1) if the investment is made in accordance with that subsection. (3) In subsection (2), \"mutual fund conflict of interest investment restrictions\" has the meaning ascribed to that term in National Instrument 81-102 Mutual Funds . (4) In Quebec, Section 236 of the Securities Regulation does not apply to a portfolio adviser or registered person acting under a management contract with respect to an investment referred to in subsection (1) on behalf of an investment fund, if the investment is made in accordance with that subsection. Commentary1. This section is intended to relieve investment funds in Quebec, and mutual funds elsewhere in Canada, from the prohibitions in the securities legislation of each s ecurities regulatory authority that preclude investments in securities of related issuers. 2. This section sets out the minimum conditions for purc hases to proceed without regulatory exemptive relief. An IRC may consider including in any approval any terms or conditions in prior exemptive relief orders, waivers or approvals obtained from the securities regulatory authorities. The CSA expect that the IRC may give its approval in the form of a standing instruction as described in section 5.4 to allow the manager greater flexibility in its decisions. 3. This section contemplates that the manager will comply with the applicable reporting requirements under securities legislation for each purchase. The filing refe rred to in paragraph (1)(b) should be filed on the SEDAR group profile number of the investment fund, as a continuous disclosure document. 4. If an IRC gives its approval for the investment fund to pur chase securities of an issuer described in this section, and then subsequently withdraws its approval for additional purchases, the CSA will not consider the continued holding of the securities to be subject to subsection 1.2(b) of the Instrument. However, we will expect the manager to consider whether continuing to hold those securities is a conflict of interest matter that subsection 1.2(a) of the Instrument would require the manager to refer to the IRC.The Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 75 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.Part 7 Exemptions 7.1 Exemptions (1) The securities regulatory authority or regulator may grant an exemption from this Instrument, in whole or in part, subject to such conditions or restricti ons as may be imposed in the exemption. (2) Despite subsection (1), in Ontario only the regulator may grant such an exemption. 7.2 Existing exemptions, waivers or approvals Any exemption, waiver or approval under a provision of secur ities legislation that was effective before this Instrument came into force and that deals with the matters that this In strument regulates, will expire one year after this Instrument comes into force. Commentary1. The CSA have, in a number of jurisdictions, granted exemptions and waivers from the conflict of interest and self-dealing provisions in securities legislation to permit the manager and/or the investment fund to make investments not otherwise permitted by securities legisl ation. Some of those exemptions and waivers contained \"sunset\" provisions that provided for the expiry of the exemption or waiver upon the coming into force of legislation or a CSA policy or rule that effectively provides for fund governance. For greater certainty, the CSA note that the coming into fo rce of section 7.2 of this Instrument will effectively cause all exemptions and waivers that deal with the matters regulated by this Instrument n not just those exemptions and waivers that deal with the matters under subsection 5.2(1) n to expire one year after its coming into force whether or not they contained a \"sunset\" provision. Part 8 Effective date 8.1 Effective date This Instrument comes into force on November 1, 2006. 8.2 Transition (1) Despite section 8.1, this Instrument does not apply to an investment fund until the earlier of (a) the date on which the manager provides to the securities regulatory authority or regulator the notification referred to in subsection (4); and (b) the date one year after this Instrument comes into force. (2) Despite subsection (1), six months from the date this Inst rument comes into force the manager must appoint the first members of the independent review committee under section 3.2 in compliance with this Instrument. (3) Despite section 4.4, the independent review committee's first report to securityholders must be completed by the 120 th day after the end of the first financial year of the investment fund to which this Instrument applies. (4) A manager of an investment fund must notify the secur ities regulatory authority or regulator in writing if it intends to comply with this Instrument prior to the expiration of the transition period under subsection (1). (5) The notification referred to in subsecti on (4) is satisfied if the notification is made to the investment fund's principal regulator. CommentaryThe Royal Gazette, Wednesday, January 10, 2007 76 \u00a9 NS Office of the Royal Gazette. Web version.1. Section 8.2 is intended to address transitional concerns. The CSA expect that all investment funds will be compliant with this Instrument following the expiry of the transition period under subsection 8.2(1), twelve months afte r the Instrument is in force. For an investment fund established after the expiry of the transition period, it is expected that the investment fund will be compliant with this Instrument before any purchase order for securities of the investment fund is accepted. 2. Subsection 8.2(2) allows a manager an extra six months from the date this Instrument is in force to appoint the initial members of the IRC. While a six month transition period exists for the appointme nt of IRC members, the CSA strongly encourage a timely appointment of the IRC by the manager so that within the twelve month transitional period there issufficient time for the IRC to adopt its charter, to r eview the manager's policies and procedures, and to review (subject to manager referral) any existing conflict of interest matters. The transition period is also intended to give the manage r sufficient time to refer existing and new conflict of interest matters to the IRC for its review and determination. 3. The CSA anticipate a manager or investment fund may wish to rely on the Instrument before the expiry of the transition period so that it may proceed with IRC approval for an otherwise prohibited or restricted transaction in securities legislation described in subsection 5.2(1). This may not occur unless there is complete compliance with the Instrument. Subsection (4) is intended to assist the CSA in knowing which managers of investment fundsare proceeding in this manner before the expiry of the transition period. 4. For investment funds established before the expiry of the transition period, the CSA expect the manager to establish policies and procedures on any conflict of in terest matters (if they do not already have them), and to refer to the IRC these policies and procedures and any deci sions related to such matters prior to the end of the transition period. 5. The CSA do not consider a manager's organization of an investment fund (such as the initial setting of fees or the initial choice of service providers) to be subject to IRC review, unless the manager's decisions give rise to a conflict of interest concerning the manager's obligati ons to existing investment funds within the manager's fund family. However, the CSA expect the manager will establish policies and procedures for any conflict of interest matters arising from the investment fund's organiza tion or otherwise, and refer to the IRC these policies and procedures and any decisions related to such matters. It is anticipated that the manager will wish to engage the IRC early in the establishment of the investment fund to ensure the IRC is adequately informed of potential new conflicts of interest. 6. An investment fund, whether established before or after the date this Instrument comes into force, has a total transition period of up to twelve months from the date the Instrument comes into force to comply with theInstrument. Only if the manager of an investment fund intends to comply with the Instrument in its entirety beforethe expiry of the transition period is the notice in subsection (4) required. 7. It is expected that investment funds will incorporate any new disclosure obligations arising out of this Instrument as part of their annual prospectus renewal or continuous disclosure filing following the expiry of the transition period. 8. The CSA do not consider the expenses incurred by exi sting investment funds in establishing an IRC under this Instrument to be caught by section 5.1 of NI 81-102. We do not view section 5.1 as intending to capture the costs associated with compliance by an investm ent fund with new regulatory requirements.

As a result, NI 81-107 sometimes repeats (without any substantive change) certain requirements that are also dealt with in sections 112 to 128 of the Act. The cumulative effect of NI 81-107 and the Implementing Rule is that the standard of care and fiduciary duty required under section 2.1 of NI 81-107 is the same standard of care and fiduciary duty imposed under section 124 of the Act for a manager of a mutual fund, and sections 6.1 and 6. 2 of NI 81-107 provide for exemptions from some of the prohibitions in sections 112 to 128 of the Act. A manager of a mutual fund that is a reporting issuer can and should therefore refer to section 2.1 of NI 81-107 in place of section 124 of the Act, and investment funds or mutual funds, respectively, should refer to sections 6. 1 and 6.2 of NI 81-107 to see if the exemptions from the prohibitions contained in sections 112 to 128 of the Act are met. 1.3 Consequential Amendments to the General Securities Rules - The Implementing Rule also contains consequential amendments to sections 32 and 67 of the General Securities Rules and a provision which permits an issuer to use the amended Form 15 in the Ontario Regulation to the Securities Act (Ontario). 1.4 Effective Date - This Companion Policy comes into effect on February 19, 2007.
