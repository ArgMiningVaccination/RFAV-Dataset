It is also known as Jalbramhi or Indian pennywort. Mandukaprni has been used as Ayurvedic medicine in India for thousands of years, and it is mentioned in the historic Indian medical text called 'Sushruta Samhita'. This plant is found throughout India. It is grown in tropical and subtropical countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, South Africa, Madagascar, South Pacific, and Eastern Europe.1 In addition to the Ayurvedic system of medicine, mandukaparni has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine.2 Mandukaparni contains proteins, carbohydrates, dietary fibres, fats, vitamins A, B, and C; minerals include iron, sodium, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, and range of properties like: Also Read: [Saraswatarishta: Uses, Benefits & Side](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/ayurveda-uses-benefits-side-effects-of-saraswatarishta/) [ Effects](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/ayurveda-uses-benefits-side-effects-of-saraswatarishta/) Potential uses of mandukaparni against many health conditions are given below. Several preclinical (animal) studies have demonstrated the wound healing benefits of mandukaparni. It may help in wound healing by promoting skin thickening, cell growth, and tissue regeneration. In addition, Mandukaparni might strengthen newly formed skin, reduce inflammation, and provide antioxidant properties. Antioxidants play an essential role in the wound healing process.1 However, you must consult a healthcare provider if you encounter any wounds. Avoid using any herbs and remedies without a doctor's consultation. According to animal studies, mandukaparni was found to show antidepressant properties. Certain compounds called triterpenes present in mandukaparni may be responsible for this activity. Mandukaparni could also increase dopamine levels (neurotransmitters) in the brain. An increase in the levels of dopamine might help deal with depression.1 If you are suffering from any brain condition, you must talk to your healthcare provider. Do not take any for the brain without consulting with your doctor first. Animal studies of mandukaparni could show a reduction in seizures and improvement in learning deficits caused by seizures. The findings also suggested that mandukaparni might be an adjuvant to anti-seizure drugs, with the benefit of preventing cognitive impairment (trouble in learning, remembering, and concentrating). Leaf extract of mandukaparni has also been shown to have anticonvulsive properties.1 The benefits of mandukaparni against seizures have been observed in animal studies. Mandukaparni may have some benefits in improving concentration, increasing attention span, and reducing oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes Alzheimer's, and cognitive impairment is caused by free radical generation. Mandukaparni effectively prevented cognitive deficits and oxidative stress during an animal trial. In addition, it may show the potential to boost antioxidant enzymes and protect neurons (nerve cells) from oxidative damage.Therefore, mandukaparni might be used for the management of Alzheimer's disease.1However, it should not be used as an alternative to medicinal treatment. More studies are required to support the use of mandukaparni in humans. You must, adhere to the doctor's advice and treatment for conditions related to brain. In a lab study, mandukaparni extract effectively prevented alcohol-induced stomach lesions. It could strengthen the stomach mucosal barrier and reduce the damage caused by free radicals. Mandukaparni could also promote stomach ulcer wound healing through its anti-inflammatory properties. The effectiveness of mandukaparni in wound healing has also been proved by clinical studies (human trials).1Therefore, it may be used in managing stomach lesions. However, you need to consult your healthcare provider if you have any stomach problems. Self-medicating with herbs may worsen the condition. In animal studies, it was shown that mandukaparni extract could provide significant relief from pain and inflammation. It is also revealed that oral administration of mandukaparni could reduce the severity of arthritis. Mandukaparni also prevented joint destruction. In preclinical studies, mandukaparni successfully prevented the onset of arthritis and provided relief from its symptoms.1 Mandukaparni may help manage heart diseases. The main components that might be responsible for these benefits are Asiaticoside and Asiatic acid. Several animal studies have shown that mandukaparni may effectively improve heart conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis (a thickening of the blood vessel walls caused due to fat deposition), and cardiac ischaemia (deficient blood supply to the heart muscle).4 However, heart diseases are severe health conditions. Therefore, you must strictly adhere to the doctor's advice and treatment. According to several lab studies, mandukaparni showed promising results in reducing high blood pressure. This effect of mandukaparni on hypertension may be due to the antihypertensive properties of Asiatic acid.4 However, you are advised not to use mandukaparni as an alternative to medicinal treatment. If you are suffering from high blood pressure, consult your healthcare provider before using herbs for your symptoms. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of mandukaparni may be beneficial in various skin conditions like acne, baldness, and atopic dermatitis (skin itching and inflammation). Because of its anti-inflammatory property, it may reduce the inflammation associated with skin conditions. It may also lower oxidative stress through its antioxidant activity.4 If you are suffering from any skin conditions, you need to reach out to a skin doctor and get proper treatment. Avoid using any herbs for your skin without consulting with a doctor first. Though there are studies showing the benefits of manukaparni in various conditions, these are insufficient, and there is a need for further studies to establish the true extent of the benefits of mandukaparni on human health. I want to highlight that the water-based extract of Mandukaparni may have shown beneficial effects in rats. It may help alleviate intestinal spasms caused by barium chloride, reduce spontaneous contractions of the muscles of the intestine, and relax the muscles of the isolated ileum. However, more studies on humans are needed to verify its impact.

Likewise, do not discontinue or replace an ongoing treatment of modern medicine with an ayurvedic/herbal preparation without consulting a qualified doctor. Did you know that Mandukaparni is not only great for healing wounds but may also have been recommended for managing various conditions like leprosy, lupus, and varicose ulcers?

Also, before using mandukaparni for any health benefits, make sure you have consulted your doctor about the possible side effects associated with its use. Then, it will help you make well-informed choices.

It seems to have been valued for its potential benefits in addressing these specific health concerns.
