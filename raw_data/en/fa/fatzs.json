Full Text of the Announcement](#_Part_2._Full) [Section I. Funding Opportunity Description](#_Section_I._Funding) [Section II. Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports extramural research focused on understanding, controlling and preventing diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. In response to threats presented by emerging infectious diseases, the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has established research programs to facilitate development of countermeasures for certain pathogens. The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to solicit research applications for projects focused on preclinical development of lead candidate therapeutics or vaccines (or related countermeasures) that address select NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens, as defined below. For the purpose of this FOA, \"lead candidate\" is defined as a candidate product, or a collection of optimized products (e.g. lead candidate series), for which proof-of-concept data have been obtained and \"preclinical development\" is defined as all activities beyond lead candidate identification. Examples of supported research areas include: lead optimization; efficacy testing, safety evaluation; stability testing; manufacturing; development of broad spectrum platforms and/or production technologies; optimization of products or technologies; process development; scale-up; production of quantities sufficient for preclinical regulatory requirements; and IND-enabling activities required for initiation of Phase I clinical trials. Priority will be given to projects that address the greatest public health concerns. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) support development of countermeasures to protect the public from infectious diseases. In 2002, the NIH initiated development of strategic plans to counter threats presented by emerging infectious diseases. As a component of these plans, NIAID was assigned responsibility for research leading to and development of candidate countermeasures against a growing list of emerging pathogens. NIAID established the Partnerships program to support discovery, preclinical research, product development and eventual commercialization of candidate products that address specific pathogens/agents. This FOA reflects current priorities outlined in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research, the HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE) Strategy and Implementation Plan, the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), the National Action Plan for Combating Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis, the HHS 2010 Medical Countermeasure Review, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 18: Medical Countermeasures against Weapons of Mass Destruction. The objective of this FOA is to support milestone-driven preclinical research that will advance the development and/or production of lead candidate therapeutics or vaccines (or related products) for select Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens described below. Each application must propose a research and development project whose goal is to advance an already identified lead candidate. Proposed projects are not required to result in a \"final\" product, nor is it necessary to propose completion of the product development process up to the point of readiness for clinical trials or validation within the time frame of the project. Applications that would significantly advance a candidate product toward clinical or field usefulness are responsive and encouraged. Required industrial participation on applications from academic institutions (see below) will facilitate appropriate and validated product development activities. Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) are strongly encouraged to obtain expertise in the areas of product development planning and target product profile development in general, and regulatory matters in particular. Expertise needed to fulfill project objectives may be retained as defined effort or may be included as periodic consultation on specific issues. Descriptions of supported countermeasure development activities and targeted pathogen categories are presented below: Therapeutics This FOA will support preclinical development of therapeutics against select NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens (antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and emerging viral pathogens; see below), including immune-based and host-targeted forms, with emphasis on broad-spectrum therapeutics and those targeting pathogens for which no standard clinical treatment exists or for which drug resistance poses a significant public health concern. Therapeutics of interest include small molecules, biopharmaceuticals, nucleic acids, or peptides to be used as monotherapy or in combination, or as adjunctive therapy, with other drugs. Projects must initiate with a single candidate therapeutic or lead candidate series. For projects initiating with a lead series, down-selection to a single lead candidate must be accomplished within the first two years of the project period. Immune-based therapeutic projects may focus on broad-spectrum or pathogen-specific immunotherapeutics. Of particular interest are immunotherapeutics that would enable prevention of infection or intoxication in the face of an immediate threat, protection of immunocompromised individuals, or post-exposure treatment to suppress infection and disease. NIAID encourages development of immunotherapeutics that directly affect pathogens and/or therapeutic approaches to stimulate non-specific immunity. Passive treatments may be especially valuable during the acute emergence of infectious diseases and may complement the use of antimicrobial drugs or vaccination programs to optimize protection. Host-targeted therapeutic projects must focus on a host-encoded function required for infection, replication, spread and/or pathogenesis by one or more pathogens. Host-targeted therapeutic candidates that act primarily by stimulating the host immune response through direct regulation of interferon expression will be considered non-responsive. For host-targeted intervention projects, applicants must clearly define the specific required host-pathogen interaction(s) for development of the corresponding targeted therapeutic(s). NIAID encourages development of therapeutics that target specific host functions/pathways that are required for infection and pathogenesis by unrelated pathogens. Of particular importance for novel host-targeted therapeutics is consideration of proposed work that directly addresses the clinical and regulatory pathway to product registration and potential hurdles such as demonstration of pathogen susceptibility and therapeutic efficacy using non-standard in vitro assays and in vivo disease models, as well as potential toxicity issues. Applications for development of a broad spectrum anti-infective against multiple targeted Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens are encouraged. A broad-spectrum therapeutic is defined as a therapeutic agent that targets a common, invariable, or essential component of different strains or classes of microbes, or one that targets a host function required for infection and/or disease. Each therapeutic development project supported by this FOA must focus on a previously-identified, well-characterized lead candidate (or lead candidate series) that targets one or more pathogen(s) from either of the following select pathogen categories: Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria/Fungi This initiative will support development of new or improved therapeutics for select pathogens for which drug resistance poses a significant public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one pathogen listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 report. Projects focused on drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis are limited to development and/or evaluation of therapeutic entities that are not currently licensed for another indication (that is, projects focused on repurposed drugs are excluded). Antibacterial categories supported by this FOA include, but are not limited to, narrow-spectrum drugs, broad-spectrum drugs, innovative therapeutic approaches/strategies, drugs targeting novel mechanisms, or adjunctive therapeutics. Emerging Viral Pathogens This initiative will support development of new or improved therapeutics for emerging viral pathogens of public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one viral pathogen on the NIAID Emerging Infectious Diseases/Pathogens list ( [https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/emerging-infectious-diseases-pathogens)). Antiviral categories supported by this FOA include, but are not limited to, broad-spectrum antivirals, immunotherapeutics, or host-targeted therapeutics. Therapeutics projects supported by this FOA may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following preclinical activities: Vaccines Vaccines are the most effective method of protecting the public against infectious diseases. This FOA will support development of candidate vaccines (including immunoprophylactics) against emerging pathogens, focusing on multivalent/universal forms or vaccines targeting specific pathogens (see below). Development of candidate vaccines should initiate with previously-identified, well-characterized immunogens. Projects are expected to include proof-of-concept in animal models, preclinical evaluation, and if warranted, scale-up production under GMP to provide sufficient quantities for pre-clinical FDA-required animal studies and early clinical evaluations. Projects must focus on development of a lead candidate vaccine aligned with one of the following categories: Multivalent/Universal Vaccines Multivalent or universal vaccines are defined as broad-spectrum vaccines that provide protection against a group of taxonomically-related pathogens, or two or more unrelated pathogens. Vaccines characterized by broad-spectrum activity in this class include cross-protective forms, which induce an immune response against constant components of two or more microbes, and multiple component forms, which include elements that protect against microbes that are different, and may or may not be related. Examples of this vaccine category include, but are not limited to, a universal influenza vaccine or a multivalent vaccine that protects against multiple flaviviruses. Vaccines Against Antimicrobial-Resistant Bacteria/Fungi This initiative will support development of candidate vaccines targeting select bacterial/fungal pathogens for which drug resistance poses a significant public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one pathogen listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 report. Note that NIAID currently supports development of candidate vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under [RFA-AI-16-079](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AI-16-079.html) (Partnerships for Development of Vaccines to Prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection and/or Tuberculosis Disease (R01)). Accordingly, this FOA will not support projects focused on development of a vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Vaccines Against Select Emerging Viruses This initiative will support development of candidate vaccines targeting emerging viral pathogens of public health concern. Responsive applications must target at least one viral pathogen listed in the World Health Organization Priority Diseases Needing R&D Actions, 2017 revision ( [http://www.who.int/csr/research-and-development/list_of_pathogens/en/](http://www.who.int/csr/research-and-development/list_of_pathogens/en/)). For all vaccine projects, approaches should consider the ultimate potential of a candidate vaccine to quickly induce safe and protective responses in a diverse civilian population. Vaccine projects may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following product development activities: All projects submitted by academic institutions to this FOA must include substantive investment by at least one industry participant. For the purpose of this FOA, \"industry\" is defined as a large or small, domestic or foreign, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, bioengineering, or chemical company, or a related non-profit entity with an established track record in product development, and \"substantive investment\" is defined as a significant commitment of one or more resources to the project including, but not limited to: project and product development guidance/support (consultation), personnel, in kind contributions of materials and/or reagents (i.e. chemical libraries, innovative biotechnology platforms, scale up of cGMP chemical synthesis or production, etc.), provision of animal or other laboratory models for evaluation, subcontracts, data management resources, regulatory support, or alterations/renovations of facilities or provision of equipment to address biohazard concerns. For projects with consultation-only investment, the industrial partner must commit a specific level of effort (concomitant to stage of preclinical and/or product development activities) that is included in the requested budget. Support for industrial partner activities may be included in the project budget. There is no requirement for an academic participant on applications submitted by industrial organizations. Applications including the following will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed: [See ] [Section VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) for award authorities and regulations. Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.

Applicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in [the policy](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=82299). Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is there a strong scientific premise for the project? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Is this project likely to significantly advance the development of a candidate therapeutic or vaccine against one or more of the select pathogens identified in this initiative? If the aims of the application are achieved, is an important biomedical countermeasure or product likely to result? Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? For applications from academic institutions, does the applicant describe the substantive investment and participation in the project of an industry participant? Will the industrial participation facilitate candidate product development and achievement of proposed objectives? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? For applications from academic institutions, does the research plan leverage appropriate industry involvement to facilitate candidate product development, some aspects of which may not be inherently innovative? Does the approach represent the best use of current or emerging technologies and appropriate collaborations to achieve the research objectives? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. Product Development Strategy Is the Product Development Strategy well-conceived and appropriate for the proposed countermeasure category? Are the Milestones and Timelines proposed to achieve the goals of the project appropriate and feasible? Does the applicant propose quantitative criteria by which the milestones achievement will be assessed and are the criteria relevant for assessing the proposed product development? Is the proposed Product Development Plan feasible and appropriate for proposed and future product development? For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following criteria: (1) description of proposed procedures involving animals, including species, strains, ages, sex, and total number to be used; (2) justifications for the use of animals versus alternative models and for the appropriateness of the species proposed; (3) interventions to minimize discomfort, distress, pain and injury; and (4) justification for euthanasia method if NOT consistent with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Reviewers will assess the use of chimpanzees as they would any other application proposing the use of vertebrate animals. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. Not Applicable Not Applicable Not Applicable As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will consider each of the following items, but will not give scores for these items, and should not consider them in providing an overall impact score.

Reviewers will comment on whether the following Resource Sharing Plans, or the rationale for not sharing the following types of resources, are reasonable: (1) [Data Sharing Plan](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11151); (2) [Sharing Model Organisms](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11152); and (3) [ Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11153). For projects involving key biological and/or chemical resources, reviewers will comment on the brief plans proposed for identifying and ensuring the validity of those resources. Reviewers will consider whether the budget and the requested period of support are fully justified and reasonable in relation to the proposed research. Applications will be evaluated for scientific and technical merit by (an) appropriate Scientific Review Group(s) convened by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , in accordance with [NIH peer review policy and procedures](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11154), using the stated [review criteria](#_1._Criteria). Assignment to a Scientific Review Group will be shown in the eRA Commons. As part of the scientific peer review, all applications: [Appeals](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-11-064.html) of initial peer review will not be accepted for applications submitted in response to this FOA. Applications will be assigned on the basis of established PHS referral guidelines to the appropriate NIH Institute or Center. Applications will compete for available funds with all other recommended applications submitted in response to this FOA . Following initial peer review, recommended applications will receive a second level of review by the National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council . The following will be considered in making funding decisions: After the peer review of the application is completed, the PD/PI will be able to access his or her Summary Statement (written critique) via the [eRA Commons](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11123). Refer to Part 1 for dates for peer review, advisory council review, and earliest start date. Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11156). If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request \"just-in-time\" information from the applicant as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157). A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the grantee's business official. Awardees must comply with any funding restrictions described in [Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions](#_5._Funding_Restrictions). Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Grantees, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights law. This means that recipients of HHS funds must ensure equal access to their programs without regard to a person's race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, sex and religion. This includes ensuring your programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. HHS provides general guidance to recipients of FFA on meeting their legal obligation to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful access to their programs by persons with limited English proficiency. Please see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/resources/laws/revisedlep.html. The HHS Office for Civil Rights also provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html); and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html). Recipients of FFA also have specific legal obligations for serving qualified individuals with disabilities. Please see [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/disability/index.html). Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/office/about/rgn-hqaddresses.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. Also note it is an HHS Departmental goal to ensure access to quality, culturally competent care, including long-term services and supports, for vulnerable populations. For further guidance on providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services, recipients should review the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care at [http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53](http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlid=53). In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Cooperative Agreement Terms and Conditions of Award Not Applicable When multiple years are involved, awardees will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161) [A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the ] [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11161). The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for awardees of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All awardees of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
