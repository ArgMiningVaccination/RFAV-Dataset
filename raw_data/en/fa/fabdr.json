MEDICAL DEVELOPMENT GROUP BOSTON - EVENTS The [Medical Development Group Boston](https://www.mdgboston.org/) (MDG Boston) is a community of individuals professionally committed to the Medical Device and other Medical Technology Industry segments united by the belief that innovation and advances in technology lead to substantial improvements in health care. MDG's Mission is to contribute to the continuing development of medical devices and other medical technologies by enhancing the professional development of its members, fostering and supporting entrepreneurial thinking, serving as a forum for exploration of new business opportunities, and promoting best practices in enterprise management. MDG pursues this mission through the organization of educational programs and forums: the facilitation of cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration; the creation of venues for networking and information sharing for current and aspiring professionals, clinicians, and entrepreneurs; and the development of alliances with complementary organizations.

MEDTECH BOSTON INFORMATION SOURCE & CALENDAR OF EVENTS Boston has long been known as a medical mecca of scientific discovery. Boston's healthcare professionals and administrators are adopting practices from other high-risk and service industries. The 'big data' movement is thriving, fundamentally changing our healthcare delivery systems. Digital health investments are higher than ever before. Medical hackathons and un-conferences are now an every-weekend occurrence. And both redesign and innovation promise to change medicine as we know it. It's all happening right here, right now. But the problem is that many of us don't know it. Despite Boston's innovative energy and a solid medical infrastructure, many medical providers and health care entrepreneurs remain in the dark about the opportunities, events and work happening in and around the city of Boston - and across the country. That's where we come in. At Medtech Boston, we highlight exciting medical innovation work in and around the city of Boston. We aim to start a discussion about the most exciting and controversial new healthcare offerings, igniting a new reputation for Boston as a city with first-class medical research and patient care, but also as a city full of passionate people who use new technology to think big thoughts about medicine's most pressing problems. More organizational information and event postings from Medtech Boston is available [here](https://medtechboston.medstro.com/).

FLIPPING FAILURE - PEER SUPPORT COMMUNITY RESOURCE [Flipping Failure](https://flippingfailure.mit.edu/) is a collection of video stories told by MIT students about their path towards resilience when faced with challenge at MIT. The goal of this community initiative is to provide visibility to stories of academic challenge and resilience so that we can begin shifting the conversation around struggle from something to be ashamed of to something that is human. Struggling is not only part of the human experience, but it is often the result of tackling difficult challenges and learning experiences. We hope that watching peers talk about their challenges and hearing about the productive and healthy strategies they used to cope will help other students discover their own path towards resilience and self-acceptance. Thanks to Our Partners: Support Services (S3)](http://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) If you are interested in learning more about Flipping Failure or would like to contribute your story, please contact flippingfailure [at] mit.edu (flippingfailure[at]mit[dot]edu).

THREE POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS - CHAIKOF LAB - HMS 1 - Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Immunity and Tissue Repair: Harvard Medical School Postdoctoral research fellowship available in [the laboratory of Dr. Elliot Chaikof](https://www.chaikoflab.org/) for a candidate with an interest in the role of the innate immune system in tissue repair and regeneration with a particular focus on the development of therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The candidate is expected to closely interact with an interdisciplinary team of medicinal chemists and GI pathologists to support this drug discovery program. The project will focus on the evaluation of modulators of mucosal immunity and intestinal epithelial repair processes using animal models of colitis and gut organoid assay systems (see Science Advances 2020; 6:eaay8230).

Research Collaborator: Omer Yilmaz, MD, PhD (Biology, MIT) - echaikof [at] bidmc.harvard.edu (echaikof[at]bidmc[dot]harvard[dot]edu). 2 - Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Thrombosis: Harvard Medical School Postdoctoral research fellowship position available in [the laboratory of Dr. Elliot Chaikof](https://www.chaikoflab.org/) for a candidate with an interest in defining the prothrombotic pathways and/or biomarkers of increased thrombotic risk among patients with cancer, particularly those with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The candidate is expected to closely interact with an interdisciplinary team of hematologists, oncologists, and medicinal chemists in support of a related drug discovery program. The project will focus on defining the underlying mechanisms that promote a prothrombotic phenotype using animal models of patient derived tumor organoids and organoid assay systems. This program is a component project within the NIH CLOT (Consortium Linking Oncology with Thrombosis) Consortium. Second only to the underlying malignancy, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. VTE can delay the initiation of cancer treatment and is associated with worse survival. Once VTE occurs, cancer patients have a three- to four-fold higher rate of VTE recurrence compared to patients without cancer. VTE risk is particularly high among patients with pancreatic cancer, but only a subset will develop a VTE. Significantly, the underlying mechanisms that promote a prothrombotic phenotype have not been established nor has the relationship between procoagulant phenotype and tumor subtype based on gene expression signature been defined. PhD in molecular biology, immunology, tumor biology, biomedical engineering or related discipline required. Responsibilities - Integrate knowledge from tumor biology, molecular genetics, and immunology to determine the molecular mechanisms that promote cancer-associated thrombosis. - Initiate and direct experiments that utilize murine models of patient derived tumor organoids. - Apply a variety of in vitro tools, including organoid assay systems and conduct molecular and cellular bioassays, flow cytometry, as well as immunohistochemical studies to characterize the relationship between phenotype, tumor subtype, host immune response, and gene expression signature. Requirements - Requires a PhD in molecular biology, immunology, tumor biology, biomedical engineering or related discipline. - The candidate is expected to closely interact with a multidisciplinary team to define underlying molecular mechanisms that promote cancer associated thrombosis and related biomarkers of risk. - Experience in cell and molecular biology, flow cytometry, other complex bioassays, as well as in vivo studies using mouse models. - Must be an energetic, out-of-box thinker with positive attitude. Excellent written and oral communication skills are required, as is the desire and ability to work in a multidisciplinary environment. - Expert knowledge of scientific principles and concepts.
