See how Traditional Chinese Medicine can help Key takeaways: Adrenal fatigue is a post-industrial disease. It happens when your adrenal glands are not operating at an optimal level. Deprivation of essential vitamins, especially B, exacerbates it. Traditional Chinese Medicine can address adrenal fatigue and vastly improve it. Today's society is suffering from an epidemic of adrenal fatigue syndrome, a relatively new disease that has evolved since the industrial revolution. The main driving force behind this epidemic is the [depletion of our soils, which affects the vitamins we consume](https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/05/07/soil-depletion-human-security/). Our frenzied, modern lifestyle and commercial farming have had negative effects on our hormones. In this article, we explore what adrenal fatigue syndrome is and how our changing soil quality and stress levels cause it. What is adrenal fatigue syndrome? Adrenal fatigue syndrome describes a series of symptoms that arise as a result of vitamin deficiency and prolonged exposure to stress. Symptoms include fatigue, body aches, sleep disturbances, nervousness, and digestive problems. Does this mean that every time you feel tired or achy, you're suffering from adrenal fatigue? Not exactly. But, it does mean that you should monitor your symptoms and seek medical guidance, rather than ignore them. The causes of adrenal fatigue Adrenal fatigue happens when your adrenal glands are not operating at the necessary level. To know why this happens, you need to understand their role in the first place. Adrenal glands are the small organs just above your kidneys that are responsible for helping you respond to stress by releasing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline that quicken your heart rate and increase your blood pressure. They also help regulate your metabolism, immune system, blood pressure, and other essential functions. One of the key factors that help your adrenal glands function properly is your diet and the [essential vitamins](https://www.eacuwell.com/blog/vitamins-and-healthy-foods) it provides like vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, and B12. Our nutrient-depleted soils are driving the adrenal fatigue epidemic because: Foods that were once rich in vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) now contain very little of this essential nutrient, so our bodies are unable to respond appropriately to physical and emotional stress. Other vital nutrients like vitamins B1, B2, and B3, which are essential to the operation of the adrenal glands, the balance of hormones, and the regulation of our mood, are also deficient in our present diet, especially in fast food and prepackaged items. This lack of regulatory factors causes an overflow of adrenal hormones which causes the adrenal glands to experience burnout. Vitamin B12, which is necessary for controlling the rhythm of cortisol secretion, is also deficient mainly due to the [sort of feed we give the livestock](http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-degradation-restoration/global-soil-health-indicators-and-assessment/soil-heath-biological-and-chemical/en/)we eat, which are our main source of the nutrient. Feeding livestock a corn diet of genetically modified seeds that have been sprayed with pesticides and herbicides decreases the nutrients we consume. Vitamin B8, or inositol, which regulates adrenaline-induced stress responses, is also deficient in today's diet. Vitamin C, which is most prevalent in our adrenal tissues, is important for the reduction of cortisol in the body. The deficiency in this nutrient causes a decrease in glutathione, a compound responsible for reducing free radicals and fighting stress and age-related adrenal fatigue. Zinc, copper, and manganese are also important trace minerals that are lacking in our foods, but which are crucial in helping certain enzymes neutralize free radicals. These are just some of the vitamins, minerals, and nutrients sourced from food that your body needs to prevent conditions such as adrenal fatigue, insomnia, hormonal imbalances, mood disorders, inflammatory conditions, and more.
