Good sources of essential mineral s include fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, beans and dairy products. Unfortunately, much of the soil in which food is g rown has been depleted of these nutritive minerals, therefore the mineral content in food is reduced.3,4 We also obtain some minerals from the water we drink, but the amounts vary widely. Mineral availability and absorption is also affecte d as foods are cooked, processed and refined, and m any naturally occurring minerals in food are removed.5, 6 A daily mineral s upplement is not a substitute for a healthy diet, b ut can ensure we get the minerals we need for optimal health.

They exist naturally on and in the earth and many ar e critical parts of human tissue and are termed \"essential\" nutrients. Of the 92 naturally occurrin g elements, the 14 minerals that have been shown by research to be essential to human health are: calcium, chromium, copper, fluorine, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium and zinc .*1 Essential macrominerals are those we need in significant quantities (such as calcium) - usually measured in milligrams, and essential trace minerals are those we need in minute quantities (such as se lenium) - usually measured in micrograms (one microgram [mcg] equals 1/1,000th of a milligram [mg]). On This Page Macro Minerals Trace Minerals Non-Essential Electrolytes Calcium is the most important, and most common, min eral we need. Eating a diet rich in nutrients that help your bones stay strong should be the first step in stopping or slowing the process of osteoporosis. Calcium, magn esium, vitamin D, phosphorus, soy-based foods and fluoride compose th e major nutrients that strengthen bone. At this mo ment, 98 percent of your body's calcium resides in your bones, the r est circulates in the blood, taking part in metabol ic functions. Because the body cannot manufacture calcium, you must eat c alcium in your daily diet to replace the amounts th at are constantly lost. When the diet lacks sufficient calcium to rep lace the amount that is excreted, the body begins t o break down bone for the calcium necessary for life-preserving metabolic processes. Calcium in the diet can generally slow calcium loss from bones, but it usually doesn't seem to replace calci um already gone. The National Institutes of Health r ecommend 1000- 1200 milligrams of dietary calcium per day women and 1200-1500 milligrams for menopa usal and postmenopausal women Good sources of calcium inclu de milk and milk products, yogurt, ricotta, cheese, oysters, salmon, collard greens, spinach, ice cream, cottage cheese, kale, broccoli and oranges. If you cannot tolerate dairy products, calcium supplements are an easy way to co nsume calcium. Take supplements with a meal to aid absorption of calcium from the stomach. CALCIUM Page 1 of 7 Essential Minerals 7/11/2009 http://www.bodyandfitness.com/Information/Health/Re search/minerals.htmTRACE MINERALS Iron carries oxygen to the cells and is necessary f or the production of energy, the synthesis of colla gen, and the functioning of the immune system.* Iron deficiency is common only among children and pre-menopausal women. Great care must be taken not to take too much iron, as ex cess amounts are stored in the body's tissues and a dversely affect the body's immune function, cell growth and heart healt h.*7, 8, 9 A blood test is the most effective way to determine needs, and consultation with a trained health professional is strongly recommended. Iron absorption can be bl ocked by calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, antacids and tetracycli ne (a common antibiotic).2 Iron is found in meat, f ish, beans, spinach, molasses, kelp, brewer's yeast, broccoli a nd seeds. Because iron from plant sources is not as well absorbed as that from animal sources, some experts recommend th at vegetarians supplement with, or eat foods high i n, vitamin C as it enhances iron absorption.10 IRON Magnesium is essential to maintain both the acid-al kaline balance in the body and healthy functioning of nerves and muscles (including the heart), as well as to activa te enzymes to metabolize blood sugars, proteins and carbohydrates.*2 Magnesium is vital for proper bone growth and is in directly related to adequate calcium absorption.*11 A 2:1 ratio of calcium to magnesium is essential to maintain stron g bones. Indications of a magnesium deficiency may be muscle twitches, nervousness, abnormal heart beat and diso rientation. 2 Good food sources of magnesium inclu de seeds, unrefined grains, beans and other vegetables. MAGNESIUM Most phosphorus in the body is found in bone, usual ly at a 1:2 ratio to calcium. In soft tissue and ce lls, phosphorus contributes to many natural chemical body processes .11 For example, phosphate bonds of ATP (adenosine tr iphosphate) provide the energy necessary for metabolism.11 Food sources of phosphorus include protein-rich foods su ch as meats and dairy products, although some is present in alm ost all foods. Due to the abundance available in th e average diet, as well as its high absorption rate, most supplement s do not contain phosphorus. People taking aluminum hydroxide as an antacid for extended periods of time may develop a phosphorus deficiency since the aluminum prevents p hosphorus absorption.11 PHOSPHORUS Zinc supports the health of the immune system, norma l synthesis of protein, and the health of reproductive organs (especially in men).* 2 Zinc deficiency is common, and can adversely affect normal physical growth, skin a nd nerve health, natural healing ability, and immune function, especially in infants .*12 Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption adversely affect zinc levels.13 Meats, fish, beans, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms and brewer's yeast are goo d food sources of zinc. Too much zinc can lower copper retention, lower HDL (\"good\") cholesterol,14 and impair immune function at dosages of 100 mg/day or more.*15,16 Adverse effects may occur if the balance of zinc to other minerals is not maintained.*2 ZINC Product Recommendations Promotes muscle relaxation. Adequate magnesium must be available to relax muscles and relieve cramping, stiffness and soreness. Magnesium is also especially important as a co- factor for the use of energy in the heart Chromium functions as part of several enzyme system s, including the glucose tolerance factor (GTF), whic h works with CHROMIUM Page 2 of 7 Essential Minerals 7/11/2009 http://www.bodyandfitness.com/Information/Health/Re search/minerals.htminsulin in the utilization of glucose (blood sugar) .* Insulin helps to control metabolism of triglycer ides (the main form of fat in the body), therefore chromium has a positive eff ect on triglycerides due to its influence over insu lin.* Chromium deficiency has been linked to improper metabolism a nd imbalances of blood sugar.* 18, 19 While popula rly used as a supplement to achieve weight loss and muscle gain, research is not consistent enough to validate chrom ium's effect for those benefits.*20, 21 According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture wid espread chromium deficiency is due not only to inad equate food intake but also to excess sugar intake that increases chro mium losses in the body.*22 The only common food sou rce is brewer's yeast. Chromium should not be taken in excess howev er\u2014there have been reported cases of toxicity when used in high doses (>800 mcg/day).1, 23 Blood, nerves, joints, heart, skin, liver and both the immune and nervous systems all need adequate am ounts of copper, most of which is concentrated in the brain and live r.* Copper is critical to the absorption and utiliz ation of both zinc and iron.*24, 25 A deficiency of copper has been linked to an inability to produce the important antioxida nt enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and to a shortage of red blood cel ls.*24, 25 It is especially important to balance c opper levels with those of zinc because an excess of either will depr ess retention and utilization of the other.* 26 Rea dily available through the diet, copper is commonly found in whole grains, nuts, shellfish, liver and dark green, leafy veget ables. COPPER Elemental iodine is essential to the development an d functioning of the thyroid gland, and a deficienc y can cause an enlargement of the gland.* 27 Deficiency of iodine during pregnancy and infancy may lead to abnormalities in brain development and in children's growth.* 28 Iodized salt is the most common source of this ess ential trace mineral. Those with thyroid abnormalities should consult a health care practitioner before taking more than 150 mcg o f iodine per day. For most people, amounts up to 1,000 mcg per day are sa fe, although some may be sensitive to it (resulting in skin irritations or difficulty breathing). IODINE The essential trace mineral manganese is necessary f or normal bone metabolism and important enzyme reac tions*28 It also helps maintain normal nerve, brain and thyroid function.2 While a deficiency of this mineral is u ncommon, it is often lost in processed foods. 29, 30 A deficiency of manganese may affect brain health, glucose tolerance, normal reproduction, and skeletal and cartilage formation.* 31 Grains and cereal products are the best food source s of manganese, while animal products are the poorest. Toxicity from manganese is uncommon. 11 MANGANESE Molybdenum is involved in the operation of several key enzymes in the body. Readily available througho ut the diet, deficiencies of this essential mineral are unusual, although rare deficiencies occur in people who suf fer from malabsorption conditions.* 32 . Milk, beans, cereals and bread are common food s ources of molybdenum. Elevated levels of molybdenum can cause a loss of copper.* 11 MOLYBDENUM This powerful antioxidant works closely with vitamin E and supports critical antioxidant enzyme functio ns.*2 As an antioxidant, selenium may reduce the risk of abnorm al cell growth ,*33 while supporting cardiovascular health.* 34 Seafood and organ meats such as liver and kidney are high i n selenium, whereas selenium levels in grains and v egetables vary widely, depending on local soil content. 35 No more than 200 mcg of selenium daily is recommen ded for general use, because of possible toxicity. Excessive intakes of selenium can affect the functioning of enzymes and normal bone and cartilage development in fetuses, according to anim al studies. In milligram amounts (75 mg/day), selen ium can cause nausea, loss of hair and nails, skin abnormalities and nerve damage. 1 SELENIUM Page 3 of 7 Essential Minerals 7/11/2009 http://www.bodyandfitness.com/Information/Health/Re search/minerals.htmPotassium is the major mineral in, and primary regulator of, fluids inside cells - along with sodium.*11 Potass ium is critical to the transmission of nerve impulses, muscle contract ions and maintenance of normal blood pressure.*11 Th e kidneys control potassium levels, if adequate water is consumed.2 P otassium deficiency is rare in healthy people - but is a very common side effect of two widely abused modern drugs - chemical laxatives and diuretics. Potassium deficiency can also be caused by excessive vomiting, chronic diarrhea or kidney fail ure. Signs of deficiency may include muscle weaknes s, intestinal problems, heart abnormalities and respiratory weakness.2 Potassium is widely available in foods, but mostly in unprocessed fresh foods - especially fruits and vegetables. The estimated average adult intake of potassium varies widely between 1,000 and 10,000 mg daily, depending on diet (vegetarians get the most).40,41,42,43,44 Potassiu m is toxic for healthy adults if daily intakes exce ed 18,000 mg.45 Pills with more than 100 mg, if taken on an empty stomach and without sufficient water, may cause ulceration s in the stomach or esophagus.

Microgram amounts are not considered toxic. Silicon \u2014 Silicon is important in the composition and calc ification of cartilage to produce bone, and is comm on in unrefined foods of plant origin.*2 Vanadium \u2014 There is some scientific evidence that vanadium c ontributes to fat metabolism.*2, 38 Vanadium in mi crogram dosages has low potential for toxicity.39 ELECTROLYTES Electrolytes are the elements necessary for electro chemical activity in our body. Water (H20) - and th e three minerals sodium, potassium and chloride are a ll necessary for the transmission of electrical impulses between cells. Sodium and potassium are cations (positively charged atoms), and chloride is an anion (negatively charged atom) - all are essential nutri ents. These minerals are supplied by the typical diet in thousands of milligrams per day. So dium and chloride are overabundant in the diet and are not generally added as a mineral supplement.
