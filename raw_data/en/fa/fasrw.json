The publication is compiled through the cooperative efforts of the Aerospace Medicine and Biology Bibliography Project of the Library of Congress (LC), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and NASA. It assembles, within the covers of a single bibliographic announcement, groups of references that were formerly announced in separate journals, and provides a convenient compilation for medi- cal and biological scientists. Additional background details for this publication can be found in the first issue, NASA SP-7011, which was published in July, 1964. Supplements are identified by the same number followed by two additional digits in parentheses. In its subject coverage, Aerospace Medicine and Biology concentrates on the biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental effects to which man is subjected during and following simulated or actual flight in the earth's atmosphere or in interplanetary space. References describing similar effects on biological organisms of lower order are also in- cluded. Such related topics as sanitary problems, pharmacology, toxicology, safety and survival, life support systems, exobiology, and personnel factors receive appropriate atten- tion. In general, emphasis will be placed on applied research, but references to fundamental studies and theoretical principles related to experimental development also qualify for inclusion. The contents of this issue are comprised of abstracts that were prepared by the three contributing organizations. Each entry consists of a standard citation accompanied by its abstract. It is included in one of three groups of references that appear in the following order: a. NASA entries identified by their STAR accession numbers (N66-10000 series), b. AIAA entries identified by their ZAA accession numbers (A66-10000 series); and c. LC entries identified by a number in the A66-80000 series. Many of the abstracts included in this publication have been reproduced from those appearing in STAR and ZAA. This procedure, adopted in the interests of economy and speed, has introduced some variation in size, style, and intensity of type.

The threshold for perception of a lumped image is primarily a func- tion of the brightness of the pulse and the brightness of the background against which the jumped image is seen. In order to maintain high brightness of display. with a pulse brightness sufficiently low to avoid the jump phenomenon. PRF should be increased as far as possible. The \"shift\" phenomenon is be- lieved to be due to stroboscopic interaction between small. in- voluntary eye movements and pulsed light sources. Experi- ments with the present equipment indicate that these effects are very small and. under the particular circumstances of the experiment.could not be seen by some observers. It is reasoned that special conditions (such as those existing on certain CRT displays) are required for the production of the shift phenom- enon. Adequate investigation of the shift phenomenon there- fore requires simulation of these conditions. Author N66-12177.n Naval School of Aviation Medicine. Pensacola. Fla.

The Bell simulator was used with the Norden verti- cal display serving as the media for information transmission. Momentary error and control position were recorded and were later converted into error and inefficiency scores. While highly significant in a statistical sense. the differences between con- ditions were considered to be of limited theoretical interest. The primary contribution of the study was in its comparison of the different indices of error (absolute. squared and standard deviation) and the measures of' inefficiency. It was concluded that the standard deviation is the most sensitive of the error measurements and that an index of inefficiency (product of the error and the rate of control movement) is more sensitive of error alone.

Results graphed by the first method, based on the amplitude and duration investigation of the curves. compare BCG's of healthy people with those of persons exhibiting stenosis of the pulmonary artery. stenccardia. and mitral stenosis. The second method, in which the continuous curves are replaced by discrete values of amplitude. is se- lected because it requires less complex devices for processing the curves. At present. it is not possible to make specific diagnoses on the basis of BCG analyses: however, the curves do distinguish healthy from sick people. The proposed device may be used to accumulate data for future statistical analyses and to correlate distribution curves with types of illness. M.W.R. N86-12260*# Public Health Service, Washington. D.

Tests were made on one subject dressed in street clothing, dressed in a sterile surgical scrub suit includ- ing cap and socks, and dressed in sterile surgical scrub suit including cap, socks, and surgical mask. Preliminary data indi- cated that dissemination of viable microorganisms can be reduced by wearing a sterile. efficient surgical face mask. Also. methods for optimum contamination of surfaces with human microorganisms without laboratory seeding were investigated in studies on the reduction of bacterial contamination during exposure to conditions of 40% relative humidity at 50\u00b0C. Data on natural contamination of stainless-steel strips during exposure for 72 hr in an area of moderate activity and ex- posure for 1-hr in a dynamic exposure chamber are presented. Exposure in a dynamic exposure chamber in which human shedding is occurring appeared to be superior in that maxi- mum microbial contamination of the surfaces occurs in a short period which is desirable in order to avoid natural selection.

Structural diagrams are presented for the formation of the mediator RNA, and for protein synthesis. In support of the protein synthesis mechanism, experiments on memory carryover in planarians dissected with subsequent regenera- tion are discussed. Also reviewed are experiments on the transmission of memory in salivary gland chromosomes of insects by administration of a hormone called ecdisone. se- creted by insects. The effects of chromosome spiralization and antibodies on memory mechanisms are also considered. L.S. Joint Publications Research Service. Washing- N66-12271# Joint Publications Research Service.

Prior to assent. car- diac contractions taken in a pressure chamber remained fairly constant and averaged about 145 per minute; this rose to an average of 191 after erposure to rising altitude conditions. Respiration rate rose from an average of 28 to 44 per minute. In all experiments oxygen pressure fell as altitude increased: temporary stays at 2. 4. and 6 km led to approximate drops Of 85%. 73%. and 64%. respectively. from initial levels. With brief stays at 8 and 12 km. these pressures decreased to about 48% and 42% and were accompanied by sharp hypoxic dis- orders and marked disturbances in EKG. Myocardial oxygen pressure tends to rise during the initial action of overloads from rotation in a centrifuge, but later falls in the presence of 6. 8. 10. and 12 g overloads. Oxygen pressure falls more sharply during the third minute of rotation with overloads in the head-pelvisdirection thanwithtransverse overloads. M.W.R.

(Contract AF 33(657)-11729) (AM R L-T R -65- 1 1 0: AD -622298) Booster induced spacecraft vibrations occur in combina- tion with booster induced sustained acceleration. This was a joint NASA-AF study to provide a preliminary cursory evaluation of the effects of this environment on crewmen. Six subjects were used in 60 tests to measure the decrement in dial reading ability as a function of the level of 11 cps gx vibration and the sizeof the dial. where a bias acceleration of 3.85 Gx was super- imposed on the vibration Dial reading errors were inversely related to the arc length of the interval between dials and directly related to the amplitude of vibration. There was approximately 50% distortion of the 11 cps vibration acceleration, which markedly influences the interpretation of results and their com- parison to measurements of vlsual decrements from 11 cps VI- brations with 1Gx bias loads. In mOSt general terms, however, the 3.85Gx bias, and/or the undirectional force (i.e.. the resultant acceleration was always greater than 0 G) creates a subjectively more tolerable environment than with a 1 G bias. Vibrations of 3.85Gx !3.0gx were without serious subjective effects in exposures of 90 seconds duration. Gross compari- sons of dial reading performance under the two conditions provide some indication that the greater bias acceleration Author (TAB) is associated with less visual decrement.

Index deviation values for two indices of statement attractiveness, stressing either the personal or social acceptability of the statements. were corre- lated with each other, with four other attractiveness indices ob- tained previously. and with frequencies of statement choice obtained under four response sets. The correlation between the two indices and their relationship to previously obtained attrac- tiveness indices and choice frequencies indicated the personal and socially oriented indices represented essentially the same attractiveness dimension for the cadet groups.

In anes- thetized cats. the exposed cortex was illuminated with the light output from a monochromator and fluorescence changes were detected by use of a photomultiplier tube. Appropriate filters were used to prevent response of the photomultiplier to light from the excitation source. When electrical pulse stimulus of electroconvulsive intensity was applied by means of a wick electrode to the brain surface. there were observed signals of several millivolts amplitude from the photomultiplier tube in- terpreted as fluorescence changes. An interpretation is tenta- tively proposed which is based upon changes in relative propor- tionsof oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotide in the cortical tissue. Author (TAB) N66-12387# AFB. Ohio.

At identical elevated intra- pulmonary pressures the changes in circulation depend on the character of the pressure. In contrast to intermittent pres- sure, constant pressure causes more substantial circulatory disturbances, as manifested in a greater decrease in arterial pressure and a larger increase in venous pressure.

Dominant lethals were used as an index of heredita,y changes caused by radiation. Unirradiated females were crossbred with irradiated males, sacrificed, and data derived which characterizes the frequency of dominant lethal development. The frequency increases with the radiation dose. An exponential dependence of this frequency on irradia- tion dose was noted. Values were obtained of the RBE for pro- ton irradiation and compared to those previously derived for X-radiation. The REE value was lower which may be due to the pulsating character of the proton radiation. whereas the X-radiation is continuous. It may also be the result of the in- teraction of high energy protons with tissue causing nuclear 6 reactions which form \"stars\" with a high ionization density. It was noted that the R6E value is close to that obtained from a number of somatic reactions. R.N.A. N66-12458. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Washington, E.

DETERMINATION AND MICROBIAL SURVIVAL OF CRYO- GENIC WHOLE AIR SAMPLING CONDITIONS Washington, NASA Dec. 1965 to qualitatively determine the survival of eight species of microorganisms to shock wave exposure and subsequent cryogenic whole air sampling. The eight microorganisms chosen were physical conditions to which these microorganisms were subjected were chosen from those suggestefl by the design of an existing collector system to be used in sampling the dust content of the upper atmosphere. This system uses a low temperature metal surface .which at high speeds condenses all the air in its path. from this it was assumed that successful collection of microorganisms would be dependent on their ability to survive near vacuum in the upper atmosphere, rapid heating in passage through the shock wave generated by the sampling vehicle. high speed impaction on the metal surface, rapid cooling to a few degrees K. and rewarming to room temperature and subsequent storage for a period of time. Results showed that the majority 7 N66-12576 of the microorganisms survived the conditions of the shock wave and cryogenic collection. The only exception was Ser- ratia marcescens. R.N.A.

Experimental time variations in the electrical con- ductivity of blood that had previously been cryogenically stored are noted to be small but as yet inconclusive. Comparison of conductivity results for plasma of blood that had been cryo- genically stored with and without PVP additive were signifi- cantly different, the preserved blood having lower hemolysis and higher conductivity. The thermal conductivities of bovine brain, kidney, and liver were measured after these specimens were slowly frozen to 0\" C and then slowly thawed; the conduc- tivities increased approximately 10 percent above values obtained for corresponding unstressed specimens. The cor- responding conductivity changes for samples that were cryo- genically frozen and more quickly warmed were smaller. Anaytical thermal conductivity models were compared to ex- perimental data obtained previously: good correlations of the results were obtained.

The characteristic changes were increased strength of con- traction and rapid recovery. A lethal dose of radiation caused a marked change in gastric motility. Immediately after the irradiation. gastric motility disappeared. Although the motility resumed subsequently. a sustained normal state was seldom reached. If the depression occurred. in most cases chances for full recovery were nil. In a few animals. after the first depres- sion. the gastric motility fluctuated for several months before returning to normal. If. however. a second depression occurred after an extended normalization period. death usually followed. The extent of the gastric motility alteration may be used as an index to the severity of the radiation syndrome, as a basis for understanding of the nature of the gastrointestinal dis- turbance in radiation sickness, and eventually for its treatment. Since gastric motility is under the regulation of the CNS. its changes may also reflect the state of the CNS. Author (TAB) N66-12626# Joint Publications Research Service. Washing- ton. D. C.

The humidity of the respiratory tract is extremely high. and at the pharynx and the larynx it reaches approximately 99.5% relative. If a dry hydroscopic particle were inhaled it would increase in size considerably while traversing the respiratory tract. Therefore, the site of deposition may be difficult to predict.

(USSR) v. 2, 1951 p 17-24 (FTD-TT-65-410/1+2+4: AD-620503) CSCL 06P Relative investigation of electrical activity of cortex and basal sections of the brain revealed certain additional charac- teristics in the nature of basal electrogram in comparison with( the previously described ones. Vestibular irritation causes: considerably greater changes in bioelectric activity of the brain than do other afferent irritations. Electric response to irritation of the vestibular apparatus can be picked up from all areas of cortex cerebri and in a majority of cases appears to be two- sided symmetrical. Responsive reaction to vestibular irritation in basal areas is expressed much brighter, more intensive and longer lasting, than in the cortex cerebri. Duration and multiphaseness of changes in electrical activity of the brain during vestibular irritation, apparently. are connected with the involvement into responsive reaction of a series of mechanisms. including the vegetative-vascular. A very important role is played in this case by the emotional factor. The obtained data. indicating considerable functional displacements in electrical activity of basal sections of the brain under the effect of vestibu- lar irritation in norm, give bases to assume that illnesses of the central nervous system the changed nature of its reactivity may be easier to detect with the aid of the mentioned afferent irritation.

The name given to this nonverbal information is 'affective informa- tion'. The work attempted to make use of the physical infor- mation in the speech processing system to predict the 'intelli- gibility' of the speech signal. Intelligibility as here defined is synonymous with fidelity of transmisston since the subject's response is merely a repetition of the perceived input signal. With respect to affective information the goal has been to identify as far as possible the acoustical properties of the speech signal which are identified with various perceptual responses to that speech signal. The first non-verbal aspect that was considered was 'speech quality'. Since this concept is of considerable importance both in the technology of speech processing developments and from a psychological point of view, various attempts at defining psychoacoustical correspon- dences have been made during the term of this project.

This injury was presumed to be the result of a? impact profile having a peak acceleration of 18.8G. a rate of onset Of 420G per second and a baseline duration of approximately 100 milliseconds. The subject's long axis was inclined backward 34 degrees from the vertical force vector. The diagnosis was established upon the subject's termination of hazardous duty and separation from the service, approximately one year after the presumptive data of injury. This documented injury represents a demonstrable endpoint in impact tolerance of a subject exposed to an acceleration environment which can be specifically described.

In the diagnostic computer, disease symptoms are at first multiplied as variable and then grouped into syndromes and the figures on their rate of occur- rence are multiplied, whereupon the median of both figures is derived. The a priori probability of a disease is used but be- cause of the lability of an a priori probability and its contin- gency on many factors, it is used as a subjective component in the diagnostic computer, One other method of comparing probabilities is the logic of the phase interval. Here the sums of the squares of the probability of each disease are compared. This method alone cannot produce reliable results. Symptoms may be primary or secondary and the absence of a secondary symptom may be of no significance. That is why probabilistic logic is needed. In making its diagnosis, the computer elimi- nates all diseases in which the patient's symptoms are impos- sible by deterministic logic. A selection is made from among the remaining diseases by probabilistic logic. On the basis of the phase interval method, the previous findings are corrected. R.N.A.

(FI D-21339) .^ Studies were made of the clearance rate of Ca45 following intravenous injection in adult dogs and studies of the blood distribution between marrow and bone. The arteriovenous differences as an indication of bone uptake of Ca45 was greater in the first minute and then decreased slowly during the experi- mental period. The average percent cleared was 53.35% of the iaotope for the first 5 minutes and 47.08% for 10 min. The blood distribution was found to be from 7.1 to 20.6% in the marrow and the rest in the cortex. The bone uptake of Ca45 decreased continuously but was still measurable at the end of 12 hr. The average blood flow to the femur was 4.9 cc/min/ 100 gm of fresh bone and 3.1 cc/min/100 grn of fresh cortical bone. Average relative blood volume for cortical bone was 0.0189 cc/gm and for marrow was 0.634 cc/gm. The blood flow to the femur in dogs with unilateral femoral arteriovenous fistulae was also determined. The average blood flow values were 10.322 cc/min/100 gm of fresh cortical bone for the fistula side and 7.043 cc/min/100 gm of fresh cortical bone for the opposite side. The average difference in weight between femurs on the side of the fistula and the opposite side was 6.845 grams. E.E.B. icine. Ca-45 AND Sr-85 METABOLISM IN MAN Final Progress Re- port, 1 May 195841 Mar. 1965 [19651 13 p refs (Contract AT(11-1)-587) icc$:87.1! Progress is reported in studies of bone metabolism ana derangements therein found in bone diseases of man in which 45Ca and 85Sr were used as tracers. An extremity counter utilizing a plastic scintillation detector was used in counting and data were analyzed by a computer. A technique was de- veloped for calculation of the exchangeable Ca in a given 3-in. segment as grams of Ca and of accretion as grams of Ca per day SO that the absolute contribution of individual peripheral bone regions to the total body kinetic analyses can be derived. Results show that periarthritic bone usually has a higher initial uptake than norma! bane. despite lower plasma specific activ- ity, and the rate of fall of activity in arthritic bone is less rapid than in normal regions, indicating an increase in bone ex- changeability and accelerated new bone formation in periar- thritic bone. Data are summarized from Ca balance and 45Ca kinetic studies in patients with osteoporosis; calcium metabolism studies in patients with combined central osteoporosis and peripheral rheumatoid arthritis; and metabolic balance and 45Ca studies in normal subjects. hypopituitary dwarfs, hypopi- tuitary adults, and an adult with active acromegaly.

The physical conditions to which these micro- organisms were subjected were chosen from those suggested by the design of an existing collector system to be used in sampling the dust content of the upper atmosphere. This system uses a low temperature metal surface which at high speeds condenses all the air in its path. From this it was as- sumed that successful collection of microorganisms in the 15 ?

Six individuals with bilateral labyrinthine defects and seven normal persons served as subjects. Transient periods of subgravity force (0.5G. zero G) were produced by parabolic flight maneuvers in a specially equipped C-131 E aircraft which accommodated a tilt chair and accessory apparatus for recording CR response up- right and with body tilt (*25\", *50\" ). The labyrinthine-defective group revealed results qualitatively similar to those from the normal group but markedly reduced in magnitude. This demon- strated that extralabyrinthine factors were not significantly in- volved. In the normal subjects zero G induced a physiological deafferentation of the otolith organs. When the gravitational force equalled about 0.5G. CR was below the level midway between the zero and Earth standard gravity response. The non- linear relationship between otolith activity and subgravity force is discussed. Author ONE-HALF STANDARD, AND ZERO GRAVITY EN- N66-13114*# Thompson Ramo Wooldridge. Inc.. Cleveland. Ohio.

The encephalogram of a normally sleeping per- son is examined. and the consecutive changes shown by the recording of the biocurrents ere discussed. It was found that during restful consciousness alpha waves, with a frequency of 10 vibrations per second, usually appear: light sleep is usually accompanied by frequency rhythms of about 14 vibrations per second; further deepening of sleep shows the propagation of large slow waves, which gradually almost displace all other waves. It was noted that the internal deep sleep continues quietly for some time before the encephalogram changes sharply and approximates the pre-dormant period. This cycle. with its phases, is repeated until awakening. It is pointed out that sleep mechanism studies may prove useful for treating diseases connected with sleep disturbances. in investigating mechanisms. and for understanding the complex mechanisms at the basis of epilepsy.

For such a control, it is possi- ble to maintain a constant reactive force per pulse for various combinations of pulse widths and pulse amplitudes. The con- .trolled element was a one-dimensional second order system. A semirandom sequence of three step voltages was used to dis- 'place a spot on a CRT. Subjects were required to recenter the spot as fast as possible. Manual control performance was tested under three levels (low, middle. high) of control output gain. Three pulse width-pulse amplitude combinations were tested at the :ow and high control output gain levels and four pulse width-pulse amplitude combinations for the middle control out- put gain level. Three subjects ware tested under all conditions. Performance measures obtained were: integrated absolute error, integrated absolute fuel consumption. and integrated absolute stick motion. The results of this study indicate that (1) changing pulse width and pulse amplitude, but keeping control output gain fixed, does not affect manual Performance: but that (2) changing control gain does.

A broad research and flight mission program in space biology was developed which includes development of life detection experiments and a concept for an automated bio- logical laboratory for planetary exploration of life: a biosatel- lite program including scientific experiments to study the biological effects of weightlessness, radiation combined with weightlessness. and removal from the Earth's rotation: a re- coverable biosatellite spacecraft system; and the supporting research and technology required for these flight missions as well as biological support for manned space flight. Monkeys and chimpanzees were flown in sub-orbital and orbital flights to test systems and their safety before flight of astronauts. In the exobiology field, progress was made in biosynthesis of organic life-related materials and lifelike objects and the pos- sible origin of life. study of organic constituents of meteol- it-, development of life detectionjnst[uments. and a new concept of integrated life detection for unmanned spacecraft for Martian exploration.

The objectives were to investigate the egress problems associated with the panel layout of a min- imum volume crew station and to establish optimum location of an overhead hatch for crewmembers wearing regular flight suits during an emergency egress condition. A simulated single place crew station was designed and fabricated in-house and mounted in the Aeronautical Systems Division's zero gravity aircraft. An overhead hatch bulkhead was designed to be ad- justable which allowed the egress task to be performed at different locations from the seat reference point (SRP). Three hatch locations were used. In the first series of tests the hatch opened outward from the crew station and was tested at the three locations; in the second series the hatch was tested at the maximum distance from the SRP but opened inward. Three times were recorded for the egress task: reaction time, egress to the hatch. and egress through the hatch. Three subjects were used to give six replications for each hatch location. The data were statistically analyzed using F ratio and t tests and the results indicated that egress through an inward opening hatch took 1 1/2 to 2 times longer than to egress through the hatch that opened outward. The time required to egress to the hatch proved to be what would be expected: the time increased as the hatch distance to the SRP increased. Author (TAB) N66-1399O0# Texas Univ.. Austin.

Oct. 1964 amount of ice formed in amputated feet of mice frozen at various temperatures was found, in 26 calorimetric determinations. to vary from 29.6% of the total weight at - 1.5C to 46.7% et -9.5C. These figures represent. respectively, 46% and 72.5% of the water content of the Ilmb. The average devia- tions from the mean percentagi of ice per total weight were of the order of three units. The proportions of water frozen at given temperatures. after establishing equilibrium of ice formation, are appreciably lower in these experiments than in those of Lovelock and Smith on the hamster. There is close similarity in the ratios of electric capacitances of nonfrozen and frozen paws of mice, in the cases of amputated limbs. attached limbs in dead animals and attached limbs in living animals. This sim- ilarity justifies the use of calorimetric determinations made on amputated limbs to estimate the amounts of ice formed in living tissues or organs frozen under the same conditions, as furnished by the ratios of capacitances. after the relationship between these ratios and the calorimetric data is established.

Immunization against a heterologous protein is nil if the graft is less than Id cells, but normal if it is 8t least 2.6 X lo7 cells. However. a graft of 2.5 X lo7 ganglionic cells does not cause immunization of an irradiated host if it comes from previously irradiated donors who had received 10s g8nglionic cells or less and beon subjected immedi8toly after irradiation to the same antigenic stimulus.

The technique allows the pressure-suited subject to move in six degrees of freedom without the encumbrance of connecting lines or hoses or other supports and further permits performance simulation of long- duration tasks. Experiments were made to demonstrate the re- lationships between the maneuvers performed by a pressure- suited subject under weightless conditions produced by water-immersion and zero-gravity aircraft flights and those per- formed under full-gravity conditions. The tests demonstrated that the simulation technique is useful for premission determination of critical oparational characteristics relating to spacecraft and spacesuit design under conditions of zero gravity. In addition. the physical capabilities of man and his ability to perform useful work and maneuvers in a pressurized suit under simulated zero- gravity conditions can be demonstrated. Comparison of the subject's motion behavior between the aircraft and water-im- mersion tests showed that the technique is valid where the ve- locities are low.

The characteristic secondary response yields fewer PFC and lower serum anti- body concentrations than the primary response. When an adequate time interval (9 weeks or more) elapses between primary and secondary antigen injections, the magnitude of the secondary response begins to approach that of the primary. Primary serum hemolysin is mercaptoethanol sensitive (19s largely mercaptoethanol resistant i7S immunoglobulin). Generation times of 7 and 9 hours are obtained for plaque-forming cells during the first 4 days of the primary response. A mathematical model is presented which relates numbers of antibody form- ing cells to serum hemolysin concentrations. Using the model. together with available experimental data, it is concluded that the great majority of the cells producing 7s hemolysin prob- ably are not detected by the Jerne technique, as applirti to the spleen.

The responses of three groups of human subjects to positive acceleration after undergoing minimal dehydration and heat stress are presented. A decrease in acceleration tolerance of 15 to 18% is noted. It was.determined that the effects of heat stress alone did not produce the observed decrease. The possible underlying mech- anisms producing these effects are discussed and recommendations are made for future studies.

Theoretical mathematical bases for impact loadings on the body were noted, along with discussion of stunt jumper techniques. Fifty (39 males, 11 females) cases of free- falls survived by individuals aged 7 to 80 years impacting water en- vironments at over 55 ft/sec during the past three years were in- tensively investigated and analyzed. These represgnted over 25% of the 281 known water free-falls survived durmg this period. addition, autopsy data in fatal falls occurring under similar environ- mental conditions during this time was compared. It was found that fatal cases sometimes presented a problem as to whether death was caused by drowning, and if so. whether the impact trauma could have been survivable. The most survivable body orientation, by a factor of 5-7 times, was found to be a (t G,) feet-first deceleration, in which critical velocity for human survival was slightly over 100 ft/sec. (116 ftlsec max. ). In fatal cases a high proportion of rib fractures in lateral and transverse impact orientations was found to cause fatal penetration of the lungs and other internal organs. Patterns of injury and relationships of factors found to influence human survival tolerances are presented and compared with impact trauma on nonwater surfaces.

In the initial faster phase of gas absorption the rate was found to be independent of the nitrogen concentration but increased with reduction of en- vironmental pressure. During the final slower phase the rate of absorption decreased as the inspired nitrogen concentration was raised and as the environmental pressure was reduced. mechanisms involved in the development of acceleration atelectasis are discussed in relation to these experimental findings. It is con- cluded that the effectiveness of a given inspired concentration of nitrogen in retarding the development of acceleration atelectanin should increase as the environmental pressure is reduced.

Aerospace Medicine, vol. 36, Oct. 1965, p. 956-960. Traffic Control Specialists (ATCS) has been of concern to the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) for some years. Those who are engaged in the occupation, as well as external observers, have ex- pressed the belief that the stress inherent in the occupation has an adverse effect on ATCS. Unfortunately, there is little objective evidence on which an evaluation of this belief can be based. The present investigation represents an attempt to evaluate the impact of the ATCS work on the health of those engaged in it. As part of an employee health program conducted in the southwestern states by the senior author, information about specific health problems was solicited on an anonymous basis from participants in the pro- gram, with personnel not engaged in ATCS work. ATCS occupation was indeed health information from the two groups should indicate a higher incidence of health nroblems among the ATCS.

Fourteen experiments done in various laboratories have as- sessed the effects of high thermal stress on mental performance. These experiments represent different combinations of exposure time and effective temperature. When the results of these studies are reviewed, they indicate that the upper thermal limit for un- impaired mental performance varies systematically with exposure duration. tically reliable decrements in mental performance decline exponpn- tially as exposure durations are increased up to 4 hr. When this temperature-duration curve for mental performance ia compared with physiological tolerance curves, it is found to lie well below them at every point in time.

Four of the centrifuged dogs died, each during centrifugation (during the second, seventh, tenth and twentieth hours). At autopsy only moderate congestion in the caudal lung segments and viscera was found. control dogs were essentially normal at autopsy. Previous studies in unanesthetized animals demonstrated that similar but more fre- quent exposures over a period of weeks caused significant renal lesions. It seems likely that these renal changes are due to the cumulative effects of frequently repeated tissue injury; they were not seen in the present study, probably because the interval between centrifugations was 3-4 days, permitting each tissue insult to sub- side before re-injury.

Proposal of a new theory, the \"gate control\" system, and a review of two current opposing theories of pain, the speciiicity theory and the pattern theory. The specificity theory holds that pain is a specific modality like vision or hearing, with its own cen- tral and peripheral apparatus. The pattern theory maintains that the nerve impulse pattern for pain is produced by intense stimdlation of nonspecific receptors since there are no specific fibers and no specific endings. that are transmitted to three spinal cord systems: the cells of the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn, the dorsal-column fibers that project toward the brain, and the first central transmission cells in the dorsal horn. pain phenomena are determined by interactions among these three systems. The substantia gelatinosa is thought to function as a gate control system that modulates the afferent patterns before they influence the transmission cells. It is proposed that the presence or absence of pain is determined by the balance between the sen- sory and the central inputs to the gate control system. Drugs af- fecting excitation or inhibition of substantia gelatinosa activity may be of particular importance in future attempts to control pain. M. F.

Clinical and biochemical effects of hyperoxia were exaggerated in tocopherol deficient mice and were prevented by prior supplementation with tocopherol, a specific inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. It is postulated that the primary effect of hyperoxia on the central nervous system is peroxidation of brain lipid which directly or indirectly (through interference with other metabolic systems) results in cell and tissue damage.

Subjects were exposed to vibrations with varying peak and rms accelerations and frequencies to explore the relative importance of these parameters in determining the effect of the vibration produced by turbulence in low-altitude high speed flight. acceleration levels and frequency contents, pairs of periodic vibra- tion exposures having the aame rms but different peak accelerations were evaluated using both a subjective severity rating and a measure of vibration induced hand motion. The higher peak acceleration of the various pairs having the same rms values was subjectively rated more severe in 32 of 40 observations. However, when attempting to hold the hand in a fixed position during vibration. the induced deviations from the null point, expressed either as average or peak- to-peak errors appeared to depend more on rms acceleration and frequency than on the small differences in peak acceleration studied here.

Data concerning acuity as a function of pupil size, intensity of illumina- tin\", and the relation between retinal illuminance and resolution are reviewed and discussed. The importance given to the reiation be- tween eye movement and acuity is emphasized, as it is pointed out that the eye is never motionless, even when fixing on an object. It is concluded that acuity is optimal only when test objects are seen within a distance of 5 min of arc from the point of fixation, ad that acuity is relatively poor for a moving test object even when the eyes appear to be successfully pursuing it. dependence of eye movements and visual aculty is obviously depen- dent on a servomechanism of incomparable efficiency and precision among human perceptual systems.

Comprehensive review of the data on the visual perception of space. space perception has been formalized in terms of so-called cues, and that, in turn, these cues have been divided into two types - monocular, on the basis of vision with a single eye, and binocular. in which the coordinated activity of both eyes is involved. monocular cues are discussed: relative size of an object and retinal image size; interposition (overlapping of images as related to dis- tance); linear and aerial perspective; monocular movement parallax; light and shade; and accommodation. Convergence and stereoscopic vision are the two binocular cues considered. Discriminations of size, shape, and distance are compared. Monocular movement parallax is analyzed in detail as it applies to the situation in which a differential angular velocity 1s developed when a human being fixates on a moving object, .or looks at a stationary object while moving, or turns his head while looking at objects that do not move.

Biological investigation of outer space must be based on the fullest and most detailed ftudy of all factors which may have a detrimental effect on the living organism. In the exploration of space, the influence of a whole complex of flight factors has to be taken into account. Roughly speaking, these factors may be divided into three groups: group includes the extremely low barometric pressure. the change in gaseous composition in the absence of molecular oxygen, ionizing radiations (cosmic, ultraviolet and corpuscular radiation), unfa- vorable temperature conditions, presence of meteoric material, and so on. The second group of factors relating to rocket flight include: noise, vibration, acceleration and weightlessness. The third consists of factors governing living conditions in the space capsule (artificial atmosphere, restricted movement, feeding prob- lems, etc.). present time to the study of factors the action of which is prolonged and continuous. radiation. is complicated by the practical lmposslbility of reproducing them under laboratory condltlons.

The following types of relationshlp between the effects of cold (external and internal) and different forms of anoxia will be dls- cusscd on the- basis of data from animal experiments, especially from the point of view of tolerance limits and with some reference to the underlying mechanisms. Resistance to external (environmental) cold is impaired by hypoxia (and hypercapnia) whlch interferes with thermoregulation and renders difficult the maintenance of thermal homeostasis. The critical tension of oxygen (below which oxygen consumption starts to decrease) can be taken as a measure of the resistance of the body thermostat to the hypoxic load. It 1s shown that this parameter is not necessarily related. as often assumed, to the overall rate of 02 consumption (thermogenesis), but only to complementary heat production, i.e., that facultative part of total thermogenesis which IS under the control of thermoregulatory centres. cold environment which by itself can be tolerated without change of body temperature. atmosphere, which at higher environmental temperatures can be INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BASIC ENVIRONMENTAL Hypoxia may act as a hypothermia-inducing agent in a On the other hand, even such changes of ambient compensated by physiological regulatory mechanisms, may induce in the cold serious disturbances of thermal homeostasis. From the point of view of homeostatic resistance, therefore, a mutual poten- tiation of the effects of cold and anoxia may be described. From the survival point of view, however, internal cold (hypothermia), induced by anoxia in a cold environment, may have a protective value. the fall of body temperature renders the homeotherm capable Of surviving under anoxic conditions which would be lethal at normal body temperature.

In the extreme, hypothermia through its basic inhibitory effect on life processes, causes the cessation of oxygen supply and transport (respiratory and circulatory arrest). At the same time, however, through its protectlve effect, it renders the organism capable of tolerating relatively long periods of such \"suspended animation\" (or \"clinical death\"). animation will be defmed data brain metabo- lism.

It has been shown recently that one daily maximum contraction of 5 sec is enough to keep a muscle strong and enduring enough for static work. In order to maintain a high capability for dynamic work, muscles have to work daily for about 112 hour as hard as possible. To keep the heart fit and the hemoglobin content of the blood high for short extreme stress situations. it is sufficient to raise the pulse rate once a day up to 100-200 beatslmin for about 30 sec by exhausting work. This is usually achieved by standing- running under the influence of gravity. Under weightless conditions cranking seems to be the best solution for physiological and technical reasons.

Although no true state of weightlessness is attained, nevertheless long-term observations in subgravity are made possible in this way. Certain human experiments indicate that in such conditions slight distur- bances in ECG and blood pressure may become manifest. These results were not confirmed by other authors. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of long-term weightlessness simu- lated by immersion on EGG and blood pressure in rabbits.

By arranging for these forces to be applied across his body (transversely), instead of along the length of his body. circulatory difficulties can be reduced and his tolerance increased. However, at the higher accelerations tolerable in the transverse position other difficulties appear most by involving respiration. Not only is it more difficult to inspire air, but, because of a dis- placement of the blood perfusing the lungs, there is imperfect exchange between pulmonary air and blood.

The criterion for radiation safety can be expressed as a permissible radiation dose, established in the light of the fact that cosmic radiation occurs in a complex, or against a background, of other flight factors, which probably alter the effectiveness of ionizing radiation. If nuclear power sources are used, the total permissible dose will consist of the dose produced by the action Of cosmic radiation and the dose released by the nuclear reactor. It is assumed that for a spaceflight lasting for a period of several days up to a year, the maximum permissible dose rate can be set at 25 rem, and for a flight of several years at 50 rem per year. In working out the actual measures for pharmacological and biologi- cal protection a considerably greater maximum permissible dose may, of course, be taken.

As far as space capsules are concerned, the problem of creating a tolerable environment has its own specific features which are determined by the conditions peculiar to spaceflight. The following are of great importance: The fact that there are no materials or substances in the external surroundings which could be used to form an artificial environment in the space capsuie; man!s continuous cccEpation of the capsule's artificial environment for a lengthy period; the strict limitations on power supplies, weight and dimensions of the cabin and all its parts; the practical impossibility of securing complete protection from certain cosmic flight factots (primary cosmic radiation, etc. ). The conditions peculiar to space travel impose a certain degree of compromise between the need to create a comfortable environment for members of the crew and the technical possibilities of achieving it. At the present stage of astronautical development, it is hardly appropriate to draw up strict limits for permissible variations in the parameters of the artificial environment, irrespective of the kind of spaceship that has been evolved. The need is beginning to be felt to establish positive standards, closely coordinated with the preparation of measures to increase man's resistance to the effects of certain flight factors, and with the selection and training of cosmonauts. However, certain principles of standardization, even though framed in the most general terms, should be laid down immediately.

The primary object of the former is the detection and diagnosis of disease or frank illness; the ulti- mate purpose is to ascertain the cause of death of the astronaut. Experimental observations, on the other hand, are concerned with the effects of the special conditions existing in apace on the normal mechanisms of the body, and with the altered responses evoked by known stimull applied in a strange and Ill-deflned environment. These two types of monitoring require different methods, but certain baslc problems are common to both. difficult to decide on the physiologlcal variables whlch will give the desired information.

Beta- adrenergic blockade invariably caused a reduction in heart rate, cardiac output, mean mertal pressure, and left venuicular minute work; arteriovenous 02 difference Increased and there was a small rise In central venous pressure. As an apparent consequence of the impaired circulatory response to exerdse, both maximal oxygen con- scmption and capacity for strenuous exenton were reduced. However, even after ,9 -adrenergic blockade, cardiac output still rose substantially during exercise. We conclude that sympathetic nervous stimulation of the heart plays a significant, although quantitatively limited, role in mediating the normal response to exercise in man.

The characteristics of swltch actuators for communicattons equtpment to be used in spacecraft are investigated. Subjects operated common switch actuators with space suit gloves, under both atmospheric pressure and two- psi pressure differential. The independent variables studied were type of actuator, dlrection of operation, actuating torque, number of switch positions, effect of pressure, practice effect, and position on the panel. The dependent variables (criteria) were operating time, errors, and ranks. Switch actuators, in general, were operated more slowly and with more errors under simulated spacecraft conditions than under ordinary conditlons. It was found that multiposition switches must have flrm detent or lntertocklng features to pre- vent overshoot or accidental reversal, The best switch actuator under all cir- cumstances combined is descrtbed.

An application of continuous parameter optimization techniques to the synthesis of a model of human tracking behavior in a simple twoaxis task is presented. Considerable emphasis is placed on the measurement of perform- ance criteria for estimating the relative difficulty of singlegxis and two-axis fnsk as well as for evaluation of the validity of rnathematlcat models. It is shown that the modeling technique can be used to yield a quantitative in- dication of the degree of ctoss coupltng between axes introduced by the operator.

The body pool, half-life, and turnover time of carnitine in rats maintained at 25oc. and in rats exposed to 5\u00b0C. for a period of 6 weeks were measured. The level of free and lipid-bound carnitine in striated muscle of these animals was also determined. Results show that the body pool of carnitine is eight times greater in cold-acclimated rats than in rats maintained at 25OC. On the other hand, the half-life and turnover time of carnitine in coldacclimated ratsis only one-half of that of rats kept at 25OC. Analysts of suiated muscle showed a parallel increase of carnitine in coldacclimated rats. This increase in carnitine was accompanied by a corresponding increase in acylcarnitine.

Subjects were required to listen to messages consisting of 1, 2, 3, or 4 letters of the alphabet over each of 1, 2, 3, or 4 channels. It was found that increasing the number of channels above 2 had a markedly deleterious effect upon recall of the messages, 2 leners over each of four channels being less well recalled than 4 letters over each of two channels. In a second experiment, it was found that, providing only one channel was required in recall, and this one was indlcated by a light immediately after the stimuli had been presented, then the decrement could be largely offset and the total number of signals stored held constant at about 8 regardless of how many channels were used. However, if the letters had to be recalled in exactly the correct order in which they arrived, performance dropped to almost zero. The results are discussed in terms of the channel capacity of the nervous system and in relatlon to corresponding flndings in other sense modalities.

Caskey (Hawthornden State Hosp., Macedonia, Ohio). 547. 6refs. An experiment is reponed on continutty effects produced in a longer. duration, lessintense noise signal alternating with a shorterduration, higher- intensity tonal signal. The perceived continuity in the noise stgnal is demon- strated to be aRected by the following: (1) the frequency of the tonat signal (200, 400, 1000,2000, and 4000 c.P.s.), (2) the duration of the noise signal C/O, 250, and 950 msec.), and (3) the manner of presentation (monaural versus dichotic). Monaural thresholds were found to be larger than dichotic continuity thresholds. Continuity effects were demonstrated under dichotic presentation That is, the noise signal was reported as continuous when in- tenupred for Peaods of time that would be dearly percetved U no tonal a~gnat were interpolated in the Lnterruptlons of the noise. A twodactor theory is forwarded to explain the dichotic and monaural continuity effects. The mon- aural effects are discussed in terms of rate of decay of auditory sensation. The dichotic dects of charge somewhat more central than the tlrstsrder neurons. AM-80155 CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE USSR TO THE EXPLORATTON OF OUTER SPACE [ VKLAD SSR V MAN IN SPACE. PARIS, 1962.

The problem of temperature regulatlon 1s most acute for the astronaut when he Is ourdde hts vehtcle and thereforedlsconnected from the relatlvely bulky machlnery whlch normally attends to his thermal needs. It is necessary to arrange that metabolic heat Is transported from the sktn surface to some devlce whlch wlll absorb tt. Two heat exchangers are therefore requlred, one at the skin surface and one In the thermal pack, and the transport of heat from skin to absorbent must be effected oprlmally In terms of the wetght and bulk of apparatus necessary. The properrles of an existtng nlr venttlated clothing system were tnvesttgated uslng a heated dummy whose regional \"ttssue con- ductance\" was matched to that of a thermally Comfortable human subject. It was found that If the complex dtstrlbutlons of air flow and skin temperature were Ignored, the results could be expressed in terms of the performance characteristics of a simple heat exchanger having Its plate surface temper- ature equal to the mean skin temperature. The relatton between mass flow and heat exchange coefficient at the skin surface was such as to suggest that suttable characteristtcs could be obtalned by introducing alr at the four ex- tremlties and removing It at the watst. The power requlred to ventilate existtng suits was found to be many times the theorettcal mtntmum, and constderable Improvement In thts respect appeared possible.

Data in the literature and investigations indicate a correlation between the degree of stress in a subject and the excretion of free adrenaline and nor- adrenaline in urine. Noradrenaline excretion is mainly correlated to the degree of activation of the vasomotor system and is increased in erect posidon, dur- inn exposure to other gravitatlonal forces, during muscular work, and under certain conditions of stress associated with agresstveness and anger. Adren- altne excretion is increased in a variety of conditions of mental suess; e.g., during performance of certain tasks, examinations, excitatlon by external Stlmmull, fear, pain, or other disagreeable conditions, and anticipation of such states, particularly when involving competition and or posslble dangers. Habituation to certain suess-inducing situations tends to decrease the adren- dine excretion. Attempts to correlate the catecholamine excretion pattern and personality traits seem to indicate that such studies may be of value for the characterhation of Individual types and as a means of predicting thet reaction pattern to stress. Quantitative evaluation of stress by the catecholamine excretion tests may also provlde some information on mental bdUy alter- attons whkh may affect performance.

With dissociation of the direction of the lon- gitudinal axes of body and head, and exposing them separately in varying angles to the direction of the resultant acceleratton, information is obtained on the contribudon of systems involved in the perception of the vertical. Con- clusions are derived from results of experiments on 15 volunteers subjected to a total of 397 different combinations of body and head position with re- sultant accelerattons between 1.0 and 3.0 g. The position of the longttudinal axis of body or head influences the directions of the apparent vertical. The effect of the position of body and head is addtttve. The accuracy of esttmation of the directton of the resultant acceleration is optimal up to 1.5 g, when body and head are held in the directton of the resultant acceleration. Above 1.5 g. the direction of the resultant acceleratton is underesdmated when the vector of forces moved transiently through a frontal place to its flnal podtion. The directton of the resultant acceleration is increasingly overesttmated when the vector of forces moved transiently though a sagittal plane to its flnal position. The precision of estimation of the apparent vertical is higher during lateral acceleration than during backward acceleratton.

Concomitantly with the required equipment and test and development a series of studies was conducted in animals exposed to simulated stresses of space flight up to 14 days duration. These studies included the effects of acceleration, vibration, sensory deprivation, hallucinogenic drugs on disuimtnattve per- formance, alertness, and sleep-wakefulness cycles; concomitant assays being made of steroid and catechol amine metabolism. As a basic keystone around which our final objective could be realized, the University of California at Los Angeles Space Biology Laboratory nas pioneered in tne appiication of 3 complex computer techniques to the analysis of the EEG data recorded. Differences in these various quantitattve and qualitattve functtons analyzed have been seen in many of the responses studied, and the results thus far encourage the view that these techntques are more revealing of early signifi- cant changes than most others in current use.

The problem involved the effects of training and test similarity on the difficulty of transfer for a paradigm in whtch test stimuli and responses are not new but are only simple rearrangements of previously learned S- R relationships. The difficulty of transfer gesponse reversal) is as follows: 0) Transfer for the 20% reversal group was significantly faster than for the 40% or 60% groups but not significantly faster than that for the 80% or 100% re- versal groups. (2) The 100% reversal group was significantly faster than the 40% or 60% group. Therefore, a curvilinear funcdon characterizes the re- lation between transfer difficulty and the number of s- R relationships altered. The data are discussed with respect to the Skaggs- Robinson hypothesis of a curvllinear relattonship between similarity and facilitation flobinson, E.

Frederick Snyder (Natl. lnst. of Mental Health, Sect. on Psychophysiol. of Sleep, Bethesda, Md.) (Am. Psychiat.Assoc., 121st Ann. Meettng, NewYork,N,Y.. May state distinct-from sleep and wakefulness. The physiologtcal phenomenon associated with dreaming reports in man is the rapid eye movement state (REMS) which has been demonstrated in all mammals includtng opossum. Other characteristics include shallow, trregular respiration; diffuse, twitch- like muscular movement with some gross movement of exttemittes; increased respiratory and pulse rate; increased systolic pressure in man; and 2-3/sec. \"saw-tooth'' shaped waves on the electroencephalogram preceding or over- lapping clusters of eye movements in man. REMS resembles arousal except for differences in the brain motor funcdon. Periodic occurrences of REMS is dependent upon certain nuclei of the rhombencephalon. Locus coeruleus of the pons is necessary for the tonic motor inhibition assoctated with REMS. Its ablatton results in motor behavlor. Inducdon may be humoral, wtth experimental support for either a cholinerglc or an adrenergic mechanism. Ddldt in REMS is is by cortlcal re- cnvey.

REMS primary role may be to provide needed activity in terms of primitive or instinctual behavior for the developing nervous system in the neonatal and/or embryonic period. In contrast to adult animals which iarely suffer from insomnia, disturbance of this system may occur in man. Efficacy of elrxuoconvulsive therapy may be due to its property to reverse REMS deprivation effects. A66-80169 SIMILARITY OF RADIATION PROTECTION A. Tarasenko. DokladvAkademiiNaukSSSR,vol. 164,110. 2, Sep. 11, 1965,p.441-444. 16 refs. In Russian. The similarity in radiation-protection mechanisms of two aminothiols, an indole-derivative, and anoxia was studied in albino mice, who were subjected to gamma-radiation. The protection was evaluated by the ability of the animals to survive 30 days after exposure. The level of the sulfhydryl group in spleen tissues was determined. All factors (serotonin, cystamine, cysteamine, and anoxta) caused a definite increase in the sulfhydryl group content. After In- jections of aminothiols, this increase was greater than could be expected from the simple chemical action of these compounds. In fact, their concentration in the spleen was decreased. The reason for the sulfhydryl increase nust be sought not in the simple macromolecular reaction, but rather in a catalytic action, which can cause formation of endogenous sulfhydryl-containing compounds other than glutathione, in which the thiol hydrogen has great reactivity. These compounds must be of low molecular weight and can form metabolically stable compounds with biomacromolecules, possibly, through bisulfide coupling. Also, these sulfhydryl compounds could react with free radtcals by inactivating them and interrupting the damage process. This point of view could explatn the high effect of anoxia, which is always greater than that of chemical radia- tion-protectors.

InJection of the solution greatly affected the metabolism of macroergic phosphate compounds by the effect varied with the stage of over- cooling. At the ftrst stages and during rewarming, oxidation and phosphoryla- tion activlty was separate while final stages were accompanied by a high degree of oxidative-phosphorylation with intensive resynthesis of macroergic com- pounds. The stages in dynamics of labile phosphate in the brain, so char- acteristic for hypothermy, are largely conditioned by periodtc reshunling of oxidation from the phosphorylating to the non-phosphorylating pathway. These interrelations have been confirmed in in vitro experiments of the brain cortex of hypothermic animals. A66- 80171 THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF FATTY (USSR, Acad. of Sci., K.

Parabolic flights were shown not to induce pathological changes in the organism, or in the morphology and biochemical values of blood and urine. Concentrations of nonssterized fatty acids after the first parabolic flight significantly increased in the majority of cases. Suf- ficient tolerance of the effects of weightlessness may be indicated by: fl) in- significant changes in pulse frequency in the weightless state; (2) adaptibility to illusions of countenotation and aftenotational nystagmus after a series of parabolic flights and (3) absence of unfavorable sensory and vestibular te- actions (space illusions, dizziness, and motion sickness).

Experiments are presented attempting (l) to studv the effect of stabilizing retinal images on disappearance time, and (2; to quantify thts effect as a func- tion of the size of the stimulus (Landolt rings). The subject, wearing a Contact lens and vlewing monocularly through the optical system, Used to provide stabilization of the image, tapped llghtly on a table when the previously pre- sented Landolt ring had completely disappeared. The disappearance occurred within a few seconds and was related directly to the size of the stimulus. No reappuuance OCCUK~~ if nothing else was changed. A66-80174 THE STATE OF THE INTRAORCANIC BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE LIMB MUSCLES DURING INTENSE PHYSICAL 1. P. Z. Gudz' (Kiev Inst. of Phys. Culture, Dept. of Functional Zhurnal,vol. 11, Jul.-Aug. 1965, p. 477-484. 18 refs. In Ukrainian. During elevated physical loads, the functional capacity of the muscles depends to a great extent on the adaptability of the vascular system to the new physiological conditions. In an experiment on albino rats it was found that during the hypodynamic state many capillaries of the muscles are collapsed. The dilating arterio-venous anastomoses then let part of the arterial blood pass into the vetn, bypassing the capillaries. In animals, in a state of high working capacity (training), the capillary network of the limbs is con- siderably dilated and new capillaries develop. The arterio-venous anastomoses contract, which secures the supply of the entire arterial blood to the capillary network of the muscles. Not only is hypertrophy of the muscle fibers noted. but their quantity Is Increased by longitudinal splitting of previously existing ones. This process is preceded by a rearrangement of the motor innervation of the muscles- hypertrophy of the elements of the motor disks and development of additional motor nerve endings. Thus, a myoneural synapsis develops on each of the parts of the dividing muscle fiber. Under conditions of chronic fatigue the arterio-venous anastomoses dilate, and because of this, part of the artertal blood goes into the vein without reaching the capillary network of the working muscle. This is one of the causes of disturbancy of the ratio of loss to supply of energetic substances. Many muscle and nerve fibers are subjected to dystrophic and destructive changes under these conditions. A66- 60175 THRESHOLDS FOR NEGATIVE AFTER-IMAGES. F. H. C. Marriott &I.

The vigilance task consisted of a cathode cay cihe dtspkj whkh was r.c=itc:d by 40 subjecEs for a period of 4 hr. Several of the organismic variables (personality and intelligence test data) were related to monitoring behavior. These were self-control and flex- ibility as measured by the Caltfornia Psychological Inventory (CPl). Those subjects who scored high on both the intelligence test and the Achievement via Independence scale of the CPI showed no decline in their performance during the long monitoring session. These results suggest the feasibility of predicting subjects performance on a vigllance task from psychological measures. A86-80179 THE VISUAL RESPONSE COMPONENT OF ROTARY PURSUIT TRACKING. Henry S.

Since this finding disagrees with reports by Melton (1 947), Ammons (1951), and Duncan(1957), the present experiment set out to test Adams'watching procedure for reliability and generality. Each of 198 sub- jects tracked the rotary pursuit for 5 min. with the right hand, next received one of 11 different treatments consisting of various durations of watching, resting or both and finally resumed tracking for another 5 min., using the left hand. After statistical adjustment of lefthand scores to the expected post- rest level, the results showed a decremental effect, supporting Adams, and indicated that the effect was functionally related to various durations of watch- ing and resting. This research was designed to test the hypothesis that certain organismic Adam (1955)found that watching the rotary pursuit affected subsequent A86 - 801 80 NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVES AND SEQLENCE LENGTHIN ACQtiISITION OF A STEP- FUNCTION TRACKING TASK.

The roles of two task parameters, sequence length (N) and number of alternatives in the population from which the sequence was drawn &),were examined in a tracking task. The tasks were irregular stepfunction inputs wherein N was defined as the number of targets (steps) in a repeating se- quence and K was defined as the number of alternative target positions. N and K were varied independently in a 3 x 3 factorial design Wtth 9 suqects per cell. The major findings were that tracking performance, as measured by integrated error scores, is affected by increases in N, but not proportionately, while neither K nor the N x K interaction was significant.

From a brief review of studies of muscle tension during sleep it is con- cluded that the widely accepted positive correlation between cerebral and psychological activity and muscle tension does not hold during desynchronized sleep (DS). Some similarittes between DS and extreme relaxatton are postu- lated, and a check of this hypothesis is suggested.

HFE- 6, Sep. 1965, If a person could tell a computer exactly how he would evaluate every p. 3- 13. alternative that might arise, the machine could decide between any two alterna- tives as the person himself would. A fairly realistic experiment was done to test the feasibility of \"interpolation between corners\"as a psychological method for telling a machine how to compute the worths of multidimensional alternatives. The results were satisfactory. A statistic called fractional disagree- ment is proposed as the proper measure of the machine's success in mimick- ing the man's decisions. The concept of conflict between the dimensions of two alternatives is explained. The size of the conflict and the size of the dif- ference between the worths that the machine ascribed to the alternatives were found to help to predict the correctness of the machine's decision. Con- flict and dtfference in computed worth should, therefore, be useful in defining regions where the machine should give the dectsion back to the man and tell him to make the choice.

With this theory it is possible to obtain a time-varying im- pulse response function and a time varying transfer function which represent the action of a human operator In an open- or closeddoop control system. No special form of iiiput is required. The characterization, that may be In etcher real-time or nonreal-time, is based upon an exact theory of fixed-form optimiza- tion. A strongly convergent, definitely stable iteration technique can be used to realize the optimal characterization filter. The theory takes the time variation * -L - ,--..I-- --e----- ..*.. \".... .I..__.__. necessary to make the assumptton of slowly vmng dynamics. An uncertainty or compromise exists between the error, i.e., the error between the output of the human operator and that of the optimal characterizing filter, and the degree of variabilii of the optimal characterizing filter. This uncertainty is fundamental, and therefore cannot be circumvented. Although the theory has been verified by extensive experimental study, emphasis here is placed upon presentation of the theory.

At the end of the tests rectal temperature was at an average 39OC. The effects of combined thermal and hypoxtc stress on cardiovascular and respiratory activity appeared to be additive. Subsequently, stmtiar experlments were per- formed on lightly anesthetized dogs, where hypoxia of a more severe degree (Inspired PO?: 52, 41 and 29 mm. Hg) was employed. In these animals hypoxia invariably inhibited or entirely suppressed shivering, and in the cold they suffered a moreraptd fall of mean body temperature under hypoxia than on air. Expertments in which a normal parttal pressure of CO2 was maintained by partial rebreathing suggest that hypocapnia may contribute to the sup- presston of shivering In the cold. During the exposure to heat there was a marked factlitation of panting under hypoxia, giving rise to extreme hyperpnea with hypocapnia. A68-80189 TOLERANCE TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF COLD AND OF ABNORMAL ATMOSPHERE. Radoslav K. AndJus pelgrade U., Fac. of Sci.. Inst. of PROC. FIRST INTERN. SYMP. ON BASIC ENVIRON. PROBL. OF MAN IN SPACE, PARIS, 1982. Wien, Springer-Verlag, 1985, p. 105- 130; discussion, p. 131. 29 refs. The relationship between the effects of cold (external and Internal) and dlffuent forms of anoxla is discussed on the basis of data from animal ex- perlments, especially from the point of view of tolerance limits and with some reference to the underlying mechanisms. Resistance to external (envlron- mental) cold is impaired by hypoxia (hypercapnia) which Interferes with thermoregulation and renders dUficult the matntenance of thermal homeostasts. Hypoxia may act as a hypothermla-lnducing agent in a cold environment which by Itself can be tolerated without change of body temperature. On the other hand, even such changes of ambient atmosphere, which at higher environ- mental temperatures can be compensated by phystological regulatory mech- anirms, may induce in the cold serlous disturbances of thermal homeostasis. From the polnt of vlew of homeostatic resistance, therefore, a mutual potenti- ation of the effects of cold and anoxia may be descrtbed. From the survival point of view, however, Internal cold (hypothermta), induced by anoxia in a cold envltonment, may have a protective value; the fall of body temperature renders the homeotherm capable of surviving under anoxic condttions whtch would be lethal at normal body temperature.

Some of the main conclusions reached are: (a) the changes caused by stresses in question are generally spectflc in character; @)reactions vary considerably from tndtvldual to Individual, the difference in many cases being greater than between the same indtvidual's reactions to various stresses: (c) the changes provoked by stratn of longer duration do not follow a simple linear course; (d) all changes occurring in htgher nervous activity under stress are Identical in form with those observed in neurotics; (e) the most typical feature is a dts- turbance in internal inhtbition (as reponed by Pavlov); $)there is no slmple correlation between btochemical reactions and reactions in higher nervous activity; and @) exposure to prolonged stress lowers resistance to supertm- posed stress of short duration.

To determine the endocrine and metabolic response of restrained dogs to whole body vibration, pentobarbital anesthetized and non-anesthetized dogs were vibrated horizontally. After vibration of anesthetized dogs at either 4 C.P.S., 0.4 g for 30 minutes or 2 hours, or at 10 c.P.s., 2.3 g for 2 hours, there was an average increase of 4.06 mcg. 17- hydroxycorticosterotds (17-OH- CS) per 100 ml. plasma and a stgnificant increase in blood epinephrine but not serotonin o: norepinephrine. Shak!:g at 4 c.P.s., 1.7 g for 30 minutes produced less of a change in plasma 17-OH-CS than at 0.4 g. However, shaking at 4 c.p.s for 6 hours led to greater increase in plasma 17- OH- CS at 1.7 g than at 0.4 g. Non- anesthetized dogs shaken at 4 C.P.S. for 30 minutes had a greater increase of plasma 17-OH- CS than similarly shaken anesthetized dogs, thus showing a greater sensttivity of kinesthetic receptors to vibratory stimult.

As a gems of better understanding the role of the vestibular organs in relation to ataxic responses to prolonged rotation, two contrasting groups of subjects were utilized to (1) determine quantitatively to what extent two visually- enchanced postural equilibrium test performances of labyrinthtne defective subjects (L- D's) on a single rail of optimum difficulty become dis- turbed along the time axis of rotation (Experiment A), and (2) compare the performances of these L- D subjects with those of normal subjects in terms of postrotation effects as studied with a new standardized ataxia test battery (Experiment B). Rotation- induced ataxia was superimposed to an apprectable extent upon the previously present and characteristic vestibular ataxia in the 1-D's (Exp.

Thirteen simulated flights with 25 subjects and 4 chamber operators were performed udng some 8,300 numbers and words and 2,200 words in sentences to help evaluate communlcatton intelltgtbtlity In oxygen at 5 and 3.5 p.s.t.a., in oxygen- and- nitrogen at 7 p.s.i.a., and in oxygen- and- heltum at 7 p.s.i.a., and to compare these findings with those obtained in room air at ground level. Three-way communication was carried out between chamber subjects, and ground level operators in room atr. No statistically significant differences could be detected in test results when either words within sentences or random numbers were employed, but unrelated words resulted in statistically significant differences in some cases. The same order of magnitude or less of errors re- sulted in a reduced oxygen- and- helium environment as in an oxygen environ- ment at the same oxygen partial pressure, thus indicattng no new communt- cation intelltgtbility problems are created by the additton of helium. Also, the effects due to tiring of lack of alertness create as many problems in room alr as do the reduced pressures U subjects are alert. More errors result between subjects in test environments than between subjects and operators, in which case phone communications equipment is necessary. Most errors are of the rhyming type.

In thts manner, a profile of the patterns of air- sickness was obtained on each student over the course of the primary flight training. The incidence of this type airsickness was 17.6% (1 88 students out of 1,067). Correlations between incidents of airsickness per student and their ground school grades and fllght grades were not statistically significant.

A66-80207 EXERCISE AND THE PATELLAR REFLEX. Charles M. Tipton and Peter V. Karpovich Mseases AM 06724-01 555. The relationship between muscular activity and patellar reflex time (the time from the striking of the patellar tendon to the beginning of leg extension) of the right leg was investigated on male subjects between the ages of 17 and 50 yrs. Riding a friction bicycle for 5 or more min. or performing 600 or more ipsilateral or contralateral extensions was associated with shortened times; but only the former was changed significantly. The Jendrassik maneuver be- fore and after exhaustive exercise shortened reflex time; however, the post. exercise readings did not approach preexercise times. Reflex times tended to shorten with training. The results demonstrated that reflex time will shorten or lengthen, depending upon the amount of exercise performed.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether there were age differences in thermoregulatory behavior, and to relate these differences to age differences in rate of loss of body heat in a cold environment. Thirty male Sprague- Dawley rats, evenly divided among three age groups, 7, 12, and 28 months of age, were placed in an experimental chamber within a refrigerator for 16 hrs. and were given access to a lever that turned on a heat lamp. The ambient temperature within the refrigerator was set at Z0C., the output of the heat lamp was 2 50 watts, and the duration of each heat burst was 2 sec. Previous to this experimental session, determinations had been made of the effects of this low ambient temperature on the rectal temperature of the rats. Over the age range investigated, the rats learned and performed thermoreg- ulatory lever-pressing behavior equally well, and showed equal heat loss as measured by rectal temperature.

Cardiac output increased by 76Yw heart rate increased by 257\" and arterial pressure did not change significantly in 9 sub- jects who breathed 8% oxygen in nitrogen for 7- 8 min. Addition to this in- spired gas mixture of sufficient carbon dioxide to raise arterial pC02 to its control value reduced the circulatory changes, but raised arterial oxygen tension from an average of 37 to 52 mm. Hg as a result of increased ventilation. Abolition of hypocapnia without change in arterial oxygen tension, by reducing oxygen concentration from 9 to 7% when C02 was added to Inspired gas, produced no change in the circulatory responses to hypoxia in 12 sublects. Thus, hypocapnia does not appear to be responsible for the increase in cardiac output, heart rate, and forearm blood flow which accompany acute arterial hypoxia.

The response to water touching the face was similar but smaller, heart rate and forearm blood flow both falling by about 10yp It was concluded that both water touching the face and breath holding contribute toward the reduction in heart rate and forearm blood flow found on immersing the face in water, the major contribution coming from the breath holding.

AM-80212 RESPONSE OF CAPACITY VESSELS IN HUMAN LIMBS TO HEAD-UP TILT AND SUCTION ON LOWER BODY. Shlomo L. Samueloff, Norman L. Browse, and John T.

The \"occluded\"ltmb technique was used for continuous monitoring of reflexly mediated changes in venous tone in 10 normal subjects. Tilting to 70' head up and exposure of the lower pan of the body to subatmospheric pressure (60 mm. Hg) caused a transtent increase in venous pressure tn the hand, foot, and forearm whose circularion was arrested, in contrast to a matn- rained decrease in forearm blood flow. On return to the horizontal or release of suction, another transient rise in venous pressure often occurred in associ- ation with an tncrease in forearm blood flow. The transient venous responses could not be related to the redistribution of blood caused by these procedures. It seems that reflex changes in tone of the capacity vessels in the limbs are not an essential part of the compensatory vascular responses for matntenance Of systemic arterial blood pressure in the upright position, although the transient increase in tension of the walls of the capacity vessels may aid the resistance vessels in reducing the rate of pooling of blood in dependent parts.

The effect of regular and Irregular enforced exercise peadmlll and swimmlng) on the food Intake, weight gain, and, in some cases, spontaneous activity of adult male Sprague- Dawley rats wa3 observed. Regular enforced runntng for 4 consecutive days a week caused a reduction in these functions with some increase on the days free of exercise. Enforced swimming for 2 hr. or less/day had a similar effect but swimming for 4 hr./day Qd not reduce food Intake. All swimming groups showed less proportionate decrease in food intake than the controls In response to a hot environment. Rats exposed to irregular bouts of enforced treadmill or swimming exercise every 3rd or 4th day decreased food intake on that day with an increase on the 1 st or 2nd day following. The reduction and subsequent increase of food Intake were even more prominent In rats trained to eat thek daily food in 3 hr./day. This re- sponse of rats to enforced exercise, reminlscent of that observed by some In man, does not appear to be explained by current hypotheses of the control of food intake. A88- 802 21 REACTION IN MAN OF RESISTANCE AND CAPACITY VESSELS IN FORE- ARM AND HAND TO LEG EXERCISE. 8. Sture Bevegard and John T. Shepherd (Mayo Clln. and Mayo studled in normal subjects. Following a transient Increase in forearm blood flow (strain- gauge plethysmograph) and decrease in arterial blood pressure with onset of exerclse, the flow remains at the pre- exercise value or, with severe exercise (1,200 kg./min.), decreases to less than half that value as arterial pressure increases. These changes in forearm flow re- sulted from dllatation followed by consulction of muscle vessels, and with moderate to severe exercise a gradual dllatation of vessels In forearm skin as deduced from changes in oxygen saturation of blood from forearm muscle and skin veins. The resistance vessels In the hand constricted with onset of exercise and dilated again toward the end of the exercise period. The capaclty vessels consnicted with onset of exercise; the consulction persisted throughout exercise and was graded like that of the resistance vessels In muscle to the work load. These vessel reactions were mediated by sympathetic flbers and could be blocked In the forearm by local heating. The venomotor reflex mlght be elicited by the muscle contractions.

Men walked for 3 hr. while exposed to square pulses of environmental heat at 55 and 3OoC. under condltlons whlch permttted free evaporation of sweat. The pulses involved heat loads, M+ R+ C, of 750 and 2 50 kcal.jhr. alternated at Intervals of 30, 15, and 7.5 min. The average hourly sweat rate, heart rate, and skin and rectal temperatures durtng the pulsed exposures were slmllar to those observed in steady exposures at an environmental temperature midway between. Simtlarly, when the same three subjects walked alternately at speeds of 5.6 and 2.0 km./hr. tn a constant environ- ment at 460C. with total heat load at 560 and 440 kcal./hr. their average responses were not different from those observed at a steady pace with a metabolic rate midway between. Thus within the limtts of the study, a time- weighted avaage of conditions of unsteady exposures was uaable for pre- dicting over- all physiologtc strains.

The transtent and steady- state ventilations were slrnllar for comparable levels of oxygen consumption at each pedallng speed. It Is concluded that the speed of leg motion does not affect the ventilatory response to exerclse independent of the total work load. If the proprioceptor stimulus is frequency dependent, these results indlcate that proprtoceptor activity has little Influence In the ventilatory response to exercise. The results do not rule out the possibtllty of a combination of frequency and force acting as a pro- prioceptor sttmulus to ventilation.

Anesthetized dogs were ventilated with a hyperbarically oxygenated modified Ringer solution at 37OC. Minute volumes of ventilation ranged from 1 to 4 liters at respiratory frequencies of 6- 21 bresths/min. Ltquid ventilation resembled pump ventilation with air except that volume displace- ments occu~ed by gravity instead of a piston. 40 ranged from 1,380 to 3,640 mm. Hg.

The duration of ltquid ventilation varled from 26 to 43 min. The panlal pressures of oxygen in ltquid exhaled into a long sampling tube were progressively higher and the carbon dtoxtde tensions were progressively lower at increasing distances from the lung. It is concluded that pulmonary gas exchange in liqutd-ventilated dogs is diffusion limited and can be descrtbed mathematically in terms of radial diffusion in a sphere.

The nature of the fiber stimulated was deduced from the strength of the stimulus used. Stimulation at threshold and up to 5 times threshold produced 3.6-13.1Aaugmentation of ventilation. These impulses probably originate in group I and group I1 fibers of muscle spindles and tendon organs. Stimulation of the nerve at 10, 20, and 40 times threshold produces increase in ventllation due to the stimu- lation of group 111 afferents which are known to be connected to pressure receptors, and the excitatory effect persists for a while after the stimulus is over. Natural stimulation of these endings by pressure of the order of 1 kg./cm.2 to 5 kg./cm? also produces hyperventilation. ADJUSTMENT RATES FOLLOWING HYPER- VENTI LATl ON. S. F. Sullivan, R. W.

H20. The decrease in lung volume is mainly due to the cranial displacement of the abdomen; although at the end of spontaneous expirations during submersion the diaphragm is stretched almost as far as at full exptration, it is relaxed, where- as during a full expiration It contracts. The end- expiratory pressures across the rib cage, the diaphragm, and the abdominal wall are: - 19, - 14, and -13 cm. 1120during submersion, and -23.5, -11.5 and -12 during negative pressure breathing. Notwlthstandlng the lack of the graviratlonal effect of the abdomen during submersion, the shape of the chest wall is almost the same as during negative-pressure breathing because of the low compliance of the rib cage. During submersion the airways resistance increases by 58% because of the lung volume decrease; during negative-pressure breathing it lncreases by 157.7,, the extra lncrease being due to the compression of the extrathoracic atways.

Wellcome Found and Northern Ireland Hosp. Authority supported research. A study of the mechanical propertles of the lungs in specific pathogen- free (SPF)rats and ordinary (non- SPF)rats was carried out using anesthetized anlmals. Pulmonary compliance was measured under static condltions. the measured pulmonary resistance was that offered by the alnvay and tissues during flow. In the SPF rats, the mean pulmonary compltance was 0.25mlJcm. HZO (sd = 0.04) and the mean pulmonary resistance In tracheostomized animals was 0.14 cm. HzO/ml. per sec. (sd = 0.04). Upper alnvay resistance was estimatedto be 53gof the total pulmonary flow reslstance. For the pur- poses of comparison between the SPF and non- SPF groups, the antmals were arbitrarUy divided into two subgroups (young and old) ustng 12 months as the dividhg line. Pulmonary resistance was compared In tracheonomhed animals because upper away resistance accounts for a large pan of the total resistance, and changes in resistance in the lower alnvays would not be easlly detected if total resistances were compared. It was found that old non- SPF animals hnd significantly higher pulmonary resistances than the SPF as well as the young non- SPF rats.

When a sinusoidally varying pressure is applied to a system possessing an extremely large number of parallel pathways (assumed to be analogous to the lung), each with its own mechanical time constant (compliance x resistance), the complex compliance will be expressed in the integral trans- form of the distribution function of the mechanical time constant. The dts- tribution function was obtained graphically using an approximation method to solve the integral transform. In normal subjects the log dtstributlon func- tion curve had a maximum point at a time constant of about 0.2 sec. and had a narrow and rougt ly symmetrical shape with respect to the time con- stant of the maximum, while the spectra in emphysematous patients showed a flat or trapezoidlike functlon with a maximum at a much higher time con- stant. about 1 sec. or more.

The char- acteristic patterns of Wv and WF as a function of speed were andyed. The external work per step, Wtot= Wv + WF, must be sustained by muscular actlvlty; both Wv and WF alone, on the contrary, are not directly related with muscular activity, as the rigid skeletal structures make possible the trans- formation of kinetic energy into potential, and vice versa.

Study of dynamic as well as stable- state ventilatory responses to changes in respiratory stimuli is becoming increasingly Important in attempts to ex- plore the control of pulmonary ventlation. Instrumentatlon is described for accurate automatic measurement of breath- by- breath respiratory minute volume (VE~ respiratory frequency (f), and tidal volume (VT) Use of the instrument in the study of pharmacological actions and In the investigation of physiological mechanisms is descrlbed. The action of a recycling, water- sealed, dual spirometer unit upon a potentiometer provides a voltage ac- curately proportional, to tidal volume. An electromechanical divtder unit simultaneously measures the period (P) of a respiration and computes respiratory mlnute volume and respiratory frequency on a breath- by- breath basts as the ratios VT/P = Vt and 1/P = f. Appropriate voltages are sampled and clamped at the end of each breath for recording. As described, tidal volumes in the range 0- 4 liters and resplratory frequencies from 7- 110 breaths/min. can be measured with an accuracy of 2 2 R of full scale easily attainable.

The system measures the followlng three aspects of ventilation: ttdnl volume, tnittal volume of nitrogen in the lungs, and pattern of distri- bution of Inspired gas. The technique for using the system is also described. The apparatus is unsuitable for following slow, continuous changes in lung volume, and for thts purpose a body plethysmograph is preferable.

The indirectly measured diastolic pressures were consistently higher than the directly re- corded values in one subject and they were consistently lower than the directly measured diastolic pressures for the other subject.

In hypothermic rats (25OC.) the injection of glucagon did not produce hyperglycemia but the re- duction in blood inorganic phosphorus levels was still obtained. Following the administration of glucagon, an increase in the excretion of inorganic phorphorus in the urine was observed in both normothermic and hypothermlc rats. The fall in blood inorganic phosphorus level was considered to be due, in part at least, to the effect of glucagon in increasing the pxcro!ior. of led to hyperglycemia, and a A68-80248 LIGHT INDUCED CHANGES IN THE LIPIDS OF CHLORELLA VULGARIS. 8.

Med., Great Britain). (Symp. on Cutaneous Responses to Thermal Stress, Chicago U., Feb. 20- 22,1965). Archives of Environmental Health, vol. 11, Oct. 1965, p. 407-422. 37 refs. Adaptive changes take place in the human sweating mechanism as the result of repeated episodes of thermal stimulation. A given thermal Strain then produces an augmented response and the enhanced sweating capacity serves to improve heat regulation during the acclimatization process. When body temperature is repeatedly elevated, only minimal changes occur in sweating capacity if at the same time sweat- gland activity is inhibited by in- direct cooling.These observations support the concept of a peripheral training phenomenon; but the possibility that concurrent changes occur in central nervous excitability cannot be enttrely discounted in view of the re- ported earlier initial response of the sweat glands in the acclimatized state. However, the lack of any change in sensitivity to neurohumoraal agents at the periphery suggests that neural changes, if they occur, are more likely to be associated with central responsiveness. Glandular training may also be artificially induced by repeated direct chemical stimulation, and the char- acteristics of the enhanced responses are generally consistent with the events in heat acclimatization. These facts have been utilized to demonstrate that the local response to a standard injection of sudorific drug can be used to monitor changes in sweat output in groups of persons undergoing heat acclimatiza- tion. Some of the events at the peripheral site which bring about sweat- gland training are recognized, but their relative importance cannot yet be identified. There is no evidence that the number of active glands multiply; the increased sweat output appears to derive from a series of events at first involving metabolic changes in the glands and improvement in vascular supply and leading possibly to an eventual hypertrophy of the glandular elements.

(Symp. on Cutaneous Responses to Thermal Stress, Chicago U., Feb. 20- 22,1965). Archives of Environmental Health, vol. 11, Oct. 1965, D. 423- 427; disc-s,t;n ContractDA-193-MD-2176; Grants PHS AM-05635; and5-TI-AM-5300. A review is presented on varlous aspects of the human eccrine sweat gland. These include morphological description of the gland, a comparison of the renal tubule fo the function of the sweat gland, cytological changes in the sweat gland due to sweating, electrolyte excretion, glycogen relation to sodium reabsorption and reaction of sweating to hormones. Using the results of these morphological and functional studies, a model of the eccrine sweat gland is proposed. Basically the model pictures a gland actively secreting sodium in isotonic fluid. Glycogen depletion in the se- cretory cells is varlable with time, urd cannot be used as an index of mea% formation. Some sodium reabsorption takes place in the duct while sweat rate remains unaffected. This indicates that some action must be exchanged for the sodium. Glycogen continuously depleted in the duct cells, indicates sodium reabsorption activity. Mineralocorticoids facilitate sodium reabsorp- tion. Furthermore, acdimatlzation at the saeat gland level may be an in- Qcanon of the lack of adaptation of the duct to aldosterone. Thts being in contrast to the kidney, the sweat gland can be used in cooling the body with minimal loss of sodium. p. +?E-?:$. 25 K&S. A66-80250 VASCULAR AND SWEATING RESPONSES TO REGIONAL HEATING.

Employing twin climate chambers in which a copper screen bed may be rapidly moved from one chamber to the other, each maintained at different ambient temperatures, functional responses of normal human subjects to varying thermal stress were examined. The functions studied included mul- tiple channels of sweating, cutaneous and deep body temperatures, cutaneou vascular pulses, ECG, blood pressure, etc. Major conclusions include the following: (1) The onset of sweating and vasodilatation during progressive elevation of ambient temperature is influenced by both surface and internal body temperatures, but is not controlled exclusively by dther. It appears that both internal and skin temperatures must be elevated to elicit maximal responses. (2) Temperature of the head and the six breathed plays a dg- nUicant role in the onset and intensity of sweating and vasodilation. (3) Sweating decreases very quickly or ceases entirely when a subject is rapidly moved from an ambient temperature of 6OoC. or less into a cool environ- ment, while volume pulse amplitudes return to control levels very slowly. However, sweating is sustained for more prolonged periods when body storage of heat is greater as a result of exposure to extremely high (90OC.) ambient temperatures. A66-80251 HIDROMEIOSIS.

Hidromdosis is a decrement of the rate of thermally-induced sweating. Alternative hypotheses proposed to explain the latter are examined and problems which remain unsolved are indicated. The following conclusions are drawn from experiments and observations presented: (1) at vapor pres- sures less than that of the skin, the sweat rate must exceed a threshold value for the process of hidromeiosis to be Inldated; (2) once initiated hidromdosis proceeds exponentially to a limiting sweat rate which is ap- proximately that of the threshold; (3) females have a lower threshold and a higher rate constant for hidromeiosis than males; (4) hidromeiosis may be reversed by exposing wetted skin to dry air, by stripping wetted Stratum corneum, and by rapidly drinking large volumes of water; (5) hidromeiosis may be prevented by bathing subjects in 10%- 15% NaCl or by removing the stratum corneum prior to exposure to moist heat; (6) the primary mechanism for hidromeiosis seems to involve the skin; and (7) adaptatton of thermal receptors and fatigue of the eccrine sweat gland are not processes related to hidromeiosis.

Experiments were planned to determine the relations of the sweating responses of men during work on the treadmill to corresponding changes in temperature of the (a) skin, @)rectum, (c) gastrocnemius muscles, (d) femoral vein draining blood from the working leg muscles, and (e) the long saphenous vein draining the skin of the leg. In one series of experiments the subjects worked on the treadmill at three different rates, and the environmental temperature was the same. In another series of four experiments on subject A the room temperature was varied and the subject worked at the same rate in all four experiments. In final analysis the data of these experiments in- dicate that the regulation of sweat rate involves the integration of a number of factors. No one thermal sense organ could account for the sweating responses which these subjects made in relation to independent variations of environ- mental temperature and work intensity as discussed above. Factors which may participate in this regulation include (a) reflexes originating from cuta- neous thermoreceptors, @) increased sensitivity and activity of the hypothalamic center as its temperature increases, (c) possible thermoreceptors located in the muscles themselves, or in the veins draining blood from the working muscles, and (d) neuromuscular Influences on the hypothalamic center.

Data on various forms of miliaria (crystallina, rubra, pustulosa, profunda) are reviewed. The morphological changes that develop in the skin and the symptoms that arise therefrom depend entirely on what level in the skin the obstruction occurs and at what level the sweat is retained. The etiologic problems are far from settled. Nor are the mechanisms of the disease com- pletely understood. However. it is generally agreed that the primary disease is an isolated one that takes place in the skin at the sweat pore and duct. Any systematic reactions of clinical, biochemical, or endocrlnologlcal import that OCCUI are secondary to this initial local event and are Only Severe when severe inflammation of the skin occurs and/or when the needed evaporative heat loss is impaired and acclimatization is interfered with.

Pharmacologically active substances are released from the thermally in- jured sktn of human and animal subjects. Among others there are histamine, bradykinin, adenylic compounds, and possibly serotonin. The amount of pharmacologically active substances released is directly related to the degree of injury. Following burning of the skin, degradation products are released that are toxic and lethal to the host. This toxin or todns are to be differ- entiated from the pharmacologically active substances described above. It is postulated that a true burn toxin or toxins exist. The release of histamine from the skin of animals and man begins at threshold stimuli and the amount released is directly related to the stimulus. It is postulated that histamine is the chemical mediator for cutaneous pain. A66-80255 THE FACTOR OF TEMPERATCRE IN ULTRAVIOLET INJURY. Robert G, Freeman and John M. Knox (Baylor U.

Irradiated mtce did not live as long in a heated environment as they did at room temperature. The rate of developing skin tumors was higher in mice exposed to ultraviolet light and kept in a hot environment than in mice similarly exposed but kept at room temperature.

The findings presented indicate that both freezing and non- freezing cold injury of the skin are direct consequences of progressive microcirculatory dysfunction. This dysfunction is initiated by vasospasm, but the development of tissue damage parallels neither the distribution Of vasoconsuiction nor a cooling gradient but corresponds closely to the extent of secondary erythrostasis. The basis is a result of endogenously mediated venular- capillary dilation and leakage with consequent hemoconcentration and increased frictional resistance to flow leading to a critical slowing of the circulation through the venular drainage bed. If the circulatory obstruction remains confined to the terminal vascular plexus, the corresponding epidermal necrosis may be re- paired by regeneration. Irreversible tissue damage (gangrene) is associated with the occurrence of widespread necrotizing angtitis and thrombosis which gradually extend from the microvasculature into the major veins and arteries. : 60 I , A66-80257 RESPONSE OF HUMAN EPIDERMlS TO GRADED THERMAL STRESS: A MORPHOLOGIC COMPARISON OF BURNS, COLD-INDUCED BLISTERS, AND PEMPHlClrS VULGARIS.

Although the exact nature of their mechanoelastic behavior depends apparently on the varylng amount of etherwater extractables present, these measurements reflect in a general sense the ability of the tissue specimen to react to changes in environmental conditions. From the results it would appear that the outermost layer of skln behaves in a manner very much like other proteinaceous material of slmilar nature. Apparently the tissue sample reacts to changes in environment qualitatively in the same fashion as, for example, wool and hair fibers, an altogether not unexpected relationship. The stress relaxation responses to salt solutions, to varying pH conditions, to presence of different cations, etc., all suggest that the observed pattern in all of these systems is a net result Of several processes working with and against each other with varying time constants.

On each trial a list of 6 A-B pairs was presented once, then 1 of these 6 pairs was te'sted for recognition. On the recognition tests either A-B (a proper pair) or A-X (an improper pair) was presented; subject had to make a binary ges- no) decision plus a confidence rating. From these data ROC curves were plotted, and they resembled the curvilinear functions of signal-detection theory more than the linear function required by the high- threshold concept. These results call into question the use of a high-threshold concept to explain findings from studies of 1 -trial learning.

The operating characteristic is used to examine the relation between the recognition of a single item and the recognition of a pair of items. Twenty- nine subJects listened to a sequence of 5 digits, and then copied a sequence of 8 digtts. Then they were given a test of recognition memory for one or two diglts from the original sequence. The operating characteristic for single digits is a smooth functton that is symmetrical about the major diagonal, whereas the curve for pairs is highly asymmetrical. False- recognition rates for test pairs containing one digit from the original sequence are only slightly greater than false- recognition rates for completely new pairs. Recognition of a pair does not appear to result from independent recognition of each digit. A mathematical model is developed in which the strength of the memory trace has a continuous distribution which is incremented in a probabilistic fashion upon presentation of an item or pair.

Rather, time In store and difficulty of transform both contribute to determining the amount of forgetting. Experiment IV shows that the loss of material in store is a decreasing function of its distance prior to the transform, but that the transformed material itself shows no decline in retention. These results point to an operational definition of rehearsal as a process requiring part of the limited central capacity of subject. A66-80270 USE OF NEGATIVE SLOPE TRANSFORMATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE OF RESULTS ON A SIMPLE MOTOR RESPONSE. Donald A. Schumsky (Tulane U., New Orleans, La.) Journal of Experimental Psychology,vol. 70, Nov. 1965, p. 534-536. Bilodeau (1 953) studies a series of transformations of knowledge of re- sults (KR) which had slope and intercept constants varying inversely with one another making it impossible to partitton their separate effects. The present study, by employing transformations with both positive and negative slopes, had comparable groups equated for slope constant but varying intercept values. , Eighty subjects were given 18 discrete trials to learn a simple knob-turning response. Each response was followed by an appropriately transformed KR. Results revealed that sub)ects'inittal responding is related to the value of the intercept constant of the transformation equation. Subsequently, the speed of learning is directly related to the absolute size of the slope constant of the transformation equation.

The average galvanic skin response (GSR) to the light showed an intrasession @ut no intersession) adaptation effect for both sexes but this effect was al- most gone for the males on the last session. In addition, the males made significantly larger GSRs than the women on all 3 sessions, especially on the last session.

Twenty male albino rats were used as sub]ects In determlnlng behavioral effects of ultra high frequency radiation. Experimental subjects were exposed to low intensity (50,000 mV.), low frequency (300 mc. to 920 mc.) UHF radio waves for 47 consecutive days. Radiated rats were more active than non- radiated rats during the early part of the experlment, but became less active as the days of radiation increased. The UHF group was more emotional than the non-UHF group and showed a gradual increase in the latency of recovery from electroshock convulsion. No differences were found for weight, audiogenic seizures, and water consumption. Results suggest that (a) some time is re- quired for UHF to have a consistent effect on behavior, and @) the effects on behavior may be non- thermal and related to neurophystological substrates.

Psychological Repons,vol. 17, Oct. 1965, p. 635-646. 9 refs. Grant NSF GS- 311 and Contract AF 49(838)- 1441. The effects of variation in the stimulus and response uncertainty of a decidon task on the decision maker's sublective uncertainty, amount of in- formation search, and informatlon processing were examined. Results in- dicated that: (a) information search tended to continue until one bit of stim- ulus and/or response uncertainty remained, independent of the level of lnitlal uncertainty; @)the higher the stimulus uncertainty of the decislon task, the faster the subject began seeking information; and (c) sublectlve uncertainty increased with both stimulus and response uncertatnty. Unfonunately, the data precluded adequate examination of the possible relatlonshtp between subJective uncertainty and search behavlor, but the latency of search was 62 1 negatively correlated with the magnitude of subjective uncertainty across subjects, suggesting that a more extensive examination of the motivational effects of subjective uncertainty would be of value.

Changes in skin conductance (GSR), skin potential (SP), heart rate(HR), finger blood volume (BV), and pulse volumepf) were recorded in 24 subjects in response to 2- sec. bursts of white noise. Five intensity levels of sound (60, 70, 60, 90, and 100 db.) were presented over 5 repetitions. Results showed that: (1) response magnitudes and latencies were directly related to stimulus intensity and inversely related to number of repetitions; (2) for BV, SP, and GSR the effect of repetition varied with stimulus intensity; (3) HR changes were primarily monophasic; and (4) BV and PV were more sensitive to stimulus intensity differences than were the electrodermal responses.

Active eccrine sweat gland activity was measured in 30 Negro and 29 Caucasian male subjects to determine whether sweat gland activity was a possible factor in racial differences in skin conductance. Basal skin con- ductance, heart rate, respiratory rate, finger skin temperature and blood pres- sure were also obtained. Negro subjects had significantly lower skin conductance but no other significant physiological differences were found. While there was no significant difference in number of active sweat glands between the races, the intragroup relationship between sweat gland count and skin conductance was significantly higher for the Negro subjects. The two groups did not differ in number of nonspecific galvanic sktn responses (GSRs) but the Cau- casian subjects showed greater change in skin conductance to an initial tone stimulus. When differences in prestimulus levels were taken into account, the group differences in response to stimuli were no longer significant.

Moment- by- moment changes in the phase or relative timing of electroen- cephalographic (EEG) patterns in different brain areas show great lability and psychological responsiveness, and are studied as possible correlates of peripheral psychophysiological reaction. Relative leading, lagging, and in- phase relationships between EEGs of different brain areas are automatically recorded, and stimuli classed as simple sensory, indifferent- ideational, dis- anterior and central brain areas is found to characterize conditions oi arousal. Rapid diphasic reversals of interarea EEG phase relationship during mental activity is possibly symptomatic of interaction between brain areas.

An experiment was conducted on four groups of trainee postal sorters to examine the relationship between age and progressive part and whole learning methods. The median age of the older groups was 42.5 and those of the younger groups were 26.5 and 27. The younger group, which learned by the progressive part method, had signtficantly higher scores than the younger group, which learned by the whole method. There was no significant difference between the. two methods for the older groups. It is suggested that the performance dif- ference between young and old individuals using progressive part learning was due to the increased effects with age of interference and unlearning difficulties.

The effect of exposure times varying between 900 and 100 msec. on the critical frequency of fusion (CFF) was studied in 15 young and 13 older healthy men, at a light: dark ratio of 1.9. In both age groups, the CFF dropped from the high to low exposure times by 5- 8 C.P.S. The curves of two age groups, however, were not parallel along their entire length. The drop of CFF at shorter exposures was dgniflcantly greater for older than younger men. At all exposure times, the CFF was signiftcantly higher in the younger group than in the older group (P< .001). AM-80286 THE PSYCHOLOGY OFTIME. M. Trelsman. Dtscovery, vol. 26, Oct. 1965, p. 40-45. Human estimation of temporal intervals is usually inaccurate. It seems to depend on the psychological state of the person. Although it is generally assumed that an uninteresting occupation \"makes time drag\", while persons absorbed in work do not notice the passage of time, experimental Investiga- tions have indicated the reversed effect. The same parodox was noted when individuals were isolated for a long period of time. The explanation may lie In a hypothesis postulated by Dr. Hudson Hoagland, who proposed that nervous systems may contain \"pace- maker\" cells, which regulate normal physiological activities, such as respiration and cardiac contractions, and that the rate at which they produce impulses may be affected by the body temperature and apparently depends on chemical processes. The use of a model consisting of a Pacemaker, a Counter and a Store produced results which indicate the presence of an internal clock, which generates temporal information. Some evidence indicates that the possible location of this unit may be certain small areas of the thalamus, but more information is necessary to fully answer the question of time]udgment. A8E-80287 DO CELLS HAVE CLOCKS 7 8. M. Sweeney. D~SCOVCIY,VOI. 26, Oct. 1965, p. 34-39. Observations of plant and animal physiology and behavior disclosed a circadian rhythm with a period of about 24 hrs. Some animals and plants show definite seasonal variations in growth and behavior. Several factors were noted, which may influence biological rhyrhms. The axial and orbital rotation of the earth has been established as one. Variations in temperature have been noted to affect the activity of some organisms. Light is the most im- portant factor, which not only affects the behavior or physiological and bio- chemical actlvity, but, in some experimental cases, light stimulation can shift the circadian rhyrhm. None of these factors can account completely for biological perlodiclty. The governlng unit must be some form of a biological clock which operates on a biochemical basis regulated by a feedback system. There is some evidence indicating the role of ribonucleic acld in equilibrating the continuous biological time keeping. AEE-80288 CONVERGENCE AND STEREOSCOPIC VISION. 1. C. H. Ishak, M. H. S.

A66- 80302 CHANGES 1N FUNCTION AND RECIPROCAL ACTION OF THE OTOLlTHS AND CUPULA OF THE VkSTlBULAR APPARATUS DURING CHANGES IN 22 refs. In Russian. lnvestlgations with decreasing and increasing gravity loads and weight- lessness were conducted to determine whether weightlessness acts as a unique stimulus of the otolithic mechanism specifically exciting Its neuroreceptor mechanlsms or whether it leads to a functlonal elimlnatlon of the otollths C'physiologlcal delabyrinthization\"~ To elucidate the functlonal condition of the otolithic mechanism, the following indices were studied: (1 )the duration of post- rotational nystagmus, (2 )the duratlon of counter- rotational illusion, (3) the niagnltude of the latent developmental period of rolling or rocldng illusions, and (4)the threshold duratlon of recovery from leaning. Tables with results of these and other studies are given. Analysis of the data indicates that weightlessness does not lead to a functional ellmlnatlon of the otolithic mechanism or to so- called physiological delabyrinthization, but rather, that weightlessness is a negative stlmulus leading to the development of specific vestibular reactions. It should be noted that not only the absolute value of gravttatlonal change, but the process of the change itself and the direction of force on the body dlctate the degree and nature of the nystagmic reaction, e.&, a lessening of load leads to retardation of the nystagmic reaction.

In Russian. Experiments were performed with 38 (21 acclimatized, 17 not acclima- tized) mountain climbers to high altitude (1650 m.)at the beginning of the experiment. To detect differences between the two groups in their abllities to withstand hypoxia and to tolerate fatigue during ascents was attempted. After 2 0 days the non-acclimatized group had achieved a degree of acclima- tization comparable to that which the first group had at the beginnlng of the 2 0-day period. Actual tests for determining resistance to hypoxia were based on duration of respiration in a Krogh apparatus filled with air. The acclimatized group showed a slight, but not statistically significant, rise in tolerance to hypoxia. fie nonacclimatized group showed a statlstlcally significant (21.3%) drop in tolerance to hypoxia. Toward the end of the 20-day period In camp the acclimatized group showed a rlse of 19.9y;, and the nonacclimatized group showed a 20.4yo Increase In tolerance to hypoxia. When tested for tolerance to hypoxia in the Krogh apparatus, both groups showed a rise in pulmonary ventllatlon up to the 7th mlnute. After the 7th minute pulmonary ventilatlon continued to rise In the acclimatized group, but fell off in the non- acclimatized group. fils drop in pulmonary ventilation in the nonacclimatlzed group is apparently due to acute fatigue of respiratory muscles. Blood oxygen saturation and hemoglobin content of both groups were compared before and after ascent to hlgh altitude. Variations between the two groups for these parameters are described.

Experiments were conducted on human subjects to determine the reaction tlme of vlsual perception by presenting briefly charts with outlines of familiar objects. Subsequent series were compllcated by masking the design by a num- ber of randomly dlsulbuted black dots. The results showed that recognition of deslgn was slower when the size of the object was decreased. The masking of the design with 100- 200 dots per cm.2 did not change the reaction rate; greater masklng increased the time. 'I'he decrease of IUumlnation also de- creased the reaction time. In general, the change in stlmulus to noise ratio dld not affect the reaction time to a certain limit, but the results indicated the exlstence of a sharp threshold for each system and individual. axls of the body. The following physiological Indices were Uuslons during rotatlon were characteristic of those experienced when the semi-circular canals were stimulated. The cardiovascular system reacted sharply to short-term rotatlon, reflected in an Increase in pulse rate after the chair had been stopped. In Some cases, after A66- 80307 accelerations the rate was 125 beats/min., qulckly returning to normal and sometimes subnormal levels. Systolic and dlasrolic pressure was Increased. Cardiac actlvlty respiratlon rate increased immediately after exposure, qulckly returning to normal levels. It is observed that the reactlons of the organlsm to short- term rotations were not speciflc and were attributed to neuropsychic responses, i.e., to emotional strains such as those encountered In catapult tests. This was substantiated In a test in whlch a sub- ject was glven a false command that the chair was ready to revolve and did not. The same physlological reactions as those observed during rotatlon occurred, though not to as great a degree.

The carboxyhemoglobin concentration Increases by about 0.8%. The cholinesterase activity was slighrly elevated. The performance capacity showed no arlthmetlcally detectible change, but the number of errors increased. The changes could not be accounted for by hypoxemia alone, because of Its rise.

Under certain conditions, thls nolse factor can be expected to have an unfavorable effect on astronauts. To test thls posslblllty, the auditory sensitivity was studled in 8 subjects kept In a small hermetlc chamber for 27- 60 days. These subjects were exposed to constant noise with a maximum In- tensity of 60- 65 db. (600- 1800 c.p.s.)and minlmum Intensity of 4-5 db. (one octave hlgher). Hearlng tests were conducted Wlth an AU- 5 audiometer and a telephone located in the chamber. Hearing thresholds were determined at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 3000, and 8000 C.P.S. In all, 350 hearing tests were conducted. Hearing thresholds were characterized by the following stages durlng the experiment: During the first stage, there was a maxtmumincrease In hear- ing sensitlvlcy especiallyduring the first day. The second stage was char- acterized by high stabUlcy of hearlng sensltlvltyduring the 23rd and 24th day of 3Oday experlments. The thM stage was characterized by a further decrease in hearing thresholds, whlch reflected an improvement In hearing b Is suggested that the progressive improvement In hearing following pro- longed exposure to nolse reflects an intenstfled excitatory process in the cerebral conex. Restoration of auditory sensitlvity took place 10- 15 min. after the termination of the experiment; full restoration was observed a few months later.

ProblemyKosmicheskoiBiologii,vol.4,1965, p.119-126. 68 refs. In Russian. Space crews are exposed to corpuscular radiation of the radiation belts surrounding the earth, protons of solar flares, and heavy nuclei of primary cosmic radiation. Damage whkh may be caused by these types of ionizing radiations can be prevented either by suitable shielding of the craft or by direct radiation protection drugs. Animal experiments indicate that cystamine, distaphene, and isothiphene give adequate protection against ionizing radiation. As a rule, pharmaceutical protection seems to be sufficient in cases of scattered radiation but has little effect against hard radiation. Aminothiol compounds (cystamine, cysteamine, serotonin, and aminoethylisothiuronium) have protected experimental animals against protons of 120-660 MeV. energy. Very hard radiation, which may be encountered in extraterrestrial space, is difficult to produce in ground laboratories; therefore no complete data are available. In addition, the ionizing effect may be complicated by such factors as acceleration, vibration, weightlessness, noise and ambient conditions of pressure and humidity. Another factor is duration of mission. The problem of chemical protection can not as yet be considered as solved, but this method seems to have great possibilities.

Estimation of the primary cosmic radiation dose which an astronaut ven- turing beyond the earth's magnetic field may receive produced the following results: The intenslcy of the primary cosmic radiation was accepted as 2.24 particles/cm.2/sec. The coefficient of the relative biological effect was cal- culated from the graphs determined by the linear energy expenditure. As- suming constant composition of the primary cosmic radiation, the daily dose in 125-270 mrem This dose exceeds 7-16 times the limit of man's toler- ance. The protection shielding of the spacecraft, with a thickness of 1 - 2 g./cm.l, does not alter this vaiuc. ',?,e ZSG~Z::~~ cf !he !nntTlne effect of the primary radiation was found to be: protons- 5.0 mrem., alpha-particles mrem.,and H- 96.0 mrem. per 24 hrs. Cosmic radiation also contains about 1% electrons, and traces of gamma- rays. Since the earth's magnetic field deflects some of the radiation, it may be rake this value in space. Solar flares create outbursts of ionizing radiation consisting of 9% protons, 10% alpha particles, and traces of heavy nuclei including 2 18. The shielding, there- fore, must be increased to 3 gJcm.2. Even this may not prevent the crew members from receiving a lethal dose, which is about 2 00 rem. Heavier shield- ing, however, presents technicaldtffkultles in construction of a spacecraft.

Optimal and permissible values must be established for the biological, physical, and chemkal indices of the skin under normal conditions and during exposure to various flight suessors. Results of some studies akready made are reponed. Included are the following: (1 )deprivation of customary washing arrangements for two weeks had an adverse effect on general well-being; deprivation for longer periods had sriU more severe effects, including development of skin pathologies; (2) the elasticity of certain portions of the skln was changing by a factor of 2 to 3 during exposures in pressure-, echoless-, and thermochambers under condi- tions of artificial lighting and restricted movement; (3) experimental removal of underwear for 5 days resulted in greatly increased accumulation of sebum (440 to 470 mgpm.2); and (4)confinement was found to reduce the bacter- icidal effectiveness of the skin. It is suggested that possible correlations of indices such as nonspecific sldn reactivity and changes in the chemical com- position of sebum with bactericidal properties of the skin must not be over- looked. h66- 80313 CERTAIN PROBLEMS OF HUMAN ECOLOGY IN CLOSED SYSTEMS OF CHEMICAL CYCLES [ 24 refs. In Russian. ~~~ . The author gives a preliminary survey of some of the problems which may confront man in the closed system of the spacecraft cabin. Weight considera- tions prohibit an excess supply of life-supporting items, making the cycling of oxygen, water and food all important. Oxygen can be regenerated by the use of photosynthetic systems of green plants of different species. However, C02 is not the only product of animal and plant respiration. Traces of other gaseous contaminants may be present, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile oils, methane, acetone, and alcohols. Some bacteria can be employed' in assimilating these products and purify the atmosphere. Some gaseous waste products of plant metabolism may be even beneficial, such as phytoncides, whlchae lethal to some microorganisms. Redistillation of urine and condensed water is feasible; but repeated distillation may lead to the removal of all mineral aaces essential for human metabolism. Changes in the duration of day- night periods during space flights may affect the circadian rhythm of man, lower the metabolic processes, and result in reducing the daily vital require- ments.

Chkk embryos allowed to develop In a helium-oxygen mixture developed normally. However, In order to achieve normal development, the temperature and humldlty of the surroundlng environment had to be somewhat higher than normal. Expert- menu performed with developing frog eggs also Indicated that the only effects of high partial pressures of hellum are due to its physical propertles (speclflc heat and thermal conducthrlry~ In short, It wax shown that substltutlng hellum for nlaogen was not an obstacle to normal embryonic development. Experl- ments performed wlth chickens and mice Indicated that prolonged exposures to a hellum- oxygen environment do not cause any phyilologkal dlsruptlons. However, the reactions and general behavior of the animals lndlcate that physlologlcal processes are much more sensitive to the temperature of the surrounding gas mlxtw than they 'Ihe temperature comfort zone In helium- oxygen atmospheres Is 3-3.5OC. hlgher than In normal atmospheres.

Petechiae due to acceleration were more commonly encountered and more pronounced after 20 days of hypokinesia and perslsted for 2 -3 days after centrlfugatlon. In conjunction wlth these effects, there was a tendency for Small vessels to become more brittle after bedrest (positive endothellal syndromeb In general, It was observed that a ZOday period of hypokinesia lowered human endurance to acceleration, whereas a 3day perlod dld not have this effect. Indlvldual response to the experiment was pronounced. It was concluded that prolonged restriction of motor activity and decreased hydrostatlc pressure of the blood are the maln pathogenic factors determlnlng lowered human tolerance to acceleration. A66-80317 EFFECT OF SLIGM CORIOLIS ACCELERATION ON THE 1965, p. 343-348. 18 refs. In Russian. The chronic effects of small magnitudes @, 5.3, 10.6, and 2 1.Z0/sec.) of Coriolis accelerations on human cardiac activity were analyzed for 4 subjects. The vestibular sensitivity of the subjects varied. The cumulative effects of small Coriolis accelerations did not produce any pathological changes, and any deviations observed were judged to be wlthin physiological norms. Magnitudes of 10.6O/sec. had a sympathetic influence on cardiac activity, while the effects of 2 l.ZO/sec. were mainly parasympathetic, changing to a pronounced sym- pathetic effect during functional tests. This effect was probably due to de- creased cardiac functional ability induced by extracardlal factors. Even when nausea set in, physiological deviations in cardiac actlvity were not great. This reflects a nonspecific stress reaction to rotation In the higher autonomic cen- ters. It is concluded that the human heart muscle shows a high adaptability to vestibular stimuli.

In three series of tests the acceleration force vectors were 6S0, 78O, and 90\u00b0 to the longitudinal axis of the body on a large-radlus centrifuge.

At 6 g's and a 65O angle the tolerance time was 635 sec.; and 8 g's it was 186 sec.; at 10 g's it was 58 sec.; at 12 g's it was 28 sec.; and at 14 and 15 g0 It was an average of 18 and 10 sec. respectively. EEG changes were simllar at 12, 14, and 15 g's. Reaction time increased parallel to an increase in g. Tolerance was Improved at 12 g's at an angle of 78O, probably due to a better blood supply to vita1 organs at that angle. An angle of 900 lowered tolerance wtth dtsplacement of internal organs, dlsruption of breathing, and nausea. A66- 80319 EFFECTS OF THE COMBINED ACTION OF ACCELERATION, VIBRATION, AND RADIATION ON CELL NUCLEI OF THE BONE MARROW IN MICE [ VLIIANIE A. V. Golobkina. Problemy Kosmtcheskoi Biologii, vol. 4, p. 373-390. 15 refs. In Russian. The mttotic acttvity of the bone marrow cells of mlce exposed to the tn- dlvidual and combined effects of acceleration (8- 10 g for 5- 15 min.), vibra- tton (700 c.P.s.), and radiation (100 r. for 1 hr.) was studied. The experimental parameters of the tests and their quantitative results are tabulated. The changes in mitotic activity in bone marrow cell mitosis Observed are assumed to reflect altered oxygen metabolism on the macro or cellular level as well as effects on the sympathetic system and the secretion of adrenalin or noradrenalin. These two hormones tend to protect the organism from radiation but also depress mttotic activity. It is also possible that the physical factors themselves had a dlrect effect on the cellular mechanlsm. In general, however, It was felt that the varlous physiologtcal changes occurrtng as a result of acceleratton tlon lead to disruptlons of mltotic activity whtch may reflect a unique protective effect from radiation.

Studies of yeast cells grown on a nutrient medium disclosed that recon- structions of the mitotic apparatus damaged by gamma radiation proceeded slower than in the water medium. The experiments conducted on the culture medium showed that cell viability does not depend on the hyploid or dlplold states but on the degree of damage to cytoplasm, whtch takes part In recon- struction. Because the whole organism can withstand higher doses than isolated cellular tissues, it may be concluded that the viability of an organism depends not on the numbex of undamaged cells, but, rather, on the recon- struction of the damaged cells.

When normal white laboratory mice were placed In a \"gas-selection 1adder\"experimentai chamber, they selected an atmosphere of 345Y; 02 when the high-oxygen end con- tained 6v0; and an atmosphere of 42.4~~ oxygen when the high end contained 9q0 oxygen. After these norms were established, a special series of experi- ments was conducted in which white mice were kept for a period of 6- 10 days in a chamber containing 60y0 oxygen and 407\" nitrogen. Mice kept in a chamber containing normal air served as controls. After being kept in the high-oxygen atmosphere for various lengths of time, experimental animals as well as control enlme!s aere permitted to make their atmosphere selection in the \"gas- preference ladder.\" The high end of the \"ladder chamber\"contained a 6w0 oxygen atmosphere, Le., the same atmosphere in which the experimental animals had been kept. It was found that mice whtch had spent six or eight days in a 6v0 oxygen atmosphere prefer an oxygen concentration consider- ably higher than that selected by control animals. Three days after the ex- perimental animals had been transferred to a chamber with a normal atmos- pheric composition, a reverse effect was observed.

It was establtshed that, depending on magnitude and duration of rotation, pro- gressively less apomorphine was required to provoke nausea in intact dogs. In the labyrinthectomlzed dogs, resistance varied, but the parodoxical effect of apomorphine was unchanged (reversal of effect as the duration of rotation increased). Exposure to vertical oscillation showed no emetic effects In the labyrinthectomlzed animals when sub-threshold doses of apomorphine were administered; and even 1 OWo doses had a delayed effect (2 0 min.!. In the intact dogs, 50-6v0 of the test dose sufficed to induce nausea. In both types of oscillation, test and control animals showed a significant decrease of 2 min. in the mean values of latent periods of nausea anacks as compared with at- racks during rest. It was observed that increases in pulse rate (to an average of 260 beats/min.)can be used as indices that nausea is occurring. A66- 543-554.

A66- 80329 AN ELECTRIC MtTHOD FOR REGISTERING THE TONGUE MOTION ARTICULATION OF 0 Russian. A method of palatography was investigated whlch (unlike the classical palatograph of phoneticians) would permit continuous recordlng of running speech, and which (unlike Stetson's rubber bulb palatogram) would give a complete picture, not only of the duration, but also the exact location of tongue-palate contacts. A sensor, consisting of prosthetically fitted artificial palate wlth imbedded electrodes, was devised for this purpose. Objective data are obmlned from palatograms for studylng the temporal structure and physical articulation of consonants in various phonetic environments (alone and In combination wlth other e1ements)in initial, medial, and final positlon. The amount and nature of these data requlre data processing. It was found that not only the shape, size, and location of tongue-palate contacts, but also their relatlonship to each other in time during the production of a given consonant, were essential elements of the dlstlnctke and unambiguous palatographic signature of that sound. The signatures of different sounds obtained by this method are often simllar.Dynamlc palatography shows this similarity to be an artifact, since it does not reflect the all-important time relationships of the steps In the complex process of speech sound formation. Dynamic palatog- raphy may also be useful materials for psychophysical study by making it posslble to discover the boundaries of natural aniculatory segments of runnlng speech.

All measurements were taken in chronic experiments on rabbits whith the sensors attached to veins along the anterior longitudinal sinus or the sinus itself. The rabbtts were placed in a head to tail position on the cen- trifuge (1 35 r.p.m.) whereby g forces were distributed as follows: head5 g, thorax47 g, tall-10 g. During the first day rabbits were centrifuged four times, 30 sec. each. On the first day during the initial exposures venous flow in- creased in the thermal cycle. With subsequent exposures venous pressure and temperature decreased, and the initial increase of the venous flow in the first thermal cycle declined. During the 4th exposure to centrifugation, the de- crease in venous flow coincided with the first thermal cycle. One day inter- misston or longer durations of centrtfugation did not influence this decrease. Respiration of 5 to 10% CO:, results in a similar response of cerebral cir- culation.

It consists of a FAK-07 cooling unit. Ethylene glycol is cooled to a temperature of -2SoC., circulated through the thermal sult, and then returned to the cooling tank Within-suit temperature may be decreased to -1OOC. For rewarming the temperature of ethylene glycol is raised to + 45OC. The equlpment can be actuated manually or auto- matically by solenoid valves. Experiments were performed on 46 dogs, of whkh 31 were manually controlled and 15 automatic. Thirteen of the dogs were subjected to repeated hypothermla. Before the experiment, durlng hypo- thermia, and at various stages of rewarmlng clinical observations were made. Physiological indices registered were: body weight, body temperature, hemato- crlt, pulse and respiratory rates, pulmonary ventllation, arterial pressure, electrocardiogram, and rectal temperature. Although there were behavioral and physlologicaldevlatlons from the normal upon rewarming, by the thM day all dogs had returned to normal condition. Continuing observation for a year after hypothermia falled to reveal a? sbnormallty. It is concluded that reduction of body temperature to 2 2 - 23 C. for 3 to 5 hours does not result In any permanent pathological changes in dogs. Any deviations (lethargy, leukocytosis) were temporary, and disappeared 3 to 5 days after the experi- ment.

Creation of a direct man- machlne linkbased on human speech resolution and analysls would eliminate these and other llmltations of present systems. There are at least two ways in whkh the essentlal features of speech signals may be sought: (1)detalled study of the saategy by whkh a human, hearing a sound,dis- covers what articulatory movements he must mak to initiate it; and (2) statistlcal (computerked) analysls to isolate the correspondlng to a glven stance of the articulatory organs and to transitions from one stance to another. The latter line of attack requires synchronous recording of artkulatory parameters and speech slgnals.

Analysts of data showed that the upper and lower sections of the rectus abdominis recorded a dtfferefice in magnltude of potential under the following circumstances: (a) the magnitude of action potential was considerably higher for the lower section of the rectus when the feet were supported; @) the magnitude of action potential was higher for the upper section of the rectus during the performance of sit-ups when the feet were not supported; (c)the lower section of the rectus remalned in partial contraction during the 60- to 90- degree phases in an attempt to maintain trunk position. The upper rectus relaxed during this time permining the pull of gravity to support the upper trunk. Ttunkflexion upward from 45 degrees to the perpendkuk showed a decrease in muscle acttvity. The exer- cises performed with knees flexed and backcurled appeared to elicit the greatest action potential from the abdominals.

The Inner diameters of the tubes used were between 8 and 15 mm.and the wall thicknesses were between 1 and 2 mm The main purpose of the investigatlon was to correlate the pressures in the tubes to the Impact velocity of the falling weight and to the deformation at the point of impact, which was recorded by a mechano- electric motion transducer. It was demonstrated that the impact velocity, when a certain amount of energy was delivered to the system, was of great importance as far as pressure pulses in the tube and deformation at the point of Impact were concerned. An increment of the impact velocity caused higher pressure amplitudes and steeper pulse fronts in the tube and at the same time less deformation at the point of impact. The generation and transmission of the pressure pulses were also studled in a number of modified systems with varied physical constants.

Archivo di Psicologia Neurologla e Psichiatria, vol. 25, Sep.-Oct. 1964, p. 421-443. 14 refs. In Italian. The increase in muscular tension, electromyographically recorded during a mental task (EMG gradient), was studied in 32 sublects executing a series of circles before a mtrror. The importance of gradients calculated by means of an index not directly related to performance time is related to experimentally determine non-precise speed and slowness- prectsion behavior, and to ef- ficiency indexes (time and errors) in both groups of subjects. The results suggest the necessity for new criteria in evaluating gradient importance when the laner is related to speed with whlch a mental task is performed. The results also confirm the opportunity to study better the possible significant differ- ences between the various muscular gradients involved in the mental tnsk studied, and on the whole, conform the validity of the relation between ef- ficiency gradients and gradients and motivational aspects of total behavtor. A66-80342 ON OXYGEN DIFFUSION IN THE BRAIN. I. SPATIAL MODEL AND CAL- CULATION OF THE OXYGEN DIFFUSION I UBER DIE GEHIRN. I. Plan&- dte gesamte Physiologk,rol. 285, Aug. 6,1965, In German. On the basts of anatomic findings and theoretical calculations a new \"cone\"mode1 is developed for the oxygen diffusion in the brain. It is hypothe- sized that the dhce of darion is 8 function of the difference between the oxygen parttal pressure prevaUing at each point within the COplUsl*S and the lowest oxygen partial pressure within the tissue. The beginning of cap8laries near the artery wkh its high 02 porKol pressure selvtces a greater area than the venous end. Boundary of the tissue area serviced by a single capillary is formed by the isobars of the lowest tissue oxygen partial pressure, whkh has a vPrtPble course and is influenced by a number of factors. TheoretlcaUy it is conceivable that oxygen diffuses also from the venous end of capillaries, thus havlng a conW area serviced by a single capulary. Under normal condi- tions, however, intercapillary space is more or less identical with the area of oxygen diffusion at the arterial end of the capillary, while at the venous end oxygen diffusion is negligible. 71 ?

Under normal condittons the brain operates with an excess of oxygen in the amount of 9 mm. Hg. Within these limits a fall in the arterial or venous oxygen partial pressure merely shtfts the Various Isobars tn the ttssue. Slight alterations in oxygen partial pressure of the blood are compensated for by shtfting and regrouping the ttssue areas serviced by each capllary-com- pensation accompltshed solely on the basts of altered oxygen conditions. Oxygen partlal pressure In ttssue is thus preserved at the hlghest level pos- stble; under normal conditions the lowest oxygen pressure may be as htgh as the venous oxygen pressure, which ts the highest level posslble. There Is a basic difference In the action of arterlal and of venous hypoxia on the brain. At the same tissue threshold value the threshold values of the venous oxygen pressure are lower with venous hypoxia than with arterial hypoxia. Changes In the dtffusion conditions by both types of hypoxla are effected in a different manner. A66- 80344 REACTION PATERN OF THE HUMAN MUSCULATURE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THERMOREGULATION I DAS REAKTIONSMUSTER 52 refs. In German. The electrical activity of forearm, shoulder, thigh and calf muscles, the rectal temperature and the metabolic rate were recorded in 10 men during sudden cooling by uncovering at 1OOC. for 1 hour. Responses to cooling were compared to those during a mental arithmetic test. In the initial phase of cooling, the pattern of muscular acthrity may be very simlar to the emotional stress, where the activation was confined mainly to the forearm. Progressively less activity was found in calf, shoulder, thigh, in that sequence. With pro- longed cooling the pattern shifted to a more centralized activity, and the above sequence was often reversed during the late phases, especially when vislble shivering appeared. The localization determines the efficiency of shivering for heating the body core. A decrease of shivering during acclimattzatton can be simulated by shtfts of shivering from peripheral to central muscles. The dlstrlbutlon of muscular activlty during cold exposure allows a differentlation to be made between more emotional components, with predominantly peripheral sites of action, and more thermoregulatory components concerned in heating the body core. The signtflcance of the results is dtscussed in relation to des- criptions of human thermoregulation in terms of technical control systems.

It was found that the ttme course of &-saturation is considerably longer than that of re-saturation. In a theoretical part, a method approximation is de- veloped for calculation of the stationary and non-stationary release of oxygen to the tissue by the capillaries. From the conuadictioli between experimental and theoretical results it is concluded that Krogh's supply model, which provides most unfavorable 02 supply, gives an Inadequate approximation of the average mode of supply of oxygen to the hean muscle.

It was concluded that two opposing influences act simultaneously upon the venuiculsr myocardium during cephalic hypoxia in preparations wlth Cenual nervous system hypoxia enhances myocardial conaactllity; its effect is mediated prlncipally via sympathetic pathways. Hypoxia at the level of the carotid chemoreceptors depresses con- tractility reflexly; the efferent limb of this reflex is medlated chiefly via the vagi.

The delta waves may have orlginiated as a result of excitation of the cortex with a prlmary response accompanied by local discharges of high frequency. The slow components originate only In subcortical zones, and are propagated undez the Inflwnce of the physiological functions and the potentials of the conductors. The subcortical centers of the slow components, which generate asynchronous delta waves, have various degrees of sensitivity toward hypoxia. The slow waves, therefore, can be noted onlyduring certain conditions of clinical death and reanimation. Because slow waves are synchronous in character, the elemoencephalogram mun be taken wlth monopolar leads. A8640353 OXYGEN CONSUMETlON RATE AND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC STAGE SLEEP. D.

When asked to judge whether two stimuli (tones) were the \"samenor \"different,\"subjects took longer to decide that two identical stimuli were the same than to decide that two dissimilar stimuli were different. Thus these judgments are not equivalent obverse aspects of a unitary judgmental process. While decision theory can be extended to deal with the obtained data, a model based on an analogy with a statistical computer is more directly applicable.

Journalof LipidResearch,vol. 6,Oct. 1965, p. 478-480. 19 refs. An attempt has been made to determine the influence of several physical activities upon the serum cholesterol of 133 young adult males, who were randomly selected to participate in 10- week programs of crosssounny run- ning, golf, tennis, tumbling+gmnastics, wrestling, and weight training, and whose cholesterol values were compared with those of a control group. The findings as examined by analysis of variance suggest that different types of physical activity influence cholesterol concentrations In different degrees: subjects who participated in a vigorous and dynamic type of activity showed a significant decrease, whereas subjects who participated in a vigorous but static type of activity experienced no significant reduction dudng the expert- mental period.

The physiologlcal aspects of heat exchange in the aviator by means of convection or radiation are discussed in relation to aircraft speed and altitude. At low-altitude atmosphere, aircraft speed can produce heat which interferes with the environmental cold. At high-altitude atmosphere, radiations assume the same role. Maintaining the aviator In a temperature comfort zone may be achieved either by ventilated clothing or cabin climatization. Consideration ts given to the problems of heat exchange in supersonic and commercial aircraft and In spacecraft, to temperature variations in the troposphere and stratosphere, and to the comparative effects of direct solar energy at ground level and at atmospheric limits.

Following an outline of the methods (convection, radiation, evaporation, conduction) utilized by the body In controlling exposure to high temperatures, a description is presented of protective clothing developed in France against the heat. Included are the ventilated EFA- 25 undergarment, the pressurized- ventilated EFA- 12 helmet, and the ventilated suit. Experimental studies on the effectiveness of these items of clothing at high temperatures indicates that up to 5O-7O0C. good results may be obtained. Also discussed are the physio- logical concepts governing the average body, skln, and central temperatures, along with the methods of measuring these temperatures.

For the period of a month, one group of 65 female Wistar rats received an expertmental diet containing 90% sugar, and another group of 2 5 rats recehred a normal dlet containing 55% sugar. Each rat was subjected to the induced hyperglycemia, insulin, and tolbutamlde tests. During induced hyper- glycemic dlet was characterized by a hyperglycemk peak whose amplitude greatly exceeded that of the control group. A greater sensitivity to tnsulln was observed In rats on the hyperglycemic dlet. Rats sublected to the experimental diet were more sensitive to synthetic hypoglycemia even though the decreased blood sugar was total in control rats tndtcattng a pronounced and prolonged actmty of tolbutamide. The results of the hyperglycemic test suggest a decreased glucose tolerance ln anlmals subjected to a hyperglycemic diet. A questionnaire was dtstrlbuted to 121 student pilots concerning their breakfast diet. It was found that 7 subjects ate Ilttle or nothing at all; 71 ate food contabing a maxtmum of 100 grams of sugar; and 43 subjects ate food contalnlng over 100 grams of sugar.

The results make posdble the establishment of limits of human tolerance required to avotd extended or permanent disturbances 74 ? in the vital processes. The effects of temperature, pressure, and radial ac- celeration on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are vital in the closed system of the spacecraft cabin, and the results of ground studies can be used in provlding a suitable ambient environment for the astronauts. The degree of visual perception is essential in space missions. Therefore, the results of training studies should be applied during actual flight. The value of expertmental or in-flight function studies depends on statistical data obtained by the use of elecuonic computers. A66- 80367 ANALYSIS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA 206-216. 7 refs. In Russian. APFLICATION OF SOME ASPECTS OF INFORMATION THEORY IN THE The equation H(X1 = P,log2P, HIXI ,=l being the entropy and Pi the probability for the values of the random vari- ables was applied to the calculation of entropies for different physiological indices including the entropy for G.

It is concluded, that in pro- cessing of spaceflight data, calculation of entropyaids in the evaluation of physiological function. By using the methods of the information theory, the joint entropy of an entire group of indices characterizing the state of one or several systems of the organism can be calculated. Numerical results obtained show that the values of the joint entropy calculated during the space flight have a tendency to decrease. Thts is interpreted as a sign of adaptation of weightlessness.

During the first hours and days of the Vostok 5 and 6 flights elecuo- encephalograms revealed an increase in the index of high-frequency waves without any increase in the index of low-frequency waves. Also character- istic were a hetghtmed oculomotor activity (EOG) and rapid changes in the galvanic skin response (GSR). These reactions probably reflected the emotional tension in the initial flight stages. Adaptation to flight conditions became apparent in the significant decreases in EOG activity and fluctuations of the galvanic skin response. It is felt that EEG changes and a fall in EOG may be used to assess progressive fatigue. Also, EOG data can be used to judge the effax Of welghtlessness on the vestibular function. It is noted that the objective changes in these indlces dld not COrreSpOnd to subjective feelings of fatigue, vestibular symptoms, or a decrease in the working SbUiV.

Normalization took place 5 -6 hours after the beginning of flight in Bykovskif and 18-20 hrs. in Tereshkova. During reentry, Bykovskii's pulse rate reached 157, Tereshkova's-184. The respirarion rate did not appreciablychange throughout the flight in both astronauts. The electrocardiograms and setsmograms (body vibration) showed z Iecreas. in time intervals before fltght. During flight, the electrocardiograms showed an increase in time intervals. The electroencephalograms of MyltovsKii showed an increase in brain potentials. In Tereshkova's tracings low-ftequency wave8 were noted. In both sexes weightlessness produced no effects on the degree of performance. The flights proved that both men and women can tolerate the conditions of extraterrestrial mtssions.

F. fi1ICOVSKOGOl. V. V. Antipov, N. 4, 1965, p. 248-260. 6 refs. In Russian. Studies of the effects of space flight factors on the reproduction of fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and the genetic apparatus of a plant, Tradescantis paludosa, were carried out during space flights of the Soviet spacecraft -- 3': \"Vostok- 4\" and \"Vostok- 5\". The results show that durlng the first four days of weightlessness no changes in the reproducttve process were noted. The image formation in series, which were studied after reentry, was slightly delayed. The number of females predominated in all series. This finding may indicate the damaging effect to the male spermatozoa which con- tatn the Y- chromozomes. This damage could also account for some mal- formation noted in some individuals, which occurred only on one side of the body. No permanent mutations were observed on close examination. The cytologtcal study of Tradescantia microspores disclosed recombination of chromosomes, disturbance in mtosts, and suppression of growth. These changes could be due to acceleration stress durtng Itft- off and reentry. Exposure to cosmic radiation was small during these missions. It is posstble that the combined effects of accelerarton stress, weightlessness, and ionizing radiation may produce greater changes in the animal and plant reproductive system; but, so far, the dam received are insufficient to allow any definite conclusions.

Experlments studylng the effects of space flight stresses on normal and cancerous human cells and on phage production in cultures of Escherlchia coli- 12 during the Vostok spaceflight series are presented. Hum samples did not differ substantially from control samples on earth. However, some tendency to intensification of phage productton was observed in cul- tures of b. coii f:::o: VOStOk- 3, and 1.96 on Vostok- 4). The following derived values of in. duced phage production were calculated: 3 for Vostoks- 3 and 5 (corresponding to the inducing effect of 3.2 r. of gamma rays), and 1.8 for Vostoks- 4 and 6 &omparable to 0.0 r. of gamma rays). Since the doses quoted are higher than those encountered in spaceflight, the observed genettc effect must be parttally due to other factors (such as wetghtlessness, acceleration, vibration, etc.). To study the operation of one of these factors, E were subjected to vlbra- tions of 18, 35, 75, 100, and 700 C.P.S. for 15 to 30 min and, in another series of experiments, to vibration in connection with Co60 gamma irradiation (dose, 100 r.; dose power, 2 1 rJmin.). The results showed that vibration alone does not induce phage production but does tncrease the senskMcy of lysogenic bacteria to the subsequent influence of gamma irradiation. It is suggested that vibration helps sensitize cells of a lysogenic culture to the influence of cosmic radiation, although it is also possible that the cause of genetic changes is weightlessness in combinacton wlth radlatlon.

A66-60374 SOME FACTORS OF NATURAL IMMUNITY AND THE STATE OF ENDOGENOU MICROORGAMSMS OF ASTRONAUTS DURING TRAINING AND 4, 1985, p. 290- 303. 5 refs. In Russian. Tests used to determtne reactivity of as- tronauts tn spaceflight (Vostok series) are described and results are presented. Three groups of tests were conducted In flight and before and after flight. The methods and materials used are described In detatl. Bactericidal properties of all four astronauts (Gogarin, Titov, Popovtch and Ntkolayev) usually remained wlthtn phystologtcal norms during the entire tnvesttgatton period, and were only occasionally activated. In the case of phagocytosts of coliform bacteria by neutrophtlis, the Intensity of the reaction clearly depended on the time of ob- servation. It was concluded that the immunologtcal shifts noted were mtnor and transtent, since they did not weaken the resistance of astronauts to microbes. The fact that these shifts were less expressed for Nikolayev and Popovtch shows some adaptation in the course of their 3- 4 day flight.

The second series studied diurnal variations in the respiratory rhyrhm, the cardtac activity, and the brain bioeleculc activity in two capuchin and one macaque monkey under restraint. The data tndtcated that respundon, hem rate and brain btoelectrlc actlvlty remain within normal Itmtts for the period of restraint. A comparison with Other data published leads to the conclusion that prolonged restraint has Certain advantages over short- term resuatnt. The relative stabtltty of the physlologtcal tndtces during prolonged restraint allows the use of antmals in limited restraint systems as subjects in spaceflight experiments. The effects of prolonged partial restratnt were explored In two series of 686-80377 EFFECT OF PROLONGED OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION ON THE ORGANISM 10 1965, p. 316- 321. 20 refs. In Russian. A study was made of the optoktneric tmmobtlized wtthtn a rotating drum painted with black stripes. Frequency of the OKN was always less (67 to 11 1 movementspnin.) than sttmulus frequency (1 32 sulpesptn.). Each nystagmic movement seemed to be a reaction to a group of stripes. OKN frequency decreased wit' prolonged stimulation. After 90 mtn. the cyltnder was stopped and a screen placed be- tween the antmal and the snlpes. Deprived of vlsual reference, the rabbits developed a reverse ocular and cephaltc nystagmus and leaned against the direction of rotation. Duration of RPN was 35-45 mtn.; amplttude was less than that of OKN, and frequency equal or greater than OKN frequency. Omission of the screen suppressed the RPN. However, If the screen was set up after a 80 mtn. delay RPN still appeared. The results demonstrate the persistence of maces of optoktnetic stimulus In the central nervous system. Optoktnettc and vestibular nystagmus have common nervous mechanisms, which may be localized in the reticular formation and In the mesencephalic nystagmogentc zone. RPN is evidently related to the prolonged circulatton of stimulus in these structures after stimulus cessation, and delayed RPN to the prolonged retention of stimulus trpces in these structures.

The behavlor of the antmals was monttored by TV, and cardlovascular and respiratory acttvtty were used as criteria for the resistance of antmals to ac- celeratton. Electrocardiograms of anhals exposed to acceleratton revealed sinus tachycardle, shortened T- P intervals, and ventrtcular and atrioventrlcular extrasystole. Cardiac acttvtty In general returned to normal 10-20 min. after centrlfugatton. It was found that endurance of female monkeys to 12 g ranged from 1 to 4.5 min. A htstologtcal analysts of the ovaries of monkeys examlned 10 min., 1 hr. 24 hr., and 72 hr. after termination of acceleratton revealed devlsttons from normal in the proliferation phase, ovulatton, secretory phase, and desquamattve phase. It was apparent that acceleration had Its greatest deletertous effect during ovulation and Its minimum effect during proliferation. The observed devlattons probably reflected neuroendocrtne processes as- soclated with stress reacttons to acceleration. The long- term effects of ac- celeration were not evtdent one month after acce!eratton, demonstrating the abulty of the ovartes to regenerate after vartous injuries.

In the majority of cas of rotatton, pulse rate increased by 10 beats/min. Durtng rotatton at constant rates, this index returned to normal or somettmes decreased below normal. The maximal arterial pressure decreased by 9 mm. Hg, and the mintmum increased by 12 mm. Hg. At angles begtnning wtth 6S0, and especially at 800 and 90\u00b0, subjects experienced Ulustons of tnternal organ displacement and throat con- strictton. After these tests, hyperemia of the eyelid was prevalent and the eyes were bloodshot. At angles of 0-300 (1.5-2.0 revJsec) the head and legs felt heavy and movement of extremtttes was restricted. Repeated rotattons at 20-650 disrupted the ctrculatory system ln the Vicinity of the lungs and heart. These symptoms were reversible and disappeared after 5-7 days.

A 6.5% neutral red solution was injected prtor to vibratton. The In vitro studies involved ttssue staining under the same vlbration condltions. For the In Situ studtes, the following results were obtained: (1) mouse cells exposed to Vertical vtbratton showed a change 76 in ability to absorb tissue stain, and (2) cells of different organs showed varied sensittvlty to vibration. The most noticeable reactions took place in the kidneys and cerebellum, while less noticeable reactlons were exhlbtted by subcorttcal and muscle cell nuclet Tissue cells studied in vttro also showed different senslttvtty to vibration. It Is concluded that, regardless of the presence or ab- sence of a specific receptor, all cells are able to react nonspeciftcally to vlbratton as they are able to respond to any other stimulus of sufftctent intensity.

Male whtte mice weighing 18-21 g. were subjected to C060 gamma- rays (dose power, 26: rjmin.) and l?O-snr! 66O-Mevprorons (dose power, 500-700 I.). The expehents were also designed to test chemlcal agents with a known radioprotective effect against X-rays and gamma- rays during proton inadtatton. The antmals were irradiated in plastic chambers in groups of 10-5 controls and 5 protected mtce. The LD50/30 for Co60 gamma-rays was calculated to be 600 I., and for 660- Mev protons, 900 r. Thus, the relatlve btologtcal effectiveness (RBE) of 660-Mev protons, according to the LDlOO index, is 0.73. given in tabular form. Expertmental results showed that the RBE of both 660- and 120-MeV protons for mke, as compared with elec- tromagnettc radiatton, does not exceed 1. Furthermore, the known radio- protective substances retain their effectlveness during inadlation with high- energy protons.

S.L?rova, and P. P. Saksonov. ProblemyKosmlcheskoiBtologti,vol. 4, 1965, p. 411-429. 21 refs. In Russian. Three series of experlments were conducted to determine the effect of screening during trradtatlon of animals wtth gamma- rays and 12 0- Mev protons. Whtte rats of both sexes were used. In the first group of experiments, Proton Irradiation was conducted through lead- shielded polyethylene blocks to lower the dose (dose power 600+ 10 rjmln.). During gamma irrpdiatlon. parts of the body were screened wtth steel plates (15 cm. thtck) of different widths. The biological effect of radlatlon under these conditions was determined by the survival rate of the anlmals during a 30- day pertod after hadtatton. Localtzed shtelding during gamma inadlation of rats in a dose of 930 r. pro- duced a defintte increase in survival rate, whtch was most effecthre during screening of the abdomen (80% survival rate as compared wlth 6% In the control). In the second series of experlments, the abdomen of rats was shielded with gamma- rays. It was found that screening the abdomen with a block 6 cm. wide during proton Irradiation with 800-1050 I. increased the sunrival rate to 86.4% (as compared with 19.4xin the control). A high survlval rate (96.7- 100% wan also obsuved when the abdomen was screened with blocks of various wtdths durtng gamma frradiatton (930 I.). Preliminary expettments were also conducted to show the effect of screentnng under the influence of protons and acceleration or vibration. Results showed that neither 30 mln. of acceleratton (10 g) nor 1 hr. of vibration (700 c.P.s., amplitude 0.005 min.) altered the effectiveness of screening during proton Irradiation (doses 750- 1100 r. THE HEMATOPOIETIC ORGANS OF MICE WRING EXPOSURE TO HIGH- ENERGY PROTON Petrukhin, V. S. Shashkov, V. mice were studled after proton and irmdlatton. Some animals Were subjected once to proton irradlatlon (dose, 830 rad; dose power, 400- 600 rad/mln.), and others were irradiated from a Cos0 source (dose, 650 r.; dose power, 273 rJmin.). The mke were kllled with ether 3, 7,15, 30, and 60 days after irradiation, and cells of the spleen, thymus gland, and bone marrow of the femur were examtned microscopically. In animals that died from radi- ation sickness (9-1 2 days after irradiation), hemorrhages in the lungs and intestine were frequently observed. Comparison of the weight coefficients of the spleen and thymus (both showing a two- phase increase) did not reveal any statisttcally reliable differences In the effects of the two dtfferent types of Irradiatton on these organs. Observation of animals and comparative study of hemnrn?oiPric orsans show that changes due to irradiation wtth protons and gamma- rays are similar. In the first few days after inadtatton, the volume of follicles in the spleen decreased, and areas of myelopoiesis disappeared from the pulp. In the thymus gland, depletion of the COrttCal substance of lympho- cytes were observed, and in the bone marrow destruction of the reticular stroma occurred. It must be noted that changes were less severe durtng irradiation with protons than with gamma- rays. However, complete recovery of the spleen did not occur In either case until the 60th day after irradtatton. In general, it was concluded that restoratlve processes in all three structures studied proceeded more slowly In the gamma- lrradtated anlmals.

Male white rats weighing 200-250 g. were subjected to a dose of X- rays (750 r.) sufftctent to cause mass death 80 hours after Irradtatton. Immediately afterirradlatton, and then at intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, 28, 72, and 96 hours, groups of experimental and control rats were placed in an altitude chamber and subjected to a rarefied atmosphere (1 40 mm. Hg). The resistance of Irradiated rats to hypoxta, evident 6 hours after Irradiation, was most pro- nounced after 72 hours. In order to determine whether a decrease in the In- tenstty of metabolic processes is the chtef cause of resistance to hypoxia, the rectal temperature and oxygen consumptton of Irradiated rats were measured in the designated ttme intervals. The absence of essential changes in these indtces showed that the decrease in the intenstty of metaboltc processes in irradiated rats ts not the sole cause of Increased reststance to hypoxta. Another series of experiments tested oxygen consumption of animals directly under hypoxlc condtttons. Gas- exchange studies under normal atmospherlc and hypoxtc condttlons were compared, and tt was concluded that the me- chanism of increased resistance to hypoxia is dtfferent at dtfferent stages of radiation stckness.

Two series of experiments were performed on white laboratory mice aged two to three months. In the first series of experiments the effect of a 60% oxygen atmosphere for 36 hours, of a 90% oxygen atmosphere also for 36 hours, and 100% oxygen at a pressure of 2.5 atm. for 1 112 hours was tested. In the second series of experiments, the effects of relatively prolonged (up to 10 days) exposure of animals to a gas mixture composed of 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen were tested. The results of the two series on red blood corpuscles and on whtte blood corpuscles are presented in tabular form. These results make it possible to regard the morphological composition of the blood as a sensittve tndex which can be used for evaluation of the physiological effect of increased partial pressure of oxygen on the organism.

Experiments on cats and rats showed that in hypoxia the velocity of changes tn the exhaled air determtned the degree of physiological effect. The gradual development of hypoxla leads to better tolerance of rnlnimal oxygen content of the tnhaled air, because It allows sufficient time for development of adap- tlve mechanisms and for lowerlng the oxygen demand by the tissues. Gradual onset of hypoxia does not affect the body temperature, whlle sudden onset results tn hypothermia. Durlng space flights, individuals adapted to gradual hypoxia would requlre less oxygen than Individuals without this experience. A66-80386 VARIOUS FORMS OF HYPOXIA AND ADAPTATION TO THEM. REPORT 2.

Organic matter, mostly humus (as Is characteristic of aeroblc process1ng)can easily be pre- cipitated by the addltlon of Fe and AI catlons. Further physical and chemical purlflcatlon Is simple, without significant loss of water from the system.

Bipolar leads Grontal and occipita1)were used. Frequency analysis of EEG's showed delta and theta waves present in the waldng state-a fact not uncovered by visual analyses because of the masking by alpha and beta rhyrhms. The observation of delta and theta waves ln pathological condi- tions is due to increased amplitude of the slower rhythms and reduced alpha and beta activity. The general EEG picture over a 24- hr. period is thus not determined by the alternation of rhythms. The alpha rhyrhm is most nearly characteristic of the overall circadian EEG picture. No clearcut dependence could be established between the number of delta and theta waves and the time of the day. Lowest EMFs (total bioelectric intensity) were noted In the morning and the highest EMFs appeared at night during sleep. , A88- 80394 MODES OF FORMING CONSECUTIVE refs. In ?..lrs*2l?.

Three types of nutrlent solutions were used: a normal one without additional salts, the same with NaCl added (0.2- 2.0% CI ions), and those composed of mineralized products of human metabo- lism to which corrective amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and calcium were added. The pH of the solution was maintained at 5.8.

The Chlorella densities varied as follows: O.5-0.6x1O9, 3-4x109, and 8- 10xIO-per cc. The results in all three tests were quite similar. Photosynthesis intensity increased sharply as the amount of C02 was increased to 1.5- l.8q: Further increases did not augment photosynthesis intensity until 4.5- 5.5% was reached, at which point another sharp increase of intensity was observed. Another plateau extended to the point when CO:, concentration reached 5.0-7.5yw when another sharp increase in photosynthesis occurred. A third plateau was reached only at a concentration of 8- 10x109 cells per cc. Lower concentration of Chlorella providd only two srep increases. The step- like nature of photosynthesis in- tensity is apparently explained by factors which delay the arrival of C02 to the point where it can be utilized by the cell. This explains the presence of the third plateau in high- density cultures. The exchange rate of air and liquid phases, the area of contact, the ability of C02 to dissolve, the C02 capacity of the medium, the rate of diffusion of molecules in the nutrient medium, and the motility of the medium itself- all these are factors to be considered in designing photosyn- thesis reactors. Concennation of CO2 dissolved in the zone of cells in the medium rather than concentration of C02 in the air determines the rate at which C02 passes into the cells.

No tests Involvlng the followlng are Included: (1 )negative air Ions were applled for 8 hr. out of each 24 hr., and (2) negathre Ions were applied 24 hr. out of 14, except for about 40 mln. each morning durlng the cleanlng operatlon. Each test had Its controls. Data from these two tests do not lndlcate any advantage In providlng negative air Ions In the environment of weanllng, healthy plgs. Nodifferences were found durlng the tests nor were any noted In the welght galns or feed efflclency of the plgs 4 week after the test.
