What is Holistic Medicine? Holistic medicine is a system of healthcare that emphasizes the need to look at the whole person, including analysis of physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional, social, spiritual, and lifestyle values. It requires a cooperative relationship among all involved, leading towards optimal attainment of the physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of health. Holistic medicine focuses on education and responsibility for personal efforts to achieve balance and well-being. Physical Aspect of Healing: ~ Support the entire body with nutritionally dense food, in its most natural state, and free of chemicals, hormones, additives, or synthetic nutrients. ~ Hydrate with water free of chemicals (fluoride/chloride) and additives. ~ Use whole food supplements at therapeutic levels, for a season, to reverse damage at organ and gland level and to nourish and rebuild. Avoid the use of synthetic nutrients. ~ Clear any remaining tissue damage from old physical traumas or scars (Cation Mudpack Therapy is very helpful) Emotional / Mental Aspect of Healing: ~ Heal emotional issues. Unresolved emotional issues often manifest as physical disease. Let go of negative or destructive thoughts and relationships. EVOX Therapy and Emotional Repolarization Technique are very helpful tools for healing emotional trauma. Love yourself!! Real healing happens from the inside out...not the outside in! ~ Create a healthy environment in which to live and work. Maintain good boundaries for yourself to honor yourself and others in this journey that is 'Life'. Be open to learning and growing from experiences. Live more from 'spirit' instead of 'ego' Fact: The body, mind and spirit can heal themselves. The right environment must be provided for that to happen. It is a matter of choice.....a true gift to cherish.
