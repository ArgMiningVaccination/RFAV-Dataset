Our friendly group meets once a month to share experiences, coping strategies and information, and to offer support and encouragement to each other. We never put pressure on anyone to share how they're doing. We just offer the space for people to do so freely and without judgement, so our members feel less isolated and more supported. We have strong links with OCD Action, which helps us keep up-to-date with additional help and support that's available to our members, including events focusing on OCD. New members are always welcome.
