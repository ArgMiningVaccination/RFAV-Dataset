UI officials are working with the greek com - munity to draft a strategic plan that will guide fraternities and sororities in fostering a \"more healthy and safe\" environment, according to a message sent to greek leaders Tuesday. Efforts started around fall 2018 to create the Fraternity/Sorority Life strategic plan before the UI announced it had suspended nine In - terfraternity Council fraterni- ties last October. Following those suspen - sions, the UI announced in December 2018 it revoked the registered student-organiza - tion status of four chapters and placed six on probation for university alcohol- and hazing-policy violations. Feedback sessions to discuss the draft plan took place in the IMU over the summer with council and chapter presidents, alum volun - teers, house directors, and national and in - ternational headquarter representatives, IMU Executive Director Bill Nelson said. Nelson said the draft plan focuses on creat - ing a healthy and safe, supportive, and inclu - sive Fraternity/Sorority Life community. \"Fraternity/Sorority Life is a shared enter - prise,\" he said. \"All of those partners have a stake within the community, and they all have a role in the process of looking at where we are moving forward.\" While touching on the community's prog - ress, the message sent Tuesday \u2014 signed by BY NAOMI HOFFERBER naomi-hofferber@uiowa.edu FilmScene, Iowa City's downtown theater, has an- nounced an opening date of Sept. 20, as well as new pro-gramming and plans for the future of the art house. The theater will celebrate its opening in the newly con- structed Chauncey tower by screening three cinema clas-sics: Field of Dreams, Cinema Paradiso, and creature- feature The Blob. In addition to the classics, FilmScene will also screen the new Downton Abbey film, encouraging filmgoers to dress up for it accordingly. Bijou Film Board, the University of Iowa student organi- zation and partner to FilmScene, will also celebrate moving its programing to the new location with a special welcome event during the afternoon of Sept. 21, followed by a screen-ing that night of the Taiwanese adult film Wayward Cloud. Emma Gray, the marketing director for Bijou, said that the selection of this movie followed the success of its show-ing of the film Bat Pussy on Valentine's Day. \"We want to do more XXX films and more sex-education stuff with those films, because that's important to us,\" Gray said. \"Bijou as a group has tried to show a lot of those films, and I know there's been a lot of backlash on campus histor-BY ELISABETH OSTER elisabeth-oster@uiowa.edu As Lincoln and Mann Elementary students entered their first day of school with excite-ment and full backpacks, they were greet-ed by completely renovated buildings. This summer, both Lincoln and Mann facilities underwent extensive construction. The 102-year-old Mann Elementary and the 93-year-old Lincoln Elementary saw the addition of new libraries, music rooms, art rooms, and gyms, said Julie Robinson, the principal of both schools. \"For the longest time, we had only been building new schools where the population was growing instead of renovating our old schools,\" said Iowa City school board vice president Paul Roesler. \"We wanted all the schools to have similar facilities, so no one would be choosing a newer school over an old school just because the facilities were better.\" The elementary schools were two of 12 buildings that received renovations and ad-BY CHLOE O'CONNOR chloe-oconnor@uiowa.edu Some University of Iowa students report that they don't know the potential dangers of vaping as researchers seek to understand its effects on health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, the first vaping-related death has been confirmed as a result of severe injuries to the lung on Aug. 23. Public-health officials are currently investi-gating the issue. This summer, more than 190 potential cases of vaping-relat-ed illnesses in teenagers and young adults were reported across the country. The Iowa Department of Public Health also reported three of the four Iowans who had a vaping-relat-ed illness said they used THC in their vaping product.A recent National College Health Assessment survey showed 26.8 percent of Univer-sity of Iowa undergraduate stu-dents used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days. The number of high-school seniors who reported vaping in the last year rose 9.5 percent between 2017 and 2018, accord-ing to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \"It's just a little buzz that you get. And more than half of my friends have Juuls, so it's always just 'in,' \" said UI senior Mat-thew Cannida, who uses vape products two to three times a week. \"I think people start vap-ing because all their friends are doing it, or they have a need to fit in or do what everyone else is doing.\" Cannida said he did not know what chemical compounds are in e-cigarette liquid, if the chemicals in e-cigarette liquid are regulated, who regulated the manufacturing of these chemicals, or any other specific health aspects of vaping. \"I know that it's not good for your lungs,\" Cannida said. \"I know that it's not good for your skin.\" Of the six UI students who spoke with The Daily Iowan about vaping, Cannida includ-ed, few knew the details on how vape products are manu-factured and any health conse-quences. The Surgeon General's Advi- sory on E-cigarette Use Among Youth states that e-liquids may contain \"heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultraf-ine particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs\" and can be harmful to one's lungs and Along with a new location opening Sept. 20, FilmScene and Bijou have set a plethora of programming for the fall. Buzz for bullet journaling It's a schedule, it's a sketchbook -- it can be absolutely anything. Bullet journaling is a unique, systematic form of journaling that allows the user to customize their journal to their needs.

Gliding the tip of her Tombow brush pen along the 1-millimeter paper to create detailed calligraphy lettering over a carefully drawn portrait of her week-ly schedule, Norton is not simply creating artwork or preparing for the coming week when she journals \u2014 she is resting the qualms of her racing mind. Like many organizational fanatics longing for a way to take their standard planners and notebooks to the next level, Norton has utilized the productive yet stress-reliev-ing hobby of bullet journaling: a personalized, methodical system of journaling that digi-tal designer and author Ryder Caroll created in 2013. According to Caroll's bullet journal website, \"It's best de-scribed as a mindfulness prac-tice disguised as a productivi-ty system. It's designed to help you organize your 'what' while you remain aware of your 'why'. The goal of the Bullet Journal is to help [bullet jour-nalists] live intentional lives, ones that are productive and meaningful.\" In the years since its cre- ation, images of the intricately designed dotted, or \"bulleted\" pages have crowded Pinterest, Instagram, and the blogs of organizational lifestyle influ-encers everywhere. Prices fluc-tuate from $7 for a best-selling dotted notebook on Amazon, to a nearly $30 hard-cover gridded journal on the shelves at Barnes & Noble. The price one is willing to pay is entire-ly up to the buyer, but supplies manager Kaylee Harney at Io-wa Book believes any dotted notebook will do the trick. \"They are very popular now, a lot of people like them. Peo-ple could use any kind of jour-nal but a lot of people like [bul-let journals] because it gives them some sort of direction,\" she said. Harney said she sees most buyers fill the journals with colorful designs and sched-ules. However, the details of exactly how to mimic the style of the traditional bullet jour-nal \u2014 nicknamed the \"BuJo\" by its followers, are difficult to define. For a handful of UI student bullet journalists, this is because the limits of a \"standard\" bullet journal do not exist, and each journal is catered to the personal needs of its user. Journals can be filled with everything from habit trackers to grocery lists, bucket lists, vacation spots to visit, and bachelorette party-planning ideas.

These projects were the re- sult of a 10-year facility plan, which is currently three years ahead of schedule. The main priority of the renovations was school security, as nei-ther school had a secure entry previously. \"That's on everyone's mind right now, so we made that a focus,\" Van Hemert said. Robinson said another im- portant factor was the instal-lation of air conditioning in both facilities. \"Climate control will make a huge difference for kids,\" Robinson said. \"We won't have to let out early because of heat ever again.\" She added that the reno- vations will greatly impact the overall daily structure for students. Previously, gym class was held in the lunch-room and would have to be organized around lunchtime, she said. \"The new gym will also allow us to have all-school assemblies,\" Robinson said. \"The renovation allows the school to be a very inviting space, and the fact that we can all be together during the year is part of that.\" Van Hemert said making both buildings handicap ac-cessible was also key during construction. This included adding elevators and inclu-sive playground equipment. \"Lincoln also used to have around 50 steps that would have to be climbed from the parking lot to get to the build-ing,\" Robinson said. \"Now, you can enter the building from ground level which is a huge change.\" Robinson said the fact that the new facilities at Mann tie into the history of the build-ing was important to the de-sign. \"At Lincoln, people are ex- cited that the new addition looks over a wooded ravine,\" Robinson said. \"When you're in the library or the lunch-room and you're looking out, it feels like a treehouse.\" Aside from the renovation, both Lincoln and Mann have experienced changes to their student population. New ele-mentary attendance bound-aries were enacted for the 2019-20 school year, Roesler said. \"Our main goal was to get better equity by balancing students with low socioeco-nomic status, English-lan-guage learners, and spe-cial-education students throughout the district,\" Roesler said. For Lincoln and Mann con- struction, students finished out their 2018-19 school year in the new Hoover Elemen-tary School. Although they operated as separate schools, students shared the gym and lunchroom, said Van Hem-ert. Roesler emphasized that the building shift experience last year prepared students for the upcoming year's boundary changes. \"I think sometimes change is hard to accept,\" Roesler said. \"But students tend to do very well with it, and parents will slowly come around to it, as well.\"ically with those, so we're trying to honor that and keep that tra-dition going.\" Gray said, this year, Bijou will focus on shying away from mainstream films and go back to what they have screened in the past in their free film offer-ings for students. For FilmScene co-founder Andrew Sherburne the opening of the Chauncey building is a culmination of hard work from the organization. \"It's been a long run. To see it so close to reality is really exciting,\" he said. \"It truly is like a dream.\" Opening the theater in the Chauncy was the initial plan for FilmScene, but the process of getting approval, as well as the construction, took time. In the meantime, FilmScene found its first home in the Ped Mall, ret-rofitting a building that used to be a bar into a one-screen, then two-screen, theater. Leading up to the opening of the new theater, FilmScene has partnered with the Englert The-ater in a fundraising campaign, \"Strengthen, Grow, Evolve,\" that has raised $4 million of its $6.5 million goal. Now that the new location is nearly ready, Sherburne and Fons said there are lots of new programming and opportunities for screening ready to launch, including an event honoring an unnamed filmmaker in early No-vember, a silent film event with live music, and marathon mov-ies, including one 14-hour movie to be screened in November. With such excitement around the new location, Sher-burne and Fons emphasized that the original Ped Mall loca-tion will be just as active in the new events. \"The less screens you have, the more limitations you have in programing. And with more screens, we're really going to be getting our sea legs to figure out what that will look like,\" Fons said. Tristen Ives, the current Ped Mall location manager, said that while the Chauncey build-ing is a new, vibrant building, the Ped Mall location will pro-vide the perfect complement. \"I think this place is going to turn into this boutique, special event place. It's the hideaway of the Ped Mall,\" Ives said. \"You can get away from the parties at 11, or you can come in and study, or go up on the rooftop.\" The Daily Iowan BREAKING Iowan strives for accuracy and fairness in the reporting of news.

A BIG APPETITE FILMSCENE CONTINUED FROM FRONT Nelson, Student Accountabili - ty Office Director Angela Ibra- him-Olin, and interim Dean of Students Angie Reams \u2014 ac - knowledged the challenges the community faced in its recent history. \"Last year was difficult for many reasons, but primarily because some chapters disre - garded the health and safety of others and engaged in danger - ous behaviors, including the harmful consumption of alco - hol and hazing,\" the message reads. The note came with a warn - ing that the UI \"will continue to hold [chapters] accountable for violations of university policy\" if any greek chapter or student organization engages in misconduct in accordance with the Code of Student Life. \"It has already come to our attention that there has been outreach to properties near Melrose Court to potentially hold large open events with al - cohol, similar to the ones that led to university policy viola - tions last fall,\" according to the message. UI media-relations manager Hayley Bruce said in an email that no disciplinary actions have been taken in response to those outreach efforts. Nelson said policies the UI previously piloted with the community, such as the mora -torium on events with alcohol and the ban on out-of-town formals, are now the official policies. Those policies were implemented after the death in 2017 of UI student Kamil Jackowski at an out-of-town formal. \"A chapter's disciplinary status, whether sanctioned from the university or from its respective governing council, will determine eligibility to hold social events with alco - hol,\" according to the message. In December 2018 before the UI took disciplinary actions against several chapters, UI President Bruce Harreld told The Daily Iowan the behavior in the community was unaccept - able, but said Fraternity/Soror - ity systems across the country faced similar issues. \"I continue to remind my - self as a parent and grandpar - ent that people, that parents don't send their daughters and sons to institutions like ours and have them go through those types of experiences,\" he said. \"We've had a couple cases in which students have died, they've been hazed, we're not going to tolerate that anymore. And if that's not acceptable, then we'll have to find some other social system and rein - vent something.\" There is no timeline for the final plan's release as the UI continues to receive feedback from greek-community stake - holders. Nelson said more feedback sessions will take place this semester.GREEK CONTINUED FROM FRONT overall health. \"Popcorn lung\" that has been diagnosed in people who vape was also men-tioned in the report, and it causes scarring of the air sacs in the lungs and results in thickening and narrowing of the airways. \"As far as we're aware, the FDA does not regulate e-cig-arettes and e-liquids,\" said Vickie Meine, Interim Direc-tor of the Iowa Institute of Public Health Research and Policy. \"E-cigarettes don't fall into the same category as tobacco, because it's not a combustible tobacco prod-uct.\" Meine added that people who vape do not really know what chemicals they are breathing in, because e-ciga-rettes are unregulated. \"E-cigarette production is also not regulated by the state of Iowa and also does not fall under the broad um-brella of 'tobacco products,' \" said Kim Merchant, a UI Department of Health Man-agement and Policy research associate in the College of Public Health. Because of the lack of reg- ulation and lack of definitive medical knowledge of vap-ing, Meine said it is impossi-ble to conclude that vaping is in fact safer than cigarettes or safe at all. \"If you wouldn't drink a bottle of antifreeze, if you wouldn't be a test subject for an experimental drug, why would you vape?\" Meine said.'We've had a couple cases in which students have died, they've been hazed, we're not going to tolerate that anymore.

Breakfast Daily, Lunch, Dinner, Full Bar and Wine WELCOME BACK STUDENTS! GO HAWKS!Downtown shops offer new caffeination destinations Dash Coffee Roasters and Dunkin' have opened locations near the University of Iowa campus, broadening students' caffeine options. BY RACHEL STEIL rachel-steil@uiowa.edu Over the summer, two new coffee joints have opened near campus at the University of Iowa: branch-es of Dash Coffee Roasters and Dunkin'. Since then, doughnuts have been fried, cold brews have been proud-ly crafted, and business has been booming. Dash Coffee Roasters opened shop at 287 N. Linn St. in late May. The new Dunkin', located in Iowa Book, opened its doors to the Iowa City community on Aug. 8. The new Dash Coffee Roasters location has been serving mostly Northside families and residents, said Michael Beyne, General Man-ager at Dash Coffee Roasters. However, as the semester kicks in, the shop may see more student clientele. \"We are doing our thing,\" Beyne said. \"People will come.\" Beyne is not afraid of any competition from other coffee joints downtown old or new. Good is not good enough, he explained. Beyne wants Dash Coffee Roasters to be held to a higher standard than its peers. \"Our coffee will definitely stand out,\" Beyne said. \"We are a bit different.\" Over at Dunkin', conve- nience is key. According to Chris Benge, Director of Store Operations at Eastern Iowa Food Service, Dunkin' has wanted to open a location downtown near campus for quite some time. \"It was just a matter of finding the right location,\" Benge said. Working with Iowa Book has been a positive opportuni-ty and experience, Benge said, and the location is perfect for serving the campus and downtown community. Though the new Dunkin' location does not offer a full food menu, there is a full drink menu. And, of course, the location offers the famous fried Dunkin' doughnuts. The UI may see more of Dunkin' in the future, accord-ing to Chris Burr, director of non-traditional development at Dunkin' Brands, in an email to The Daily Iowan. \"In addition to the new restaurant located in the Iowa Book store, we hope to bring our signature cof-fees and baked goods to the main University of Iowa's campus in the future,\" Burr said. Like Beyne at Dash Coffee Roasters, Benge is not afraid of Dunkin' facing any compe-tition. donuts \"It's our thing.\" UI sophomore Ileana Minor said that she would be heading to Dunkin' before class almost every day. \"I'm super excited,\" Minor said. \"It's cheap and conve-nient.\" UI sophomore and Iowa City native Elizabeth Tornblom agreed, but said that its cheap convenience often led to less quality coffee at Dunkin'.\"Java House is way better,\" Tornblom said of Iowa City's prominent coffee joint. Whether students want es- tablished coffee joints or con-venient coffee, Burr said it's delighted and ready to serve the campus community. \"We're proud to keep Amer- ica's colleges and universities running on Dunkin' with about 100 campus locations nationwide,\" Burr wrote. \"Providing students with early morning espressos, afternoon and ev-erything in between.\"BY MADDIE MCCARRON madeline-mccarron@uiowa.edu As stories of shootings across the country continue to dominate national conversa-tions, researchers at the Uni-versity of Iowa are investigat-ing the effects of gun violence and reviewing its long-term consequences. University of Iowa Associ- ate Professor in criminology and social psychology Mark Berg said many tend to asso-ciate the words \"gun violence\" with mass shootings and of-ten forget the homicides, sui-cides, and accidental shoot-ings that occur day to day. \"There is an astoundingly small number of people who study gun violence who will provide public expression,\" Berg said. \"There needs to be a dedicated effort on this cam-pus to encourage and support more vibrant research on the challenge of gun violence.\" Almost 40,000 people died from firearms in 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.At the end of the year, Berg said, school shootings will likely represent only 1 to 2 per-cent of firearm shootings. \"We will lose far more peo- ple than just the massacres we see on TV,\" he said. Berg added that mental health in regards to gun violence is another popular misconcep-tion. There is not a strong link to connect mental-health issues to gun violence, he said. \"Anger, really strong feel-ings of anger, are usually the reason for gun shootings,\" Berg said. \"But that is just one part of gun violence. There are cases of it daily, and that shouldn't be the case.\" Berg emphasized that he believes the most heart-breaking part about any case of gun violence is when it is preventable. \"It is a major public health burden,\" Berg said, compar-ing the problem of gun vio-lence to the opioid crisis. \"I think it is that much of a prob-lem, not in numbers but with the impact it has on society.\" One obstacle that stands in the way of preventing gun violence is not just the lack of knowledge and research on the subject, but also the lack of investment, said Corinne Peek-Asa, the associate dean for research at the UI College of Public Health. \"If you compare the burden of gun violence to the amount of research on gun violence, the latter is miniscule,\" she said. \"The underinvestment has made it hard to find pub-lic approved and moderate approaches to reduce gun violence, which is something that can be done.\" Peek-Asa added that gun violence is at an unacceptable level, and there needs to be a multi-pronged approach on all violence prevention. \"We still need a lot of re- search to truly understand the balance of what are the right environmental approaches. That is critical for preventing gun violence,\" she said. Preventing gun violence will take multiple steps, said James Wo, an assistant pro-fessor in the Department of Sociology and Criminology. \"It really depends on the context of each situation,\" Wo added. \"While it is certainly possible to reduce the overall rate of gun violence, I don't think there is just one strate-gy that is going to work in all places and all times.\" Wo also said he thinks there are some promising in-terventions that could help re-duce gun violence, The Boston Gun Project and Project Safe Neighbourhoods. Along with more research, Peek-Asa said, there needs to be people listening and understanding. \"We need to invest in the research and policies to solve these issues, and we need peo-ple to care, to speak out, and participate,\" she said. Researchers seek to understand realities of gun violence UI researchers discuss the issues surrounding gun violence following mass shootings and hope to see change in the coming years.

Megan Conroy/The Daily Iowan The new Dunkin' sign is seen on Clinton Street on Sunday.There are stories shared in lecture halls and coffee shops, in apartment living rooms and at Hubbard Park, where University of Iowa students gather together and reflect on recent summer months that flew by all too quickly. There are tales of all sorts of summer classes, internships around the country, or clocking in and out of nine-to-five jobs. As for me, I spent my summer studying abroad in Dublin, Ireland with a writ-ing program. The lessons I learned abroad ended up having less to do with course-loads and class schedules, and more to do with myself, my community, and what home means to me. Of course, I'm not the on- ly one who spent the warm-er months in another coun-try. For UI students, there are a number of experiences encountered \u2014 both over-seas and within the safety of Iowa. I conducted an unscientific poll of 100 fellow students. 76 percent of respondents said they spent their summer work-ing, and 24 percent said they spent their summer traveling. For those who traveled, their endeavors involved temporary apartments, crowded hostels, classes in European cities, or leisure trips with friends and fam-ily. For those who worked, there were internships with finance companies in Min-neapolis, magazine publica-tions in Ireland, and labs in the Iowa City area. Some students forfeit- ed the Midwest for Hawaii, working as waitresses and discovering that the size of the world is bigger than classrooms and church pews, and that no matter where you are, there's an opportu-nity to be sharpened in faith, friendship, and daydreams. Other students took their studies to Europe like I did. Together, we've discovered that leaving our homebase is uncomfortable and hard. The whole ordeal of interna-tional travel is intimidating, no matter which country we explore. Still, it's here in the heart of discomfort and un-familiarity that we see the most remarkable and un-paralleled growth. It's here in the difficult and unusual that we figure out how to be brave, kind, empathetic, and curious. As for me, I discov-ered in my time abroad that I can thrive no matter where my feet are planted. And as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I'm learn-ing more about how to love bigger, ask better questions, and empathize with others. As we move into this fall semester, it'll be easier for us to become distracted with the many directions we're being pulled. There are clubs, organizations, min-istries, meetings, football games, work schedules, and other activities to consume our time. There are out-of-class components that make courses feel three times as hard, and there are already essays due in the first two weeks of classes. But it's imperative that we use this past summer as a launching pad into the school year. It's important that we consider the lessons we've learned \u2014 no matter how clich\u00e9 \u2014 and hold fast to the countless bouts of growth we experienced \u2014 whether that be halfway across the globe or right here in Iowa City.THE DAILY IOWAN | DAILYIOWAN.COM | THURSDAY , AUGUST 29, 2019 4A Opinions EDITORIAL POLICY STAFFCOLUMN What I learned during my summer abroad in Ireland Studying abroad halfway across the world taught me lessons in empathy that I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

As a vegan college student, I'm well acquainted with the challenges that come with my dietary choices. Once a Buffa-lo Wild Wings enthusiast, my peers and family members constantly questioned my reasoning behind becoming a dairy-free macaroni and cheese advocate. For the last two years as a vegetarian, and in the last year as a vegan, I've dealt with dis-cussions regarding whether I am getting correct nutrients in my system, how I deal with the high cost of meat and dairy alternatives, and how to actu-ally cook a tasty meal. Through all these discussions and de-bates, one point remains true: It is entirely possible to be veg-an as a college student with-out spending a lot of time and money on the food. In all honesty, I faced many complexities as I pinpointed a proper way to go vegan. This idea stemmed from an envi-ronmental-science lecture in which my class discussed the detrimental ecological and ethical consequences of meat consumption. As someone who cares about the planet and someone who struggled with proper dieting tactics growing up, I thought the switch to a plant-based diet would be sim-ple. I told myself the change would happen all at once. This was not the case. Through personal exper- imentation with different foods, brands, and recipes, I realized the process of being a vegan college student is en-tirely doable. It just takes a lit-tle time to adjust. It's all about taking the right steps, and starting as a vegetarian can be one of the easier, better kick-starters in the transition to a fully vegan diet. College students confront a whirl-wind of problems throughout their educational career, but being vegan is easier than one might think. The act of cutting out meat may feel like an impossible journey \u2014 especially in a place such as Iowa \u2014 but other di-etary changes seem like small obstacles by comparison. Be-ginning with easier and more well-known meat replace-ments such as veggie burgers is an accessible and cost-effective way to get the ball rolling. I also started buying box- es of black-bean patties at places such as Hy-Vee and Natural Grocers, located a short drive from campus. I tried making my own home-made versions as well. Gar-dein, a veggie-based brand, provides food with delicious meat alternatives such as chicken nuggets, taco meat, and meatballs. So fear not, as-piring vegans \u2014 most meals containing meat have a deli-cious vegan counterpart. Cutting down dairy in- take was the next transition.Although the thought of de-creasing the deliciousness of cheeses and milk can seem like another big obstacle, the process is actually quite sim-ple. One of the tactics I pur-sued began with the switch from cow milk to a dairy-free option, such as almond, rice, or soy products. Substituting dairy-free milk in dishes such as a simple cereal bowl or in lattes creates an easier path to the dairy-free lifestyle. Brands such as GoVeggie and Daiya provide tasty and realistic shredded and sliced cheese replacements. These substitutions can be used on sandwiches, sprinkled on sal-ads or pasta, or put on pizza. These foods are completely accessible, cost-efficient, and delicious. While college life brings plenty of challenges, being vegan doesn't have to be one of them. The road to a plant-based lifestyle may seem daunting, but not impossible. So take a bite of that vegan burger, kick back, relax, and bon app\u00e9tit. COLUMN Being vegan in college The DI creative director writes about the challenges of eating a plant-based diet as a young person going to school. Photo illustration by Katina Zantz TAYLOR NEWBY taylor-newby@uiowa.eduCOLUMN I escaped the heat of a sweltering August day by sitting in a dark, cool au-ditorium. There, my home-town's community theater put on its first ever perfor-mance, aptly choosing The Music Man. While watching the show and humming along to some of my child-hood classics, I couldn't help but notice a scene that should have been cut from the musical in its entirety. A line of women marched onto the stage dressed as Native Americans, all of whom were white. Follow-ing their entrance, the lead-er of the group began chant-ing \"wa tan ye\" while the other women echoed her chant. From what I gath-ered, the women were put-ting on a performance and were not deliberately trying to disrespect anyone. After all, The Music Man d\u00e9buted on Broadway in 1957 and is set in 1912 Iowa. But does the musical el- derly state constitute an au-tomatic waver for question-able scenes? I think not. I'm white, and despite the innate priv- ilege that comes with my skin color, I can't help but feel uneasy about art that is dubbed as a timeless classic. Unfortunately, the realm in which the word \"timeless\" is used does not qualify in all forms of art, because a part of writing and creat- ing pieces such as The Music Man requires someone to analyze the time in which they are conscious. Even musicals such as Les Mis\u00e9rables \u2014 which, in my opinion, is superior to all others \u2014 have kept sing-songy jokes about certain identities \u2014 for example, about men being gay or saying \"this one's a Jew.\" My dad, a 60-year-old Jew-ish man who has seen Les Mis\u00e9rables eight times in his life, leaned over and whis-pered to me to say, \"I can't believe they kept the Jew joke.\" Some other shows have taken the measure to change the script or cut scenes that simply are not acceptable for 2019. For ex-ample, Show Boat d\u00e9buted on Broadway in 1927. The show covers controversial topics on race, and in the original script, the N-word appears in the opening line. When it was revived in 1946, the line was removed, along with several songs. New words were written, mak-ing Show Boat acceptable for more inclusive audiences. This example reminds us \u2014 the audience, play-wrights, directors, produc-ers \u2014 that revising anti-quated shows can still bring about the story's main idea while yielding whichever emotions creators hope to evoke in the audience once the curtains close. Nothing is timeless, and it's time that we revisit our beloved classics. What do we do with antiquated, insensitive art? Art from previous generations \u2014 such as The Music Man \u2014 contains racially insensitive content, but that doesn't mean it can't be adapted. 'Unfortunately, the realm in which the word \"timeless\" is used does not qualify in all forms of art, because a part of writing and creating pieces such as The Music Man requires someone to analyze the time in which they are conscious.' MADISON LOTENSCHTEIN madison-lotenschtein@uiowa.edu KATINA ZENTZ katina-zentz@uiowa.edu Contributedjust days before Iowa opens its season against Miami (Ohio) on Saturday. \"We are pleased that the NCAA and Big Ten Confer-ence have approved Oliver's waiver to play this season,\" Ferentz said in a release. \"Ol-iver is a tremendous young man who has been working hard since the day he set foot on our campus this summer. His teammates are excited to have him on the practice field and in the weight room, and we look forward to Oliver be-ing able to contribute to our team.\" Martin's ability to play brings more stability to an Iowa offense that lost its top three receiving threats to the NFL in T.J. Hockenson, Noah Fant, and Nick Easley. Not listed on Iowa's Week 1 depth chart with his status up in the air, Martin \u2014 who has been practicing with the team since the middle of June \u2014 will receive playing time next to Ihmir Smith-Marsette and Brandon Smith, as Nico Ragaini and Tyrone Tracy round out the receiving corps. \"I think me being a part of the receiving room helps the standard in the room raise,\" Martin said at Iowa's media day. \"I think it'll help push each other. They're talented, and I feel like I have good ability, so I think that helps raise the standard in prac-tice.\" Rated a four-star recruit by 247Sports during his days at Iowa City West, Martin was also listed as the best pros-pect in the state of Iowa out of high school as well as the seventh-best wide receiver in the nation. Martin redshirted in his first year with the Wolverines before hauling in 11 passes for 125 yards and a touch-down in 13 games last season. Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh said at Big Ten Media Days that Martin was at the top of the Wolverines' depth chart before his deci-sion to leave the program. \"Yeah, I was surprised that Oliver transferred,\" Har-baugh said. \"He really had a heck of a spring and was at the top of our depth chart coming out of spring ball and was doing very well in school \u2014 on his way to the Ross Business School. So, that was a surprise.\" Quarterback Nate Stanley said in June that Martin re-minded him of Easley, who starred as Stanley's security blanket by catching 52 passes in 2018. \"[He's] fast, has great hands,\" Stanley said. \"He re-minds me a lot of Nick. Kind of same body type. Obviously, Nick had great production here, so maybe he can do something like that.\"THE DAILY IOWAN | DAILYIOWAN.COM | THURSDAY , AUGUST 29, 2019 SPORTS 5A NO COVER9PM - 1AM THURSDAY MARTIN CONTINUED FROM 6A improvement this August, as well.\" That improvement may in part be due to the new philos-ophy the position group has adopted for watching film. Running backs coach Der- rick Foster wanted his play-ers to change the way they look at tape, diving deeper into each play. The results have been ben- eficial thus far. \"Sometimes, as running backs when you watch film, you just watch yourself,\" Young said. \"Now we're talking about the blockers and how the offensive line is going to block things up, different looks the defensive line is going to give us, the front they are, in things like that.\" This additional knowledge of what is happening on the field around them on any giv-en play has helped the posi-tion group anticipate what's coming at them and how to deal with it in order to gain more yards. \"We have an idea of what's going to happen,\" Sargent said. \"From there, athletic ability plays its part. We just make plays after that.\" Sargent returns for Io- wa this year after being the team's leader in rush-ing yards (745) and rushing touchdowns (10) a year ago. Sargent posted a ca- reer-high 173 yards rushing in the regular-season finale against Nebraska last year and has focused on continu-ing to improve \u2014 and the competition at the running back position has helped him do that. \"The competition in the running back room is unbe-lievable,\" Sargent said. \"We need that. I feel like if you don't have any competition, you're basically just patting yourself on the back and feel-ing like you're safe. I feel like to be our best individually, we need to compete with one another.\" Both Young and Sargent will see their share of touches for the Hawkeye offense this season. Other backs like Ivo-ry Kelly-Martin will see their share of touches as well. For Sargent, that is a ne- cessity to have success, es-pecially given the conference his team is in. \"We're in the Big Ten; it is going to take more than one running back to win the game,\" Sargent said. \"We are not selfish guys, it's a brotherhood in there. We have a camaraderie. We are just trying to win games and get to where we want to be: the Big Ten Champion-ship.\" FOOTBALL CONTINUED FROM 6A men's tennis team. At 18-10 on the season, the Hawkeyes posted a .643 win percentage. However, five of Iowa's losses last season were against Big Ten opponents. All in all, the Hawkeyes gutted out a 6-5 conference play record last season. Home dominance is in- evitably something the Hawkeyes will continue to look back on positively head-ing into the 2019-20 season. Conversely, Iowa's record on the road last season will likely be viewed as failure by coach-es, players, and spectators alike. Last year, the Hawkeyes stumbled their way into a rough 3-7 record away from home. 3 - Big Ten teams ranked in the top 25 Last season, three Big Ten teams were ranked inside the ITA top 25. Ohio State was ranked first overall by the end of the 2018-19 season. Illinois (15) and Michigan (19) were the other Big Ten schools rep-resented in the poll. The Hawkeyes went 1-2 against ITA top 25 teams in 2018-19. Iowa lost to Ohio State at home and Illinois on the road. Iowa's lone win against top 25 teams came at the HTRC against Michigan. It is also worth mentioning that Iowa defeated Minneso-ta before the Golden Gophers fell out of the ITA Top 25. When Iowa beat Minnesota, the Gophers came in at 18th overall. 19 - doubles points won in 2018 Last season, Iowa won 19 out of 28 possible doubles points. The Hawkeyes only earned one win without the doubles point last season. Contrarily, Iowa only lost twice when it earned the dou-bles point. Iowa finished 17-2 when it won the doubles point and 1-8 when it did not earn the doubles point. Because of this trend, the Hawkeyes need to prioritize winning the doubles point in every match in 2019-20. The numbers also suggest that Iowa needs to play better on the road and against ITA top 25 teams. If the Hawkeyes want national respect, post-ing a .500 or better winning percentage on the road and against ITA ranked teams will certainly help.Briefly looking outside the numbers, there is tremendous upside for this Hawkeye team. It ended last season on a 5-1 run over its last six games. Io-wa will also bring back stand-out veterans Kareem Allaf and Joe Tyler. Head coach Ross Wilson will be returning for his sixth season, as well. One thing that is clearly identifiable without numbers is the palpable excitement surrounding Iowa's men's tennis team heading into the 2019-20 season. TENNIS CONTINUED FROM 6Aeach year. Iowa already toppled Northern Iowa on Sunday, giving them a victory over an in-state team. Although the Hawkeyes fell to Iowa State last season, the preparation hasn't changed. \"I think that we are not ap- proaching [Iowa State] any differently,\" senior midfielder and captain Isabella Black-man said. \"I think that the past is the past, and we all just super excited for [Thursday] and hoping to get that win.\" The team will not allow the result of this game to impact the rest of the season, regard-less of the result. \"We have never allowed it to impact the season, to be honest,\" DiIanni said. \"We lost it last year, and we con-trolled most of the game, but gave up some set-pieces and still went on to having a de-cent season.\" As in football, the games are usually tight. Since Dilanni began coach- ing at Iowa in 2014, all but one game has been decided by one goal. \"Every game that we'll play against Iowa State is close; they're well-coached,\" DiIanni said. \"Even if one team is a bit more talented than the other, the game ends up being very close because of the nature of the rivalry and how intense it is. \"It's going to come down to production, and, overall, it's going be one player making a play to be able to push their team forward.\" Iowa plans to use its ad- vantages against Iowa State. With a 2-0-0 record head-ing into the contest, the Hawkeyes have a sense of their strengths.\"We're hoping to attack their midfield, because I think we might be a little stronger in there and then get some vertical balls up top and hope-fully score early,\" senior for-ward Kaleigh Haus said. The past two games for the Hawkeyes have been im-pressive, as they have out-scored their opponents, 8-1, with their victories coming against Western Michigan and Northern Iowa. Defeating two in-state op- ponents in the same week would mean a lot for the team. \"I think it really has to do with what we did in the off-season,\" Haus said. \"I mean, we scored something like 27 goals during spring, and I think that just carried over into our new season. It's been building up over the year.\" Iowa soccer also owns some responsibility with the game on the horizon \u2014 it will be the first game of the Cy-Hawk series in any sport. And each year, the rivalry starts anew with the fierce fire and passion the teams show.\"Honestly, [this game] means everything,\" Blackman said. \"My been a Hawkeye. I'm a third-gen-eration student-athlete here, so I've been born and raised to be against Iowa State. So, [Thursday's] game makes me really excited, and I know the team is excited, as well.\" SOCCER CONTINUED FROM 6A Nick Rohlman/The Daily Iowan Iowa running back Mekhi Sargent carries the ball during Iowa's game against Iowa State at Kinnick Stadium on Sept. 8, 2018.

Last season, the team lost the in-state rivalry to the Cyclones, 2-1. Despite the loss last season, Iowa didn't decide to focus on this game until recently.\"We had a great practice [on Wednesday],\" Io- wa head coach Dave DiIanni said. \"It was short and sharp and intense. I think that we are very short-minded in terms of our vision. I think now is the time we're talking about Iowa State versus worrying about it on Sunday.\" The Cy-Hawk rivalry is always intense no mat- ter the sport. Both teams want bragging rights BY ROBERT READ robert-read@uiowa.edu The term \"running back by committee\" tends to have a negative vibe attached to it. The assump-tion is that a team does not have a clear-cut No. 1 running back to give a full slate of touches to and is forced to split up carries.Some teams don't have starting-caliber run- ning back. In Iowa's case, it just has too many. The Hawkeyes will begin the 2019-20 football season with a committee taking hand-offs out of the backfield. The committee will be led by a pair of junior running backs: Mekhi Sargent and To-ren Young. Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz is pleased with where the position is right now and is confident both Sargent and Young will be playmakers for this year's Hawkeye team. \"It's a really good room,\" Ferentz said. \"We've got a really good room of backs right now. Both guys have improved a great deal. I really think they were better players in the spring than they were last fall, and I think we've seen growth and \"That's a lot of big guys coming at you, about 600 pounds worth. \u2014Cedrick Lattimore on his role of taking on double teamsQUOTE OF THE DAY \" Sports DAILYIOWAN.COM THURSDAY, AUGUST 29, 2019 THE MOST COMPLETE HAWKEYE SPORTS COVERAGE IN IOWA STAT OF THE DAY Iowa football returns players responsible for 96.3% of the teams rushing yards last season. 96.3% of rushing yardsGeil to enter transfer portal Iowa running back Henry Geil announced his intention to enter the transfer portal on Wednesday. \"I would like to thank the University of Iowa and their staff for opportunities the Hawkeyes have brought me,\" Geil tweeted. \"I've decided to enter the transfer portal, and will be transferring at the end of the semester.\" Geil appeared in two games for the Hawkeyes last year as a true freshman, taking advantage of the NCAA's new redshirt rule.HAWKEYE UPDATES Iowa golfers earn presea- son recognition Six Iowa golfers earned preseason recognition from the conference on Wednesday \u2014 thr ee on the women's team and three from the men's team. For the Hawkeye women, sophomore Manueala Lizarazu and freshmen Morgan Goldstein and Lea Zeitler were named 2019 Women's Golf Big Ten Preseason Honorees. Lizarazu competed in all 11 tournaments last season for Iowa and tied for 43rd at the Big Ten Championships last spring with a three-round score of 151 (7-over). The Bogota, Columbia, native carded a career best finish at the Diane Thompson Invite last season, placing third with a three-round total of 223 (7-over). Goldstein, a Las Vegas native, was a member of the All-Southern Nevada first team, All-Mountain Region first team, and All-Northwest League first team golfer as a senior in high school. Zeitler has been a member of the Austrian National Team since 2010, and was awarded a second-place finish at the 2017 Matchplay Championship. On the men's side, seniors Alex Schaake and Benton Weinberg, and sophomore Gonzalo Leal Montero were named 2019 Men's Golf Big Ten Preseason Honorees. Schaake is the reigning Big Ten Men's Golf Player of the Year and Les Bolstad winner, which is presented to the player with the lowest stroke average. The Omaha, Nebraska, native competed in all 11 events as a junior and led Iowa with 17 rounds at or below par last season. Weinberg was an All-Big Ten Second Team selection as a junior. He posted career bests at the Hawkeye Invitational, finishing sixth with a 54-hole score of 204 (9-under). Montero competed in every event in his freshman season.

While many sports programs have already tak- en the field, one sport remains in limbo: ten-nis. Hawkeye men's and women's tennis will not find the competitive court for a few more weeks. While other fall sports look ahead to the coming season, tennis takes a look back at last season. Here's a look at the 2018-19 Hawkeye men's tennis team by the numbers. 18 - wins in 2018 In 2018-19 the Hawkeyes earned 18 total wins. Six of those came against Big Ten foes. Iowa was most dominant at home last sea- son, as fourteen of the Hawkeyes' 18 wins came at home. Fourteen of the Hawkeyes' 18 wins last season came at home.

On the web On the air Events calendar80 HOUR S Thursday, August 29, 2019 Armed with pencils, a tech- nicolor array of her beloved fine-point gel-pens, and a dozen or so patterned Post-It notes, University of Iowa sophomore Camryn Norton takes to the dotted pages of a small pink journal each morning. Gliding the tip of her Tombow brush pen along the 1-millimeter paper to create detailed calligraphy lettering over a carefully drawn portrait of her week-ly schedule, Norton is not simply creating artwork or preparing for the coming week when she journals \u2014 she is resting the qualms of her racing mind. Like many organizational fanatics longing for a way to take their standard planners and notebooks to the next level, Norton has utilized the productive yet stress-reliev-ing hobby of bullet journaling: a personalized, methodical system of journaling that digi-tal designer and author Ryder Caroll created in 2013. According to Caroll's bullet journal website, \"It's best de-scribed as a mindfulness prac-tice disguised as a productivi-ty system. It's designed to help you organize your 'what' while you remain aware of your 'why'. The goal of the Bullet Journal is to help [bullet jour-nalists] live intentional lives, ones that are productive and meaningful.\" In the years since its cre- ation, images of the intricately designed dotted, or \"bulleted\" pages have crowded Pinterest, Instagram, and the blogs of organizational lifestyle influ-encers everywhere. Prices fluc-tuate from $7 for a best-selling dotted notebook on Amazon, to a nearly $30 hard-cover gridded journal on the shelves at Barnes & Noble. The price one is willing to pay is entire-ly up to the buyer, but supplies manager Kaylee Harney at Io-wa Book believes any dotted notebook will do the trick. \"They are very popular now, a lot of people like them. Peo-ple could use any kind of jour-nal but a lot of people like [bul-let journals] because it gives them some sort of direction,\" she said. Harney said she sees most buyers fill the journals with colorful designs and sched-ules. However, the details of exactly how to mimic the style of the traditional bullet jour-nal \u2014 nicknamed the \"BuJo\" by its followers, are difficult to define. For a handful of UI student bullet journalists, this is because the limits of a \"standard\" bullet journal do not exist, and each journal is catered to the personal needs of its user. Journals can be filled with everything from habit trackers to grocery lists, bucket lists, vacation spots to visit, and bachelorette party-planning ideas.

Aside from tracking her sleep, wa-ter intake, and exercise for health purposes, Stutting used her journal to plan the entirety of the 2018 Iowa Rotary Youth Leadership Awards, an annual leader-ship conference with more than 250 student attendees that she said took the ma-jority of the year to orga-nize. \"Literally everything I did before I put it in a spread-sheet, I put it in my bullet journal,\" she said. \"When I was working on that confer-ence, I used it every single day.\" In addition to meeting her organizational and lifestyle needs, Stutting also said writing and designing the pages in her bullet journal helped relieve the anxiety she felt while studying abroad in India over winter break. \"I was far away from home, I was on a different continent, I didn't know anybody around me, I didn't know the language,\" she said. \"So what I did is I took a Bible verse and I just opened up the back of my bullet journal and wrote down the verse and made it super beautiful. I'll just have random pages with differ-ent sayings and stuff. It's therapeutic.\" Now, Stutting uses a dif- ferent style of journal-ing to plan different Dance Marathon events and all fundrais-ing efforts leading up to the Big Event. She said having something to focus on in times of stress, while also being productive, has been calm-ing and rewarding to look back on. \"It's a good keepsake, and a very good way to go through the meticulous things that you did in the past,\" she said. \"A lot of times you don't remember those things, but those are the things that make up who you are.\" For UI sophomore Emma Gostonczik, bullet journal-ing became a way to tem-porarily escape from her busy life \u2014 and the pain of her chronic tension head- aches \u2014 when nothing else seemed to work. \"I tried acupuncture, massage therapy, physical therapy, yoga, and over-the-counter medication,\" she said. \"If you suffer from chronic pain, you're proba-bly never going to eliminate the issue entirely, but I used reading with low lighting and bullet journaling as stress-relief and that did help reduce my headaches when I was focused on one activity, but wasn't strain-ing my eyes or stressed.\" Aside from creating monthly sched-ules and doo-dling, Goston- czik uses her journal as a secure place to express her feelings when they become overwhelming. \"I tend to be a very open-book type of person, and while I realize it's great to be open, it's great to be honest with people, not everyone needs to know my life sto-ry,\" she said. \"I've found bullet journaling is some-thing where I can express those feelings and put them in a secure place where they are out into the world but not necessarily being trust-ed with any people.\"Gostonczik said having somewhere to keep her thoughts safe has kept her from unneeded stress and kept her thoughts in order. \"I think a lot, I talk a lot, I overanalyze things,\" she said. \"When I can have those thoughts and accept them and put them on the paper, but not put myself in a vul-nerable position by doing so, that really, really helped me emotionally. Everybody has mental struggles, and I think it's so great to have an outlet that doesn't put you in a negative position.\" JOURNAL CONTINUED FROM FRONT 'I've found bullet journaling is something where I can express those feelings and put them in a secure place where they are out into the world but not necessarily being trusted with any people.' \u2014 Emma Gostonczik, UI sophomore ACROSS 1 Last ___ 6 Stereo knob10 Franchise with a \"Cyber\" spinoff13 \"... you sure about that?\"15 Up to it16 Kylo ___ (Adam Driver role)17 iPhone download18 2020, but not 2019 or 202119 -20 Most of Google's income22 Film not seen in theaters24 Rapper law, for short30 90s kid?33 World35 Friends of Nancy36 Cousin of a Drama Desk Award40 Los Angeles neighborhood that includes Dodger Stadium41 Classic Dr. Seuss book42 -43 C-worthy44 Loading area45 Action figure with 21 moving parts46 Ventilated container49 \"Is there a point to all this?\"50 What may be found behind the appendix53 Tony55 Flood58 Piece of hotel room furniture62 Mountain rescue group63 Flee to avoid obligations, say65 -66 It's in the pipeline67 ___ Railroad Co. v.

Her classical look mirrors her appreciation for older cin-ema, which she continually works to help screen for the Iowa City community. For Bagnall, sitting in- side a cinema is more than a form of entertainment \u2014 it's a spiritual experience. Although she began as an international-studies ma-jor, one general-education course, \"Introduction to Film Studies,\" changed ev-erything for her. The mov-ies she watched were unlike anything she'd seen before, she said, making her want to delve further into cinema as an art form. In the second semester of her freshman year, a friend of Bagnall encour-aged her to apply to Bijou Film Board, the university's student organization dedi-cated to screening indepen-dent cinema. She worked on the After Hours Screen-ing Committee, where she helped screen films late at night and get students to at-tend the events. This year, she is the organization executive direc-tor. With the sev- eral commit-tees in Bijou, Bagnall said, she appreci-ates how the organization helps present a large range of movies from all over the world, whether they're se-rious documentaries or light-hearted cartoons.Bagnall has a large selec- tion of favorite movies, such as the Czech drama-com-edy Daisies, psychologi- cal horror Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and French arthouse Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelle. With older films such as Vertigo, Bagnall said, she was enraptured by how the movie portrayed its com-plex relationships and char-acter interactions. \"Relationships among people are really fascinat-ing, and people's routines and the things that they like to do over and over,\" Bag-nall said. \"... You don't really get that kind of emotional intensity from films nowa-days. Everything is so ster-ile and bland.\" As a cinema major, she frequently needs to create movies as class assign-ments. Her films have ex-clusively been set in her own apartment, taking an unconventional approach by not writing a script or linear story. \"I'm really interested in space, and how people in-habit space, and how the space that I'm living in can be manipulated through film,\" she said. In her new role, she said, she wants to make more of an effort to support in-dependent filmmakers, believing that it's difficult for moviegoers to keep an open-mind with so many remakes and sequels being released in recent years. \"I think that's real- ly discour-aging, because people are really getting in their box-es, and they just seek out what they know and what's comfort-able,\" Bagnall said. \"I really implore everyone to step out of their comfort zone and go see a movie that they might not have heard of but sounds really interesting.\"THE DAILY IOWAN | DAILYIOWAN.COM | THURSDAY , AUGUST 29, 2019 80 HOURS 5B Hometown: Ames Year in School: SeniorAge: 21Top artist she listens to: (Sandy) Alex G Dream place to live: ParisDream place to work: Metrograph in New York City Favorite place for a late-night bite: Dumpling DarlingFavorite movie: Celine and Julie Go Boating Last song stuck in her head: \"1914\" by floristInstagram: @m0llybbFAST FACTSExploring mind, body, and space through film Since her first year on campus, Molly Bagnall has devoted her time to screening independent films and creating unique movies.

Both Iowa natives, the duo has grown into a five-person band that tours Iowa and sur-rounding Midwestern states, pumping up audiences with top-40 hits from the 1980s to present day. The original team of Birdsall and Goodchild will perform three sets at the Vue Rooftop Aug. 30. When they first started their music career, Birdsall and Goodchild wrote a few original songs, but realized that song writing was a path that was simply not theirs to follow. \"It's like all the creativity went in the name,\" Birdsall said as a joke. \"Our principal strength as BIRDCHILD just isn't writing original tunes. In order for us personally to get more bookings and play music to a larger audience, we needed to play to our strength, which is playing our interpretations of great songs others have written.\" While the band has noth- ing but respect for songwrit-ers, the musical crew tends to put its own twist on original songs. \"Sometimes, if we're driv- ing and listening to the radio, we'll think, 'Wow, this song would sound great if we put a funk twist on it,'\" Goodchild said. \"We just take the song in the direction that sounds good to us.\" As the bass player of Bird- child, Ian Draves has to take control of the beat to create a \"funkier atmosphere.\" \"The bass is in charge of controlling that funk twist,\" Draves said. \"You have to feel the sub divisions and feel the beat more.\" If the whole band were present at Vue Rooftop, the sound would bring more of a funk vibe, as Birdchild's key-board player and drummer both possess a funk and soul background. But with the two members providing vocals and guitars on stage, Good-child said the sound may be subject to change. \"As a duo, we like taking songs that you would expect to sound the same but make it more acoustic,\" Goodchild said. Having recently played at the Iowa State Fair, the two Hawkeye fans expressed their interest in playing in Iowa City after Coralville's annual Fry Fest and the night of the first home football game. \"I used to leave Fry Fest wanting to go do something else,\" Goodchild said. \"Iowa crowds love to have a good time, and they show us a lot of support for us as a cover band.\" Depending on the show, the musicians said they feel what is similar to a runner's high during and after perfor-mances. \"There's more of a rush if you're playing on a big fo-rum,\" Birdsall said. \"After the show, you're feeling all amped up, but even with a small crowd you feel that general sense of pride when the show is over.\" Having played live shows since 2004, and being \"nine-to-five guys,\" the band doesn't expect to stop jamming any-time soon. \"We'll keep playing until we start forgetting the words to the songs,\" Goodchild said with a laugh. Seventeen years ago, two high-school friends started a cover band. The duo will head to Iowa City, giving twists to various top hits.

Iowa City is designated by UNES- CO as a World City of Literature. The University of Iowa is home to the first law school west of the Missis-sippi River. Stone for the Old Capitol was fer - ried down the Iowa River on barges. The UI was the first university in the nation to recognize an on-campus LGBTQ organization. Actor Gene Wilder graduated from the UI in 1955 with a B.A. in communi-cation and theater. The Iowa Memorial Union used to house a bowling alley, a soda fountain, and a dry nightclub. The UI was the first public univer - sity to admit men and women equally. According to UI Registrar data from fall 2018, 33,564 students are en-rolled at the UI. The UI boasts more than 40 Pulit- zer Prize-winning alumni and faculty members. The UI is the first university found- ed in the state of Iowa. Iowa City is ranked the fifth-best college town in the U.S. by the Amer - ican Institute for Economic Research. The Iowa Writers' Workshop is na- tionally known. Jewel Limar Prestage became the first black woman to earn a Ph.D. in political science from an American uni-versity when she graduated from the UI in 1954. The UI is one of the EPA's Green Power Partners. There are more than 500 active student organizations at the UI. More than 20 varsity athletic teams call the UI home.Facts to know about the UI, IC Iowa City was founded in 1839, and less than 10 years later the UI was established. Here are some facts students should know. Tom Brokaw, the world-renowned broadcast journalist, attended the UI, but didn't graduate. The Daily Iowan was the first daily college paper west of the Mississippi River. Actor Ashton Kutcher is a former Hawkeye. The first educational television station broadcasted programs from the basement of the Engineering Building. Iowa City became the first U.S. city with a population of more than 10,000 to elect a female mayor when it voted Emma J. Harvat into office in 1923. The median age of Iowa City res- idents is 24.8 years old, including the population of UI students. Former UI presidents have also led museums. President Emeritus Sandy Boyd was president of the Field Museum of Chi-cago, and former President David Skorton was the Smithsonian Institution secretary. TOP: The Old Capitol is seen on April 15.

(Shivansh Ahuja/The Daily Iowan)The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - 5Mollie Tibbetts ' death shocks nation The second day of classes came with the discovery of the body of UI student Mollie Tibbetts. She had been missing since July 18, when she disappeared from her home-town of Brooklyn, Iowa. Authorities said Cristhian Bahena Rivera, the man charged with her murder, led investigators to her body in a cornfield in Poweshiek County. A vigil was held on campus that week in Hubbard Park, where students gathered to honor Tibbetts' memory. Free-speech issues flare on campus A judge ruled against the UI in Feb- ruary in a case regarding the removal of Business Leaders in Christ as a regis-tered student group. The UI removed the organization in late 2017 after the group denied a leadership position to then-soph-omore Marcus Miller, saying he did not uphold the group's faith statement be-cause he is gay. The court ruled that the Human Rights Policy at the UI was not applied equally across student groups. Around the same time, the Iowa Legisla-ture passed a bill that addressed freedom of speech on college campuses, including regulations around student groups. Iowa women dominate college hoops The Iowa women's basketball team had a dynamite season this year, finish-ing with a 29-7 record, the best in near -ly 25 years. The team won the Big Ten Tournament in March with a 90-76 win over Maryland. Iowa continued on to an impressive run in the NCAA Tourna-ment, finally falling in the Elite Eight game against Baylor. The powerhouse of the team was undoubtedly Megan Gustafson, who racked up the most ca-reer points for any Hawkeye basketball player, ending the season with 2,781 to-tal points. She received several national awards, including AP Player of the Year. UI brings change to greek community An investigation into greek life con- ducted during the first semester result-ed in four UI fraternities being removed from campus. Kappa Sigma, Delta Chi, Sigma Nu, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon lost their registration as student orga-nizations in December. The fraternities were found in violation of the Fraternity/Sorority Life moratorium that began in May 2017, which bans fraternities from putting on alcohol-related events, and UI alcohol policy. Several fraternities were also placed on probation. Hawkeyes selected in first round of NFL Draft The Hawkeyes made history in April when T.J. Hockenson and Noah Fant were selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. It was the first time two tight ends from the same school were drafted during the first round. Hockenson was selected by the Detroit Lions at No. 8, and Fant went to the Denver Broncos at No. 20. #DoesUIowaLoveMe? A social-media movement began in February with students from historical-ly marginalized groups saying the UI does not do enough to promote diversity and prevent discrimination. Under the hashtag #DoesUIowaLoveMe, students shared stories of discrimination and oth-er challenges they had experienced at the UI, challenging the school to better address their concerns. Modern Piping legal dispute drags on Since 2017, the UI was in a legal dis- pute with contractor Modern Piping over work done on Hancher Auditorium and the Stead Family Children's Hospi-tal. District and state courts affirmed an arbitration panel's award of more than $20 million for work done on the proj-ects. This year, the Iowa Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Modern Piping, backing the 6th District Court's ruling that the UI pay that judgment. In May, after a district-court judge lifted the stay on the execution of the judgment that was put in place pending the appellate court's ruling, the UI had paid Modern Piping in full.Historic cold causes death on campus Another tragedy struck the univer - sity in January when UI student Ger - ald Belz, a Burge resident, died after university police found Belz unrespon-sive outside Halsey Hall early Jan. 30 when windchill temperatures dipped below minus-30 degrees. Later reports confirmed Belz died of hypothermia be-cause of cold exposure. UI Health Care employee's mysterious death unresolved The community was affected by the death of UI Health Care employee Jo- Ellen Browning in April. Browning, 65, died in her home on April 5. Investiga-tors quickly ruled the death a homicide. Browning worked at UI Health Care for 42 years, and was described as a \"loving wife, mother, sister, and friend.\" Election Night brings victory for female candidates in Iowa The November 2018 election was no- tably a victory for women. Kim Reyn- olds became the first elected female governor in Iowa history. Iowa voters elected its first female U.S. Congress-women, Cindy Axne and Abby Finke-nauer. In addition, 44 women were elected to the state Legislature, com-pared with a previous total of 35.6 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 What happened in 2018-19? Wyatt Dlouhy/The Daily Iowan A UI student speaks during a rally for the #DoesUIowaLoveMe movement on the T. Anne Cleary on Feb. 28. Stu-dents, faculty, and community members gathered to share stories about belonging to marginalized groups. The UI community responded to a number of tragedies, celebrated success, and faced changes in the 2018-19 academic year. Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Gov. Kim Reynolds addresses supporters at the Hilton in Des Moines on Nov. 7.

Student Health & Wellness under - went a major change during the 2018-19 academic year \u2014 the program broke into two separate entities, Stu-dent Health and Student Wellness. This division is an effort to create a greater emphasis on the UI's move-ment toward a holistic approach to student health care. Student Health Located in Westlawn on 200 New- ton Road, Student Health is only a short bus ride away from campus, and provides unlimited visits to students at no additional cost outside of their tuition. Student Health offers allergy treat- ments and shots, confidential gyne-cology, immunizations, travel edu-cation in health-related areas, lab procedures, sexual-health services, LGBTQ-friendly medical care from a LGBTQ-friendly provider, nurse care, and mental health care. To schedule an appointment, stu- dents can either call at 319-335-8394 or register for a MyChart account. Student Wellness Student Wellness, while no longer a part of Student Health, is still located in the same place, along with a sec-ondary location in the Campus Recre-ation and Wellness Center. The new department offers ser - vices for students in the areas of fit-ness, nutrition, stress management, alcohol, drugs, tobacco and e-cig-arettes, sexual health, and sleep. Some specific programs include a 5K/10K training program, intui-tive eating workshops, and Refresh, which teaches students about get-ting a restful night of sleep. University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics UI Hospitals & Clinics started out on the East Side of the Iowa River in 1873. More services were added over the years, such as the children's hospi-tal and the psychopathic hospital in the early 1900s. The hospital moved into a new facility on the west side of the riv-er in 1928, and still stands there today. UIHC's main facility, located at 200 Hawkins Drive, is Iowa's only com-prehensive academic medical-care center. The 811-bed hospital is ran by 13,000 employees, students, and vol-unteers on any given day. Many other clinics and facilities care for patients in addition to the main facility. UI Stead Family Children's Hospital The UI Stead Family Children's Hospital, the only comprehensive children's hospital in the state, opened in 2017. The 190-bed hospi-tal served 77,068 patients last year, coming from every county in Iowa, nearly every state, and several coun-tries. High on the 12th floor, pediatric patients and their families can see the ideal view of Kinnick Stadium ev-ery home football game through the Rooftop Press Box, both settings of the iconic Hawkeye Wave, a tradition that has gained national attention. Carver College of Medicine On 375 Newton Road, the Carver Col- lege of Medicine stands as one of the nation's top medical schools, and works closely with UIHC to provide patients with the best theoretical knowledge and clinical care possible. Many special-ized centers are housed in the college, including the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Iowa Neuroscience Institute, and the Carver Family Center for Macular Degeneration. UI QuickCare UI QuickCare is available to stu- dents in need of non-emergency-based care. Located in the Old Capitol Town Center on 201 S. Clinton St., students can receive care without setting up an appointment. Conditions treated at Quick Care include respiratory illness-es, minor ear, eye, and skin conditions, minor injuries, bladder infections, sex-ually transmitted disease, vomiting, and diarrhea. UI Health Care LGBTQ Clinic The UI LGBTQ Clinic, located at Iowa River Landing at 105 E. 9th St., serves the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning communities by providing full-ser - vice health care to meet LGBTQ health needs. All clinic staff has had LGBTQ-specific cultural humility training to ensure a welcoming envi-ronment.Health care with a statewide reach Students have access to all the tools they need for a healthy lifestyle with different University of Iowa programs.

The University of Iowa strives to provide a wel- coming and safe environment for people of all iden- tities. In order to respect and support transgender and nonbinary individuals at the UI, there are a number of resources and services available. UI students are given the ability to change university records to reflect a more accurate rep-resentation of students' identities. To change sex and gender in UI records, students can go to their MyUI accounts, select the \"Student Information\" tab, scroll down to the header \"Student Life Man-agement,\" select \"Sex and Gender,\" and update their preferred identifications. To change a student's preferred name and pro-nouns in UI records, students should follow a sim-ilar process. Also under \"Student Information\" in MyUI and under the \"Student Life Management\" header, students can update their names and pronouns through the \"Preferred Name and Pro-nouns\" tab. Students are also encouraged to look into the Trans Student Support fund, which assists and supports UI transgender students seeking legal name and document changes but have limited fi-nancial means to do so. In the summer of 2016, the UI restroom project converted restrooms into gender-neutral spaces. Students living on campus now have the ability to select gender-inclusive housing in their UI Hous-ing application and choose to live in the \"All In\" LLC for LGBTQ students, and a number of resi-dence halls have pod-style bathrooms that aim to eliminate the struggle that transgender and nonbi-nary students may face when choosing a restroom. UI students also have the opportunity to join the Trans Alliance student organization, which focus-es on spreading awareness of what it means to be transgender and increases public knowledge of the identity. Students are also welcome at the Pride Alliance Center to find a community among other transgender and nonbinary students in a nurtur - ing environment.

First, the Office of Student Financial Aid can connect students to work-study jobs, in which on-campus employment funnels pay-ment directly into tuition dollars, or other work opportunities on campus, for students who need to earn extra cash. The website also provides information regarding scholar - ships, loans, among many items, so students can narrow down which opportunities they are eligible for. Finally, Financial Aid actively works to ed- ucate students on financial literacy: teaching students how to track their spending, pull their credit reports, check their loan balance, and more. Resources include helpful links on how to create a budget, or compare and re-pay loans. Equally helpful is the UI Student Government's guide to \"Being Not-Rich at Io-wa,\" a collaborative document for students to share saving tips and advice. David Harmantas/The Daily Iowan Calvin Hall, which houses the UI Financial Aid Office, is seen on Oct. 30, 2017.

The Universi-ty of Iowa has an established support system for those struggling with substance abuse. The UI Collegiate Recov- ery Program embodies al-cohol-harm reduction, pro-viding a network of services and opportunities for stu-dents at any level of recov-ery from substance abuse so they can achieve their aca-demic goals. The program distinguishes itself from an addiction-treatment pro-gram, aspiring instead to be a community for people struggling with substance abuse and a space support-ed by qualified, professional staff. Strength in Numbers and Success Not Excess groups that are both available to foster an encouraging en-vironment for students in recovery or who seek alter - native ways to connect with peers. UI Hospitals & Clinics al- so offers outpatient services for students fighting alcohol and substance abuse. In ad-dition, the UI continually provides alternatives to al-cohol and substance-based activities. Sober and stu-dent-based events are avail-able every week, so students can comfortably recover and abstain from drinking, smoking, etc. Programs for substance abuse For students seeking support for substance abuse, the UI offers a number of resources.Navigating financial aid Figuring out how to finance the cost of a degree can be complicated.

Nearly one-fourth of the student population reports being first-gen-eration. The UI works on develop-ing initiatives for first-generation Hawks through the First-Genera-tion Task Force. The task force com-prises people from different areas of campus and has focused on involve-ment in the National First-Genera-tion Celebration. First-generation students can also seek support with resources in the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Many first-generation students are part of other underrep-resented populations as well.Next academic year, the UI will bring back the First-Generation Learning Living Community in the residence halls, and it will include a learning component through the Rhetoric Department. Another support mechanism is the First Generation Summit, a student-led initiative that has been implemented to celebrate students with the identity. UI Student Gov-ernment hosted the event for a sec-ond time this past spring. It brings speakers and also provides work-shops for students and community members to attend. Ultimately, the summit gives an opportunity for students with the first-generation identity to come together and build relationships.The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - 23 24 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 All Hawkeyes have the opportu- nity to seek out a job in nearly all locations around campus.

Before Harreld was select-ed, the UI chapter of the American Association of University Professors conducted a survey revealing that only 1.8 percent of faculty and 2.6 percent of other respondents consid-ered him qualified for the job. As a former IBM, Kraft Foods, and Boston Market executive, Harreld lacks the experience in higher education many members of the campus community believe is necessary to govern the university. That concern sparked several pro- tests around the time of Harreld's hir - ing, as well as a sanction from the na-tional AAUP to condemn what faculty said was a lack of shared governance in the hiring process. The AAUP voted to lift the sanction in June 2018 after fac-ulty and administrators collaborated to draft a UI presidential-search doc-ument outlining best practices to pro-mote the involvement of shared-gover - nance leaders in the process. The 21st president of the UI, Har - reld has spent the last three years de-veloping and implementing a strate-gic plan according to key institutional priorities: research and discovery, student success, and engagement. Executive VP and Provost Montserrat Fuentes Two years after the departure of UI Executive Vice President and Pro- vost P. Barry Butler, Montse Fuent-es stepped into the role in June.

Because Iowa City has cemented itself as a liter - ary city full of writers and think-ers, there is certainly no shortage caffeinated hotspots \u2014 whether you are studying, catching up with friends, or pumping out a nine-page research paper, there is a macchiato with your name on it. Prairie Lights, for example, fea- tures a quaint coffee shop, called the Times Club, among its pletho-ra of novels and notebooks \u2014 with an ever-rotating array of drinks, the lesser-known spot is a favorite of English professors, writers, and those looking to escape the chaos of some other well-known chains. Fa-vorites, such as the ubiquitous Star - bucks and Iowa City landmark Java House, which also has a location in the Iowa Memorial Union, offer a quick pick-me-up as opposed to a place to park yourself for hours at a time, although Java's downtown lo-cation does offer ample seating. Both Prairie Lights and Java House offer classic cups, such as Chai lattes and cappuccinos, and also feature signa-ture drinks \u2014 Java's sugar-cookie latte is the perfect marriage of the sweetness of the dessert and buzz of the caffeine. Newer ventures, such as Poindex- ter (which is attached to the Grad-uate Hotel), may be fresh in town but are equally enjoyable to explore. Regardless of your \"spot,\" Iowa City surely has beans to die for. Plus, who doesn't need an afternoon jolt of energy? Another newer coffee shop in town is Cortado, which opened in Janu-ary 2017. Alongside espresso drinks and drip coffee, Cortado also serves Mediterranean-inspired sandwich-es, salads and soups as well as fresh pasteries.No sleep? No problem: Coffee shops in Iowa City David Harmantas/The Daily Iowan Cortado, a coffee shop in Iowa City, is seen on Sept. 16, 2017.

If you are visiting Iowa City for the week-end or living here for four years, the ever-changing landscape of the city's stores never produce a dull shopping experience. Iowa Book: Bursting to the seams with Hawkeye pride, this downtown spot features a large selection of Tiger - hawk gear along with school supplies and textbooks.

Iowa City's bustling art scene is showcased here in full force: everything from stickers (perfect for laptops,) posters, prints, and ceramic pieces create a unique shopping experience every time. This shop is also right next door to Record Collector, Iowa City's one-stop-shop for vinyl (and even cassette tapes.) Artifacts: With everything from midcentury modern furniture to an-tique children's' toys, Artifacts has ev-erything you could imagine ... and then some. The store certainly lives up to its tagline of \"no boring stuff allowed.\" Whether you are looking for old post cards to fill the walls of your dorm room or a quirky accoutrement to adorn your desk, the store's constantly replenished stock of unique items will certainly war - rant a second (and third) trip back. Ragstock: When Halloween rolls around, students often scramble to find the pieces of their costumes. But with Ragstock right next door to Java House in the heart of the city, your costume will assemble itself right in front of your eyes. When it's not a \"spooky\" time of year, the store is known for a wide va-riety of pre-owned and vintage clothing. Raygun: Ubiquitous in Iowa for its array of quirky, sardonic, and political-ly charged T-shirts, Raygun is a main-stay in the Hawkeye State. In addition to special-edition shirts that chronicle events and political movements, the store also sells coffee mugs, magnets, and post cards. Prairie Lights: In addition to a quant coffee shop, Prairie Lights, which President Obama visited on his trips to the university, regularly makes the top of the \"best bookstores in the country\" list. Iowa City's reputation as a true writers' city is truly shown by the breadth of written works available at the storied location \u2014 prose , poetry, cookbooks \u2014 you name it \u2014 line the shelves of the warm and inviting book emporium.

Through-out Iowa City, a myriad of resturants \u2014 with a plethora of culinary options \u2014 will assist you in vanquishing even the most vicious hunger. Basta, for example, offers deceptive- ly simple Italian dishes. The restau-rant's name, which comes from an Italian phrase that means \"enough,\" is the perfect place for a date-night, parents' weekend, or a relaxed eve-ning with close friends. After all: is there anything better for unwinding from a long week than an oven-fired pizza and laughs with friends? A new, but highly rated spot, St. Burch, is split into two levels: a dining room (the \"tavern\") and a basement (the \"den\"), which offer a variety of appe-tizers, entrees, and libations. Then, of course, are the Iowa City favorites \u2014 Pancheros ever-pres-ent burrito (and famous late hours) and Mesa's zany pizza slices come to mind. Other must-visits, such as the soups, salads, and sandwiches of Nodo and Dumpling Darling's vegan and vegetarian bites, perpetually ex-perience a crowd of satisfied foodies. Breakfast is also something Io- wa City doesn't take lightly. Both Hamburg Inn, which is visited by presidential hopefuls during caucus season, and Bluebird Diner offer the perfect atmosphere for a date or long-awaited breakfast with old friends. Regardless of your culinary tastes, however, a five-minute (or less) walk through Iowa City will yield countless options for your rumbling stomach.Where to eat in Iowa City Emily Wangen/The Daily Iowan Slices of pizza are seen on display at Mesa on May 13.

Each year, CAB provides students with a number of activities each week, from comedy shows to feature films, CAB is the source for all things enter - tainment. In CAB, there are 10 committees. The comedy committee brings top-act comedians from all over the country to the UI, and the films committee shows newly released films at the IMU. There is also a traditions committee focused on preserving and creating traditions, a Night Hawks commit-tee focused on nightly activities, and a special-events committee that is in charge of large scale events, such as Welcome Week. The cultural committee puts on events representing different cultures around the world, and the variety com-mittee is in charge of hosting weekend trips and weekly Thursday activities of all types. The novelty committee, the most re- cent addition to CAB, hosts events two to three times per month, including trivia night. There are also committees for marketing and public relations for students seeking to promote CAB be-hind the scenes. SCOPE provides UI students with the opportunity to learn more about the music industry by offering quali-ty concerts and entertainment to the university and Iowa City communities. SCOPE is also responsible for plan-ning the UI Homecoming shows each year. It has hosted such musicians as Bil- lie Eilish, Lizzo, and Car Seat Head-rest in the past and features big names in the music industry every year. Each fall semester, SCOPE looks for student genuinely interested in the music in-dustry to join the organization, located in the IMU.UI Campus Activities Board and SCOPE are two student groups that work to bring comedians, activities, and music to campus for Hawkeyes to enjoy.

KRUI operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, broadcasting news, sports, and mu-sic for the Iowa City community. Students can join without previous experience as on-the-job training is provided. KRUI has nine depart-ments: on-air staff, music, online content, marketing, sports, news un-derwriting, production, operations, and IT. The University of Iowa has pro- grams for everyone on campus, pro-viding many different opportunities for involvement. One of these many programs is ROTC, which gives stu-dents the opportunity to gain the skills for graduation while simulta-neously gaining the skills to become an officer in the Army if they choose. Reserve Officer Training Corps, known as ROTC, is composed of a set of electives that students may take to gain knowledge on the history of the Army, leadership and manage-ment skills, and military instruction. Many of these skills are applica- ble to any field that students pur - sue, so there are no majors that ROTC would not benefit. With only one elective class per semester, the ROTC program does not interfere with students' field of study. While ROTC programs reward students with greater skill develop-ment as well as opportunities after college, students may also be re-warded with additional scholarship opportunities. ROTC offers many scholarships for students involved in the program, typically based on merit. While the amount of money awarded in scholarships may vary, scholarship winners are an \"allow-ance\" of up to $1,500 per year. While many students are interest- ed in the ROTC for career benefits, skills development, and scholarship opportunities as a bonus, many ask whether it requires military obliga-tion. ROTC does not require a mil-itary obligation the first two years of involvement and do not have a service obligation after college un-less the student chooses to enroll as an Army officer. This allows students the option to choose their path later while gaining additional leadership and managerial skills in college. If students are interested in ROTC or have additional questions, they may contact the UI Department of Military Science. There are many options for involvement on campus, and ROTC is an opportunity to ben-efit students for their college careers as well as their futures. For students interested in the Army, ROTC serves as a resource for education and training.

Presi- dential candidates flood the state, hopping from city to city on the campaign trail. Needless to say, University of Iowa students are politically active. The UI is home to three political organizations that are associated with major political parties: the University Democrats, the College Republicans, and the Y oung Democratic Socialists at Iowa. The organizations meet several times a semester, usually on a weekly basis. The political groups here give students the opportunity to be come active citizens. Though the organizations are associated with political parties, people from different political backgrounds are invited to join in the name of education. The University Democrats are dedicated to ensuring the vic- tories of Democratic candidates in Iowa and beyond. On campus, the group helps to organize candidate visits, voter-registration events, fundraisers, and educational oppor - tunities. The College Republicans is a student organization devoted to spreading Republican ideas across campus. The group works to further the party's agenda and promote student leadership. The Young Democratic Socialists at Iowa strives to promote racial, gender, eco- nomic, and environmental equity on campus. The organization hosts educational events, voter-registration events, book clubs, and candidate visits.

The UI has residence halls locat- ed on the East Side, near the heart of campus except for one), and on the West Side near the UI Hospitals & Clinics. Most first-year students opt to live in the residence halls, though they are open to returning students and transfer students as well. Currier, Stanley, Burge, Daum, Catlett, and Mayflower are located on the East Side. Hillcrest, Peters - en, Slater, and Rienow are located on the West Side.

On-campus living isn't for every - one. For students wishing to get out of the residence halls, off-campus liv-ing is available. Starting the apart-ment search early is recommended. Though the housing market is lim- ited in Iowa City, students can find just what they are looking for if they allot plenty of time to search. For students planning on living with roommates who don't have any yet, social-media sites such as Face-book and Reddit are perfect places to start. Often, apartment compa- nies also have roommate searches on their websites. The next step is the search. It is generally more expensive to live closer to campus, but often the con - venience seems invaluable. Howev-er, the farther away from campus the apartment is, the cheaper it is likely to be, and it might offer more amenities. The University of Iowa offers an off-campus housing search on which students can view listings of apartments and houses through-out the city.

The REACH program at the UI, which stands for Recognizing Edu - cation and Career Hopes, provides student with disabilities a transition certificate program. Students with autism, Down syn- drome, intellectual disabilities, or learning disabilities are encouraged through the REACH curriculum to become independent members of their communities. REACH combines academic enrich - ment, career development, student life, and transitional elements to pro - vide students with a Big Ten college experience. The two- to three-year REACH pro - gram provides inclusive classroom experiences, extensive scholarship support, employment preparation, and internships in the local commu - nity. Alums of UI REACH have gone on to work for organizations such as the Chicago Cubs, Sukup Manufacturing, and Arrow Electronics. The national employment rate for individuals with disabilities is just 20 percent. Since the program's in - ception in 2008, more than 80 percent of UI REACH students are employed. Support for REACH students doesn't end at graduation. EXTEND is a network of REACH alumni that hosts monthly and yearly social events for families and graduates.

For students looking for the opportunity to showcase their athlet-ic abilities, intramural sports are the perfect des-tination. Intramural sports pro - vide the chance for UI students who are not in - volved in college athletics to get out on the playing fields or courts. From flag football and 3-on-3 basketball to inner tube water polo and ca - noe battleship, there are activities to fit the inter - ests of many. Intramural options are available in both the fall and spring semesters. To get involved, students simply need to purchase an Intramural Sports Membership, which can be done on the Recre-ational Services website. Memberships are avail- able for $25 each semes - ter or $45 for a yearlong membership. Purchasing a membership gives stu - dents access to all of the intramural sports offered that semester. A membership is rec - ommended for students planning to play in more than one sport, play in a league sport, or partici- pate in a multi-day tour - nament. Single-play passes are also available for certain activities for $10, with an option available to upgrade to a full mem - bership at the end of that day. Valid UI IDs are nec- essary to compete in any given sport. They will be checked prior to the be - ginning of events.The University of Iowa offers several intramural sports during both the fall and spring semesters. Campus Recreation & Wellness Center Located in proximity to the Main Li - brary, the Campus Recreation & Well - ness Center is undoubtedly the biggest fitness center on campus. It has basketball courts, a lazy river, a pool, a climbing-rock station, sauna and steam rooms, training rooms as well as a three-level gym from dumbbells to cardio machines for all fitness needs. Because of all the great amenities the center provides, it's no surprise that it can get a bit busy, especially during the mid-afternoon and weekdays. The spot is probably best for a great workout for any muscle type during the mornings or late evenings. Field House Located near Petersen, Rienow, and Slater, the Field House is the perfect fit -ness center for people who live on the West Side. It has a nice workout room with numerous bench racks and dumb-bells Additionally, it is the place to go for basketball and badminton. It has more than 12 basketball courts for all indoor sports needs. Fitness East A more basic fitness center across the street from the IMU, Fitness East is the perfect low-key spot for anyone looking to get a quick workout without waiting. Never is there a time when this fit - ness center is overly packed, allowing people to get in and out during just about any time of day. However, the only downfall is that is closes at 7 p.m. Campus Rec shutters at midnight and the Field House at 10:30 p.m.Best spots to work out on campusKatie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Students participate in flag football in the Hawkeye Tennis and Recreation Complex on April 24.

Coming off a 14-19 cam- paign in 2017-18, Iowa knew it had to fix its once-atrocious defense and find offensive consistency. It did just that. The Hawkeyes churned out a 23-12 record, finishing sixth in the regular-season Big Ten standings and spending a good chunk of the season in the top-25, and even went dancing in Columbus, Ohio. There, Iowa bested Cincin- nati in the round of 64 before falling in overtime to Tennessee, 83-77 \u2014 just one victory short of a Sweet 16 berth. Iowa's core of Jordan Bohannon, Joe Wieskamp, and Luka Garza will return, as well as the majority of the Hawkeye bench rotation. Tyler Cook announced he would leave the program and test his luck in the NBA Draft. He has been one of the conference's top forwards during his three years with the program. Nicholas Baer's five-year Hawkeye career has come to an end, and he will definitely be missed. He finished his tenure as the only Hawkeye in program history to have more than 750 points, 500 rebounds, 100 blocks, 100 assists, 100 steals, and 100 3-pointers in a career. It'll be interesting to see what Iowa's rotation looks like next season, but head coach Fran McCaffery might have one of his deepest squads yet. Not only do the Hawkeyes get Cordell Pemsl and Jack Nunge back from redshirt seasons, but C.J. Fred- rick will see his first action on the court after doing the same. Meanwhile, incoming freshmen Patrick McCaffery and Joe Toussaint enter the program. McCaffery (listed as ESPN's 60th-best prospect in the nation) adds an-other scoring dimension along the wing, and Toussaint (four-star point guard) boasts a slashing, facilitating game.The Hawkeye women's basketball team had one of its best seasons in program history in the 2018-19 season. Iowa went further than it has ever gone in head coach Lisa Bluder's tenure, winning a Sweet 16 matchup against North Carolina State to make an Elite Eight appearance. Both Bluder and star player Megan Gustafson earned the Naismith Coach and Player of the Year trophies, and Gustafson earned several other Player of the Year awards as well. While Iowa will lose Gustafson \u2014 the best player in program history \u2014 along with Tania Davis and Hannah Stewart, the Hawkeyes should see more meaningful action from a few of last year's juniors. Kathleen Doyle and Makenzie Meyer will play big roles. Both showed significant growth from their sophomore seasons, and without Gustafson taking the main portion of points, both should see some significant increases in production. Filling out the three spots of the Hawkeye seniors will be the difficult part. Monika Czinano saw some solid playing time as a freshman and will be the prime contender to take over Gustafson's post spot. Senior Amanda Ollinger might vie for Stewart's empty spot, and redshirt freshman Kate Martin, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL, could be a top competitor for Davis' open position. Next season probably won't end in the thrilling fashion Iowa's last one did, but Bluder always seems to get the best out of her team no matter the talent level, and this upcom-ing season should be no different.Women turn to life after Gustafson The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - 95 Take $100 off your Slumberland purchase of $599 or more.

Iowa football finished 9-4 in 2018, cranking out its fourth season in a row with at least 8 victories. Iowa capped the season with a 27-22 win over No. 18 Mississippi State in the 2019 Outback Bowl, and it also had wins over rivals Iowa State, Minnesota, and Ne-braska during the regular season. The Hawkeye defense allowed just 17.8 points per game (11th in the country) and on the offen-sive side, it scored 36 or more points on five occasions, includ-ing a season-high 63 in a shutout win over Illinois.Quarterback Nate Stanley had a breakout season, throwing for 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns. Defensively, Iowa's Amani Hook-er earned the Tatum-Woodson Award, given to the Big Ten's best defensive back. Stanley and running back Me- khi Sargent head the offensive playmakers returning, and of-fensive linemen Tristan Wirfs and Alaric Jackson will hold the two tackle positions. On the oth-er side of the ball, defensive end A.J. Epenesa is arguably the con-ference's best lineman.Losing both tight ends in No- ah Fant and T.J. Hockenson will hurt, but Iowa boasts a reliable history of plugging in and play-ing guys at the position. Hooker, Anthony Nelson, Nick Easley, Matt Nelson, Ross Reynolds, and Keegan Render will all leave siz-able holes to fill as well. Iowa's regular-season sched- ule is tougher this season. The Hawkeyes make trips to Iowa State, Michigan, Northwestern, Wisconsin, and Nebraska while hosting Penn State, Minnesota, Rutgers, Purdue, and Illinois.

The men's team took the champion- ship medal at five meets last season, as well as a share of the regular-season Big Ten title and a Coaching Staff of the Year honor. Highlights from the season include eight athletes advancing to the final round of the NCAA Championships, three earning All-American honors, and two in the final round of the Win-ter Cup Challenge. Individually, Andrew Herrador took second place on the high bar, and Stew-art Brown took third place on vault at the Big Ten Championships. Evan Davis scored Big Ten Freshman of the Week after his performance at the Win-ter Cup. The women's team finished its in- tense season with a fourth place se-cured at the NCAA regional. Before doing that, the team finished sixth at the Big Ten Championships and took numerous individual honors. Senior Nicole Chow and junior Char - lotte Sullivan were named to the 2019 Big Ten Women's Gymnasts to Watch list. The GymHawks also topped 196 points throughout the majority of the season. Notable departures include Gym- Hawks Chow and Misty-Jade Carl-son and Jake Brodarzon on the men's squad. Bennet Huang, Herrador, and Davis will return next season. Jax Kranitz, Clair Kaji, Lauren Guerin, and Alex Greenwald will return for the women.The Iowa wrestling team went 14-1 during the regu-lar-season dual meets, unde-feated in the Big Ten, with its only loss coming at the hands Oklahoma State in Stillwater. The Hawkeyes finished third at the Big Ten Cham-pionships, crowning a lone champion in 165-pounder Alex Marinelli. He went un-defeated the whole season up until the NCAAs, where he placed seventh. At the national tourna- ment, Iowa placed fourth, and Spencer Lee successful-ly defended his 125-pound title. Lee went 23-3 and placed second at both the Midlands and Big Ten Championships, falling to Sebastian Rivera in both of those finals before bouncing back in the season's biggest tournament. Another Hawkeye to watch will be Austin De-Santo. In his first year as a Hawkeye, he earned the 133-pound Midlands title, placed fifth at NCAAs, and notched numerous upset victories throughout the season. Mitch Bowman and Sam Stoll are the only Hawkeyes in last season's starting lineup who will not ap-pear in 2019-20. Among the eight returners, six were All-Americans: Lee, DeSan-to, Pat Lugo, Kaleb Young, Marinelli, and Jacob War - ner. In addition, All-Ameri- can Michael Kemerer, who had to sit out last season because of an injury, will be back for the 2019-20 season. With seven returning All-Americans and a two-time national champion in the lineup, the Iowa wres-tling squad has the poten-tial to reach great heights next season. After going undefeated in its Big Ten duals, Iowa wrestling will attempt to keep improving on the national level.

But there's a lot of change happen- ing in the program. Former head coach Bond Shymansky was fired after violat-ing NCAA rules, leaving Vicki Brown as the interim head coach. There are positives for the program, however. The Athletics Department is in the midst of building a new $190 mil-lion home for Iowa volleyball, which is set to open in 2020. But for now, Iowa's focus is on this season. It looked as though the team was about to break the postseason streak after it took down No. 10 Wisconsin at home on Oct. 6, 2018, but a flurry of injuries made for an agonizing crawl to the end of the season. It doesn't help that the team lost some of its highest producers to grad-uation last season; hitter Taylor Louis and Molly Kelly \u2014 both of whom paced the conference in various stats - have departed the team. But there are some bright spots that could help the program reach a postsea-son berth. Despite injuries, now-senior Cali Hoye proved to be a dominant hitter on the court. The middle section of the net was young for the team last sea-son, with freshmen Hannah Clayton and Amiya Jones starting. Youth is turning into experience for the blockers and several hitting po-sitions, so this could be the year the team gets it done. Iowa soccer posted an av- erage season in 2018, going 8-7-3, but it could be in for a big year in 2019. The Hawkeyes return six of their top seven scorers from last season, including Natalie Winters and Devin Burns. Winters led the team with 5 goals in 2018, adding 3 as-sists to that total, which was also tied for the team lead. Burns will also play a big role moving forward. She led the team with 9 goals in 5 assists in 2017, but in-juries forced her to miss a good chunk of the 2018 sea-son. Burns only played in 13 games with six starts last season. Still, she managed to net 2 goals and an assist in her limited playing time. Kaleigh Haus \u2014 who scored 4 goals last season \u2014 returns as well, but the losses of forward Rose Rips-linger and defender Morgan Kemerling won't help. Iowa found plenty of suc- cess playing at the Iowa Soc-cer Complex, sporting a 7-0-3 record in games at home, but it will need to improve its performance on the road. In games away from Iowa City, the Hawkeyes went 1-7. Iowa opened its schedule with a 4-0-1 record, show-casing what it can do early in the season. It did some-thing similar in the spring as well. Loaded with talent in its spring schedule, Iowa went 7-0, showing what it is ca-pable of. The potential for success is there. Hawkeye head coach Dave DiIanni and Company could be in for a big season in 2019. Multiple Hawkeye scorers are set to return, which will help them improve on what turned out to be a decent 2018 campaign.

Volleyball sets sights on NCAA success The Hawkeyes have struggled when it comes to making the postseason, but they're looking to change that in 2019.

The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - 101 102 - The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 Plenty of questions sur - rounded the Iowa base- ball squad entering the 2019 season. After all, it had lost its two best hit-ters, best starting pitcher, and best reliever from the season before. But with head coach Rick Heller at the helm, the Hawkeyes never strayed far from the top of the conference stand-ings. Southeastern Commu- nity College transfer Aus-tin Martin stepped up in an important way in his first year with the Black and Gold, and fellow newcomer Izaya Fullard posted some impressive numbers as well. Despite an injury to Saturday starting pitch-er Jack Dreyer, which sidelined him for the majority of the season, Iowa's weekend rotation of Cole McDonald, Cam Baumann, and Grant Judkins answered the questions entering the season. The Hawkeyes played their best baseball of the season when they got into the thick of the Big Ten schedule. After being swept by Indiana to open the conference slate, Iowa ripped off six-consecutive Big Ten series victories. The Hawkeyes will lose McDonald on the mound, as well as middle infield-ers Mitchell Boe and Tanner Wetrich. Chris Whelan, who has been one of Iowa's key leaders in recent years, will also graduate. While the senior loss- es will certainly leave a void, especially in the field, the Hawkeyes' new core should set them up for future success. High hopes for Hellerball next season After posting its sixth 30-win season in a row, Iowa baseball will focus on increasing that mark. Under the tutelage of coach Gayle Blevins, Hawkeye softball was nearly unbeatable in the late-1990s and early 2000s. After her retirement, Iowa suffered some turbulent seasons with under - whelming records. But last season, Iowa native Renee Gillispie took the helm of Iowa softball and rearmed the program with newly found enthusiasm last year. Only two seniors had spots on last season's roster, and some of the team's best talent will return to Pearl Field in the coming season, so more wins can be expected. Now a senior, pitcher Allison Doo- cy will continue to be one of the most commanding arms in the Big Ten. The right-hander had a coming-out party in her sophomore season, recording the fourth-lowest ERA in the conference. Along with that, she recorded some of the most innings pitched in the confer - ence in her junior season, proving her competence and dominance in the cir - cle. Rounding out the lineup card for Gillispie last season was transfer DoniRae Mayhew, who transferred from Kirkwood and started her Di-vision-1 career as a junior at Iowa. The now-senior led the team in several hitting categories for much of the season, showing prowess at the plate with both consistency and power. The road to a rebuilt program is a long one for Gillispie and her squad, but last season was a big steppingstone in the right direc-tion. This coming season, fans can expect more wins and excitement at Pearl Field.

Iowa cross-country has made huge strides over the past couple of years. Both the men's and women's squads had their best finishes to the season in years. The men's team finished in sixth place at the 2018 Big Ten meet, its best finish since 2009. The women also had success at Big Tens, coming in ninth in the 6,000 meters, their highest finish since 2011. Some of the catalysts behind that success will be lost to graduation heading into next season, which will be tough for the Hawkeyes. Daniel Soto will be a key loss for the men's squad. He led the team in the first three races of the 2018 sea-son and finished strong with a ca-reer-best in the 8,000 meters at the Big Ten meet. Andrea Shine led the women in the 6,000 meters in her senior season, placing 15th overall at the Big Ten Championships. Despite losing some of its key per - formers who have paced the program for a long time, Iowa cross-country should still be in a position to suc-ceed heading into the 2019 season, with Mylenek leading the way. He finished 11th in the 8,000 me- ters at Big Ten Championships, earn-ing All-Big Ten honors. He then fin-ished third at the NCAA regional and became the first Hawkeye to advance to the NCAA finals since 2011. In 2019, Mylenek will want to im- prove on his already impressive ca-reer and finish even higher.Hawkeyes running into the new season Katie Goodale/The Daily Iowan Junior Nathan Mylenek runs in the middle of the pack during the Hawkeye Invitational at Ashton Cross Country course on Aug. 31, 2018. Mylenek will lead the cross-country pack in 2019. Iowa track and field will attempt to continue to build off its past success after an impressive 2018-19 season. The 2018-19 track and field sea- son was one to remember for Iowa. The indoor campaign ended with the men's and women's squads com-bining for 14 All-American honors and 11 Big Ten titles. The highlights of the outdoor season were the Big Ten Outdoor Championships, which was hosted by the Hawkeyes at the Cretzmeyertrack and the Iowa men won, as well as Laulauga Tausaga's na-tional title in the discus. Heading into next season, Iowa will lose a few key contributors to graduation but will maintain a very talented group at the same time. Mar'Yea Harris and Brianna Guil- lory were some of the most accom-plished sprinters in program history in their time here. Their Hawkeye ca-reers ended at the conclusion of the 2019 season. Leading Iowa into the new season will be Tausaga, an All-American and national champion thrower who is among the best in the country. Coming off a season in which she broke school records in all three women's throwing events and was named Regional Field Athlete of the Year, Tausaga will try to keep adding to her illustrious Hawkeye r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in her senior season. Also returning for the Hawkeyes will be Jaylan McConico and Jenny Kimbro, both of whom became Big Ten champi-ons in the indoor 60-meter hurdles. With plenty of talent returning, Io- wa boasts plenty of potential heading into the new season.

The three standouts were Matthew Walker, Alex Schaake, and Benton Wein-berg. All three of their best performances came in the Hawkeye Invitational in which Walker and Schaake tied as champions with overall scores of 14-under. Weinberg finished tied for third at 10-under. Schaake, the Big Ten's Golfer of the Year, was by far the most impressive golfer, fin-ishing with two other top-five finishes in addition to the Hawkeye Invitational. He will be back next season for what will likely be another solid campaign. Walker, however, will graduate. He also had several top-10 finishes this past season, and he will hang up his clubs af-ter an incredibly consistent Hawkeye career. Sophomore Joe Kim will try to make big-ger contributions to next season's team as will Weinberg, who will be a senior along with Schaake. The women had to start last season after losing one of their premier golfers in Jes-sica Ip. The Hawkeyes started off slowly but reached their high point at the Diane Thom-ason Invitational \u2014 they came out on top. Shawn Rennegarbe won a share of the individual title (5-over), and Manuela Liz-arazu and Kristin Glesne finished third and fourth. The future is bright for the Hawkeye women \u2014 they will return Stephanie Her - zog, Sophie Liu, Sarah Overton, and Liz-arazu, all of whom played significant roles last season. Iowa, however, will miss the leadership of Rennegarbe, who will graduate after two extremely productive years with the team.The Iowa rowing team faced numerous weath-er problems last season, ranging from canceled events to not being able to be in the boathouse from September to mid-April. Nonetheless, the team had some success, most of it coming from the 1 Varsity 8 boat. The boat comprises Contessa Harold, Hunt-er Koenigsfeld, Hannah Greenlee, Eve Stewart, son, Elena Waiglein, Paige Schlapkohl, and cox-swain Logan Jones. The latter two \u2014 Schlaokohl and Jones \u2014 were the se-niors of the crew. But the Hawkeyes will still have two All-Americans \u2014 Har - old and Koenigsfeld \u2014 to lead the boat to victory. These two, along with Greenlee, have been in-vited to the U23 national team camp, where they will try to snag a spot on the national team and compete in the 2019 World Rowing Under 23 Championships. As the team uses the knowledge of its experi-enced and talented rowers, it will also hope for im-provement among the new-comers. The Iowa rowing squad has found ways to uti-lize homegrown athletes despite the state's high schools not offering rowing. The Hawkeyes also boast plenty of international tal-ent, however, with eight athletes coming from coun-tries outsude of the United States. After a solid performance all season, the Hawkeyes will try to improve at the Big Ten Championships in 2020. Iowa rowing the boat nationally The Hawkeyes \u2014 especially their 1 Varsity 8 boat \u2014 have become a squad to watch in the conference.

The Hawkeyes are set to lose only its lone senior, Adorabol Huckleby. In her final season, she was in and out of the lineup, starting mostly at the lower spots in both singles and doubles. As for the returners, this past years' team was young and inexperienced with five new-comers. Junior Elise van Huevelen Tread-well led the team at Nos. 1 and 2 in singles and doubles all season. However, newcomers Ashleigh Jacobs and Sophie Clark did the most damage. Between Nos. 3 and 4, Jacobs led the team with the best record, going 12-6, and Clark was right behind her at 11-8. Overall, this season was far from a disap- pointment because the incoming Hawkeyes showed they can be competitive against any team. Their best victory came against Indiana, 4-3, on March 31. As this team progresses, it will be more competitive as its underclassmen gain more experience. The Iowa men's tennis team conclud- ed its season 17-9, 6-5 in the Big Ten. The Hawkeyes secured its third winning season in the last five years, mainly because of its strong 14-2 home record. However, Iowa will lose one of its main contributors in lone senior Jonas Larsen. He concluded his season 9-12 in top-spot singles and 15-8 in top-two doubles play. Freshmen Oliver Okonkwo and Nikita Snezhko contributed a great deal to Iowa's success. Okonkwo put up a 15-6 doubles re-cord with sophomore Will Davies at Nos. 1 and 2 and added an 18-7 record in singles, including a victory over No. 1 Ohio State in singles. Now-senior Kareem Allaf will try to im- prove on his new program-best 14 home victories because the Hawkeyes return five starters from last season and seek to be-come one of the top teams in the Big Ten. Despite losing in its first match of the tour - nament last season, the Iowa field-hockey team qualified for the NCAA tourney for the first time since 2012. The Hawkeyes went 14-7, winning the most games they've won in a season since 2011. Io-wa notched six wins over top-25 opponents, topping No. 14 Wake Forest, No. 25 California, No. 23 Ohio State, No. 21 Stanford, No. 6/7 Penn State, and No. 7 Michigan. The Hawkeyes had suc- cess behind All-Americans Maddy Murphy and Murphy was Iowa's leading scorer (13), and Birch led the team in as-sists (10). Murphy and Birch played huge roles for the Hawkeyes offensively. Defensively, the Hawkeyes turned to Anthe Lokke Stribos, and Leslie Speight. Speight led the Big Ten in shutouts with seven. In 21 games, only 23 goals were scored on Iowa, giv-ing it the sixth-best goals-against average in the na-tion. Iowa will return nine of 11 starters \u2014 Makenna Grewe and Brown grad-uated. Goalkeeper Grace McGuire \u2014 who was Iowa's original starting keeper last season \u2014 did not play be-cause of an injury, but she will be back next season. The squad placed second at the Big Ten Tourna-ment, becoming the first ever No. 6 seed to advance to the championship game. The Hawkeyes will try to top the conference this coming season with their returning talent. With their young talent continually gaining experience, the Hawkeyes want to make a move in the Big Ten.

Every Saturday in the fall, the stands will be packed with around 69,000 fans anxiously awaiting \"Back in Black\" to come on the PA system. Kinnick served as a relatively safe space for the Iowa football squad last season. The Hawkeyes posted a 5-2 re-cord in the friendly confines of Kinn-ick, compared with a 3-2 record on the road. The stadium is also home to one of the best traditions in college foot-ball: the Kinnick Wave. Fans, players, coaches, and referees turn around at the end of the first quarter of each game to wave to the children in the UI Stead Family Children's Hospital, whose top floors overlook the stadium. In addition to the relatively new tradition, Kinnick has become a diffi-cult place for ranked teams to come in and escape with a win. The Hawkeyes are 4-1 against top-five opponents since 2008, with two of those victories occurring in the past three seasons. Kinnick will look different in 2019 as well. As part of the north end zone renovation, it will have a new con-course, Jumbotron, restrooms, conces-sion stands, and premium seats. Iowa will face Miami (Ohio), Rut- gers, Middle Tennessee State, Penn State, Purdue, Minnesota, and Illi-nois at home as it tries to keep its hot stretch at Kinnick going. Kinnick Stadium certainly deserves all the praise for being the most im-portant place on campus for Iowa fans in the fall. When the Iowa temperatures inev- itably drop, the sanctuary for Hawk-eye fans goes down the road to Carv-er-Hawkeye Arena. The facility opened in early 1983 and is now the home of men's and women's basketball, wrestling, volley-ball, and gymnastics. Last year, Carver was rocking during several home basketball games for both the men's and women's squads. It was also the home to the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament for the Hawkeye women in which Carv-er-Hawkeye broke the record for the most attended venue in the first two rounds of the NCAA Women's Tourna-ment. Wrestling has also seen its fair share of sellouts. After all, the state of Iowa loves its wrestling. Carver-Hawkeye is more versatile than existing as just a sporting ven-ue. It has been home to famed musi-cal artists such as Whitney Houston, Metallica, Guns 'N' Roses, and Old Dominion. It has also hosted former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and was home to World Wrestling Enter - tainment events from 2011-13. Also the site for some graduation ceremonies, Carver-Hawkeye is an in-tegral part of the UI campus.The hubs for Hawkeye sports Kinnick Stadium and Carver-Hawkeye Arena are home to a multitude of Hawkeye sports throughout the year.

Ryan Adams/The Daily Iowan Iowa's Tanner Nelson competes in the 200-meter breaststroke during finals of the Big Ten Swimming Championships on March 2. Iowa men's swimming and diving hosted the Big Ten Championships in the Campus Recreation & Wellness Center last season, but the team didn't bring home much hardware despite nu-merous accolades. This season, both the men and the women have goals set higher, and this will, they hope, bring home much-de-sired conference crowns. Many indi-vidual performances warrant a lot of excitement for the squad, including some young members of the team who should keep it strong for several years. To start, all of Iowa's divers wiggled their way into the NCAA Zone D Div-ing Championships last season. Of the nine Hawkeye divers to make the trip, only two of them were graduating se-niors; on the men's side, Anton Hoherz and Jonathan Posligua will return, along with Jayah Mathews, Thelma Strandberg, Sam Tamborski, Jolynn Harris, and Claire Park on the wom-en's side. Iowa was dominant in many events on the swimming side all season, pav-ing the way for some solid finishes. Dominance in the freestyle events oc-curred all season; the men's team had at least one swimmer with NCAA qual-ifying times in every event but the 200 individual medley and the 100 fly. Depth certainly applies to both teams, and this is what they will bank on heading into this season. Iowa making waves in the Big Ten UI men and women's swimming and diving set the bar higher going in the upcoming season.The Daily Iowan - HAWKEYE VIEW - Iowa City, Iowa - Thursday, August 29, 2019 - 111 319-499-1041 513 WASHINGTON ST.
