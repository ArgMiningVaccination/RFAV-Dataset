Capsule: Cellulose & Water Information: Energy is an intelligent healthy booster with a unique combination of plant-based Ultra Minerals and Apple Extracts.* Energy increases our production of ATP, an important molecule that energizes and fuels every metabolic process in our body.* The combination of Ultra Minerals and Apple Extracts deliver powerful polyphenols and a full spectrum of important plant-based elements and minerals, most of which are absent from foods and supplements currently on the market. One capsule a day for energy and endurance.* Energy is plant-based (vegan) and has kosher, gluten free, organic, and Non-GMO ingredients. Suggested Use: ENERGY (Ultra Minerals with Apple Extract)\u2014 Energy is designed with plant minerals and apple extract to increase energy levels and vitality in the body.* Energy: Clinical trials show 1-2 capsules before exercise increases endurance strength and stamina. Take in the morning and if needed, repeat in the afternoon. For an energy boost, take 1 capsule of each High ORAC, Fructo Borate and Phyto Power.* Minerals: Energy is a great nutritional product filled with 72 plant-based ultra minerals that are no longer available in our soil and therefore missing in our foods.* Our Favorite: Energy is one of Michael's favorite products, along with the Fructo Borate and Chromium. He strongly advocates for more mineral supplementation due to our depleted soil. His morning routine includes all three products taken along with 1 capsule each of Cranberry Pomegranate (for prostate health), Blueberry Extract (brain), Glucosinolates & Sulforaphanes (for DNA cellular integrity - protection), and 1 teaspoon of the No 7 mixed with water. He then begins his workout routine!* The Research: Energy is an intelligent healthy booster. With a unique combination of 72 plant-based Ultra Minerals and Apple Extracts, Energy increases our production of ATP, an important molecule that energizes and fuels every metabolic process in our body.* What is ATP? Adenosine-5'-triphosphate or ATP is known as a primary intracellular energy source in our body (Wilson et al., 2013). ATP and its metabolites are also involved in various important functions in the body, such as cardiac function, neurotransmission, blood flow, and muscle contraction and strength (Joy et al., 2015; Rathmacher et al., 2012; Jordan et al., 2004). In essence, having adequate ATP levels in the blood is correlated with improved health and performance (Herda et al., 2008). ATP is a vital molecule for good health, yet clinical results with synthetic ATP supplementation were mixed (Jordan et al., 2004). Reyes-Izquirdo et al. (2013; 2014; Joy et al., 2016) set out to examine a food-based source that can indirectly increase endogenous ATP levels: they used a combination mix of apple extracts and plant ultra-minerals from Mesozoic Vegetate (see more below on Ultra Minerals). In both clinical trials, Reyes-Izquirdo et al. found a considerable increase in ATP levels and overall energy and strength in the body, compared with placebo (2013; 2014).* Moreover, the combination of ultra-minerals and apple extracts significantly boosted the body's ability to exercise longer and harder. The trials utilized a 150mg dosage of the mix and showed blood ATP increased by 40% at 60 minutes following ingestion and dropped 28% at 120 minutes following ingestion. Muscle biopsy was also performed to show an 281% increase of ATP levels in muscle tissue at 60 minutes, and 433% at 120 minutes following ingestion (Reyes-Izquirdo et al., 2014). Even more promising, the natural food-based mix of apple extracts and ultra-minerals were shown to decrease reactive oxygen species (Reyes-Izquirdo et al., 2013). Typically, ATP production increases the levels of reactive oxygen species which is pro-inflammatory (Chang et al., 2010), but the plant-based mix of ultra minerals and apple extracts' phenols serve as anti-inflammatory agents, reducing inflammation markers in the blood. This clinical finding is important as Energy can be used to enhance exercise and endurance performance and at the same time to reduce inflammation that is common when exercising, and more so when over-exercising (Joy et al., 2016; Swamy et al., 2011).* Ultra-Minerals is a unique blend of 72 cold-water extracted plant-based minerals. Derived from deeply buried flora and plants dated back to the ancient Mesozoic Era, the ultra-minerals deliver a full spectrum of important elements and trace minerals, most of which are absent from foods and supplements currently on the market.* Minerals and ultra (or trace) minerals are essential nutrients for human health (Davidson, 2017), playing a central role in regulating cardiovascular function (Mohammadifard et al., 2017), metabolic functions, internal antioxidant defense mechanism, bone formation, immune function, and much more (Pappas et al., 2018). The soil lacks many nutrients, in particular minerals and trace minerals, all due to ongoing poor farming methods, overuse of herbicides and pesticides, mono crops, inadequate fertilizers, and other shortsighted agricultural practices.* Finding rich sources of nutrients has become difficult as our oceans, lakes and rivers are also polluted. Rock sourced minerals can also present some toxicity issues as well as low absorption rates (Pappas et al., 2018). The ancient plant-based properties of our Ultra Minerals are unique: they are excavated from deep within the earth where lush plants belonging to tropical forests existed. These amazing deposits of Mesozoic Vegetate from nutrients-dense rain forests are full of nutrients that we extract with cold water and then dehydrated. The ultra-minerals are wholesome, readily available, and easily digested and absorbed.* Apple and apple extracts are associated with numerous health benefits (Hyson, 2011), including longevity, cognition, and energy (Hodgson et al., 2016; Flanagan et al., 2016, respectively). As an energy booster, apple is found to be as energizing as coffee! In fact, apples offer equivalent energy as caffeinated drinks. More so, due to the different polyphenols in apples, athletes and sports players enjoy improved endurance during intense exercise while keeping their muscles flexible and pain free (Deley et al., 2017; Flanagan et al., 2016).* Antioxidants and polyphenols have shown in research to reduce oxidative stress created by exercise (Morillas-Ruiz et al., 2006). Over the years, clinical trials have focused on the ability of apples and apple extracts to reduce inflammation of joints and increase joint function for a greater range of motion (Jensen et al., 2014).* Scientists view apple's polyphenols as excellent anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory properties in improving inflammatory bowel disease (Denis et al, 2016; Pastrelo et al., 2017). Moreover, apple is found to exhibit anti-microbial effect, reducing microbial growth in beef, pork, and turkey, and protecting against carcinogens during heat processing of beef (Jensen et al., 2016; Sabally et al., 2016). Apple's many attributes are associated with beneficial effects on conditions from anti-carcinogenic (Tu et al., 2017), cardiovascular (Bondonno et al., 2017), to asthma (Sawyer et al., 2017), to cognition "}
