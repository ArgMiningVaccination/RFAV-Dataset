These symptoms can be a sign that your body is making antibodies against the virus. One common side effect is a red, itchy, warm, painful, swollen rash on the arm where you got the shot. This rash, which can be large, is also known as \"COVID arm.\" It may develop a few days to a week after getting the vaccine. While it may be uncomfortable, this reaction is harmless. You can take an antihistamine or an over-the-counter pain medicine to relieve itching and pain. Even if you have a rash after vaccination, it is important to get further shots as needed. If you are scheduled for a second shot, you may want to get it in the other arm or see if an alternative vaccine is available. Review Date 2/22/2023 Updated by: Frank D.
