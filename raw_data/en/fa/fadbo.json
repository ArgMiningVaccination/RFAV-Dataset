Adding kiwi to your daily diet, may help improve your health in many ways. Kiwi contains antioxidants such as vitamin C, which supports the immune system and promotes healthy skin.

There are many ways to add kiwi to your diet: enjoy the fruit sliced or chopped in salads, as an embellishment to entrees, or use in baking muffins and breads.
