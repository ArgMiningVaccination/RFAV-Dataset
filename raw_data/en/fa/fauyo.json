Analysis of a recent survey shows just how popular the Register is, with 94 per cent of responses (which came from alumni, students and current and former Fellows) rating it either good or excellent. Andrew has juggled editing the Register with pursuing research and his responsibilities as Chaplain, Chattels Fellow, Dean of Degrees and Welfare Coordinator and, after six editions, he has decided the time has come to lay down his red pen. I'd like to thank him for his excellent work on those editions and for his support when handing me the reins. I will now work with a small advisory board, including the Rector and chaired by Emeritus Fellow in English Dr Helen Leith Spencer, to shape future editions of the Register. For 10 years or so I have helped to collate, typeset and distribute the Register , so it is by no means new to me, but on becoming editor I wanted to enhance my understanding of the publication's purpose and how it is regarded by readers. I liaised with the Register advisory board, spoke with many members of College, including former editors of the Register , and analysed responses to the publication survey mentioned above. It is, I think it accurate to say, first and foremost a record of Exeter's academic year. That has immediate interest and value, and helps keep members of the Exeter community around the world updated on College news and hopefully maintain bonds between the College, its members and alumni. It also creates a record of enormous historic value, as former editor John Maddicott (Emeritus Fellow in History) and College Archivist Penny Baker both impressed upon me. Indeed, in my role as Head of Communications I have often consulted old editions of the Register to obtain valuable information about former Fellows, the history of College buildings and gardens, past events and even pieces of College folklore (see, for example, 'Some Exeter Ghosts', Register 2003). It has therefore been my primary intention when commissioning articles for this edition of the Register to create a record of Exeter's academic year 2020/21, which, as we continue to contend with the extraordinary challenges of Covid-19, seems especially important at the moment. I hope after leafing through this edition you will feel up to speed with recent events in College and a little bit closer to the College and College community, wherever you are reading this. 3A call for content Responses to the recent publication survey showed that, on the whole, people are very satisfied with the balance of news from College, our students and Fellows. Where appetite for change was strongest was in the amount of news we share from alumni, with around 44% wishing to see more alumni news and only 3% preferring to see less. People noted that alumni news could take many forms. It could be an article about an area of interest or expertise, but it might as easily be a couple of sentences updating readers on events in their life. Looking at similar publications produced by other Oxford colleges, I see it is not uncommon to have a section where people can share such updates. Perhaps you have moved house, or retired, or become a grandparent, or celebrated a major anniversary, or walked a child down the aisle, or tied the knot yourself. Perhaps you changed jobs, had a book accepted for publication, won election to your local council, received an award for your professional or voluntary work, or lifted a trophy. It would be nice to share such updates, as other colleges do, and help keep the Exeter community in touch with one another's milestones, big and small. News of weddings, civil partnerships and births would be particularly welcome, as the Register already contains sections for these to be recorded, but the lists are sometimes on the light side. Another suggestion I received is that alumni might like to share reminiscences from their time at Exeter. As well as fascinating in their own right, these can add to the value of the Register as a rich resource for the College archive. It might be an article or essay about your years at Exeter, or it might be a few sentences on a single moment or a particular memory. This edition of the Register contains the late Tony Moreton's (1952, PPE) colourful recollections of playing 'Busters' Cricket. It also contains a poem by Omar Sabbagh (1999, PPE), Twenty Years in the Making, inspired by his time at Exeter. Perhaps you have similar thoughts and memories you would like to share. College food during rationing; or a particularly fine feast one year. Kindly scouts or an unforgettable tutor. The opening of a new building, the winter of '63, rowing in the first ever women's VIII or taking to the rugby pitch in the College's first women's XV . Not that such reminiscences have to capture inaugural moments. Maybe you recall a blackout. Maybe it's the repetitiveness of aspects of your time in Oxford that stands out. The hours spent in the Library or the cold, misty mornings on the Thames. The day you stood for JCR president. The day you bumped into John Thaw, or Kevin Whately, or Shaun Evans in the Front Quad. Rector's Collections. Painting on the Mound. Your own run-in with a College ghost! Long or short, profound or ordinary, it would be interesting to read about your time at Exeter. If you have something you would like to share - an article, a poem, an update, an idea, a recollection, a photograph - please get in touch. You can email comms@exeter.ox.ac.uk or write to Matthew Baldwin, Head of Communications, Exeter College, Turl Street, Oxford, OX1 3DP. Thank you. Matthew Baldwin4From the Rector The pandemic, inevitably, played a key role in academic year 2020/21 at Exeter. Covid-19 greatly disrupted life in the College, especially during Hilary Term. However, many elements of 'normality' survived, and the College community came through the experience with its unity, strategic direction and determination intact. The shifting nature of the disease, and of Government (and University) regulations for coping with it, produced significant contrasts among the three terms. Michaelmas started with the large majority of students, both undergraduates and postgraduates, in Oxford, albeit operating under tight restrictions on social interaction. These inhibitions increased as regulations tightened during the last weeks of term. Then came the sudden imposition of a further lockdown in January. As a result many Exeter students spent Hilary Term elsewhere, though the presence in Oxford of research postgraduates, many overseas students, and undergraduates with private accommodation or special needs avoided the almost total emptiness of Trinity Term 2020. The gradual easing of regulations - starting late in Hilary Term, with further instalments during the Easter Vacation and Trinity Term 2021 - meant that, from mid-May the large majority of Exeter students were present in Oxford, often remaining in College during the first two weeks of the Long Vacation. The Fellows, staff and students of Exeter devoted a great deal of care and energy to coping with these multiple shifts of policy and regulations. The student 'household' was key to eating and to social occasions, and the Sub-Rector and junior deans became expert in promulgating and enforcing regulations which in normal times would have seemed unduly restrictive. Only toward the end of Trinity Term did anything like normal conditions prevail, and by that time special attention was needed to prevent Exeter's full participation in the upsurge of infections associated with 'Variant D'. The welfare team were very busy throughout 2020/21, especially during Michaelmas Term when for a few weeks Exeter had many students isolating (with meals delivered to their rooms) either because they were infected or because a member of their household had tested positive for Covid. 5Yet this bare chronology of Exeter's pandemic makes the year seem far grimmer than it was in practice. Admittedly there were many privations, even for those who escaped isolation. The MCR and JCR were closed as social spaces for most of the academic year; special occasions such as Diwali, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Burns Night and Chinese New Year could not be celebrated in Hall; 'bops' and nightclub outings were taboo; extracurricular activities were often shadows of their normal selves; many members of staff were furloughed, especially in Hilary Term; the great bulk of conference and events income was lost; many Fellows had to conduct home schooling as well as give tutorials; College meetings were uniformly online; the Ball was postponed for the second year in a row; no graduations occurred except in absentia; exams had to be written on computers in student rooms; and much teaching had to take place through Microsoft Teams. Nonetheless, Exeter found many ways to cope. Ten socially distanced freshers' dinners were held (five each for undergraduates and postgraduates); the catering staff provided specially themed and decorated takeaway meals for festival occasions; a Marquee in Front Quad served as a place to eat when the Hall was closed, and to socialise throughout the year; the JCR and MCR staged ingenious virtual social events until the partial easing of restrictions in Trinity Term allowed carefully regulated events such as Schools Dinners to resume; the librarians ran efficient borrowing and copying services, including during periods when the College Library was closed as a study space; online Chapel services reached unprecedentedly large congregations while in-person services (when permitted) preserved the usual high standard of preaching and music despite the wearing of masks; Lateral Flow Device testing kits were readily available in College; and online Rector's Collections and graduate review sessions revealed that a great deal of productive academic work had occurred. A spectacular example was the achievement of Tabitha Thornton-Swan (2018, Medical Sciences) in winning the national George Lewith Prize for General Practice for her Final Honours School Research Project on undiagnosed diabetes. Exeter students also won a number of University prizes. Three particular occasions in Trinity Term demonstrated how the College was able to cope by the end of the academic year: Ascension Day Matins was held in the splendid if slightly soggy setting of the Mound; JCR and MCR sit-down bar nights took place in the well-ventilated Marquee; and a served, socially distanced dinner for the MCR flourished on a balmy evening in the splendid setting of the Fellows' Garden. Moreover, coping with the pandemic during 2020/21 took a form at Exeter which preserved the long-standing cohesion of the College. Exeter's version of the Oxford-wide Covid-19 Action Group (the 'CV Group') had an especially broad composition, including a variety of administrators and (uniquely, it seems) student leaders as full members. The CV Group met often - conducting its business in a complementary fashion to Governing Body and its committees. Also, a multitude of informal conversations took place as the College 'fine-tuned' its approach to Covid-19. There were, of course, stresses and strains, 6 Staff, Fellows and students took part in the Oxford Town and Gown charity fun runA Marquee in Front Quad facilitated social distancing7especially for students at home, often overseas, for long periods. But overall a cheerful stoicism characterised the approach of Fellows, staff and students alike. Partly as a result, the College was able to make considerable progress, during 2020/21, on a range of issues quite apart from the pandemic. The College's simplified and modernised new Statutes were successfully submitted to the University, and the Privy Council approved them for use from Michaelmas Term 2021. With regard to admissions, although much remained to be done, the College continued its progress of recent years in diversifying its UK undergraduate intake (as indicated by Exeter's standing in the relevant annual University report). The College also made plans to extend its bridging programme, Exeter Plus, to year-round operation and took advantage of an Oxford-wide reorganisation to extend its outreach activities from Devon and Cornwall to Somerset, Bristol and parts of London. Aided by alumni generosity, improvements were made to student support arrangements, both for the special needs of the pandemic and on an ongoing basis. Not least important, the newly arrived Finance and Estates Bursar, Nick Badman, led major changes to College finances; this process profitably reorganised the College's moderate indebtedness while altering, with an eye to more rapid growth of the endowment, the way that the College manages its investments. During 2020/21 Exeter also accelerated its environmental initiatives under the leadership of Domestic Bursar Babis Karakoulas. Encouraged by enthusiasm throughout the College, not least from students, Exeter pursued projects to reduce both heat consumption and the production of solid waste. The College also launched a philanthropically-funded carbon offset project which mobilised students, staff and Fellows in choosing 'green' causes to sponsor. Buoyed by the Civic Trust award won by Cohen Quad, Exeter also devoted considerable attention to the College's sites. Much preventive maintenance occurred during the periods when there were few students in residence. Also, the Governing Body approved a scheme for the renovation of the Porters' Lodge. By spring 2022 this project will improve working conditions, provide wheelchair access, and enable Exeter, during 'business hours', to open the outer wooden gates on Turl Street which for so long have obscured from many passers-by that there is a college inside! Even more significantly, the City of Oxford and Exeter's Governing Body approved designs for the long-postponed restoration and renovation of the heavily-used and much-loved College Library. The result will be: additional reader spaces; up-to-date working conditions for students and staff; lift access to the whole building; and the return of this very special structure, inside and out, to its original Victorian glory. The Library project is the focus of the current special appeal to alumni and friends of the College to raise the money needed to supplement donations already raised and support pledged by the Governing Body.8Just as much College business occurred despite the pandemic, much 'normal' Exeter activity in other spheres survived the disruption of Covid-19. In addition to their many academic achievements, which included a number of publications, Exeter's students found ways to distinguish themselves. This proved literally true when the MCR and JCR collaborated to produce handsome jackets and hats ('stash') sporting the College coat of arms. There was a massive take-up, including within the Rector's Lodgings! Graduate student Nick Saunders (2019, EMBA) coordinated the venture, capping a year in which he had also participated in Oxford's Varsity golf victory. Another example of entrepreneurial impact was Chenyu Zhang's (2020, Williams) captaining of an Exeter team to considerable success in the Oxford- wide All Innovate competition. With regard to sport, further distinction came when Costi Levy (2019, Philosophy and Modern Languages) coxed valiantly, if ultimately unsuccessfully, for Oxford in the women's Boat Race. Sport combined with philanthropy in June when the College's student charity ExVac met its goal of raising over \u00a32,000 for children's holidays by sponsoring more than fifty Exeter staff and student participants in Oxford's Town and Gown 10k race. A number of Exeter students played notable roles in Black History Month in October 2020 and in the College's Black Lives Matter Working Group throughout the academic year. For example, Amgad Salih (2020, Economics and Management) was featured for having co-founded the Black Excellence Network, a mentorship scheme for aspirational black students going into higher education, and Deborah Ogunnoiki (2020, Classics) was nominated for her work setting up an African and Caribbean Society at her secondary school. Safa Sadozai (2018, History) displayed leadership in a different sphere by winning election as Vice-President (Access and Academic Affairs) of the Oxford Students Union. Also, Grace Wheeler (2019, Medicine) became President of the College's relaunched medical society, renamed the Bannister Society, in memory of Sir Roger (1946, Physiological Sciences), of whom more below. Some illustrious student activity concerned the pandemic itself. For example, Alexandra Vasilyeva (2018, Engineering) co-led a project to provide information about Covid-19 to people whose English is limited. Pandemic-related work also attracted alumni such as David Thomas (2008, PPE), who was awarded the OBE in the Covid-delayed Queen's Birthday Honours List for his work in founding the Oak National Academy to provide free online lessons for school pupils during the pandemic. Many Exeter alumni distinguished themselves in other spheres during 2020/21. Among many possible examples are Kenneth Mwenda (1992, BCL), a long-serving high official of the World Bank, who received Zambia's highest civilian honour, and Mavis Chionh (1988, Jurisprudence), who became a High Court judge in Singapore. Peter Mann (1971, English), chairman of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society, received an MBE for services to the Commonwealth Community in Hong Kong and Asia; and Professor Kathleen Stock (1991, Philosophy and Modern Languages), then professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex, received an OBE for services to higher education. Entrepreneurial activity flourished among Exonians, as in the 9fintech advisory firm Ammonite, co-founded by alumna Caroline Duff (2003, Physics and Philosophy), which was selected for the Oxford Foundry accelerator programme. The cultural sphere, too, saw considerable alumni achievement. For example, Zerlina Vulliamy (2017, Music) overcame the constraints that Covid-19 has imposed on the performing arts by launching an online series, Opera in Conversation, in connection with her new organisation Oxford Contemporary Opera. And many Exonians responded generously to the College's first ever Giving Day, in November, which raised over \u00a350,000 and attracted almost 400 donors, especially (though by no means only) from individuals who had graduated in recent years. I also note, among many substantial recent publications by alumni, Lord (Stephen) Green's (1966, PPE, and an Honorary Fellow) co-authored Unwritten Rule: How to Fix the British Constitution (Haus). The pandemic meant that gaudies, and the usual alumni events in London, East Asia, and North America could not take place. However, a series of well subscribed Exeter Webinars (featured in a separate article in the Register ) took their place. Several of the talks were provided by alumni themselves, notably Lord Green, Sir Ronald Cohen (1964, PPE), Professor Joseph Nye (1958, PPE), General Sir Richard Shirreff (1974, Modern History), and David Webb (1983, Mathematics). Exeter's Fellows also distinguished themselves in many ways during 2020/21 despite unusually heavy caring, teaching, and pastoral duties. Most notable was the stellar work of Senior Research Fellow Professor Cath Green, appointed OBE in the Birthday Honours list for her key contribution to the development of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. Cath also published in July, with Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert, Vaxxers: The Inside Story of the Oxford AstraZeneca Vaccine and the Race Against the Virus (Hodder and Stoughton), a book promoted by Exonian Neil Blair (1986, Jurisprudence) which became a best seller and was serialised on BBC Radio 4. Other distinctions for Fellows included: a Fellowship of the Royal Society for Emeritus Professor Frank Close, membership of the European Molecular Biology Organisation (EMBO) for Professor Ervin Fodor (Biology), the University's Recognition of Distinction for Professor Garret Cotter (Physics), the biennial Chabod Prize for the best book in Italian History for Professor Giuseppe Marcocci (History), the UK Government's nomination of Professor Dapo Akande (Law) for the UN Law Commission, and the honorary doctorate of the Weizmann Institute of Science for Professor Dame Carol Robinson (Chemistry). Sir Antonio Pappano (Honorary Fellow) was named the next Chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, and Professor Nandini Das (English) was appointed Vice President of the Hakluyt Society, the first South Asian and the first person of colour to hold the position in the Society' s 175-year history. I also note, gratefully, the contributions by Fellows to Webinars and to Subject Family Dinners (the latter, alas, virtual, during 2020/21): Dr Francis Bischoff (Mathematics), Professor Luciano Floridi (Ethics of Information), Professor Jonathan Herring (Law), Professor Neil Herring (Medicine), Professor Philip Kukura (Chemistry), Dr Conall 10 Clockwise from Professor Mike Osborne (Engineering), Dr Dexnell Peters (History), Professor Dan Quigley (Economics), and Professor Andrew Steane (Physics). The College inducted only a single new Fellow during the academic year - Finance and Estates Bursar Nick Badman MA ACA. Yet, as noted above, he had a major positive impact on the College finances during his first several months in post. Quantitatively, 2020/21 was also a lean year for new Visiting Fellows. However, the three who arrived each made a major impact despite the pandemic. Impressive presentations were made to Senior Common Room Domus evenings by Ladan Niayesh (Professor of Early Modern Studies at the University of Paris) and by classicist and political theorist Mark Fisher (Assistant Professor of Government at Georgetown University). Another key arrival was that of Steve Swoap, Director of the Williams at Exeter Programme at Oxford (WEPO) and Howard B. Schow '50 and Nan W. Schow Professor of Biology at Williams College. Steve served on the College's CV Group and played a major part in keeping the WEPO programme going despite the pandemic. Other important transitions included farewells to three Fellows. Dr Katherine Bull (Staines Medical Research Fellow) enhanced the research, the governance and the health of the College during her three years at Exeter. Dr Dexnell Peters was also active in governance, taught Exeter and Williams students in an innovative fashion, pursued his own important research in Atlantic history, and directed Exeter's Legacies of Slavery project. Happily Katherine and Dexnell were elected to the new category of Supernumerary Fellow. Another major loss was that of Professor Karin Sigloch, Tutorial Fellow and Associate Professor in Earth Sciences, a key researcher in her field of oceanography, who left Exeter for a promoted post with the CNRS in France after several years of major positive impact in the College. Among Karin's many important contributions were two stints in the onerous role of Sub- Rector. With regard to the holding of college offices by academic Fellows, I also note that Professor Jane Hiddleston (French) is laying down her much appreciated multi-year responsibilities as Welfare Dean, a post of particular intensity and importance during the pandemic. It's also a pleasure to recognise the valuable contributions of philosophy Fellow Dr Rachel Fraser (as Acting Senior Tutor) and physics Fellow Professor Garret Cotter (as Acting Tutor for Graduates) during Trinity Term 2021. Not least, I thank the departing members of another category of particular importance during Covid-19, the junior deans - Gabriela Minden, Marco Bodnar and Cristina Dimutru. The key services of these individuals must not, however, disguise the extent to which Exeter's negotiation of the pandemic during the academic year was a team effort to which a vast number of individuals, in all categories of association with the College, made valuable contributions. After an academic year which featured College commemoration of the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, I now turn to other permanent farewells, i.e. to former Fellows 12and alumni. The Fellows were: Emeritus Professor Cyril Mango, Bywater and Sotheby Chair of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature 1973-95, a great expert on Constantinople; the Rev'd Graham Shaw (Chaplain 1978-85), famed for his sermons and his pastoral care for students; and Emeritus Fellow and sometime Sub- Rector Dr Dominic Donnelly (1958, Mathematics; Tutor in Maths 1970-2004), a long- time resident of the College who did not lose his interest in Exeter during retirement. Among many alumni deaths I note those of David Wright (1952, Music), a celebrated organist both at Exeter and for decades afterward in England's Boston; Robin Wallace (1955, Medicine), a paediatrician who distinguished himself by opening up sailing in previously nautically exclusive Newport, Rhode Island; and Roger Horrell (1955, Modern History), a diplomat who played a key role in the transition from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe and also served at MI6. A spectacular occasion associated with an especially famous deceased Exonian occurred in late September when Westminster Abbey unveiled a memorial tablet, in Scientists' Corner, to Sir Roger Bannister, honouring his achievements both as an innovative neurologist and as a champion athlete. The day's events had many echoes of Exeter, in which Sir Roger's strong interest never waned. His sons Clive (1977, PPE) and Thurstan (1979, PPE) placed flowers near the tablet, and his daughter the Rev'd Charlotte Bannister-Parker (former Catechist of the College) conducted the prayers. At the luncheon which followed, at which Clive and Thurstan spoke, Charlotte used the Exeter College Grace. Sir Roger's widow, Lady Moyra (who remains very interested in Exeter, where the gym is named in her honour), who had given a recitation during the Abbey service, gave a striking address. Marguerite and I, and Rector Cairncross and her husband Hamish McRae, attended both events. Sir Roger's achievements, like those of other recently deceased Exonians, will continue to inspire the College. As I finish this report in mid-December 2021, after a nearly normal Michaelmas Term but with the Omicron variant looming over Hilary Term 2022, such inspiration - and the more general positive example of the College's successful coping with pandemic adversity in 2020/21 - is especially important. Rick Trainor13From the President of the MCR The academic year 2020/21 was an extremely challenging one for the Middle Common Room, with the Covid-19 pandemic continuing to loom large in every facet of student life. These very challenges, however, served to demonstrate time and time again the strength and resilience of our graduate community at Exeter, through a period in which this community was perhaps more important to its members than ever. I came to Oxford as a fresher in Michaelmas 2020, and have served as MCR President from Hilary 2021 to Hilary 2022. The MCR has been a huge part of my life during my time in Oxford, and I am deeply grateful to have felt so welcomed by the community and for the many friends I have made through it. As the new students began to arrive in Oxford in October 2020 for the new academic year, the city itself was only just beginning to come to life again after a Trinity term spent in pandemic-induced lockdown and an unusually quiet summer. The MCR committee did a wonderful job of welcoming the College's new graduate students to Oxford life, hosting an impressive array of freshers' events which had been adapted for the Covid-19 era of social distancing and limits on gathering sizes. The Graduate Freshers' Dinner, normally an opportunity for all of the new graduate students to share their first formal dinner together in the College's dining hall, was split into five separate events, although thanks to the efforts of our wonderful catering team the food was as delicious as ever. Despite the restrictions, the freshers were given plenty of chances to get to know each other during Freshers' Week, including a scavenger hunt around Oxford, an online pub quiz night, and an afternoon of punting on the Cherwell. It is a testament to the dedication of the MCR committee that they were able to do so much for the freshers while adapting to the endlessly changing governmental guidance of the time, as well as continuing to provide support to the many students who needed it during periods of government-mandated self-isolation. As Michaelmas kicked off, it was clear that it would be a term of many cancellations, compromises, and unusual arrangements. A significant portion of Exeter's graduate students each year come from overseas, and the ongoing travel restrictions meant that many arrived in Oxford only after term had begun, or in some cases were unable to 14leave their home countries at all. The matriculation ceremony, a longstanding Oxford tradition which sees new students officially inducted as members of the University, was held online in a rare departure from its traditional setting in the Sheldonian Theatre. Teaching was conducted almost entirely online throughout the term, the MCR itself was reduced to limited capacity, and the College dining hall remained closed, replaced by a Marquee that occupied the once-pristine grass of the College's Front Quad. Still the MCR committee remained undeterred by the pandemic, coming up with many innovations that allowed social events to carry on in the face of increasingly strict governmental regulations. The committee arranged Sip and Stroll gatherings at the University Parks, providing us with much-needed excuses to get outdoors and enjoy the company of fellow MCR members at a time when many of us were spending our days working from our rooms. Pub nights, a Halloween pumpkin carving contest, a virtual wine tasting, online welfare teas and cook-along sessions were among the events that occupied our calendars during term, in the absence of some of the usual highlights such as Exchange Dinners and Wine and Cheese nights. The Social Secretaries ended the term on a lovely note with Christmas goodie bags for those still in Oxford, while many students left the city for Christmas not knowing that the impending lockdown might prevent them from returning until as late as April. A Graduate High Table in the Fellows' Garden was one of the highlights of the year15Hilary 2021 was in many ways the most challenging term that the pandemic had brought yet - a nationwide lockdown was firmly in place and many students were unexpectedly unable to return to Oxford, leading the University to waive its usual residency requirement. The newly elected MCR committee, with me as its President, pushed to remain as active as we could even in the depths of lockdown, and do what we could to break through the video call fatigue that - a full year into the pandemic - everyone was feeling. Group workout sessions, gin tastings, wine and watercolour sessions, games nights and a professionally-led art lesson were among the events held online throughout the term, many with participation from MCR members who were trapped outside of the UK at the time. Some of the rare chances for in-person socialisation came from our Welfare team in the form of welfare walks arranged jointly with other colleges - St Anne's, Jesus, St Catherine's and Somerville - which offered MCR members a great opportunity to get outdoors and make friends from other common rooms. Throughout the year, the MCR remained as active as ever in its engagement with the wider student community, contributing with enthusiasm to the College's outreach and access efforts. Graduates ran admissions interview workshops for underprivileged students from Cornwall and mentored incoming undergraduate students in the Exeter Plus bridging programme, which has continued to evolve and expand year on year. The College also kicked off a new carbon neutrality initiative, a welcome commitment to environmental sustainability which saw strong support from Exeter's graduates, whose votes helped determine which carbon offset projects the College would go on to support. Academically, while many graduates faced difficulties throughout the year, the community as a whole performed admirably, with many successfully completing their Master's or DPhil courses. As we come to the beginning of a new academic year, while I don't dare to speculate about the shape of the year to come, 2020/21 has left me with confidence that Exeter's graduate students will meet it with the same grace, vigour and compassion that they have shown during my time as President. I count myself extremely fortunate to have been a member of such a vibrant and friendly graduate community this past year, whose strengths shone all the brighter through the many hardships of the pandemic. I am grateful for the support of the MCR committee, all of whom took up their roles knowing that they would be in for a challenging year, and rose to the occasion with commendable dedication and adaptability. I would particularly like to acknowledge the Vice President, Urania Chiu, and the Treasurer, David Rytz, whose creativity and hard work throughout the year made the MCR a better place for all of us. Alex Stephens16From the President of the JCR The academic year 2020/21: well, it has been an unexpected one! With 2020 Freshers not signing the Register and interviews being held virtually, this year was not what anyone would have predicted. That said, the JCR did not disappoint, and we had some incredible motions. Highlights have to be the dramatic need for new cutlery, a sudden desire for home gym equipment across all sites during November lockdown and a plea for tinsel to decorate the marquee ahead of Oxmas. The year can be summarised as Michaelmas', 'At Home Hilary' and 'Is that Freedom Trinity?'. It has been a roller coaster of a year. The JCR's handling of the year's proceedings has been significantly aided by previous President William Dobbs (in office until December 2020) and our 2021 secretary, Emily Rosindell, with continuous support from the broader JCR committee - THANK YOU! Michaelmas 2020 brought us households across staircases, a Library booking system, and a marquee on the front quad to help increase distanced learning spaces. Hilary 2021 was a very tough start to the year for us. With most students unable to return to Oxford, the notorious Zoom library of lockdown one returned. The JCR's resolve to hang in there together despite all that was going on surpassed my expectations. Trinity was the term of hope and my first summer in Oxford. Despite virtual viewings ahead of room signings, we witnessed: the return of sporting fixtures, Live Music Nights and Welfare Tea (now held in the marquee!), a QR code to order from the Undercroft Bar, and a virtual College play organised by our Music, Art and Drama (MAD) Rep Costi Levy. Environmentally, this has been a monumental year for the JCR, thanks to the hard work of Jakub Michalski. After a detailed survey concerning Exeter's beef consumption, conversations about improvements towards carbon neutrality commenced with the College. The subsequent attention has been on an offsetting carbon scheme launched in Trinity, consisting of many different projects worldwide. After staff and students voted, the College primarily focussed its efforts on a project protecting indigenous communities in Peru through reducing deforestation and land degradation, leading to the offset of 550 tonnes of CO2. I am keen to see how this project develops. 17 A new range of Exeter branded 'stash', including clothing and accessories, proved popular with studentsStudents recorded a series of Shakespeare monologues to create a short film, A Deed Without a Name18The JCR was revamped in many ways this year. Our constitution has had some changes, such as an additional Women's Rep and Class Rep. Our Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic Role also changed, adding a sub-officer to increase their capacity to support minority students. This year, Exeter JCR also supported Jewish students across the University and introduced Antisemitism Awareness Training. And finally, upon their arrival in a few weeks, all workshops offered to Freshers will be run through a hybrid setup, allowing in-person attendance for Freshers and online viewing for all other members of the JCR. These efforts reinforce the College's broader work to make Exeter a more welcoming and accessible place for students. A second modification for the College this year consists of the developing plans for refurbishing the Lodge and updating our Library, creating an even more friendly environment on Turl Street. These projects are intrinsically tied to our outreach schemes. Our Social Media Reps this year, Alana Stewart and Charlotte Askew, were able to put applicants in contact with current students through Instagram (@exeterjcr) to help demystify the application process, and as I write, in September, we have the largest ever cohort of Exeter Plus students in residence ahead of the Freshers 2021 arrival. The third renovation effort affecting the JCR, particularly its finances, is refurbishments to our physical room. With new sofas, cabinets, cork boards and a fresh lick of paint, the room looks spectacular, and I cannot wait to host the first in-person JCR open meeting of my presidency in Michaelmas 2021. Despite the limits imposed upon us by the pandemic, 2020/21 had many highlights. We met Walter, the Exeter College cat, in all his cuteness as a lockdown kitten. He was not a massive fan of the return of hundreds of students in October and was probably the sole member of the College who was happy that fewer people were trying to stroke him in Hilary 2021. Despite being scattered for this second term, those students in Oxford marked Chinese New Year with a fortune cookie in their pidge. Regardless of where they were, every student received a Welfare postcard showing a beautiful picture of Oxford in the snow. The JCR and MCR launched a new College stash range with high- quality products, including a Chilly's bottle and a bucket hat! To wrap up the academic year, our Entz team hosted a College cocktail competition. After many submissions, the winner was 'Exon the Beach'; its ingredients remain a secret! Looking ahead, everyone is extremely excited about what 2021-22 will bring us. Contingency plans remain in place, and the marquee has returned to the Front Quad. Nevertheless, with the Library back to 24/7 and the tenfold social opportunities available this year, I look forward to our evolving Exeter College JCR making further improvements whilst enjoying what we all hope to be a more typical college experience. Good luck to us all! Ella Stadler 19From the Chaplain When Michaelmas Term 2020 started we found ourselves, like most people in Oxford, in a very strange place. We were back in residence, but with many restrictions. Chapel attendance had to be pre-registered; seating in the Chapel reduced from approximately 200 to 36, including the choir; there was neither congregational singing nor holy communion. To allow more people to attend the choir was reduced to an octet, who wore specially made William Morris masks, and sang, not from the choir stalls, but spread out in the apse. As term progressed, and as infection rates rose, services moved online - luckily over the summer we had a top rate sound system installed, so that we can record and broadcast services. Advent and Christmas carol services - when the Chapel is usually overflowing with people - had to be online. And when Hilary came, there was another strict lockdown, and everything reverted to online: singers, readers, preachers, and intercessors singing or praying into their phones, to be mixed together to produce a service. In some ways it would have been easier to abandon services, or at the very least to put together some recordings from the Choir's archives. But, my sense of the last year is that, perhaps more than in past years, the message of hope and possibility, coupled with the space to grieve, to think, to be was an important contribution to the College's response to the Covid crisis. So much of College life is based on community, and communities which come together to explore, experience, or resolve issues, and thus I felt it was important that the Chapel did what it could to foster a sense of community, even if we were locked down all across the world. Covid did provide new opportunities: shortly before Christmas we broadcast 'A Christmas Sequence: from Darkness to Light' working on metaphors of Christ the light entering the darkness of the world, as found in the first chapter of St John's Gospel. The director was very concerned about how we might sync lips from the audio and video recordings (which were separate); we'd forgotten that mouths would be covered with masks so it wasn't an issue. There were other creative greats: Nath Sassoon (2018, Music) set George Herbert's poem 'The Windows' to music, and members of the College contributed, not least Professorial Fellow, and Keeper of the Special Collections at the 20 To allow social distancing Ascension Day was celebrated from the Mound, with the congregation spaced across the Fellows' Garden21Bodleian, Chris Fletcher, who preached a sermon on a literary pilgrimage he'd made last summer. Perhaps the highlight was a service of reflection, requested by students, to ponder the first anniversary of the pandemic. People contributed their response to Covid-19, including Max Parfitt (2019, Music) who talked about the music of Ivor Gurney and how he found solace despite chaos, and Professor Cath Green who spoke eloquently about the discovery and development of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccination. I'm grateful to the many people who kept the lamps lit in the Chapel, be it in person or online, to Gwynfor Morgan for his work as sacristan, and to Marco Bodnar and Andrew Small in giving general assistance. Christopher Holman, the Parry Wood Organ Scholar, deserves especial praise, not only for leading the Choir during a difficult and exhausting period, but also for all his technical support and knowledge in putting together and broadcasting the services. There were some joyful highlights, too: we were able to have Ascension Day Mattins outside this year - though on the top of the Mound, rather than the Tower. We also were mightily relieved and glad that our dear Catechist, the Rev'd Dr Canon Margaret Whipp, made a recovery from her significant Covid-related illness. Writing this, in mid-Michaelmas 2021, the situation is very different from last year: we have returned to full choir for services; weddings and baptisms are again possible and happening, and the Chapel's role beyond its services is being re-established in the College, as we all seek to find a new way of being part of the Exeter Community . Andrew Allen22From the Organ Scholar Every year Exeter College Choir takes an international tour to sing at major historical sites and explore exciting new repertoire. The pandemic thwarted our plans to visit Berlin and Saxony in both 2020 and July 2021, so we decided to refocus our energies toward visiting major cathedrals and historic sites throughout Southern England. Between 2 and 12 September 2021, while staying in Cohen Quad and taking day trips all over the country, we performed ten times and recorded a new CD for Christmas (more on which below). Despite the challenge of learning roughly three hours' worth of varied, highly demanding repertoire, the Choir members' hard work and high standard of performance made the tour a tremendous success, and consistently reaffirmed Exeter College Choir's position as one of the leading mixed-voice collegiate ensembles in the UK. We spent the first two days singing together intensively in the College Chapel, each day ending with a service which was open to the public. This proved excellent preparation for our evensongs at St Paul's, Winchester, and Hereford Cathedrals later in the week, where we sang rarely performed works by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Amy Beach, and Nathaniel Dett. We also had the pleasure of singing evensong in the College Chapel with The Exonian Choir, a London-based ensemble comprised primarily of Exeter Old Members led by former Organ Scholar Tim Muggeridge. The combined forces gave us the numbers to sing Thomas Tallis's Spem in alium, a motet composed for 40 voice parts divided into eight choirs. The fact that we were able to perform this monumental work in a basically pre-pandemic arrangement was especially meaningful, given that the motet's text focuses on placing hope in God amid great tribulation. As outreach to local communities, the College Choir also sang at several small parishes, including at St Mary and St Nicholas Church in Littlemore (which John Henry Newman built and then served as priest) and the ancient Church of St Mary in Wootton-by- Woodstock. We also sang for the Saintbury Festival in Gloucestershire at a gala 23fundraiser in conjunction with the Church Historical Foundation Trust to restore the 13th century Church of St Nicholas. Between performances of Shakespeare scenes and recitations of metaphysical poems by leading West End actors Michael Maloney, Agni Scott, Emerald O'Hanaran, and Heather Rutherford, the Choir sang secular madrigals and part-songs from four centuries. In the midst of all this, we also recorded a new CD of music for Christmas entitled Masters in this Hall: Carols Ancient and Modern. The recording features seven centuries of outstanding works for the holidays, including pieces by Elisabeth Stirling and Jean Berger which have never been recorded. The disc concludes with a stunning new setting of Exeter College alumnus William Morris's beloved poem Masters in this Hall by Caitlin Harrison, who graduated this year with a MPhil in Composition. The CD was released in Michaelmas Term 2021. We are tremendously grateful not only to the College for hosting us during this time and to all those who welcomed us so graciously, but to the success of the UK's vaccination programme and making regular individual testing so easily accessible, without which none of this would have been possible. Plans are now in preparation for the Choir to continue our success with a tour to the USA in September 2022. Christopher Holman Face masks didn't diminish the quality of the Choir' s singing24From the Finance and Estates Bursar Last year was an exciting and busy time. Not only was I fortunate enough to get the role of Finance and Estates Bursar at Exeter, but my wife Lucy and I also moved into Oxford from Wiltshire, all during a lockdown. Whilst moving job and house are stressful, my path has been eased by Exeter being such a great place to work: very welcoming, friendly, and supportive. My first official day was 1 November 2020. So, mid-lockdown and at a time when the College was busy containing an outbreak of Covid with all the knock- on impacts of isolation for students. Top of my in-tray on arrival, however, were two very important financial items: Refinancing the College's \u00a312 million bank loan; and Reviewing the College's approach to its endowment investments, including advisers. Refinancing the loan The existing loan was taken out to help finance the Cohen Quad project in 2009; another era when interest rates were much higher. Loans should be refinanced at least 18 months ahead of expiry, and ours was set to expire in March 2022. We seized the opportunity to present the College to a potential lender in early December as Governing Body was keen to take advantage of the historic low interest rates potentially available at the end of 2020. This ambitious timetable involved burning a bit of midnight oil, but our pitch was successful. We agreed to borrow \u00a330 million at a fixed rate of interest for 47 years until January 2068. After repaying the previous \u00a312 million loan, much of the remaining proceeds will be devoted to a repayment fund. The pricing call to set the interest rate on our loan was fixed for the morning of 10 December, coincidentally the day I moved house but also fortuitously a day when bond yields fell to historic lows. As a result, our debt was priced at a very reasonable 1.72%, below the Bank of England's 2% inflation target and a record low for an Oxbridge College. 25Review of endowment investments My arrival represented a good opportunity for the Investment Committee (IC) to review the investment strategy and advisers, particularly as the College's incumbent adviser, Sand Aire, had just been bought by Cazenove. The IC concluded that it could add most value at the strategic level and that the Committee would be better off selecting best-in-class advisers to make tactical changes and decisions regarding detailed asset allocations and the selection of individual fund managers. The IC also agreed the importance of exploiting the College's key advantage in being a truly long-term investor. At a strategic level, the IC recognised that looking forward it will likely be far harder to make the kinds of returns often seen in the past. In short, the bull-run is over and to achieve the sorts of returns needed to grow the endowment will require very careful asset allocation and access to the best long-term investments. In April, the IC interviewed four potential advisers. Two new advisers, Partners Capital and Oxford University Endowment Management (OUEM), were appointed to manage the majority of the College's securities endowment. Partners Capital and OUEM offer access to high quality private equity assets, among other things, playing to the College's strength as a long-term investor. A smaller portion of the endowment was set aside to invest under a different, dynamic tactical approach using listed assets only. The IC has recently interviewed potential advisers and appointed Ninety One to manage this portion of the endowment. Help for students The College has set up several initiatives to help students including: A Vacation Study Grant under which all resident undergraduates are entitled to seven nights' free accommodation per annum. The allowance can be carried forward subject to a maximum of 14 nights in any calendar year; A Maintenance Grant under which the College will automatically apply an extra accommodation subsidy to low income undergraduate students (e.g. those with household incomes below \u00a342,875). These low income students will also get an extra seven nights' free accommodation per year, effectively doubling the Vacation Study Grant. The Maintenance Grant will be automatically credited to students' battels without the need for students to go through the hardship screening process; Free insurance for undergraduates in College accommodation. This includes new-for-old cover following loss of belongings, theft cover whilst moving to and from the College, as well as damage to laptops and other portable computer equipment; and Free flu jabs for students during Michaelmas Term 2021.26Reducing carbon emissions Exeter College has stepped up to the challenge! With generous help from a donor, and with the active involvement of students and staff, the College offset its 2021 CO2 emissions by purchasing carbon credits in a selection of accredited carbon offset projects from around the world. Students and staff received a voucher which they could use to purchase carbon credits from their chosen project. 212 members of the College participated and opted to spend their vouchers as follows: 111 people to protect indigenous communities in Peru by reducing deforestation and land degradation: offsetting 550 tonnes of CO2 39 people to recover methane from landfills in Ecuador and convert it into electricity: offsetting 193 tonnes of CO2 37 people to invest in improved technologies in Malawi, including clean cook stoves, and promote better and more efficient kitchen and firewood management practices: offsetting 183 tonnes of CO2 25 people to distribute fuel-efficient stoves to households in Guatemala to replace inefficient open-fire cooking: offsetting 124 tonnes of CO2 In total, the College offset 1,050 tonnes of CO2 emissions, representing its use of gas (our electricity already comes from renewable sources) and consumption of food. We are aiming to run the project again during 2021/22. Labrador Trigger loves going for walks with students27Trigger I sometimes bring my Labrador, Trigger, to College. Trigger is very keen (Pick me!! Pick me!!) and really enjoys seeing everyone. Last term some students took him for walks, which he loved. So if anyone is interested, please do come and collect him from the Bursary (he is usually in College two days a week). He is under strict instructions not to chase Walter (the College cat), or Bella (the Head Porter's new kitten) - so far, so good! Sale of Sutton Lodge Farm Trigger particularly enjoyed his trip to this c. 400-acre farm east of Banbury (he misses chasing rabbits and pheasants now he is a city dog!). We were inspecting the new access road built by the College (which you can see coming down to the farm top right in the picture below) and the other pre-sale preparations. The farm is not suitable for development, being the wrong side from Banbury of the M40, a railway, and the Oxford Canal. Having obtained vacant possession, we decided to take advantage of the favourable property market and sell. This worked well with two determined bidders pushing the price up. The sale was agreed in June at \u00a35.6 million (nearly \u00a31 million above the \u00a34.7 million asking price) and completed in September. The Investment Committee will be considering the use of the proceeds. Sutton Lodge Farm28Rowing I used to row many years ago in my student days at Oriel. It was with some trepidation that I took out one of Exeter's sculls recently. I was relieved not to fall in and to find that, like riding a bike, the basics are still in there somewhere. I may need to work up some extra motivation though in order to re-live those beautiful early frosty mornings, with the mist gently rising from the river .... For many students, the opportunity to do some rowing, to race against other colleges in Torpids and Eights, is a one-off quintessential Oxford experience. There is also the opportunity to win blades. I was delighted to accept the role of Senior Member of the Boat Club and am keen to encourage as many students as possible to give rowing a go whilst making sure the Boat Club has the support it needs. The Boat Club has got off to a good start with a strong level of novice involvement. Alumni are also encouraged to get involved, even if you are not in Oxford very often. The Boat Club can always use help from experienced coxes and coaches. Please contact Matt Holyoak at Exon! Nick Badman29Incoming Fellows Edith Chen Boskey Fellow in Global History I am a historian of the pre-modern Near East focusing on the Mongol Empire and Iran. My interests include Islamic history, legal history, and the transmission of people and ideas across Eurasia. As an undergraduate, I studied Public Policy and Islamic Studies at Duke University. Afterward, I attended Boston College Law School for a year and interned at the Boston Juvenile Court. While enjoying most of the 1L curriculum, especially constitutional law and (even) civil procedure, I realized that I did not wish to pursue a legal career. Nevertheless, I harbour an abiding interest in the development of law, procedures, and legal theories, and what these reveal about social history. In 2012 I received a Foreign Language Area Studies Fellowship and later obtained a Master's in Middle East Studies from Harvard. While attending the lectures there, I became more inspired by medieval Islamic history and the questions it raises regarding the relationships between individuals, society, the courts, and the law, especially in the post- classical period (13-15th centuries). In 2019-2020 I received a Fulbright Scholarship and was a visiting researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I completed my doctoral studies at Princeton's Department of Near Eastern Studies in 2021. I am interested in those moments in history where different peoples were brought into interaction with one another and the products and consequences of such encounters. My dissertation examines the history of the Mongol presence in Iran (13-14th centuries) through its relationship with the local dynasties located along the Persian Gulf. Unlike the large-scale devastation that occurred elsewhere, this region enjoyed mostly peaceful relations with the Mongol rulers and flourished during this time. The concept of vassalage in the Mongol Empire (including its territories in China, Russia, and Central Asia in addition to the Middle East) will be explored more extensively in my monograph. I am also preparing a few shorter pieces on developments in Islamic law and society in Mongol Iran. 30Sarah Howles Staines Medical Research Fellow I am a Wellcome Trust Clinical Career Development Fellow and Honorary Consultant Urological Surgeon working at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford. My clinical and research interest is kidney stone disease, a very common condition that affects nearly 1 in 10 adults. I studied medicine at Cambridge and Oxford Universities between 1999 and 2005, and since qualification have worked in the Oxford region, entering the Urology training scheme in 2010. In 2011 I was appointed Wellcome Trust Clinical Training Fellow, joining Professor Thakker's group as a DPhil student. I defended my thesis in 2015 having had a fantastic time exploring monogenic disorders of calcium homeostasis, as well as becoming a mother (now two children). I continued as a clinical academic between 2015 and 2020 as an National Institute for Health Research Academic Clinical Lecturer in Urology and took up my current role with the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences in 2021. My current research focusses on exploring common genetic factors that increase an individual's risk of developing kidney stone disease. By studying data collected by the UK Biobank, my research group has been able to identify 20 areas on the genome (genetic loci) that are linked to stone formation. However, we don't yet know what effects variations in DNA sequence at these loci are having on how genes are converted to proteins and on biological pathways. We therefore aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which these genetic variations lead to kidney stone formation to allow us to identify targets for novel personalised preventative drug therapies. 31Agni Orfanoudaki Fellow in Management I am a Fellow in Management Studies at Exeter College and an Associate Professor of Operations Management at the Sa\u00efd Business School, Oxford. Alongside my role at Oxford, I hold a visiting scholar position at the Harvard Kennedy School as a Harvard Data Science Initiative Fellow. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and completed my undergraduate studies at the department of Management Science and Technology at the Athens University of Economics and Business. My research vision is to combine my experience and rigorous training in operations research with my creativity to build analytical models that make a positive impact on society. To pursue this vision, my research agenda has primarily focused on developing new methods and models for healthcare and insurance practitioners using data-driven methodologies. Specifically, I have developed new machine learning algorithms to address major data imperfections - such as missing values, censored observations, and unobserved counterfactuals - that are commonly found in real-world datasets. Leveraging a wide variety of data sources, including health and claims records, longitudinal studies, and unstructured medical reports, my research has resulted in predictive and prescriptive models that improve patient care and hospital operations in the context of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases as well as COVID-19. My work highlights the importance of interpretability and the design of systems that facilitate engagement of the decision- maker and integration into healthcare organizations. In parallel, to propel the adoption of these methodologies, I have introduced the area of algorithmic insurance, proposing a quantitative framework to estimate the litigation risk of machine learning models. My research focuses on the development of risk evaluation techniques that enable modern institutions to manage the risk exposure resulting from the implementation of analytical decision tools. 32Departing Fellows Karin Sigloch Fellow and Tutor in Earth Sciences Karin Sigloch came to Exeter in October 2013 from Munich, where she had completed her Habilitation, and held the post of Assistant Professor of Seismology. For one year Karin overlapped with her predecessor, Shamita Das, as Tutorial Fellow in Earth Sciences. Karin is a Geophysicist, and whilst at Oxford she led a group that studied the structure of the earth's interior, measuring and observing heat and material flows which drive the motions of tectonic plates, the formation of oceans, volcanism, and continental tectonics. These are inputted into 2-D images of mantle structure at depth, using seismic tomography, an imaging technique that computes three-dimensional models of the earth's interior. Essentially, it maps out the anomalously hot, cold, or dense regions that drive convection in the mantle, to develop new, rapidly growing data sets. Karin is a world-class researcher. Soon after arriving in Exeter she went to the Indian Ocean (making those of us in wet, damp Oxford very envious!). Karin was a leading member of the RHUM-RUM experience: a passive seismic experiment designed to image an oceanic mantle plume - or lack of plume - from crust to core beneath La R\u00e9union Island, and to understand these results in terms of material, heat flow and plume dynamics. The project deployed 57 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers and 30 island stations to record earthquakes and ambient noise between 2011 and 2014. The data analysis is ongoing. In 2015 she was the recipient of a Leverhulme Prize and in 2017 elected a Fellow of the Young Academy of Europe. Back at Exeter Karin contributed hugely to life at College. From 2018 - 2020 she was Sub-Rector, and managed the diverse demands of this role in an efficient, compassionate, and practical way. Karin was a keen and active member of the Senior Common Room, and a great supporter of the Chapel - both as a place of spiritual support, and also of great music making, although I failed to persuade her to play violin when we had small orchestras to accompany Schubert or Mozart masses. Her support of the musical activities of the College included commissioning an organ voluntary as part of the J.S. Bach-inspired Orgelb\u00fcchlein Project, curated by our organ tutor, William Whitehead. 33Karin's gifts to Exeter included being an expert pragmatist. Whether this ranged from the many sundry issues that come across the desk of the Sub-Rector, or to a research expedition to La R\u00e9union with her six-week-old daughter in tow, Karin's pragmatism and great clarity of thought provided seemingly easy solutions to many situations. She gave especially strong service when the College suffered a student tragedy in 2019, and as a member of the Welfare Team had significant contributions as we negotiated a new model of welfare support to all members of the College. The decision to leave Oxford and Exeter was not an easy one to make: but in May 2021 Karin, along with her family, relocated to the south of France, where she succeeded her Doktorvater as director of research at CNRS G\u00e9oazur and a Chair d'Excellence at the Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, near Antibes. This is a multidisciplinary research centre focussing on, amongst other topics, seismogenesis, telluric hazards, and earth imaging, as well as spatial metrology. Karin's departure is a great loss for Exeter and Oxford. But, as the fragile condition of our planet becomes more apparent, her work at Antibes becomes all the more important. We wish her all the very best of luck. Andrew Allen34Dan Snow Fellow in Management Dan Snow served as Tutorial Fellow in Management - and Associate Professor at the Sa\u00efd Business School - during the academic years 2018/19 and 2019/20. Dan was educated at Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of California Berkeley where he obtained his PhD. Before coming to Oxford, Dan held appointments at Harvard Business School, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, and the BYU Marriott School of Business. A productive researcher, Dan's work focuses on the complex relationship between new and old technologies during technology transitions; and service operations, particularly the building of theoretical micro-foundations to help define the field, and empirical research on operational productivity. During his time in Oxford Dan played an active part both in the College and at the Sa\u00efd. A popular teacher in both spheres, Dan was also a source of wise counsel in discussions, notably in appointment panels. In addition, Dan and his family were frequent attenders at High Table and other College occasions, thereby contributing significantly to the broader intellectual and social life of Exeter. Dan left Oxford, to considerable regret both at Exeter and at the Sa\u00efd, to take up the promoted post of Director of MBA Programs at BYU's Business School. Rick Trainor 35Catering at Exeter College Catering Services Manager Lesley O'Donovan reflects on 17 years at Exeter College as she prepares for a new adventure, running holiday chalets in Wales. My journey at Exeter began 17 years ago. I had been landlady at a pub in Oxfordshire, with my husband who was running his own fencing company and our then two-year-old daughter. We decided that we needed to make a move to find a better work/life balance and bang! I found myself working the odd shift in Exeter's Undercroft Bar, at that time a rather grotty little bar with burnt work surfaces and sticky floors. I soon progressed to becoming bar manager and overseeing the redevelopment of the bar into the lovely space we have today. I can only describe that period of my career at Exeter as eye opening, to say the least. Student rugby drinks and Bops were not something I had come across in my sleepy village pub! Hand on heart though, I enjoyed every second. The students that came through those doors have to this day held a special place in my heart, and many are still in touch with me now. I have especially fond memories of 'Roxanne' by The Police being blasted out every single night and Summer Eights with a motley crew of bar staff, including an unforgettable day when we made our way back through Oxford with one of them very merry and dressed as an elf! I recall also being coerced into coming along to Park End on a student night out and the resulting headache the next day. One of the joys of this role is that I have followed students' lives as they have progressed into their fields of work, watched them come back to us to get married and then seen them return with families in tow. A position became available for assistant catering manager, which I applied for and happily got, and then when our catering manager Kate Grove retired I moved into the role of catering services manager and have spent the years since working alongside the very best catering team I could have dreamed of. 36The day-to-day of my role is always so varied: dealing with students emailing to arrange events, helping out with service, organising bar orders, planning weddings, carrying endless boxes of wine up and down stairs, and the myriad of other things it takes to make sure staff and service are always perfect. I have even walked from Kidlington to Exeter in the snow when all the staff were snowed in and we had students and Fellows on site who needed to be fed; I'm not sure my mass catering skills are quite as good as our amazing chefs though! We have fed politicians, queens, celebrities, students, staff, Fellows, families and everyone in between. We have hosted the grand final banquet of the Great British Menu and finally made our TV debuts! Covid has obviously had a massive impact on how we have been able to cater in College for the last 18 months or so. We had to change radically the way we operate and even though it was a worrying and stressful time for the team we have managed to adapt, change and succeed. At the time of writing, in early September, we are planning for a resumption of pre-pandemic ways and I am happy to leave Exeter with all our staff returning to their original roles and duties. I think Covid has cemented in me the reason why I have remained at Exeter for so long: the catering team, the rest of the staff, Fellows and students really are a small community that look out, care for and work together to achieve such a special place. I will be very sad to leave behind my team; they are family and have made being a manager here such an absolute pleasure but I am very excited about the new chapter that we are about to embark on. My husband and I have bought a property in the beautiful town of Rhayader, mid- Wales. The house is already converted into four self-catering holiday lets with a beautiful garden and mountain views. The town is the gateway to the Elan Valley and has International Dark Sky Status so we are both so excited to be moving on to a place where our daily dog walks will have a much more dramatic backdrop! Lesley O'Donovan37The Library Restoration and Renovation Background Exeter College Library is a splendid example of neo-Gothic Victorian architecture, considered one of George Gilbert Scott's masterpieces. It is much treasured by postgraduate and undergraduate students alike, both as a space for consulting books and for quiet study. However, there has been no extensive work on the fabric of the building since the installation of the mezzanine in the annexe in the 1950s. Significant work is needed to bring the interior and exterior into a state of excellent repair, and major improvements are required to make the Library truly fit for purpose. The opening of Cohen Quad in 2017 enabled the College to relocate rare books and manuscripts to dedicated special collections facilities, freeing up the Library's lower annexe and making possible the creation of additional reader spaces. The restoration and renovation of the Library will make use of this opportunity not only to provide over a third more reader spaces, but also to make it a space truly fit for 21st century study. Meanwhile, the appearance of the Library will be restored to its original neo-Gothic splendour inside and out. The restoration and renovation will: Make the Library fully accessible, with step-free access from the Fellows' Garden, a lift, and a WC suitable for all Increase the number of reader spaces to meet demand Install modern electrical wiring suitable for 21st-century study needs Provide a variety of study spaces and a more flexible design that can be modified easily to accommodate changing study habits Create dedicated Librarians' workspaces Improve the College's sustainability by using environmentally friendly ventilation and lighting Create a half-width mezzanine in the Library's annexe, revealing Gilbert Scott's original vision for full height Gothic windows and a finely crafted roof structure 38 Refurbish roofs and conserve the architectural stonework, including reinstatement of lost details Conserve and restore the original Victorian bookcases, labels, windows and flooring Install display cases for treasured books and other objects Project summary Following the approval of the Library refurbishment project by the Governing Body in its meeting on 19 May 2021, the necessary Notices to Proceed were issued to the design consultants and the process to appoint a building contractor was launched in early summer 2021. The required statutory planning permits and Listed Building Consent have already been granted with a number of pre- and post-commencement conditions, entirely expected in this type of refurbishment project. The project is broadly on schedule with the building works expected to commence in July 2022 and be completed in September 2023. The engagement with the design consultants is very positive and productive. On the College side, there is considerable work under way to mitigate the impact of the building works on collegiate life during term, as well as on the important conference and events activities which take place during vacations. Procurement and appointment of building contractor Following a three-stage shortlisting process supported by the College's project managers, Ridge Partners, three contractors were shortlisted for the interview stage. The interviews, supported by the architects and project managers, were attended by a panel consisting of College officers, the Librarian and members of the Buildings and Gardens Committee. The interview process, having eliminated one of the three candidates, was followed by visits to five Oxford Colleges which have recently carried out projects using the remaining two shortlisted contractors. Having to choose between two proposals of outstanding quality, the selection panel decided to award the contract to Beard Construction Ltd. The decision was taken on the basis of their detailed and customised proposal, the breadth of similar projects undertaken in Oxford colleges and brought to a successful conclusion, the feedback from these colleges, and the management experience of Beard Construction. The procurement route selected is a two-stage traditional process, allowing the College and design team to work with the successful bidder during the development stage (RIBA 39Stage 4) to refine and finalise the design and building process, gain from the expertise of subcontractors and suppliers, and de-risk variations in construction costs. During this development stage, Beard Construction will work with the College through a pre- construction agreement and upon the completion of the design and the finalisation of the total construction cost projection, a formal appointment will be made. This is expected to take place in late March or early April 2022. Building contractors' facilities and access to gardens Whilst various logistical and access arrangements are being considered, the following facilities are most likely to be put in place (see image 1). The building contractors will access the site through Radcliffe Square and will set up a temporary unloading bay in Brasenose Lane, but maintaining pedestrian and cyclist access through the lane. The Fellows' Garden gate will be used as the primary point of entrance and egress for personnel and materials. Deliveries of bulkier materials as well as the removal of demolition waste will most likely be lifted over the garden wall. Within the walls of the Fellows' Garden, a building and storage compound will be set up spanning the width of the garden from the wall to the Library and about one third of the length of the garden. Access to the Fellows' Garden through staircases 4 and 5 will be retained through a corridor. The compound will accommodate the welfare and office units of the contractors and will also be used as holding storage for materials and waste. Image: Proposed plan showing access to building site, contractors' compound and protective hoarding40Temporary library facilities A Working Group set up to explore temporary library options made the following recommendations to the Buildings and Gardens Committee, all of which were approved. Maintain a small temporary library which will be open to all College members. An indicative number of books is circa 4,000 - 4,500. The Library records show that during the last three years 3,844 titles were lent out three times or more. Consider the Saskatchewan Room or the Ruskin Room as the location for the temporary Library. [Since the meeting of the Group, the Saskatchewan Room has emerged as the more likely location.] Transport the remaining books to the Bodleian storage facilities in Swindon where they will be kept in deep storage and will not be available during the refurbishment works. Support the temporary library with purchases of frequently used books, similar to the arrangement in place during the height of the Covid pandemic when many students were working from home. Provide a marquee in the Front Quad at Turl Street as a study space during the refurbishment works. [The same marquee will be used during the vacation periods to support the conference operations.] Allow access to meeting rooms such as the Quarrell Room out of hours for additional study space. The timing of setting up the temporary library facilities is to be decided. While the building works are scheduled to commence in July 2022, it will be useful to carry out as much preliminary work as possible during the Easter vacation. Progress monitoring, governance and reporting The core design work is carried out through regular workshops with the participation of the relevant design consultants, contractors and College officers. The overall progress of the work carried out in these workshops is tracked in monthly project meetings with the participation of the design consultants, contractors and the Domestic Bursar. In parallel, the Library Project Working Group, consisting of key College officers and those heads of departments (including the Librarian) affected by the project, meets monthly to facilitate the flow of information between the College and the design team. The Buildings and Gardens Committee is briefed regularly by the Domestic Bursar, architects and project managers and is consulted for key decisions on design, conservation and operational matters. During the building works, a similar monitoring structure involving the building contractor and the relevant College officers will be put in place.41The output of the project management structure outlined above is formally reported to the Governing Body through the Buildings and Gardens Committee and the Finance and General Purposes Committee.

Renovated Library, with a lift next to the staircase towerCurrent appearance from the Rector's Garden43The Library Renewed Helen Warren, Historic Buildings Advisor at Donald Insall Associates, shares her expert view on the plans to restore Exeter College Library. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge occupy a unique place in the heritage of the nation. Despite originally being places of religious scholarship, they avoided the fate of abbeys and convents, which were destroyed during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. Remarkably, these scholarly communities survive today with sites and buildings which continue to be used and occupied in much the same way as they were originally intended, as places of communal learning. This combination of historic architecture and the continuation of centuries-old collegiate traditions defines both cities. However, ensuring that these historic buildings are protected whilst also remaining relevant to modern-day needs is a delicate balance. Our team of researchers, historic building advisors and conservation architects have been busy for the past two years, collaborating with Nex Architects on a building that lies at the heart of one of the colleges, in the historic core of Oxford: the Library at Exeter College, built c. 1856-7 by the builders Symm & Co. of Oxford to designs by the architect George Gilbert Scott. The Rector of the College, Professor Sir Rick Trainor, sums up the College's aspirations for the building: 'I am delighted that the College' s exciting plans for renewing its Library have met with such a positive response and can now go ahead. As a tremendously popular building at the heart of College life, it is essential that we preserve the historic fabric of the Library inside and out while making it fit for use in the 21st century and beyond. Exeter College' s Library has been a place of inspiration to so many of our students past and present, including Sir Philip Pullman and JRR Tolkien. Our vision is to provide a study space tailored for modern students and academics, whilst maintaining the Library' s inspirational atmosphere and exceptional beauty for generations to come .' Insall's have uncovered the narrative behind the site's layered building fabric, studied its condition and considered its varied heritage values in order to guide the approach to its conservation and adaption. Exeter College is Oxford's fourth oldest college and has been situated on its central Turl Street site since 1315; its buildings have seen waves of renewal and adaption to suit changing fortunes, tastes and needs. The Library is no exception, having taken several different forms and occupying several different locations over the years, before settling between the Rector's and Fellows' Gardens, by 1857. To some, the multi-layered fabric enshrined in the College buildings holds the key to their value - that of reliable evidence. 44 Clockwise from from top left: Stained glass, the ornate ceiling, carved stonework, an original timber bookcase 45'There is no kind of historical evidence which is so precious, so certain, so incontrovertible as that supplied by ancient buildings.' Bryce 1879 Evidential value is concerned with what physical remains can tell us or confirm about historic construction methods, dates, rituals and practices, which we would otherwise not know. Examples of this at the Library have included the ability to determine the original decorative scheme through analysis of paint sample stratigraphy (by Hirst Conservation), and the analysis of stonework joints and details to decipher the original extent of the building and its circulation arrangements. Historic value suggests that it is the associated past events and people behind a building which make it special. The Library's historic value derives from its role in the development of the College, and in particular its mid-19th-century transformation. The University of Oxford and its colleges were undergoing profound changes in the early-mid Victorian period, rapidly expanding and modernising to meet the needs of a newly-industrialised and increasingly imperial society. Exeter was in the vanguard of reform, and this is manifested in the new buildings the College erected in this period, largely rebuilding its mediaeval and early modern structures. The Library, along with the Chapel, Rector's Lodgings and a series of undergraduate rooms, tells this story of transformation and renewal. The Library's historic significance is also reflected in its associations with Rectors, Fellows, post-graduates and undergraduates of the College, some of whom have a particularly strong link with the Library, such as William Morris and Edward Burne- Jones, whose beautiful stained-glass roundels can be seen in some of the ground floor windows. The vision of JRR Tolkien sitting, reading the book on Finnish grammar that he found in the Library and supposedly helped to inspire the Middle-earth of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, is unavoidably conjured in the mind's eye when walking amongst the bookshelves. Others may value the building for its architecture. The Library forms a group with the other buildings designed by Gilbert Scott for the College. The Library is, to quote the forthcoming Pevsner volume 'also [like the Chapel] in the late C13 style, but more personal in the handling'. Commentators, including biographer Gavin Stamp, have noted the power of the close arcading of the upper floor, which is largely blank but for four lancet windows; this was inspired by mediaeval traditions of library architecture. Other important features are the dormers with geometrical tracery and the timber-lined vaulted ceiling of the upper floor of the main range. The building is particularly special because of the high-quality materials, the skilled craftsmanship and level of detail displayed in its construction, from the carved stonework to the individually designed timber bookcases. But the value of historic buildings lies in much more than bricks and mortar. To many people, they provoke a deeper, more symbolic consciousness about time and mortality. 46We think of the people who have touched the same wall, walked up the same stairway or taken a book from one of the shelves and imagine what their life would have been like. The visible age of a building, elicited through patina on woodwork, faded paintwork or eroded stonework, is of value - a sentiment beautifully expressed by John Ruskin in 1890: 'The greatest glory of a building... is in its age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity.' Values such as the communal, cultural or spiritual cannot necessarily be associated with the building's fabric, but are derived from patterns of behaviour and traditions. The continuous use of the Library by generations of students, Fellows and staff contributes to its Spirit of Place (to coin a National Trust phrase) as strongly, if not more so, than any individual part of the building's components. Conclusion The diversity of values illustrates the complex nature of conservation; what is of value to me may differ to what is value to you, and almost certainly what might be of value to future generations. How can the conserver and custodian please the archaeologist's thirst for evidence, the romantic's desire for gradual deterioration, and the owners' responsibility to ensure the building remains fit for purpose? To what extent can the need for authenticity be prioritised over and above the survival and traditional use of a building? At Insall's we recognise that change is often needed to ensure our historic buildings remain viable. Our approach is always to understand a building's heritage values upfront and use this to guide the process, looking to minimise harmful intervention as much a possible by thinking creatively about how alterations could be sited, scaled and detailed, and looking for ways to preserve and enhance what is special about a building or place. This approach at Exeter College Library has informed the recently approved scheme. The works include essential repairs and re-instatement of lost details (seen on historic photographs) such as missing pinnacles, carved heads and foliage to stonework and lions to rainwater pipes, to ensure that the Library's architectural value can be enjoyed by future generations. In order to make all floors of the building accessible a new lift and staircase have been carefully designed. Located in an area previously altered in the 1950s, the new lift shaft will sit discreetly behind an existing stair turret with the staircase nestled in a previously unoccupied gap between the neighboring Bodleian's buttresses. The removal of the 1950s first floor, which crudely bisects the annexe, will allow the original, single volume and Gilbert Scott's traceried windows to be appreciated at their full height once again. Where new additions have been required they have been designed by Nex as bespoke pieces of furniture intended to echo the craftsmanship of Gilbert Scott's work, in an honest way. There will be significant upgrades to the building's services (including 47those facilitating up-to-date information technology) and environmental comfort and performance, with the services re-routed and hidden beneath the plinths of bookshelves. The approved scheme, which is expected to be completed by Autumn 2023, ensures that the building remains relevant for today's users without compromising its architectural quality, atmosphere and idiosyncratic charm. Helen Warren Nex Architects computer images showing how the new half-width annexe mezzanine will allow the full height of the Library' s Gothic windows to be revealed and its finely crafted ceiling to be fully appreciated 48The Porters' Lodge Refurbishment Background, feasibility study and refurbishment objectives In late 2018, Exeter College commissioned Berman Guedes Stretton Architects to carry out a feasibility study exploring several options to improve accessibility and the appearance of the College's Porters' Lodge, which has not had significant refurbishment for many years. The key objectives for the architects were Improve the layout of the Lodge, making the working and reception spaces more ergonomic for its staff and Lodge users. Improve accessibility for College members, staff and visitors while improving security and access restrictions for unauthorised visitors; allow the main gate to be kept open during daytime thus projecting the image of an open, welcoming college. Respond to changes in shopping and communication habits with suitable storage space for parcel deliveries. Provide unaided access for disabled people. Improve the environmental performance of the site. The study explored five options; three were different iterations of the selected design, one was based broadly on the existing layout and one explored the possibility of relocating the Lodge to the ground floor and basement of Thomas Wood Building (on the corner of Turl St and Broad St). Planning applications, procurement and contractor appointments As Berman Guedes Stretton Architects went into administration in early 2020, the College employed Ms Magda Cheda, the same architect who carried out the feasibility study, to work on the project through a different practice, Jessop and Cook Architects. Ridge Partners were appointed Quantity Surveyors and supported the College in the selection of the principal contractor following a two-stage traditional tender process. This procurement route allows the College to work with the successful bidder to refine and finalise the design and de-risk variations in construction costs. The successful bidder was Richard Ward (Oxford) Ltd, a local, family-owned firm well known to Exeter College from numerous past projects. The key subcontractors will be RT Harris (electrical works), GF Cross (mechanical works) and Westronics (access, CCTV and fire alarm installations). All have excellent track records in working with Oxford colleges and are very familiar to Exeter.49The applications for planning permission and listed building consent were submitted in August 2021 and granted in October and November 2021. Design and building works In response to the refurbishment objectives, the final design provided the following features Changes in the orientation of the Lodge counter by 90 degrees, thereby improving the visual line between the counter and the College entrance. Rationalise and declutter various electronic panels for CCTV , fire alarms, access and other IT systems, making the working space more ergonomic. Installation of a secondary gate and railings within the arched area allowing the main, wooden gate to remain open during the day. Relocation of the pigeonhole area to the back of the Lodge and making it accessible through Staircase 2, thereby allowing more storage space for parcels. Installation of a hydraulic lift, embedded into the floor of the arched area when not in use, to allow unaided access to wheelchair users. Improvements in the thermal performance of the site and installation of secondary glazing. The preliminary works started on 22 November 2021 and included setting up of the building site and creating a temporary Lodge in the Front Quad, as well as an extensive asbestos survey which yielded negative results. The main building works commenced on 29 November and are expected to last until March 2022. Maintaining the integrity of the architectural identity of the space as an Oxford college lodge within a Grade 1 listed building remained a key consideration throughout the design process and will guide the building works throughout the duration of the project. The choice of American ash, a hardwood with a mellow, light finish and a relatively straight grain as the material for the interior joinery will introduce a more contemporary appearance, yet respect the reference to a traditional college lodge, whilst its notable hard-wearing properties make it ideal for areas with high volume use. The joinery works will be carried out by the in-house team of Richard Ward to ensure a high quality finish. The use of ceramic tiles with a stone pattern for the Lodge floor and high quality, yet unassuming ironmongery fittings will complement the joinery works further . The railings and internal gates will be manufactured by Ben Prothero, a bespoke forged metalwork blacksmith. The pattern is a reference to the shape of the arched ceiling of the College entrance and the colour contrast between the black railings and brass handles will be used to draw the attention of the user to the functional elements of the installation. 50The display boards will be refurbished and a new monitor screen will be installed within the arched area to display information. At the same time, the environmental footprint of the proposed design has also been a key consideration. An insulating, permeable rendering will be used throughout the external walls of the Lodge, allowing the stone walls to breathe whilst delivering significant improvements in the thermal performance of the site. Secondary glazing, customised to match the joinery, has already been approved by the Oxford City conservation officer and will be installed in all windows using the same high quality timber and finish as in the rest of the Lodge areas. Lastly, even though the scope for excavation will be limited (mainly to allow the installation of the railings and the necessary cabling) the works will be supervised by a city archaeologist to ensure that any findings are recorded as necessary . Babis Karakoulas A temporary Lodge has been set up in Front Quad while the work is carried out 51Rector' s Seminars / Webinars and Subject Family Dinners 2020/21 During the academic year 2020/21 the pandemic made impractical the traditional format of in-person Rector's Seminars. Accordingly, with huge support from Amelia Crosse, Alumni Relations and Events Officer in the Development and Alumni Relations Office, the series moved online. This approach continued the arrangements, during the first lockdown, adopted in Trinity Term 2020. As before, during 2020/21 the online format often facilitated talks by individuals who could not have come to Oxford and, on each occasion, enabled attendance by audiences drawn from most corners of the world. In Michaelmas Term 2020 there were four such Webinars. Professor Conall Mac Niocaill (Tutor for Undergraduate Admissions and Fellow in Earth Sciences) spoke on the complex and sensitive topic of 'Oxford Admissions Explained'. Professor Joseph Nye (1958, PPE, and Honorary Fellow) gave a timely presentation, on 29 October, on 'Do Morals Matter? The American Election and Donald Trump'. Dr Dexnell Peters (Boskey Fellow in Atlantic History) spoke engagingly about 'Race and Politics in the Greater Caribbean during the Revolutionary Era'. David Webb (1983, Mathematics) presented a characteristically stimulating talk on 'Were the Lockdowns Worth the Socio-economic Cost?'. In addition, the Lyell Society of Exeter's earth scientists held a lively online event featuring brief talks from five recent alumni of the programme. In Hilary Term there were two general Webinars and two addressed to Exeter audiences identifying with particular disciplines. Chemistry Fellow Professor Philipp Kukura explained a complex subject very clearly when he spoke about 'Weighing Molecules with Light', discussing both basic research and a successful commercial spinout. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone struck a similar note in a talk skilfully focused on 'My journey from founding start-ups to serving founders of start-ups'. Law Fellow Professor Jonathan Herring addressed the College's Fortescue Society with a highly stimulating presentation on 'Law and the Relational Self'. Professor Neil Herring (Pre- Clinical Medicine) fascinated his audience with his cardiology research under the title 'Weathering an electrical storm: a matter of life and death'. Neil's talk relaunched the College's medical society as the Bannister Society, in memory of Sir Roger Bannister (1946, Physiological Sciences). During the Easter Vacation and Trinity Term some of the talks were aimed particularly at alumni in certain parts of the world. General Sir Richard Shirreff (1974, Modern History, and Honorary Fellow), former deputy supreme commander of NATO, usefully drew lessons across the usual boundaries of activity when he gave a talk on 'Battlefield to Boardroom: What might business learn from the military approach to managing risk?'. Professor Luciano Floridi (Ethics of Information) gave a presentation on the highly topical subject of 'AI Developments and Ethical Challenges'. Professor Mike Osborne (Engineering) tackled another pressing problem when he spoke about 'Technology at 52Work: The Future of automation'. Professor Nandini Das (English) gave a fascinating presentation on 'The World in a Box: Cabinets of Curiosity'. In addition, Professor Andrew Steane (Physics) presented a talk with profound implications on 'Science and Religion: A Humane Future'. I also note online talks, to Exeter subject family dinners - necessarily virtual in 2020/21 - by: Dr Francis Bischoff (Mathematics, to the Mathematical and Physical Sciences dinner) on 'The Hidden Geometry of Differential Equations'; Professor Dan Quigley (Economics, to the Social Sciences dinner) on 'What is Research in Economics?'; Dr Neil Herring (Medicine) on 'Being \"unsympathetic\" towards the heart' to the Medical and Life Sciences dinner; and by myself to the Languages and Literature dinner on 'Reflections on the Value of Studying Languages and Literature (from a former student of the same)'. Having acquired considerable momentum, attracting substantial audiences, the Webinar series of Rector's Seminars was poised to continue during academic year 2021/22. How far subject family dinners will remain virtual hung in the balance at time of writing. In any case, as the types of talk reviewed here demonstrated during 2020/21, the intellectual life of the College is weathering well the storms of the pandemic. Rick Trainor Co-founder of Twitter Biz Stone (left) spoke with Rick Trainor in a hybrid Rector' s Seminar/Webinar, which was broadcast to a global audience online while people attended the event in person in Cohen Quad 53OBITUARIES Peter Warner, 1963 - 2020 Peter died on 22nd June 2020, at the early age of 56, after a non-Covid illness of only a few weeks. His death was a profound shock to Exeter: although Peter had served the College as Fellow and Finance and Estates Bursar for only eleven months, he had had a very positive impact and had fully integrated himself into the life of Exeter. Peter was educated at St Alban's School and at St John's College, Oxford, where he took a First in Modern History. He then embarked on a highly successful career in the City, including senior posts at Lazard and at Gleacher Shacklock. In 2019, when Peter decided that the time had come to 'give back' to the University which had nurtured him as a young man, Exeter was very fortunate to obtain his services. During his time in the College's Bursary Peter applied his formidable financial and intellectual skills to a wide range of matters. For example, he prompted the College to adopt an investment policy with an explicit commitment to considering ethical (including environmental) issues. He also made progress on a number of important questions relating to the College's estates. In addition, Peter proved highly adept at dealing with unusual issues, of which by coincidence Exeter had an especially large number during 54his tenure. As Peter wryly remarked, his days at Exeter made his previous hectic work in mergers and acquisitions seem absolutely tranquil by comparison! In approaching such topics Peter brought to bear sharp analytical powers, extraordinary patience and persistence, a wealth of useful contacts, and a subtlety of approach which included an instinct for knowing when temporary inaction was the best way forward. These traits were also to the fore as Peter played a leading role in developing Exeter's approach to the early stages of the pandemic. Peter quickly established himself as a major player in College affairs. When he spoke, colleagues listened carefully, on a very wide range of issues. Peter also became an influential voice in the wider University as he gained the respect of fellow Finance and Estates Bursars in other colleges. Peter thoroughly enjoyed College life. He lunched regularly with other Fellows in the Old Bursary, showing a keen interest in all aspects of Exeter. He and his wife Sally, whom he had met in Oxford during his time at St John's, dined regularly at High Table. Peter was well known to, and well liked by, College staff, endearing himself to them, for example, with the spirited speech he gave when unexpectedly called upon at the annual staff Christmas dinner. And Peter made a point of getting to know Exeter students, forging a warm working relationship with JCR and MCR leaders in particular. Exeter derived the benefit of Peter as a remarkably well-rounded person who, for example, was a published novelist. He was deeply immersed in family life, taking a keen interest in each of his and Sally's four children. He was a mainstay of village life in Plumpton, Northamptonshire and - though he never allowed public affairs to influence his approach to Exeter life - a major figure in the politics of his part of the county. Peter was also a person of deeply philanthropic instincts, for example by serving as a trustee of The Northamptonshire Hope Centre, a homelessness charity. Peter was a warm person with a nuanced approach to life, whose intense human sympathies complemented his strong business instincts. In all that he did, he sought to serve society as a whole. The breadth of Peter's interests and friendships were on vivid display at his memorial service - delayed by the pandemic - at a packed St Mary's, the University Church, on 22 October 2021. Exeter played a major part in that event, which was led by the College Chaplain, sung by the College Choir, and followed by a lively reception in the Marquee in the Front Quad. This was highly appropriate: no one could have contributed more to a college in a short period than Peter did to Exeter. Rick Trainor (adapted from his welcome to Peter Warner's memorial service)55Dominic Donnelly (1958, Mathematics), 1937 - 2021 John Dominic Paul Donnelly (known as Dominic) came to Exeter in 1958, having already received a BSc from the University of Western Australia. Dominic obtained the highest mark in Mathematics when he sat his Finals, in 1962. He then left Oxford to work in industry, but soon came back, to the Computing Department, as Lecturer in Numerical Analysis. He returned to research and obtained his DPhil a few years later. Dominic was elected to a Fellowship at Exeter in 1970 and served as Official Fellow and Lecturer in Applied Mathematics for 34 years. He lived in College rooms overlooking the Fellows' Garden and at the time of his retirement, in 2004, was the College's most longstanding resident. Upon retirement he became an Emeritus Fellow. Dominic served Exeter in a variety of ways, beyond his primary responsibilities as a Tutorial Fellow, including as Sub-Rector 1973-7, and for many years as Senior Member of the Music Society and Treasurer of the Senior Common Room. In retirement Dominic continued to visit the College occasionally, and to offer assistance where he could. He thereby continued his long-standing interest in the College, including its history and traditions. Dominic died at his home in London in April 2021, aged 84. Rick Trainor 56Cyril Mango, 1928 - 2021 Cyril Mango, who has died aged 92, was a towering figure in the study of the Byzantine empire, the successor of Rome in the east Mediterranean. His approach was refreshingly unromantic. For him Byzantium was neither the heroic transmitter of pure Greek culture from the classical to the modern world, nor a paradise of Orthodox religiosity, but a history and culture which deserved to be studied in its own right. Mango was as happy studying brickstamps as sermons, and as knowledgeable on nuances of language as about the iconography of a saint. Occasionally he would wonder whether his wide-ranging approach to the past made him a master of none of it. In this he was wrong; his breadth of expertise made him an exceptionally complete scholar, respected, even revered, by historians, art-historians and archaeologists and - through 57his more popular writing, such as his Byzantium: The Empire of New Rome (1980) and his Byzantine Architecture (1986) - known beyond the world of academia. At heart he was a scholar, rather than a teacher, but all who were fortunate enough to attend his classes and seminars received a masterclass in good practice. The depth of his knowledge was formidable: in the space of a few minutes, a Byzantine text, a Turkish archaeological report, and a Russian traveller's account from the 18th century might all be brought into play, seemingly effortlessly, with the odd puff on an unlit pipe and the occasional wry smile. Cyril Alexander Mango was born on April 14 1928 in Istanbul to a Levantine family of a cosmopolitan type now sadly lost. His Greek great-grandfather, Dimitri, from the island of Chios, had settled in Istanbul in the 1840s, working as a printer for the Catholic church; his son, Anthony (Cyril's grandfather), founded with a Corfiot Italian the wonderfully named Foscolo-Mango Steamship Company, which shipped coal from Britain and the Baltic all over the Mediterranean, and became very rich. This commercial enterprise led to the establishment of an office in London and the beginnings of close family ties with Britain: Anthony's youngest son Alexander (Cyril's father) completed his schooling at a Methodist boarding school in Cambridge, and went on to read Law at Cambridge University. In around 1905 he became a naturalised British citizen, and, on returning to Istanbul, practised as a barrister in the consular court, trying cases (primarily civil) between British subjects. Anthony horrified his family by marrying a penniless refugee from the Bolshevik Revolution, Ada Damonov. Cyril was their youngest son, after Anthony (who pursued a career at the UN) and Andrew (an authority on modern Turkey, who worked for the BBC World Service and wrote a biography of Ataturk). In the family home, Ada and Alexander spoke French together (their common language), while Cyril and his brothers spoke Russian with their mother and Russian nanny, Greek or English with their father, and Turkish in the street. Until he was 12, Cyril was tutored at home, largely by a former tsarist officer, and then attended the Istanbul English High School for Boys, where he was introduced to the dubious pleasures of football and cricket. It was during these years that Mango developed a fascination with Istanbul's Byzantine past, sparked initially by the ruins of a monastery on the island of Prinkipo, where his grandfather had a summer residence. In his teens, he wandered all over the city, acquiring an unrivalled and invaluable knowledge of its topography and of its Byzantine and Ottoman remains. Influenced by a Scottish master at the High School, he left Turkey for the first time in 1946, to read Classics at St Andrews, an experience he never regretted, although there 58was no one on the teaching staff with an interest in Byzantium and he was exposed to the full rigours of Britain under rationing: tinned spaghetti on toast for high tea at 6pm represented a culinary high point. With an MA in 1949, he won a scholarship to study in Paris, where again he was essentially self-taught (this being before the revival of Paris as a great centre for the study of Byzantium), eventually completing a doctorate on the ceremonial entrance to Constantinople's imperial palace, which became his first published book. In 1951 he won a Junior Fellowship at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, a leading centre for Byzantine research, where he remained in various roles until 1963. These were good years: Dumbarton Oaks was a well-endowed institution, then still under the benign wing of its founder, Mildred Bliss. Scholars were able to get on with their work with few formal demands besides attending Mrs Bliss's regular afternoon teas, and with the opportunity to interact with an impressive stream of international visitors, there as fellows or simply passing through. A string of articles and books followed, many on aspects of Constantinople. In 1963 Mango accepted the Koraes Professorship of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies at King's College, London, but was never very happy in this role, and in 1968 he returned to Dumbarton Oaks as Professor of Byzantine Archaeology. In 1973 he took up the Bywater and Sotheby Professorship of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at Oxford, a post he held until retirement in 1995. Until a stroke in 2016, he remained an active presence at Oxford's Byzantine seminars, a tutelary god of his discipline for all. He is survived by his wife, Marlia, a fellow Byzantine scholar, whom he met at Dumbarton Oaks, and by two daughters from previous marriages.

Fondly remembered by so many students and Fellows who were at Exeter at that time, here we reproduce some of the tributes paid to him. As Exeter College chaplain, Graham was also my tutor in Theology and Church History. I well remember the regular pleasure / ordeal of reading out that week's essay to such a formidable (though kindly) critic, who could convey a great deal of intellectual pain with just an elevated eyebrow! Graham's wisdom and support were especially valued during my Final exams. I had the privilege of speaking with Graham six weeks before his passing, when I was moved and inspired - not only by his personal bravery, but also how much he was consoled and strengthened by his Christian faith. Malcolm Sumner Graham was chaplain for the whole time that I was at Exeter College. He prepared me for confirmation and was a trusted confidante to many. He attended and officiated at my wedding and I am sure he did this for many others. Aside from his pastoral role, many will remember his politically incorrect sherry and delicious biscuits served with undrinkably weak tea - one leaf or two? Rest in Peace, Graham. Nick Avery I knew Graham when I was an English Fellow at Exeter College. He was wise and witty and good company. I remember him with affection and admiration for his patience and insight. I became Sub-Rector in 1983, responsible for student welfare, and he was an invaluable source of advice. May he rest in peace. Paul Hamilton Graham beautifully alloyed intellectual rigour and kindness. I heard him give many sermons at Exeter College and at St Giles in Farnborough, where he presided over our wedding. My wife and I had to make the two-hour round trip to St Giles once a month to get onto the electoral roll but it was worth it to hear him preach. I recall many of the things he said over the years, shards of wisdom to treasure and meditate over. In that way he will be with me for many years to come. Whether one was a Christian or not Graham was a dominant character at the College whilst he was Chaplain. Socially conservative, his very liberal theology tended to make him popular with most agnostics and atheists in the College and antagonised many Christians 60(especially those in OICCU). I came up to College as a Christian apprehending a seemingly bizarre hostility between OICCU and Graham. I was the only person in my year to join Exeter's CU but I also joined Graham every morning for Mattins in the Chapel before breakfast. Graham taught me much about Christian thought and also about life. In an era when few worried about student mental health, Graham provided counselling to the College community regardless of their faith and was a source of comfort to many undergraduates. His sermons were second to none in interest, challenge and educational value. Graham became a friend although I failed to see him as often as I should have. He not only presided over my wedding but attended our 25th Anniversary as a guest. A few weeks before he died he called me out of the blue 'to say goodbye'. True to form, he did not want to speak about himself but to enquire about the family. He said that he was leaving this life fully reconciled to his departure and happy with his lot. His illness tired him and after 30 minutes he had to go and I finally said a final farewell to a man who embodied sympathetic intelligence and human wisdom. Andrew Speirs Graham was my tutor during a troubled first year at Exeter College, during which I struggled with my choice of theology as a study subject, eventually abandoning it in favour of English. This was no reflection on his tutoring abilities, as he always made the subject interesting and drew out the elements that had attracted me to it in the first place. He was also immensely kind, encouraging, funny and very patient with a struggling first year student and the tutorials were always a pleasure. I'm delighted to hear what a rich and contented life he went on to enjoy, and how much his warmth and intelligence were valued by all he encountered. Matthew Lebus I knew Graham during my time at Exeter College. I best remember his interest in people and his gentle persona. It was great to have enjoyed his company and counsel over sherry and cheese footballs - a welcome diversion from the intellectual and emotional challenges of undergraduate life. Alex Minford I remember Graham from when I attended Exeter College, particularly from the study groups he hosted. Many true words recur through these tributes to describe Graham and I'd agree with those - he was kind, thoughtful, incisively intelligent, tolerant, engaging and very positive to be around. For those qualities and many others, you will be much missed and well remembered, Graham. NP61Since meeting you, Graham, in 1979, life has been that much more marvellous. I remember you unexpectedly stealing through the Fellows' gate into Exeter College garden in Trinity term 1981, a group of us undergraduates debating and flirting in the sunshine - how you lit us all up as a 'perfect picture postcard'. I remember your Thursday lunchtimes - free food for all - you lying full stretch on the floor of your rooms and snoozing during the guest speaker's talk. I remember your reading of George Herbert's poems for a special service in Chapel. Studying The Book of Job with you and my fellow English undergraduates. Your no-notes sermons before Holy Communion. I remember you saying, 'Jonathan, I've just been to my first Quaker meeting', and later, 'I have a publisher for my book!' You used to read draft chapters from that book to us, and I remember hearing you clattering it out on a typewriter as I passed beneath your rooms on my way to rugby training. 'What an energetic man you are, Jonathan,' you'd say. I thought you were the one with all the energy. Your writings will remain precious to me. You are, yes, a pioneer of faith. It's time for a re-print of God In Our Hands, surely, and that you should be on the syllabus for all theology departments and colleges, and included in the new Quaker Faith and Practice. Though I do remember that rebuke when I asked you if you'd sent a copy of Cost of Authority to the Vatican - 'That would be a little presumptuous, Jonathan.' Thank you for phoning me to say you were going on ahead. One of the first things you told me when I was Sacristan to Exeter College Chapel, 'Jonathan, Cranmer's prayer book is an essential part of your literary education.' So it proved to be. And at the end, for your funeral, you are still the Grand Inquisitor's gracious antagonist, listening serenely to his 'miracle, mystery and authority', then cheerfully, courageously going your own pioneering and Galilean way. Jonathan Wooding62David Wright (1952, Music), 1934 - 2021 David went up to Oxford to read music and take up the post of the Parry Organ Scholar at Exeter College in 1952. At the time, Exeter College was one of the very few Oxford colleges that recruited local boys to sing with the College undergraduates who formed the alto, tenor and bass sections of the Chapel Choir. Whilst at Oxford, David took his Fellow of the Royal College of Organists (FRCO) examination and was awarded the prestigious Limpus Prize, the first prize for practical performance in that session's FRCO examinations. When injuries sustained from a bell-ringing accident meant that he needed to extend his time in Oxford, David took up the role as Assistant Organist at New College, where he worked with three eminent directors of music - HK Andrews, Henry Ley and Meredith Davies. During his Oxford years, David conducted various choral and orchestral groups, including the Exonian Singers and Exeter Orchestra, and 63was secretary of the Oxford University Musical Club and Union. His friendships at Oxford included the comedian and actor Dudley Moore, who played in the violin section of David's orchestra, and the playwright Alan Bennett. He also recalled Sir Roger Bannister in the Exeter College common room having just run the first four-minute mile. With the organ scholar's room at Exeter College at the time enjoying a prime location on Broad Street, David's window was a well known useful entry point into College for late-night revelling students 'after hours' when the College entrance was locked, and David was happy to oblige by placing a sofa under the window for anyone who might slip. David had been born in 1934 in Leamington Spa, shortly after which the family moved to Birmingham. With the outbreak of war, the family chose to relocate to Barmouth to avoid the risk of bombing in Birmingham, and it was in Barmouth that David took his first piano lessons and sang in the choir. At the age of eight he then joined the choir of Lichfield Cathedral, where he sang until the age of 10, also starting to learn the organ with Ambrose Porter. On returning to Birmingham, he continued his studies under Philip Cranmer and Wills Grant at King Edward's School, and he joined the choir of Birmingham Cathedral, where he sang for several years, initially as a boy and then an alto. On leaving Oxford in 1957, David took up the posts of Organist and Choirmaster at St. Botolph's (known as 'the Stump'), Boston, Lincolnshire and music master at Boston Grammar School. As Organist and Choirmaster at the Stump, he led the musical life of the community for over 40 years, until his retirement in 1999. He led the choir in several broadcasts of Choral Evensong on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Overseas Service and in BBC TV broadcasts. David also conducted the Boston Choral Society for many years, leading performances of many of the great works in the choral society tradition. He oversaw the restoration of the Stump's Harrison & Harrison organ in 1987, and made two commercially available recordings on the instrument, issued in 1987 and 1992. On a visit to Boston in the 1970s, the then-serving Prime Minister Edward Heath specifically requested an opportunity to hear and play the organ at the Stump, resulting in David and Edward Heath turning pages for each other in the loft as they took turns to play the instrument. In 2019, David's services to church music in Boston were recognised by an honorary award from the Royal School of Church Music, when David was made an Associate of the Royal School of Church Music at a ceremony in Salisbury Cathedral. As a teacher, David was responsible for inspiring generations of pupils in Boston, through his private instrumental lessons on the piano and organ, and his role as Head of Music at Boston Grammar School from 1957 to 1999. He was also an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (having completed his training under Herbert Howells). 64David enjoyed all things mechanical, including old cars (with much time spent on his classic 1930s Bentley), and had an interest in astronomy and physics (having studied the then-nascent topic of nuclear physics when in the sixth form). He was passionately interested in sound recording and hi-fi technology, and had a love of poetry, Latin, much classic literature, and the impressionist painters. He was also a keen photographer, carrying out his own dark-room processing and printing. In the 1980s and 1990s he took up table tennis, initially with son Toby, and competed in the local league for several seasons. David married Joan (herself an Associate of the Royal College of Music) in 1961. David moved to Winchester in early 2020 to be closer to his son and daughter-in-law, Toby and Sarah, and his grandchildren, Martha and Freya. He passed away in Winchester in January 2021. Toby Wright 65Roger Horrell (1955, Modern History), 1935 - 2021 Roger Horrell, who has died aged 85, was a senior MI6 officer who contributed significantly to the transfer of power from the white Rhodesian government to the black government of the newly independent Zimbabwe, culminating in the Lancaster House conference of 1979. Africa became part of Horrell's life during National Service with the Devonshire Regiment at the time of the Mau Mau Emergency in Kenya. He fell in love with the country and developed an affection and respect for Africans. After leaving the Army he joined the Colonial Service and in 1959 was posted back to Kenya as a District Officer. He served there until independence, winning the co- operation of often fiercely independent local chiefs through persuasion and subtlety . On one occasion, however, he allowed himself to be influenced by a well-meaning Canadian woman into condemning witchcraft at a tribal meeting. The result was mass defiance and a threatened riot, averted only by his promise to produce the District Commissioner promptly. The Commissioner, a devout Christian, wisely reassured the tribal chieftains that witchcraft would not be discouraged. When Horrell handed over to his African successor his final report vividly illustrated the responsibilities of often youthful colonial officers - grazing schemes, irrigation, famine relief, elections, administration of justice, school building, encouraging school attendance, trade, sanitation, resolving land disputes, maintaining war graves, etc. A constant problem, he said later, was dealing with criticism from some of the white settlers for focusing too much on the well-being of Africans. On leaving the Colonial Service Horrell was recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6). After training he was posted to Dubai, then a British Protectorate, but his African experience was required and he was subsequently posted to Kampala, then, from 1976 to 1980, to Lusaka. Zambia was at the time home to militant refugees from the rebel Smith regime in Rhodesia, turning Lusaka into the centre of political resistance. Ever since Smith's illegal declaration of independence in 1965 the issue of Rhodesia had made for strained and fractious relations between Britain and much of the Third World. Lusaka became a focal point for British diplomacy in Africa and heading the MI6 station there was a key posting. Horrell made it his business to establish contacts with 66Rhodesian exiles of all tribes, shades and factions, getting to know them well and, in almost all cases, winning their confidence. When Margaret Thatcher and Lord Carrington convened the Lancaster House conference in 1979 to negotiate the handover to majority rule in the new Zimbabwe, Horrell's work in winning the trust of the competing parties - and the intelligence he produced for the conveners - proved crucial. Following Lusaka, Horrell spent the rest of his career in London. Given charge of MI6's African operations, he immediately faced a range of problems, from entrenched military rule in Nigeria, through two insurgent wars in Angola and Mozambique, to maintaining stability in Zimbabwe, tackling the corrupt diversion of aid funds in various Commonwealth states, and finally to the process of change in South Africa. He did much to improve the British government's understanding and acceptance of the key players in South Africa, deepening MI6's already well-established relationship with the ANC. This proved essential in supporting peaceful transition to majority rule. Horrell was next appointed MI6's director of personnel and administration with a mandate to increase accountability and encourage a more self-critical culture, complementing the buccaneering ethos which, though responsible for many successes, needed modernising. Although not universally welcomed at the time, this was later acknowledged to have improved both performance and accountability. It was also at this time that the Major government publicly acknowledged the existence of MI6, leading to its establishment by statute and to Parliamentary oversight. In dealing with personnel matters, Horrell demonstrated a well-developed sense of fairness based on firm liberal foundations, displaying sympathy and support for colleagues going through a wide range of personal and relationship issues. That he was not chosen to become C - as the Chief of SIS is traditionally known - was a disappointment to many who had worked with him. It was felt at the time in Whitehall that there was a need to bring on a new and younger generation of senior leaders, and so Horrell and most of his peers duly retired. Roger Horrell was born on July 9 1935 at Dartmouth, the son of a butcher. Unusually, his father had knowledge of Latin and spoke French, a useful attribute when French and Belgian refugees arrived in the town in 1940. In February 1943 the German Luftwaffe raided Dartmouth and strafed the sea front, where young Roger was playing with a friend, narrowly missing them.67He attended Shebbear College, a private boarding school, where he excelled both academically and in sport, playing rugby for Devon Schoolboys. He also had a talent for acting. During his National Service he was Senior Under Officer at his Eaton Hall passing-out parade, receiving the Sword of Honour from Princess Margaret. Following National Service, and with effective Latin tutoring from his father, he was accepted by Exeter College, Oxford, to read Modern History. He captained the College's rugby and cricket teams. Horrell was appointed OBE in 1974 and CMG in 1988. His retirement was dogged by failing eyesight and worsening emphysema, but he remained mentally active as an astute and talented bridge enthusiast, playing regularly at the Reform and Garrick clubs. In 1970 he married Patricia Binns, with whom he had a daughter, and a son, who predeceased him. He and his wife separated in 1975; she and their daughter survive him.

His childhood was spent in New Cross, South London, and was disrupted by war. In 1951 he entered National Service in the Royal Fusiliers. From there he was recruited by the Intelligence Corps to study Russian at the Joint School for Linguists in Cambridge. He went on to Exeter College, Oxford, where he studied English from 1953 to 1956. Whilst at Oxford Peter was a pupil of Professor Nevill Coghill and with him produced an OUD's production of As You Like It. College drama was important to Peter at this time. He directed a production of The Male Animal by James Thurber and also toured Europe with a student production of King Lear. It was through drama that he met our mother, Shirley, who survives him. Peter gained a graduate traineeship at the BBC and spent the next 32 years making television programmes. He was a producer in News, Current Affairs, Education, Continuing Education, The Money Programme and Panorama. Peter loved languages, being fluent in French and Russian, devising teaching programmes in these languages. In the 1970s, for seven years, he was Arts Director of programming for the Open University, when access to study through television was expanding. 69During his time at the BBC, Peter's work earnt him several commendations. In 1974, a Money Programme edition called The Father of Europe, about the Major European problems of the day, won the Monnet Prize, given by the Commission for European Communities. In a letter from Huw Weldon, Director General in 1981, Peter's sound editorial judgement, professionalism and reliability were noted, as was his ability to enthuse and engage trainees, along with a flair for good man management and organisation. Towards the end of his career he made the programmes of which he was most proud, initiating the magazine programme for the deaf, See Hear. He was a passionate advocate of teaching sign and never forgot what he had learnt, even up to his death. Peter had a long, happy retirement. He enjoyed living in Dorset, gardening, travelling and the U3A. He was a kind, funny and interesting man and a generous host. He is much missed by his whole family. Anna Foster, Matt Dunkley and Charlotte Dunkley Images: Peter with his wife Shirley at Exeter Ball (left) and at their golden wedding anniversary (above)70Robin Wallace (1955, Medicine) Dr Robin Wallace of Middletown, Rhode Island, crossed the bar at home on March 20, 2021, after a long struggle, without complaint, with prostate cancer. Born Alan Robin Gordon Wallace on November 20, 1936, in Weymouth, England, he was the only child of Dr Gordon and Muriel Wallace. Robin grew up sailing in Weymouth with his father. Robin graduated with a Degree in Medicine from Exeter College in Oxford University. He first visited Newport in 1964, when his father was Commodore of the Royal Dorset Yacht Club, the Challenger of Record, for the British America's Cup Challenge, as well as Fleet Surgeon; the same position his son would hold years later for the New York Yacht Club. Robin desired to do his residency in the United States, and did so at the Children's Hospital in Boston. After completing his residency in the United States, he moved to Newport, and established his practice in association with Dr Fred Pearce at the Aquidneck Medical Associates. Soon after he commenced his practice, although a British Citizen, Robin was drafted into the U.S. Army where he served in Vietnam as a Major in the Medical Corps. After his service, he returned to his practice on Memorial Boulevard until retirement in 2003. He remained however the 'school doctor' for St. George's School until 2017. 71To describe Robin as an icon in Newport is an understatement. Robin quickly established himself, not only as a sought after paediatrician but also as an avid promoter of sailing. As a member of the Ida Lewis Yacht Club he and his predecessor, Race Committee Chairman Robert Conner, were determined to establish new standards of excellence in race management. They trained the members of the Club and at the same time introduced to America a European type of level ocean racing called 'ton' racing. The race series for the Sail Cup was an instant success and showcased the race management competence of the Ida Lewis Yacht Club, for which it is nationally recognized today. Robin not only worked on the water, he promoted sailing events for Newport. As the Chairman of the State Yachting Committee, for over seventeen years, he educated the state legislators in the tremendous economic impact that sailing produced for the state. Probably the most successful events for Newport and the State of Rhode Island were the V olvo Races in 2015 and 2018 which, it is fair to say, would not have stopped in Newport without the efforts of the State Yachting committee advocating for the release of state funding required to support the event. Sailing was not Robin's only love. He was devoted to St. George's School. He conducted morning 'sick call' at the school for over thirty-five years and was instrumental in upgrading the health centre and the general wellness of the St. George's community. His gentle and respectful manner gained the confidence of many teenagers and they often sought his counsel and advice. He attended football and hockey games, home and away, to provide immediate medical attention to players on both teams in the event of injury. His devotion to the student athletes was recognized by the school when he was inducted into its Athletic Hall of Fame several years ago. After the loss of the America's Cup in 1983, Robin was one of the founding members of Sail Newport, a public sailing organization that provides sailing instruction and boating facilities to the public. Currently all 4th graders in the Newport school system are introduced to sailing at Sail Newport. The organization also runs regattas and hosts many different sailing events and activities that contribute to the betterment of the entire community. Robin was a Commodore of Ida Lewis Yacht Club and also a long time member of the New York Yacht Club. He was active in race management at both clubs this past season as sailing was one of the sports that one was able to participate in during the pandemic. He was also a long time active member of the Newport Reading Room. Robin has been long loved by several generations of his paediatric patients and their parents and will be greatly missed by them and a wide spectrum of friends in Newport and beyond. Printed courtesy of Newport Daily News72An interview with Honorary Fellow Sir Antonio Pappano Sir Antonio Pappano - the distinguished and acclaimed conductor whose tenure includes a 20-year stint at the Royal Opera House as Music Director, after which he will take up the position of Chief Conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra in 2024 - is full of surprises. The opera giant, highly esteemed across the world, is perhaps not the typical Music Director one might expect. Far from being formidable or demanding, a reputation which can be synonymous with conductors, he is a cheerful, likeable and approachable man: one who exudes great energy and passion for what he does, while remaining thoughtful when talking about it. I spoke to him one afternoon over the phone during a gap in his busy schedule before he flew to New York for work. One thing that might surprise some is that Sir Antonio - or Tony as he is known to those in the music world - never trained to be a conductor (in the formal sense). Raised in a musical household, he tells me that he started taking piano lessons aged six; by 10 he was the 'house accompanist for the family business', helping his father who was a voice teacher. It wasn't just opera that he learned at such a young age - Sir Antonio credits his piano teacher Norma Verrillie with shaping him into a 'fully rounded musician' who 'knew about all the different types of music', ranging from early music, to the American songbook, to contemporary music. Rather than going to university, he continued helping his father with the business until his early 20s, when he began working for opera companies as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur (someone who is both an accompanist and vocal coach). Conducting seems to have come along a bit later in life, mainly encouraged by singers who said 'you play the piano as if it's an orchestra' and recommended he try out conducting. When asked about what makes a conductor great, the main message I took from his answer was 'you have to be a really good, all-rounded musician'. It's clear that this practical, hands-on experience was formative in his musical upbringing from a very young age and is still reflected in his musical output today, when he can be seen accompanying many singers from the Royal Opera House. Sir Antonio's accent is hard to place: perhaps this is the result of being born in London to Italian parents, then moving to the USA, before working all around Europe in his early years as a conductor. One particularly notable position was assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Bayreuth, the festival which celebrates the operas of Wagner. Indeed, while Sir Antonio is not exclusively an opera conductor - he has also been the Music Director of the Orchestra dell'Academia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome since 2005 - opera is clearly his true love. He describes being 'intoxicated with the idea of putting acting and staging and singing and playing all together to create something that is larger than life itself'. 73As we speak, it becomes clear to me that Sir Antonio is someone with an abundance of energy and, frankly, an incredible work ethic. When asked specifically about this, the conductor immediately linked the sense of work ethic to his immigrant background and Italian parents, who instilled in him the spirit of 'doing anything and everything'. Speaking more widely about work ethic and the Royal Opera House, he said it has been a joy: 'I recognised my energy there ... we're there to create drama and so the orchestra and chorus demand a certain theatricality as well as a collaborative spirit' which naturally results in hard work. It is remarkable that Sir Antonio's passion and enthusiasm for opera and classical music has remained so constant across the past 18 months, in a time when the arts in general have been put under great strain. For the conductor, it all goes back to the power of music: 'as human beings, we crave the experience of sharing music and the community it brings with it, as well as the very personal thing each and every one of us takes away from it. Music has culturally warmed us, it's all tangled up with our emotions and our emotional intelligence: what it is to be empathic, to be open to new sounds, new languages, new cultures and just to be a good human being. Someone who's using their brain'. This discussion of the power of music also related to his comments on the importance of, and lack of in some cases, an education in music: 'it's been proven that some kind of contact to music and learning of an instrument or singing gives to the brain something that no other discipline gives, and is crucial to development. How many times does that need to be said? When it comes to schools, that sometimes falls on deaf ears'. I said before that Sir Antonio Pappano is a man of surprises. Something which certainly surprised me was his answer to my curiosity about the music he listens to in his free time - a concept that is clearly a rarity for the conductor. While he admitted he spends lots of time listening to classical music for work, as well as edits of recordings, he highlighted jazz piano players and jazz singers as being among his favourites, as well as Joni Mitchell: 'she gets under my skin'. Seeing as he was preparing for another concert as well as a flight to New York, I had to wrap up the conversation. But before we said our goodbyes I was curious to ask how he felt being made an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College. 'For someone who didn't go to university', he remarked, 'I feel pretty shocked and pleased. I think I've worked very hard in life and people tell me I can be proud of the things I've done but a signal like this is really very special, of course it is'. As a Music graduate and former opera company director, I for one am thrilled that someone so important in the opera world, as well as someone so enthusiastic about music, is joining the Exeter community. Zerlina Vulliamy74Twenty Years In The Making If I look back through the tunnel of twenty years, I see this boy, graceful, and more: fuelled by a weird Desire to be graceful; and yet, I can count the fears Possessing him, a string on an abacus whose beads Addle and grin like the simplest numbers: far less Than what he might have wished-for, and more Like the way that wish was pressed, all unrest, With the sense of a muffled, of a broken need. And here he is again, a whittled number now Held in sight of a whittled eye. And below The surface of twenty years: the far deeper show - A sort of beast disclosed, revealed by a human sound. It's so darned long ago. And long ago, when love Was a round corner he grappled with, the long If Young men greet in so many different ways. Twenty years are flown. And twenty years that stay. And perhaps the way the years have fallen Are no one's fault, but mine. But to begin the effort To uncoil the spring, to unlock the bone-sad bales And sheaves of meaning, is a project for a different man, Older, younger - who can tell? For the harvest of these Passing years goes summed in two stark ways: I survived A human terror - but lived beneath the tenor of what was Always meant for me. And any winnings through it all Are like twenty and like ten: two different numbers Speaking to each other across a wind-picked valley. So many things I wished for, things set deep in me, Things for which I built, as best I could, my fort Of life, have been split and sundered from my mind. But I look back across the rough topography of twenty Years, feel my feet whisper across the hard-pressed turf, And think that, for all that, I've been luckier than most.

The 'Say on Climate' initiative proposes that listed companies disclose emissions, present a detailed climate action transition plan, and, most importantly, hold an annual mandatory shareholder vote on climate action transition plans.2 The initiative is run by the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, which was created by British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn and which has GBP 5.2 billion in assets. 'Say on Climate' is targeting companies, asset owners, asset managers, proxy advisors and regulators. The initiative aims particularly at the UK and Italy, chairs of this year's G7 and G20 summits, to make 'Say on Climate' a priority for the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK. This essay assesses the potential of 'Say on Climate' by first looking at Climate Change as a negative systemic externality in Corporate Governance. Then, it discusses whether making 'Say on Climate' mandatory can accelerate the transition to a net zero carbon economy. I. Climate change as the ultimate systemic negative externality Since the beginning of industrialisation, the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gases (together CO2-e) has led to a rise in global average temperatures, which has disastrous effects on the biosphere. According to a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2018, human civilisation is on track to cause global warming of at least a 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2052, thereby surpassing the Paris Agreement's limit.3 Greenhouse-gas concentration will continue to increase, exacerbated via positive feedbacks such as melting permafrost and the release of stored methane. Should no further action be taken to reduce emissions, global temperatures will be 4.1\u00b0C-4.8\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century.4 As a result of 'doing business as usual', in the year 2100 average global incomes could be reduced by 23%, and current and future global GDP by 33% and 7% respectively.5 1 This essay won the 2021 Oxford Business Law Blog Essay Competition on 'Business Law and the Transition to a Net Zero Carbon Economy' and was published on 13 July 2021 under www.law.ox. ac.uk/business-law-blog/bl og/2021/07/say-no-climate-change-say-yes-say-climate.

According to the 'Say on climate' initiative, only 3% of listed companies have science-based emissions targets and less than 0.3% have a plan to reach those targets.6 Corporate law, whose goal is to advance the aggregate welfare of all who are affected by a firm's activities, must lend itself to be part of the solution. Corporate actors must be incentivised, obliged, and disciplined to abate, stop or possibly even reverse climate change and its effects. Given the scale and magnitude of the problem, it is clear from the outset that 'Say on Climate' can only be a single small patch next to others to fill the regulatory void. II. 'Say on Climate' can help the transition to a net zero carbon economy The distinctive feature of 'Say on Climate' vis-\u00e0-vis other initiatives is the vote at the annual general meeting. 'Say on Climate' puts the decision over the climate action transition plans in the hands of the shareholders. The question arises whether they have the incentives and the ability to judge on a firm's efforts to reduce emissions. Reducing the carbon footprint is costly and not profitable for individual firms and managers. Undiversified shareholders also do not have a monetary incentive to gather information, monitor and vote on climate change action plans, and to sack climate-negligent management. Undiversified shareholders, however, have become the exception in public markets. Institutional investors, such as active and passive investment funds, pension funds and hedge funds, hold a diversified range of assets under management for their beneficiaries. Recent scholarship has shown that institutional investors, who care about their diversified portfolio rather than firm-specific returns, can help to internalise systemic market externalities by engaging with their portfolio companies.7 As 'universal owners', institutional investors are much more concerned about public markets in their entirety, and so it is in their proper interest to reduce idiosyncratic climate risk exposure. Institutional investors today hold 41% of the global market capitalisation and manage 80% of the listed shares in the US and 68% of the listed shares in the UK, respectively.8 In 2017, the big three investment funds Vanguard and State Street alone held an average of 20.5% of stakes and cast an average of 25% of the votes in director elections in US S&P 500 companies.9 Passive index funds are now said to account for at least 45% of all assets for US stock-based funds.10 Nevertheless, critic Robert G. Eccles has described the initiative 'well-intentioned, futile, and a drain on the engagement bandwidth of investors'.11 'Say on Climate' 6 Children's Investment Fund Foundation, 'Say on Climate - Shareholder voting on climate transition action plans' (April 2021) www.sayonclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shareholder-votes-on- climate-transition-action-plans-09042021-1.pdf accessed 1 July 2021. 7 See n 4 above; see also Anna Christie, 'The Agency Costs of Sustainable Capitalism' (2021) UC Davis Law Review, Forthcoming. 8 OECD, 'Owners of the World's Listed Companies' (2019) OECD Capital Market Series, 6 and 38. 9 Lucian A Bebchuk and Scott Hirst, 'The Specter of the Giant Three' (2019) 99(3) BU L Rev 721, 724. 10 Jeff Cox, 'Passive investing automatically tracking indexes now controls nearly half the US stock market' CNBC (19 March 2019) www.cnbc.com/2019/03/19/passive-investing-now-controls-nearly- half-the-us-stock-market.html accessed 1 July 2021. 11 Robert G Eccles, 'Here Is My Say On \"Say On Climate\"' Forbes (5 January 2021) www.forbes.com/ sites/bobeccles/2021/01/05/here-is-my-say-on-say-on-climate/?sh=4671e7dc5c49 accessed 1 July 2021.78struggles with the legacy of its namesake 'Say on Pay'. The main reason why 'Say on Pay' is regarded by some as a rubber stamp exercise that has led to little control over executive pay is that shareholders care mostly about resolutions that directly affect their returns.12 Under the current regime, the fiduciary duty of institutional investors towards their ultimate beneficiaries may not even imply any obligation to vote the stocks of portfolio companies, when voting costs are high and returns are low.13 On the other hand, BlackRock alone estimates a USD 8.2 billion risk in its portfolio due to climate change in case emissions will not be reduced.14 Thus, for institutional investors 'Say on Climate' should be a very different exercise from 'Say on Pay'. According to news reports, voting records of asset managers in practice so far are weak but improving.15 As Eccles suggests, coordination and selective action could take the edge of his limited- engagement-bandwidth argument.16 Correspondingly, more and more institutional investors have started to coordinate via platforms seeking to fight climate change. Climate Action 100+, for example, currently comprises more than 570 institutional investors, representing over 50% of all global assets under management.17 With pooled resources, institutional investors target the worst polluters, which is a promising start since the top 20 oil, natural gas and coal companies alone emitted 35% of all CO2-e from fossil fuel and cement emissions worldwide between 1965 and 2018.18 Besides the interest in portfolio rather than firm-specific returns, passive index funds' incentive to act on Environmental, Social and Governance issues (ESG) has also been explained by the fact that they seek to attract millennials, who will soon profit from the 'Great Transfer' of USD 12-30 trillion in assets from perishing baby boomers and who have social preferences over wealth-maximisation.19 According to a famous letter to investors from BlackRock manager Larry Fink in 2019, 63% of the soon-to-be-heirs in the 'millennial' generation wish their investments to have a social impact rather than to make profit.20 Adding to the effectiveness of 'Say on Climate', policymakers could extend fiduciary duties of asset managers to include environmental preferences on equal footing with the beneficiaries' monetary interest. This will enable institutional investors to openly push for CO2-e emission reduction in their portfolio companies, even when it 12 Jill Fisch et al, 'Is Say on Pay all about Pay?

Such a policy could also encourage asset managers to invest more in casting informed votes. As regards mandatory environmental disclosure, the general impact on a firm's individual performance is still subject to an ongoing debate. While Eccles points to a report by the University of Cambridge, which states that 'compelling evidence of a causal relationship between disclosure and improved performance is lacking',21 a more recent paper found that making disclosure of emissions mandatory for companies listed in the UK led to a reduction of 14-18 % of CO2-e emissions without detriment to financial operating performance.22 Thus, environmental disclosure is not overly burdensome for individual firms. The 'Say on Climate' initiative aims at listed corporations only, which is an important start, as listed companies are estimated to account for over 80% of all industrial emissions.23 However it must be taken into account that especially in the fossil fuel extraction sector, only 30% of the 224 major companies are public investor owned24 and so the danger of 'leakage' of brown investment and activity from public to private companies must be kept in mind. Given these considerations, complementary regulatory action is needed to stimulate climate change action in non-listed firms. Conclusion Fighting climate change is pressing. The failure to internalise the costs of CO2-e emissions must be urgently remedied. Regulators should come to aid and give shareholders a 'Say on climate'. As current research has shown, they are able and incentivised to make good use of it. Further, the yearly reminder through a shareholder vote could abate cognitive biases which lead management to believe that business can continue as usual. The costs of imposing 'Say on Climate' now do not seem overly burdensome for individual companies. Thus, a mandatory 'Say on Climate' shareholder vote in public corporations is a small but meaningful contribution to accelerate the transition to a net zero emission economy.

It has proved a good lesson. In his own case Dacre produced, at the end of his remarkable record of scholarship, a number of controversial and revelatory articles about early Roman history to which, until he was well into his sixties, he had devoted little attention. I hope that my discovery, reported here and made in my seventies, and my new book about it are worthy of Messrs Balsdon and Kirwan. The book is about the Zinoviev letter of 1924. It begins with the following words: 'This short book turns on its head the history of the Zinoviev letter of October 1924 and of all that year's melancholy legacy. 'It shows that Grigory Zinoviev, chairman of the Soviet-controlled Comintern and a member with Trotsky and Stalin of the Bolshevik Politburo of the Soviet Union, wrote the letter to the British Communist Party, telling them to manipulate the Labour Party, which was hostile to Communist aims, so as to move the Labour Party to a revolutionary position. 'It shows that Zinoviev's letter was not a fabrication by White Russians or by British elements hostile to Mr MacDonald's Labour Government, as has been widely believed for almost a hundred years.' It was the belief of some in the Labour Party that Mr MacDonald lost the election of October 1924 because of a plot between forces in the Conservative Party, the Press, and the diplomatic and intelligence services that soured, in some cases poisoned, relations in our political life for so long. That malign effect is still at work in some quarters. How can it be that a student of Russian, above all, Soviet history, nearing the end of his life, living in the wilds, with almost no access to libraries and little to the internet, made such a discovery? The clue to the answer is in the book's dedication: 'In memory of Judy, my dearly loved and much loving wife, who helped me so much with this book in her last year.' Judy was an undergraduate at St Anne's while I was at Exeter. For four years and more until her death in May I was caring for Judy at home after she began to suffer from myeloma. Amid the chemo, housework, shopping, cooking and washing we found great happiness. I had twenty or thirty minutes a day to read, and made this great discovery. I devoted the time to the memoirs of Soviet citizens who, from the 1920s had managed to escape 81to the West from the tyranny that Lenin and Trotsky had created and that they had often loyally served, to their later regret and shame. Many such memoirs were printed in Russian, in Moscow, for the first time during the brief period of freedom inaugurated by President Yeltsin. Some had been available, in Russian, in the West for a while in the 1930s, but later only in mangled, abridged English versions. Students of this remarkable literature discover that deep truths are found etched into the minds and hearts of those who suffered under Lenin and Stalin and their successors. In the words of Solzhenitsyn, they wished no longer 'to live according to the Lie'. They wrote the truth. My discovery is owed to three books, two by Georgy Agabekov, and a third by Grigory Besedovsky. Besedovsky, a diplomat, found himself under threat from his own side and he fled from the Soviet Embassy in Paris with his family on the second of October 1929. He wrote his book about these events and his career, entitled Revelations of a Soviet Diplomat, in two parts, the first dated December 1929, the second March 1930. At that time every thing must have been vivid in his memory. It is an impressive document. Besedovsky writes that, in the summer of 1924, after the failure of the Soviet-backed attempted coup in Germany in the previous autumn, the Comintern in Moscow was directing its fire at Britain. Well informed about the Communist International as well as the Soviet diplomatic service, he writes of Britain and of the left wing of the Labour Party: 'In the Comintern it was reckoned that this left wing was crystallising into a separate party of an intermediary type (i.e. positioned between the Labour and Communist Parties) which in its turn would become a good nourishing environment for the growth of the English Communist Party.' This assessment led to Zinoviev's writing his letter to the British Communist Party. In its Russian version Zinoviev's letter includes the following: 'It is imperative to bring a forceful influence to bear on the Government by means of the left-wing group of the Labour Party (and) Parliamentary circles in aid of the ratification of the (Anglo-Soviet) treaty' then going through Parliament. Zinoviev writes with contempt for the Labour Party which did not share a revolutionary outlook and policy. Two books by Georgy Agabekov, written after his escape to France in 1930 and 1931, establish that Zinoviev wrote the letter. For ten years, from 1920 to 1930, Agabekov served in the GPU and OGPU, successors to Lenin's original Cheka, and forerunners of the KGB, set up by Lenin in December 1917. Agabekov broke with the Soviet Union at midsummer 1930, escaped from the Soviet representation in Istanbul, and made his way to France. He was murdered by the OGPU in 1937 or 1938. 82Agabekov took a special interest in British sources and intelligence. He records, almost in passing, great Soviet successes in obtaining British secret information from agents and from intercepting correspondence. British information was prized by OGPU for its accuracy and scope. Agents were paid more for obtaining it than for intelligence from other governments. Again, in passing, Agabekov speaks several times of the Zinoviev letter. His words presuppose and thereby put beyond doubt the authenticity of Zinoviev's letter. In a striking passage Agabekov refers to the unending sensation in the West arising from the Zinoviev letter. This sensation, caused by the Zinoviev letter and the Comintern's activities, was awkward for OGPU. It put its intelligence operations abroad at risk. In 1927 it caused OGPU categorically to forbid its officers posted abroad to have links there with Comintern officers working there or with local, foreign Communists and Communist organisations. Agabekov makes it clear that OGPU gave this direction because of Zinoviev's letter. Although it was a Party body and therefore more powerful than OGPU, the Comintern had no option but to accept OGPU's decision, which caused it difficulties, because of the problems that it had itself caused OGPU by Zinoviev's letter. OGPU's decision and the Comintern's compliance presuppose the fact that the Zinoviev letter was genuine. The evidence reveals that OGPU and Agabekov knew that Zinoviev had written the letter sent to the British Communist Party. OGPU and the Comintern believed, apparently incorrectly, that Zinoviev's letter was revealed by a British Communist or agent to the authorities in London. The leak occurred elsewhere. The Comintern was obliged to accept the stringent measures taken by OGPU in 1927 to dissociate itself abroad from the officers of the Third International because of the damage caused to OGPU's interests by Zinoviev's letter. And most important of all, the Soviet Union, despite all these facts, succeeded in pretending indefinitely that Zinoviev's letter was a forgery. The Soviet Union thereby learned a vital lesson. The appalling fact was that Soviet lies were widely believed in the West. Many more lies were to follow. My book is a work of history, and the facts are there for all to see. In addition, by revealing the truth about Soviet interference in British life, it offers healing for the wounds, still raw, caused by those events in our country's politics and a way to put to rest a national tragedy after almost a century. John Symons The Zinoviev Controversy Resolved by John Symons is published by Shepheard-Walwyn83Busters Cricket Do the Busters still exist among the College's clubs? Back in the days just after the end of the Second World War the Busters was the place for convivial cricketers to congregate on a Sunday afternoon, meeting and occasionally, very occasionally, beating one of the village teams around Oxford. We were not aspiring Wally Hammonds or Don Bradmans; if you wanted that sort of game there was proper cricket in College played by proper cricketers with proper bats and pads who played other proper cricketers in St John's or Balliol or Wadham or wherever; for them there was cuppers and promotion and relegation. Not for the Busters. We played for fun. Of course, we had proper kit: we wore whites and wore caps, probably left-over from school days, of rainbow hues, the sort that are now only seen obscuring the greying hairs of elderly men at Henley. Trousers were probably held up by a regimental- or school-coloured belt of increasingly ancient vintage. The aim was to enjoy ourselves. Tea at the end of the first innings, a drink after what is now called stumps in the clubhouse. To hell with the result. The Busters team of 195484For many, Schools beckoned so any pretentions to practising in the nets mid-week or even taking the game seriously were filed under the heading 'wishful thinking'. We may have wanted to be a Bradman or a Hammond but we happily settled for the very occasional four nestling in the boundary long grass and dot balls and dropped catches. Ideally a Buster would be in his second year: prelims out of the way and Schools a year ahead. Trinity term eight weeks of unalloyed pleasure without being troubled by the examiners. In 1954 our skipper was Albert Appleby: improbably christened Albert but always to the end of his days as headmaster of a north-country school called Pip. The day was not only enjoyable but also almost free. We paid nothing on the day but at the end of term all the expenses were added up by the secretary, Keith Holloway, known for some improbable reason as Stan, and, after a contribution of \u00a311 from Amalgamated Clubs, the shortfall was divided among the members on the basis of the number of games each man had played. It worked out in old money at 2d a game. There was no shortage of players. A day out with the Busters was much envied. That year more than 40 men were called upon by 'Stan' Holloway for their fees. Bill Roberts, another north-country teacher and a keen mountaineer, was a particular enthusiast. He was our scorer. Indifferent eyesight was offered as a reason for his not actually playing though it did not seem to trouble him when he was pressed into being an umpire. For several the nostalgia inevitably attached to the Busters would be short-lived. David Joy sadly died a few years afterwards in a car accident. And John Emery, an Everest mountaineer, suffered a climbing accident. Among the enthusiastic flannelled fools of '54 Ian Hollands came in with 10d according to the accounts prepared by 'Stan' or Keith Holloway - obviously a keen man. Another contributing 10d was Roger Barltrop while Dave Burchall, staunch goalkeeper in the soccer (now called football) team was an 8d man. Eddie Bygott, who occupied the room in College opposite mine on staircase 12 was in for 1s. For 1s it was possible to buy a pint in a pub, not that the villagers ever asked us for money. We were their guests. No doubt Eddie took his enthusiasm with him to life in Shropshire as a solicitor. Ian Hargreaves, to be a journalist in Liverpool, was in there at 10d and the athletics Blue Chris Suddaby was in for 4d. Another athlete with a Blue, Bob Shaw, only contributed 2d. Schools ahead, no doubt. Josh White faced not just Schools but the prospect of earning a living: some years later he emigrated to New Zealand; Ted Mucklow became a doctor on the Isle of Wight. Clive Franklin always brought Monique, his girl-friend, later wife, whose knowledge of the game was hindered by her French birth. To be seated next to her was much desired. Clive even managed to inveigle her into the end-of-term club photograph. The Busters was that sort of society. The villages in which we played were a joy, with more than a touch of Lark Rise to Candleford or Cider With Rosie about them. Rustic without the deadening architecture 85that pre-fab houses were soon to become the norm. My favourite was Stanton Harcourt, probably influenced by the fact that I took the one and only hat-trick of my life with my improbable off-spin on the somewhat variable surface of its wicket. At Glympton we played in the estate of the parents of another member, Ben Brough. The manor house in the village subsequently fell into the ownership of a Saudi Arabian nobleman who spent a small fortune on protective devices that no doubt excluded stray cricket balls. At Begbroke the 12th century Church of St Michaels provided both the background and home to a community of nuns. Another village was Hook Norton, home of a delightful beer. At the end of the season 'Stan' Holloway's report in his careful if spidery handwriting recorded that 'total expenses amounted to \u00a311. Amalgamated Clubs granted the Busters \u00a310. The remaining \u00a31 to be met by members of the club. This has been worked out as 2d per man per game. Will the undersigned, therefore, give their contributions to Mr Holloway soon as is convenient'. So little for so much joy. I am indebted to my everlasting friend Keith Holloway, ever Stan to me, for a memory that is better than mine in resurrecting from the long grass and ageing pavilions bits and pieces of an era never forgotten. Tony Moreton Editor' s note: The answer to Tony' s opening question, do the Busters still exist, rather regrettably appears to be no. None of the current students I have spoken to is familiar with it, at any rate. Cricket remains popular in the warmer months and is played with varying degrees of earnestness, depending on the composition of the team from one year to the next. Fun and sportsmanship do seem to be rated more important than batting or bowling averages, and so in that sense the spirit of the Busters lives on, if not the club itself. Tony sadly died in Spring 2021, his fondness for Exeter College and the people he met here every bit as strong then as it was when he studied at Exeter in the 1950s.86Exeter College 2020/21 The

The Porters request that visits fall between 2 pm and 5 pm where possible. Although rare, there are occasions on which the College, or parts of it, are closed, and it is advisable to contact the College in advance to avoid disappointment. If you are planning a visit and can let the Development and Alumni Relations Office know in advance when you are likely to arrive (by calling 01865 279619 or emailing development@exeter.ox.ac.uk), the Porters can be briefed to expect you. Please make yourself known in the Lodge by identifying yourself and presenting your University Alumni Card (information on how to obtain an Alumni Card is below). Please note that the College sometimes charges for entry to the College, but admission is free for alumni and their guests. Simply give your name and matriculation information to the Porters to be admitted free of charge. You and any guests you may have with you will then be able to explore College. The Hall, Chapel, and Fellows' Garden are usually open; if the Hall is locked, the Porters will be happy to open it for you if they are not too heavily engaged in other duties. Please remember that the College is a place of study and so noise should be kept to a minimum, particularly during exam periods. If you are not in possession of a University Alumni Card, please go to www.alumni.ox.ac.uk/my-oxford-card and follow the instructions. This card will also enable you to obtain discounts at select hotels, shops and restaurants in the area with which the University has made arrangements for Oxford alumni to receive reduced rates. Dining Rights The Rector and Fellows warmly invite you to take advantage of other alumni benefits, such as High Table Dining Rights. Eligibility is from the first term after completion of undergraduate Finals or submission of the final thesis for graduates. Alumni in good standing with the College can dine on High Table once a year at the College's expense (but paying for wine and dessert) and also at two other times in different terms at their own expense. Alumni can bring one guest to High Table dinner at their own expense; we can host groups with multiple guests, however in these instances your party will be seated in the main body of the Hall, and you would dine at your own expense. Guest nights are typically on Wednesdays and Sundays during term time. Please contact our catering team at butlers.pantry@exeter.ox.ac.uk or on 01865 279931 for further details or to sign in for dinner. 128Editor Matthew Baldwin became editor of the Register in 2021.
