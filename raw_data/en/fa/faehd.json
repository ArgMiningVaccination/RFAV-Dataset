When one of these connections is injured or weakened, your body will naturally compensate or adjust. Oftentimes, the location of the dysfunction will produce symptoms somewhere else. For example, pain in your lower back could be caused by your feet, or pain in your knee could come from your hip. Our FYZICAL Therapists evaluate your whole body so that the root cause of your health challenges are uncovered. With this complete assessment, FYZICAL customizes a unique treatment plan just for you. One of the ways we evaluate your holistic health is through BODYQ\u00ae. This integrated testing program, only available at FYZICAL, can detect problem areas early to prevent injury - or even surgery - down the road. Our FYZICAL Therapists use this information to create a custom action plan for you to safely improve strength, flexibility, balance, and overall well-being. We understand how frustrating it can be to deal with chronic pain, vertigo, or more sensitive issues like pelvic pain. Our compassionate team will listen to your concerns and help identify solutions whether that is through physical therapy or the help of another medical specialist. We understand your pain, and your pain is unique to you. "}
