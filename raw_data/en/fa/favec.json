This study investigated the cardioprotective effects of standardized S. microglossa extract (EESM) in nicotine-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Moreover, the molecular mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular effects were also investigated. The acute toxicity was evaluated in female Wistar rats. Afterwards, six-month-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats received the EESM (14, 28, and 56 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/kg), and vehicle (filtered water; 0.1 mL/100 g) once daily for 28 days. All treatments were associated with 1.8 mg/kg of nicotine. At the end of the experimental period, the renal function, electrocardiographic profile, blood pressure, ventricular function, biochemical parameter, and mesenteric vascular bed reactivity were evaluated. Relative organ weights and cardiac morphometry were also investigated. Nicotine treatment in 6-month-old SHRs induced a significant reduction in renal function, with reduced urinary volume and lower renal elimination of sodium and creatinine. In addition, serum markers of the redox state and blood pressure levels remained significantly elevated, contributing to changes in vascular reactivity and left ventricular hypertrophy associated with reduced ventricular function. After 28 days of treatment, we found that the highest dose of EESM could mitigate all renal and cardiovascular changes developed by the nicotine-treated hypertensive rats. This study presented EESM as a possible cardioprotective drug that prevents cardiovascular dysfunctions in nicotine-treated hypertensive rats. Our data suggest EESM as a potential adjuvant therapy when cardioprotective effects are required. Absorption and Metabolism of Urolithin A and Ellagic Acid in Mice and Their Cytotoxicity in Human Colorectal Cancer Cells Background. Ellagic acid is a natural polyphenol compound found in pomegranates, walnuts, and many berries. It is not easily absorbed, but it could be metabolized to urolithins by the gut microbiota. Urolithin A, one of the ellagic acid metabolites, has been proved to prolong the lifespan of C. elegans and increases muscle function of mice. The purpose of this current study was to analyze the absorption and metabolites of urolithin A and ellagic acid in mice and the anticancer effects of urolithin A, urolithin B, and ellagic acid in colorectal cancer cells. Methods. Urolithin A and urolithin B were synthesized and analyzed by HPLC and NMR. A pharmacokinetic study of urolithin A was performed in mice by analyzing urolithin A and its metabolites in urines. Absorption and biotransformation of ellagic acid were also studied in mice by analyzing the plasma, liver, and feces. The cytotoxicity of urolithin A, urolithin B, and ellagic SW620, 116, and HT-29 cells. Results. Urolithin A and urolithin B were synthesized and purified to reach 98.1% and 99% purity, respectively, and the structures were identified by NMR. In urolithin A intake analysis, urolithin A was only detectable at 3 h, not at 6-24 h; it suggested that urolithin A was rapidly metabolized to some unknown metabolites. Using UPLC-MS/MS analysis, the metabolites might A-sulfate glucuronide. After feeding mice with ellagic acid for consecutive 14 days, ellagic acid contents could be detected in the fecal samples, but not in plasma and liver, and urolithin A was not detected in all samples. It suggests that ellagic acid is not easily absorbed and that the biotransformation of ellagic acid to urolithin A by intestinal flora might be very low. From the cytotoxicity assay, it was found that there was anticancer effect in urolithin A and urolithin B but not in ellagic acid. In contrast, ellagic acid promoted the proliferation of SW480 and SW620 cells. Phytochemical Characteristics Portulaca oleracea L. (P. oleracea) or purslane is a plant from the Portulacaceae family, which is used as food and traditional medicine for various diseases. This review article provides comprehensive information on the antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties of P. oleracea and its constituents. The literature survey of the different databases until the end of June 2023 was explored based on the keywords including the \"P. oleracea, purslane, terpenoids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and some other compounds. The results indicated that P. oleracea and its constituents showed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties through reduction of inflammatory mediators including interferon gama (IFN-), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4, tumor Improvement in cytokines' serum levels IL-10, and IL-4) and increased IgG and IgM serum levels, as well as reduction of IgE, phospholipase A2, and total protein were demonstrated for P. oleracea. The plant and its constituents also improved oxidative stress by reduction of oxidant and increase of antioxidant markers. P. oleracea could be considered as an effective remedy for various inflammatory and immune diseases. Behavioral Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of Using Western and Chinese Medicines or Herbal Products among the Public in Response to COVID-19 in Hong Kong: A Cross-Sectional Study The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in Hong Kong for more than two years. This article conducted a cross-sectional study for participants to investigate the behavioral prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of using Western medicines or herbal products for COVID-19 in Hong Kong. A questionnaire was designed and performed over 2 weeks from 1 May to 15 May 2022. It consisted of five parts with around 20 questions conducted including sociodemographic information, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation of COVID-19, and also the sources of information. The pattern usage of Chinese or Western medicines for COVID-19 was studied after data collection. 318 people participated in this survey, and only 311 were qualified. The sociodemographic information, e.g., personal educational level, and behavior for the prevention of COVID-19, which included wearing masks (98.7%), using alcohol hand sanitizer (83.0%), washing hands frequently (82.4%), avoiding crowds (53.1%), and staying home more often (50.6%). Western medicines, such as antipyretic drugs, antitussive drugs, and pain reliever drugs, whilst Chinese medicines, such as Lianhua Qingwen Jiaonang, Huoxiang Zhengqi San or Wan, and Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa, were most commonly used in the treatment and rehabilitation periods of COVID-19. Herbal products, including lemon, honey, ginger, and herbal tea, were used as a daily diet to fight against COVID-19. Based on the result findings, Chinese medicines or herbal products were used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but most of the participants used an unknown Chinese medicine practitioner's prescription and self-administered Chinese medicine. The pattern of Chinese medicines and Western medicines' usage in the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of COVID-19 was also investigated; this showed a statistically significant association between the variables according to gender, age, and Chinese or Western medicines for further investigation. Real-World Study on Chai-Shi-Jie-Du Granules for the Treatment of Dengue Fever and the Possible Mechanisms Based on Network Pharmacology Objectives. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a widely used method for treating dengue fever in China. TCM improves the symptoms of patients with dengue, but there is no standard TCM prescription for dengue fever. This real-world study aimed to evaluate the effects of Chai-Shi-Jie-Du (CSJD) granules for the treatment of dengue fever and the underlying mechanisms. Methods. We implemented a multicenter real-world study, an in vitro assay and network pharmacology analysis. Patients from 5 hospitals in mainland China who received supportive western treatment in the absence or presence of CSJD were assigned to the control and CSJD groups between 1 August and 31 December 2019. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to correct for biases between groups. The clinical data were compared and analyzed. The antidengue virus activity of CSJD was tested in Syrian baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells using the DENV2-NGC strain. Network pharmacological approaches along with active compound screening, target prediction, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results. 137 pairs of patients were successfully matched according to age, sex, and the time from onset to presentation. The time to defervescence (1.7 days vs. 2.5 days, ) and the disease course (4.1 days vs. 6.1 days, ) were significantly shorter in the CSJD group than those in the control group. CSJD showed no anti-DENV2-NGC virus activity in BHK cells. Network pharmacology analysis revealed 108 potential therapeutic targets, and the top GO and KEGG terms were related to immunity, oxidative stress response, and the response to lipopolysaccharide. Conclusions. CSJD granules exhibit high potential for the treatment of dengue fever, and the therapeutic mechanisms involved could be related to regulating immunity, moderating the oxidative stress response, and the response to lipopolysaccharide. Study on Optimal Extraction and Hypoglycemic Effect of Quercetin Quercetin was extracted from Portulaca oleracea L. through biphasic acid hydrolysis to investigate its potential as a suppressor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and its hypoglycemic effect in type 2 diabetic mice. The extraction procedure was optimized utilizing the response surface method (RSM) in a single-factor experimental setting. An extraction efficiency of 0.675% was achieved using the following optimized parameters: 0.064 mol/L 1 : 109.155 solid-liquid ratio, and min ultrasonication. Overall, findings indicate the effectiveness of quercetin extraction. A mouse model for type 2 diabetes was established to receive oral treatment with various quercetin concentrations for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and the DPP-IV activity in the serum were significantly reduced. The weight and insulin levels of the mice in the quercetin group were raised compared to those in the model group ( < 0.01). Quercetin dose-dependently inhibited postprandial blood glucose excursions, as demonstrated by the oral glucose tolerance test. These results confirmed that quercetin has hypoglycemic effects and considerably improves insulin sensitivity via "}
