It's gone viral on TikTok, blown up on Instagram, and can be seen all over Facebook beauty pages. It's for good reason that red light therapy has become so popular\u2014it's a straightforward and convenient way to keep your skin healthy, youthful, and radiant. It all started in high-end spas and in dermatology and esthetician's offices. However, due to the high cost of a single treatment, red light therapy was only accessible to those with a broader budget. Within the past three or four years, at-home red light therapy has rapidly expanded, and almost every beauty brand has its own line of these high-tech products. With that said, buyers beware. Just because these products are accessible doesn't mean they're quality. In fact, there are plenty of red light therapy devices that are ineffective and overpriced. For that exact reason, we decided to take it upon ourselves to test the most popular products, and handpick the 14 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. What Is Red Light Therapy? Since red light therapy can get confusing, we'll try to make this explanation as simple as possible. Your body naturally generates less sebum, collagen, and elastin as you age. However, your skin needs these three glands to appear youthful. Without them, your skin will begin to sag, exhibit more dark patches, wrinkles, and fine lines. That's where red light treatment comes in. It uses low-wavelength light to invigorate and renew your skin, giving it a younger, more vibrant, and more even appearance. To be specific, red light treatment encourages your skin to start producing more collagen, elastin, and sebum\u2014just like when you were younger. When talking about red light therapy, safety is something that many people may be concerned about. To be completely clear, red light therapy is entirely risk-free. It doesn't harm your skin, or penetrate its barrier like UVA or UVB rays. As a matter of fact, many of these products work to increase your protective layer, shielding you from environmental stresses like chlorine, pollution, and UV rays. To go even further, some research has revealed that red light therapy is a milder treatment than topical products. Therefore, red light therapy is ideal for someone with sensitive skin who has trouble with traditional exfoliators, moisturizers, or serums. What To Consider When Choosing an At-Home Red Light Therapy Device We examined countless products to select the 14 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. To get a sense of each product, we hand-tested them, read reviews, studied clinical trials, and tried to understand the science behind the product. Having said that, we discovered a few crucial factors when choosing an at-home red light therapy device. Irradiance The first factor revolved around irradiance\u2014which refers to the power of a device. Irradiance is measured in milliwatts per square centimeter, noted as mW/cm2. The more powerful a device is, the quicker and more effective it will be. A common misconception is that you should look at the wattage when determining a device's power. However, wattage describes how much electricity a device uses, not how powerful it is. Frequency Frequency was the second factor we considered while selecting the 14 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. The frequency of red light therapy equipment relates to the depth at which the waves are able to penetrate your skin. It's simple, really: the red light may target your problems more effectively the greater the frequency. High-frequency equipment can lessen joint and muscular pain while also enhancing mobility\u2014making it ideal for anyone aging. Low-frequency, red-light devices have their own advantages. These products are more gentle and better at treating skin conditions like photoaging, hyperpigmentation, and sagging skin. Some devices can even help with long-term skin issues like eczema, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. Size The last thing we recommend thinking about when buying a red light device is size. It goes without saying that larger devices work better for full-body treatments. Additionally, they can better treat broader areas like your chest or back. On the downside, larger devices are more expensive, tough to move, and less effective for delivering specialized care. On the other hand, small red light devices are ideal for targeted treatment of particular body areas. These items are affordable, more practical, and some are even portable. For those new to red light therapy, we suggest purchasing a smaller product first\u2014unless you have specialized needs. The 14 Best At-Home Red Light Therapy Devices of 2023 Now it's time to get into the 14 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. We made an effort to provide options for everyone. Whatever you're looking for, we're confident you'll find it here! 1. [Gleam Mini](https://buygleam.com/products/mini) The first red light therapy gadget is produced by Gleam, which Forbes ranks as the best red light therapy device on the market. After testing and reviewing the product\u2014we concur with the ranking. The Gleam Mini boasts additional advantages to red light therapy, is constructed from medical-grade aluminum, and is much cheaper than its competitors. The Gleam Mini is ideal for targeted therapy because it has a smaller footprint than some of the alternatives we reviewed. This product felt good in our hands, and we weren't scared it would break if we dropped it. Due to its wide range of frequencies, it can quickly treat superficial skin problems, as well as deeper tissue and joint issues. We liked how the Gleam Mini improved blood flow\u2014something we didn't find in any other competitor. Improved blood flow has been clinically shown to speed up wound healing and encourage hair growth. It can also increase cellular activity, which offers a variety of advantages like less inflammation, better sleep, and improved mental clarity. Because it can conveniently fit into a tiny backpack or carry-on, Gleam's Mini red light therapy gadget is an excellent choice for travel. And due to its size, it's also perfect for treating specific areas like your thighs, arms, or back. It's a fantastic option for anyone suffering from minor skin issues all the way to difficult, chronic pain. 2. Foreo UFO 2 The Foreo UFO 2 comes in second place on our list of the 15 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. Foreo is a Swedish skincare business that was founded in 2013. They concentrate on cutting-edge skincare and cosmetics, such as red light treatment, thermotherapy, and microblading. Even though they're a relatively young company, the UFO 2 is one of its most well-known items\u2014with over 2,000 reviews and a 4.7 rating on Google. We loved the small footprint of the Forero UFO 2. Just like the Gleam Mini, it makes the perfect travel companion because it can fit in a handbag or purse. Thanks to its strong silicone shell, you won't need to worry about it breaking, either. Foreo's UFO 2 has an app that goes along with the product. The software allows you to set up routines, monitor progress, and control the device's settings. However, we didn't find the app to work that well during our testing. Regardless, we believe this product to be a hit. Did we mention you only need two to three-minute sessions per day to see results? 3. SolaWave Advanced Skincare Wand with Red Light Therapy SolaWave's 4-in-1 Red Light Facial Wand is our third choice. The first thing that stood out about this device was its straightforward ergonomics, which were both efficient and easy to operate. The product was compact enough to fit into a backpack, pocketbook, or bedside drawer. We liked how it looked and how simple it was to use. For that reason, it's ideal for anyone who has a tough time using modern tech. Celebrities like Aubrey Plaza, Lil Nas X, Nicole Kidman, and Debbie Ryan have endorsed this product. However, it's popular with more than just famous people. The product from SolaWave has over 900 reviews with a 4.9 star average. Along with Gleam and Foreo, we consider it to be amongst the best red light therapy devices available. Red light therapy is only one function of the SolaWave gadget. It also uses thermotherapy, often known as heat therapy, to soften and even the texture of your skin. In addition, SolaWave utilizes microcurrents, which are tiny electrical currents that lift and tighten the muscles in the face. We were also impressed with just how user-friendly this device was, and there were plenty of reviews to back this up. Some individuals use it in the mornings while choosing their clothes, while others use it at night while lying in bed. Compared to other solutions that require at least 10 minutes per session, SoloWave keeps things quick\u2014you only need use this device only five minutes per day. 4. NuFace Trinity Wrinkle Reducer The NuFace Trinity Wrinkle Reducer is a popular choice among buyers. It has over 2,500 reviews and sits at an average of 4.3 stars. It's both FDA and dermatologist approved, so you don't need to worry about any side effects. However, unlike virtually all of our other selections, NuFace's Trinity Wrinkle Reducer is only an attachment to the NuFace Trinity red light device\u2014meaning you must purchase two products to begin seeing results. That being said, this NuFace product has a wealth of benefits while remaining relatively affordable! We loved its ability to minimize the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, and dark spots. Really, this product is all about improving the look of aging skin. Due to its small footprint, we think it's another excellent choice for anyone who wants a travel-friendly, red light therapy device. 5. Joovv Solo 3.0 The first company to make full-body red light therapy devices available at home was Joovv. We think the only downside to Joovv is its high price; they are most definitely a luxury brand and come in at a luxury brand price point. The third iteration of Joov's full-body red light therapy device is called the Solo 3.0. Since it's a full-body product, it's a lot bigger than the other options on our list. For that reason, it comes with three installation possibilities: a ground mount, a door mount, or a wall mount. It also has a 60-day return policy and a two-year warranty\u2014which is less than Gleam's warranty and return policy. The Joovv Solo 3.0s Bluetooth functionality and variety of presets impressed us. No other product has such a strong working Bluetooth capability. It also includes safety glasses you can put on while treating your face. Because Joovv is an independently certified brand, all their products are made according to the best manufacturing standards. Additionally, you may track your treatments and establish goals for your skin with their app\u2014which is much better than Forero's. 6. [Gleam Solo](https://buygleam.com/products/solo) Yes, we added a second Gleam product to our list of the 14 best at-home red light therapy devices of 2023. This second choice is a full-body treatment. Despite being substantially larger, the Gleam Solo is essentially identical to the Mini. It's made from the same materials, has the same warranty, and provides all the same benefits! It is the best alternative for a full-body treatment and costs only a third of what Joovv's product does. You can treat yourself more effectively using a full-body treatment device like the Gleam Solo. We think it's easier to use (since they are typically stationary), and they can simultaneously cover more of your body. It's also important to note that Gleam provides free shipping, which we think is a significant bonus given how large this product is. The Gleam Solo looks like something you'd see in a high-end spa. It has a modern appearance and looks fantastic mounted on the back of a door or in the bathroom. We think the Gleam Solo appears less like a medical gadget and more like a decorative mirror (with lights) compared to some other options. We found no differences between Gleam's product and higher-end rivals in terms of its structure, features, or strength. For that reason, we'd recommend sticking with Gleam to save money and keep all the value you want. 7. Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro Most people are familiar with Dr. Dennis Gross's products. Their brand has created some high-end serums, lotions, and skincare products that are well-known in the beauty world. Most recently, Dr. Dennis Gross, a board-certified dermatologist with more than 25 years of experience, has developed a face-treatment tool that is FDA-approved. DRx SpectraLite FaceWare Pro by Dr. Dennis Gross has certainly caught some attention on social media. With impressive results in reducing facial scarring, wrinkles, and acne, it has grown in popularity on both TikTok and Instagram. Contrary to many other red light therapy devices, this product offers additional functions like blue light and purple light therapy. The three settings on Dr. Dennis Gross's product each have their own particular benefits. Your body produces more collagen due to the red light, which improves the look of wrinkles and fine lines. Acne and other facial imperfections are also targeted for prevention using blue light. The last option, purple light, combines red and blue light to lessen inflammation, redness, and facial swelling. We appreciated the hands-free nature of this red light therapy device. You can multitask while it's on, even though it just takes three minutes to use and has a built-in shut-off! We think this product might be right for you if you're one of those people who are constantly rushing out the door in the morning. 8. Skin Gym Revilit LED During our product testing, we learned it was hard to find a red light therapy device for less than $100; however, Skin Gym's Revilit LED device fits the bill. In addition to decreasing acne, fine wrinkles, dark spots, and redness, this product turns you into your younger and more vibrant self. The Revilit LED treatment from Skin Gym uses a variety of colors, just like our last choice from Dr. Dennis Gross. It has red, blue, and green lights. While we've covered red and blue, green light is a new LED. Green light can promote your skin's natural healing\u2014while fixing any pigmentation issues. This product's total wirelessness and comfort level impressed us. You can wear it while preparing breakfast or folding laundry because it is hands-free. 9. Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite EyeCare Pro Just like Gleam, we include two Dr. Dennis Gross products on our list of the 14 best red light therapy devices of 2023. The DRx SpectraLite EyeCare Pro is an FDA-approved device that focuses on your eyes\u2014a prime spot to show your age. This product can improve the appearance of fine wrinkles, bags under the eyes, and crow's feet while boosting collagen production. This product is our favorite choice for specific eye care red light therapy. Yes, it is a little expensive for an exclusive eye product, but still, it is incredibly efficient and convenient to wear as well. Instead of the 10-minute requirement of some of the other products on this list, this device only needs to be worn for three minutes per session. And one of the best parts\u2014this device is completely hands-free. It is advised that you wash and dry your face before utilizing any red light therapy device. However, since this product will help to open your pores, you don't need to apply your facial serums, moisturizers, or exfoliators. In fact, Dr. Dennis Gross's DRx SpectraLite EyeCare Pro will aid in helping other skincare products to have a greater effect on your skin. For someone who battles eye bags or wrinkles, we suggest Dr. Dennis Gross's EyeCare Pro. You'll appreciate that this brand adheres to clean beauty standards, is cruelty-free, and is vegan. 10. MZSkin LightMAX Supercharged LED Mask 2.0 MZSkin's LightMAX Supercharged LED Mask 2.0 is the top of the line product from Dr. Maryam Zamani, an oculoplastic surgeon. Yes, we know it's expensive for a face mask, but it utilizes both red and blue light to reduce acne and improve the appearance of photoaging. It's also been clinically tested and proven to show results in as little as two weeks. We liked that MZSkin's product does more than impact the short-term makeup of your face, it gives you long-term benefits that will keep you looking younger and more vibrant. However, due to the high cost, we only recommend this product for those who know their red light treatment and want a top-tier product. 11. Angela Caglia Skincare Crystal Led Face Mask Angela Caglia is a well-known and well-liked esthetician for celebrities. She prefers a holistic approach to skincare, but don't worry, her products are supported with rigorous scientific testing. Her Crystal Led Face Mask targets collagen, sebum, and elastin synthesis by using red and blue light. Together, these three glands will limit the number of winkles, fine lines, and dark spots you find on your face. This product uses Rose Quartz, a prominent crystal in traditional Chinese medicine. We know some people won't believe in crystals\u2014or traditional Chinese medicine, but reviewers note the product's success. Rose Quartz can lessen swelling, redness, and puffiness. Additionally, you'll feel at ease while it calms inflamed skin. Angela's medical-grade silicone mask fits well, which pleased us. It provided a feminine appearance when worn, which was a concern with some of the other products we tried. It's also portable and convenient to bring with you because of its lightweight size\u2014making it the perfect travel companion. The cost was the only drawback we could find with this product. Yes, it includes many accessories, including a travel case, safety goggles, a controller, and charging connections, but so do some other less expensive choices. Because of this, we are only recommending this product to people who enjoy high-end goods and have a large budget. 12. Ora LED Light Energy Mask One of the least expensive options on our list is Ora's LED Light Energy Mask. Before spending a fortune on other, higher-end options, this product is perfect for beginners looking to get into red light therapy and to learn more about how it affects the skin. We should also mention that, just because Ora's product is less expensive, does not mean that it is less effective\u2014it's just as successful at achieving results as its expensive counterparts. Ora's LED Light Energy Mask has seven distinct modes, each tailored towards a particular skin issue. Green light calms sensitive skin and helps increase your body's natural ability to heal. And purple light heals scars and imperfections on the skin\u2014specifically targeting acne and other blemishes. You don't need to use this product every day to see the effects, but it does need to remain on your face for a little longer than the others\u2014roughly 15 to 20 minutes. We will say that this product is newer than some of the other choices on this list which means that it does not have as many reviews as some of its rivals. But we believe it's worthwhile to test out Ora's LED Light Energy Mask given its reasonable price and long list of benefits. 13. RejuvaliteMD Red Light Therapy When using the Red Light Therapy device from RejuvaliteMD, we felt professional\u2014like we were facialists ourselves. This red light device can be directed at any location on your body thanks to its flexible arm and sturdy base. It can be used while seated, standing, or even while lying down. RejuvaliteMD's product uses four lights. These include UV-free red light, amber light, yellow light, and infrared light. Together these lights are able to double the production of collagen to firm your skin, prevent sagging, and give you that glowing appearance you so desperately crave. After three to four weeks of daily use, you'll be able to notice the benefits. Fortunately, this product only takes five minutes per day to use, making it simple to incorporate it into your morning or evening routine. 14. Hooga Red Light Therapy Device As we mentioned before, using a smaller red light device is the best way to introduce yourself to the treatment. Hooga's Red Light Therapy Device is approximately 12 \u00d7 8 inches, and has a powerful frequency range of 650 to 800 nanometers. The sheer power of this device can help boost energy levels, activate collagen, and aid in reducing inflammation or redness. The product from Hooga features a 60-day trial period, and a three-year warranty. It only weighs five pounds yet is made of medical-grade materials\u2014meaning you don't need to worry about breaking it. It is, in our opinion, one of the best options for anyone requiring specialized red light treatment on particular body parts. Hooga's Red Light Therapy Device has mounts just like Joovv's product in case you want to hang it on your door or wall. You can also simply sit it on a table which will allow you to use it while eating breakfast or dinner. Using this product for only a few minutes a day will make a noticeable change in the condition of your skin. If you need a larger device and have more experience with red light therapy, Hooga offers various options. They have a collection of five unique devices, each one catered to a specific need. And some of the larger devices can be utilized for the entire body, which makes for a nice alternative to the pricey Joovv's product. "}
