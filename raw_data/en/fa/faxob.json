Located in the heart of down- town Atlanta, Georgia State is one of the country's leading urban research universities. I believe the formula for an outstanding university is greatstudents, great faculty and staff and great facilities. You'll find it all here atGeorgia State. Our student body is the best qualified and most diverse in our history.More than 40,000 students are seeking degrees at Georgia State, andmore than 26,000 of them are on campus each semester. Students cometo our campus from every county in Georgia, every state in the nation andmore than 150 countries. Georgia State continues to attract and retain outstanding faculty andadministrative personnel who are well respected in their fields. We offer achallenging intellectual environment with 52 undergraduate and graduatedegree programs in more than 250 fields of study. Opportunities forinvolvement in innovative research projects and life enhancing communityservice abound on our campus. To keep pace with growth, we introduced our Main Street Master Plan1997. Every project we imagined as a part of the decade spanning plan isnow either built or underway. The plan focused on creating a vibrant, inviting campus where students can learn, liveand work. Visible signs of the plan's success include our Rialto Center for the Performing Arts, Student Center,Student Recreation Center, Helen M. Aderhold Learning Center and University Lofts. In 2006, we updated our university master plan to guide our growth for the next decade. For this updated plan,our central vision continues from the 1997 plan. We want to create a sense of place at Georgia State. We wantGeorgia State to be intertwined with the city, but still feel like a university campus. We are busy working on manyexciting changes for the future that will enhance Georgia State's ability to meet the needs of those we serve. I invite you to explore Georgia State. Whether you're a prospective student, a community partner or one of ourmore than 160,000 alumni, Georgia State is your resource for a lifetime. Visit our campus or our website athttp://www.gsu.edu .

Choose to suppress (i.e., keep from being disclosed) their directory information per the process identified below in Paragraph IX (B); C. Inspect and review their education records;D. Seek amendment of those education records believed to be inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of their privacy rights; and E. File complaints with the Department of Education about alleged failures by the University to comply with the require- ments of FERPA. II. Definitions A. Student: any person who attends or has attended the University. For purposes of FERPA, Georgia State University considers an admitted student to be \"in attendance\" upon enrollment/registration for classes. Note: The definition ofUniversity Information 21 \"student\" set forth above is only for use in connection with this guidance. For the official University definition of \"student\", please refer to the Georgia State University Student Code of Conduct. B.

This provision does not apply to grade appeals, and students wishing to appeal th e assignment of a grade should refer to the Policy and Procedures for Student Complaints, Petitions for Policy Waivers andVariances, and Appeals. Only the Registrar, upon consultation with the respective dean, may authorize a correction in a record within the academic file of a student. Similar authority is held by the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Director of Admissions, the Director of Financial Aid, the respective College Dean and the Director of Personnel for the records which are maintained under the authority of thes e various University officials. The University representative to whom a request for correction of a non-academic file is properly addressed will notify the student of his or her decision within 21 days after receipt of the written request. If the University decides that the information in astudent's education record is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's right of privacy, it will amend the recor d and notify the student, in writing, that the record has been amended. If the University decides that the challenged information is not inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's right of privacy, it will notify the student of the right to place in the record astatement commenting on the challenged information and a statement setting forth reasons for disagreeing with the decision. Suc h a statement shall become a part of the information contained in the education record and will be disclosed with it. Should the University decide the challenged information is not inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's right of privacy, then the student will also be advised of the right to appeal the University's decision and challenge the informationbelieved to be inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student's privacy rights. The appeal may extend only to the materi al in the respective University file. While it may extend to the correct recording of a grade, it may not include a challenge to theassignment by the instructor of the grade. The student has 20 days to appeal the decision in writing to the Provost and ask for ahearing. On behalf of the President of the University, the Provost shall refer the appeal to an existing committee or designate a hearing committee comprised of University officials who do not have a direct interest in the outcome of the hearing. Georgia St ate University will notify the student, reasonably in advance, of the date, place and time of the hearing. The student shall be afforded afull and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised in the original request to amend the student's educ ation records. The student may bring one individual to act as an advisor but the individual may not address the committee. Thecommittee will prepare a written recommendation based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing and submit it to theProvost who will make a determination on the matter. The recommendation will include a brief summary of the evidence presentedand the reasons for the decision. The decision of the Provost may be appealed in writing to the President within 20 days of thedate of the decision. The appeal to the President shall be made on the record. VII.

The extent of24 University Information disclosure to prospective employers, graduate schools, organizations awarding fellowships and the like shall be made clear to t he student when he or she requests that the file be assembled and shall be agreed to by him or her on a form specifically provided for that purpose. The student may make a specific waiver of access to evaluations solicited and/or received under condition of confidentiality, but the waiver must be made by the student without pressure or coercion. Any evaluation received under such condition ofconfidentiality without the student's waiver of access or without the student's knowledge shall not be incorporated in the file but shall be returned to the sender. VIII. Addition to Records No entry may be made on a student's official records and no document or entry may be placed in such records without written notice to the student by the administrative officials responsible for the specific category of information, as identified in Pa ragraph IV . For purposes of this guidance, notification of grades, written communication to a student of school or departmental evalua tion and announcement of honors shall constitute adequate notice. A document or entry supplied by or at the request of the student may be placed in the student's record without additional notice to him or her. In the case of student records maintained in dea ns' offices and departmental offices, additions other than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph require the permission of theRegistrar, who in turn is responsible for notification of the student. IX. Release of Student Information A.

Notification may be prohibited if theUniversity receives a federal grand jury subpoena or any other subpoena which states that the student should notbe notified. The University will comply with such process only upon the advice of counsel. All subpoenas receivedby the University should be immediately forwarded in person or by facsimile (404-413-0518) to the Office of LegalAffairs to evaluate the validity of the subpoena. In the case of a subpoena which can be disclosed to a student, theOffice of Legal Affairs will inform the student of the subpoena and give the student an opportunity to file anobjection to the subpoena before responding on behalf of the University. 8.

Information contained in electronic publications may generally bechanged upon 48 hours notice. Students having opted to suppress their directory information may change theirposition at a later date by notifying the Office of the Registrar in writing. Please note: refusing to permit the release of directory information means that a student's history at Georgia State will be suppressed in full, preventing theverification by future employers and others of degrees earned and dates of enrollment. Exception to Directory Suppression: Due to system constraints, final graduation lists and official programs will include all students who are graduating, regardless of Directory Suppression, unless otherwise stated on the Graduation Application. C. Records of Deceased Students will be made available to the parents of the deceased student and other authorizedparties upon written request.

Admission is based on a number of factors depending upon level of entry and previous educationalexperience. Admission into and placement within Georgia State will be determined by the Office of Undergraduate Admissionsusing the criteria approved by the University Senate. Applicants who have been educated outside the United States shouldconsult Section 1165. The admission requirements have been developed in accordance with the rules and regulations of theBoard of Regents of the University System of Georgia and have evolved from studies of student performance at Georgia State.These studies have identified factors and criteria that indicate a reasonable chance of successful completion of academic work at Georgia State. Admission decisions are based on a previous record of satisfactory academic performance, test scores, personalqualities and circumstances, character, and good conduct. Admission is a selective process and meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee acceptance. A student has the right to appeal the admission decision as provided in the bylaws of the Board of Regents. Any applications received after the stated deadline for the term of application will be processed for the next available term and the application fee will not be refunded. Any application received without a designated term will be processed for the nex t available term and the application fee will not be refunded. Approval for admission is valid only for the term specified at the time of acceptance and does not imply that approval will be granted for a term not specified. Students wishing to be considered for a subsequent term during an academic year (the academic year begins with the fall semester and ends with the following summersemester) must submit a reactivation form (http://www.gsu.edu/gastate_reactivate.html ) and any required credentials by the application deadline date for that particular term. Students wishing to be considered for a term in another academic year mustsubmit a new application, application fee, and new credentials. Any changes in a student's record prior to enrollment will necessitate a new review of the application. Any omissions or misrepresentations on a student' s application for admission will automatically invalidate consideration by, acceptance to and continuation at Georgia State. If an applicant (a) is ineligible to enroll at any previously attended institution, (b) is on p robation, suspension, exclusion, or any other standing indicating either an academic or a conduct deficiency at any previously attendedinstitution, (c) has been found in violation of the academic or non-academic code of conduct at any previously attended institu - tion, or (d) has been convicted for violation of a federal, state or municipal law, regulation or ordinance (other than minor t raffic violations), then the applicant's case will be reviewed to insure that the applicant meets the satisfactory academic performanc e, good character, and good conduct requirements noted above. If, after a letter of acceptance has been issued, information comes to light that shows that an applicant did not meet all admission requirements, the applicant's offer of admission will be withd rawn. If this information comes to light after the student has enrolled, the applicant' s enrollment at Georgia State will be terminat ed and earned credit may be revoked. All credentials submitted with the application for admission become and remain the property of the university and will not be returned to the student, duplicated, or transferred to another institution. Admission to Georgia State University or reentry approval does not imply admission to a specific major or professional program. Students who wish to take 3000 or 4000 level teacher education courses (designated by a \"TE\" in the course descrip-tion) or who wish to enter one of the teacher education programs must be approved by the College of Education or theCollege of Arts and Sciences, depending on the student's teaching field major (see Section 1605).

Admission Requirements Admission to Georgia State University is a selective process and meeting minimum admission requirements does not guarantee acceptance. The middle 50% of students who entered Georgia State in the Fall of 2004 had SAT combined scoresbetween 1000 and 1180 and high school GPAs on College Preparatory Classes of between 3.08 and 3.54. All of the followingminimum requirements must be met in order for an applicant to receive consideration as a freshman: Be a graduate of and have a college preparatory diploma from a high school accredited by a regional accreditingassociation (such as the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools), a high school accredited by the GeorgiaAccrediting Commission, or a public high school regulated by a school system and state Department of Education. ACertificate of Attendance does not qualify a student for admission consideration. Have completed the University System of Georgia Board of Regents' College Preparatory Curriculum. Sixteen curriculumcourse units required as follows:a. English (4 units): emphasis in grammar and usage; literature (American, English, and World); and advanced compo- sition skills. b. Mathematics (4 units): algebra I, algebra II, geometry, and one additional mathematics course with these units as prerequisites. c. Science (3 units): at least one laboratory course from the life sciences and one laboratory course from the physical sciences. d. Social Science (3 units): at least one course focusing on United States studies and one course focusing on world studies. e.

If the TOEFL is not taken, applicants from local areas will be required to take the Georgia State Test of English Proficiency(GSTEP) to determine appropriate admission. Have a freshman index (FI) of 2500 or higher. The FI is based on a combination of SAT/ACT scores and high schoolgrade point average (HSGPA) in college preparatory courses only. The FI formula using SAT scores is: SAT FI = (500 xHSGPA) + SAT V + SAT M. The FI formula using ACT scores is: ACT FI = (500 x HSGPA) + (ACT composite x 42) + 88.In calculating the HSGPA for FI purposes, the applicant's transcript is calculated upon only 16 of the academic (college preparatory) courses taken such as English, mathematics, science, social studies, and foreign language.

Establishing residency for tuition purposes as defined by the Board of Regents is different than residency for purposes such as voting, obtaining a Georgiadriver's license/tag, etc., and requires more than establishing eligibility to vote, securing a driver's license, and/or payingtaxes. Georgia residency status is also distinct from the academic residency requirement for graduation. (See Section 1430.) A person may be a Georgia resident for tuition purposes if, and only if, either one of the following two criteria are met. Criterion 1 A person may be a Georgia resident for tuition purposes if that person, that person's parents, or (if the person is a minor) that person's court-appointed guardian meets all of the following conditions: 1. The person has always resided in Georgia or can demonstrate that they currently reside in Georgia and residency in any other state or country has been abandoned. Maintenance of ties with another state or country will contribute to a non-resident decision including: financial support from a person who is a resident of another state or country, payment of incometaxes to another state, and payment of property taxes. Registering a vehicle or securing a driver's license in that state orcountry may be considered. 2. The person has lived in Georgia for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the start date for the term and their 12 - month durational requirement has not included time attending any educational institution in Georgia. 3. The person can demonstrate that they moved to Georgia for purposes other than attending any educational institution in the State of Georgia. 4. The person can demonstrate economic self-sufficiency and has contributed to the state by paying meaningful taxes.Financial Information 43 5. The person is a U.S. citizen, Resident Alien or is in a visa status permitting indefinite or permanent residence in the Unit ed States. Criterion 2 A person may be a Georgia resident for tuition purposes if that person meets all of the following conditions: 1. The person is a U.S. citizen, Resident Alien or is in a visa status permitting indefinite permanent residence in the United States and 2. The person can demonstrate that she or he previously held residency status in Georgia but moved from the state and returned within the last 12 months.

The Freshmen Learning Community (FLC) program is strategically aligned with university initiatives to provide quality undergraduate programs and to increase student success and retention. Learningcommunities provide first-semester college students with a formative, integrative academic experience on which to build lifelon g strengths and perspectives as well as immediate connections to the Georgia State campus and its resources. FLCs are designedaround five linked freshmen-level courses tailored to a specific theme. Students who share the same interest enroll in a learni ng community for one semester, taking their FLC courses together. Students and faculty in each FLC form a small, friendly commu-nity within the large research university. During their second semester, FLC students may remain together for one course inaddition to scheduling other courses of their choic e. Latino Services and Outreach. The Latino Services and Outreach program provides a \"one stop shop\" for information regarding financial aid, scholarships, internships, academic advisement, and career counseling. The main goal of the program is toprovide a comprehensive support system necessary for students to be successful in college. Outreach efforts with middle andhigh school students provide a solid foundation for undergraduate activities that focus on building community and connectionamong students. In addition, the program offers educational opportunities for parents and community members interested inpromoting higher education goals within Atlanta's Latin American and Hispanic communities.University Academic Regulations 59 Supplemental Instruction (SI). Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a proven academic support program sponsored by the Office of Undergraduate Studies and specific departments across campus. It is based on the national model from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. It offers free, out-of-class, group study sessions for traditionally difficult courses. Sessions are led by students who have successfully completed the target course and have been selected to be SI leaders. These leaders attend classalong with the students and are available to meet with students outside of class at specific times. SI support courses vary eac h semester, and attendance at SI sessions is voluntary. Scholarship Office. Georgia State University offers merit-based scholarships to both entering freshmen and current under- graduate students. The scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis according to academic ability, generally without regardto financial need. There are three major awards available to incoming freshmen: the Presidential and Goizueta, which are fullscholarships, and the Berner, which is half-award, half-interest free loan. Incoming students should submit the application forFreshmen Scholarships to the Scholarship Office by December 1. An award made to an incoming freshman is automaticallyrenewable for up to four years provided the student makes satisfactory progress consistent with the recommended coursesequence for his or her degree. 1310.50 Learning Support Program The Learning Support Program (LSP) is for undergraduate students admitted on an exceptions basis who need remedial assistance in the areas of math, reading, and/or writing. The following courses are part of the program: Academic Reading EdRd 0071 Academic Math Math 0099 Students normally register for required LSP courses before registering for other courses. LSP courses do not count towards degree requirements or a student's GPA at Georgia State University. They are, however, used to calculate a GPA for HOPE, Pelland other financial aid awards, and the courses and grades earned appear on a university transcript. Approval to enroll in some degree credit courses in addition to the LSP courses may be granted if prerequisites for the degree courses are met and the student has not exceeded other LSP limits (see below). Advisement and Enrollment. It is very important that LSP students meet each term with an academic adviser for advice regarding course selection. For this reason, an advisement hold is placed on each LSP student's record each term. The hold islifted after the student has seen an adviser in the Student Advisement Center. Any student experiencing difficulty and/or considering withdrawing from an LSP course during the term must first meet with an adviser. The adviser will inform the student of the program's withdrawal policies, including the right to apply for hardshipwithdrawal if an emergency situation exists. Students are allowed a maximum of three attempts per academic area to pass all required courses in that area. Any grade other than a W counts as an attempt. If a student does not complete an academic area within 12 semester hours or 3 semesters,whichever occurs first, the student will be suspended from the university for three years. Exiting the Program. Students exit LSP by earning a passing score on the COMPASS test. Students who have passed an LSP course but not passed the COMPASS must re-enroll in the relevant LSP course. The passing COMPASS scores are asfollows: Reading, 74Writing, 60Math, 37 (on the COMPASS Algebra test) Students must successfully exit LSP before they earn 20 hours of degree credit. If students do not complete their requirements before they have attempted 20 semester hours, their registration will be restricted to LSP courses only. Requests for waivers to any of the above regulations should be submitted to the Director of the Student Advisement Center for review and approval by the university's Admissions and Standards committee. 1310.55 College Preparatory Curriculum Requirements The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia requires all students to have completed sufficient English, math, science, social science and language courses in high school as preparation for college-level coursework. Students admitted to Georgia State with a deficiency in one or more of these areas must make up the deficiency by taking Georgia State core classes(science, social science, or language) or passing the COMPASS proficiency test (English or math). The Student AdvisementCenter will advise students about which courses they can choose from to complete a CPC requirement. Credits earned in coursestaken to meet CPC requirements do not count toward graduation requirements. A grade of C or higher is required, and grades60 University Academic Regulations earned in these courses are counted in the student's GPA. Students must complete all CPC-required courses before they earn 30 hours and in their first three semesters of enrollment. Otherwise they may not register for any courses except CPC courses unt il all requirements are complete. Some transfer students are admitted with CPC requirements that were satisfied at a previous college or university. In this case, transfer courses used to satisfy CPC requirements may not be used toward graduation requirements at Georgia State. 1310.70 University Career Services 260 University Centerhttp://www.gsu.edu/career Cooperative education programs provide for periods of paid work experience related to the student's area of study and/or career interest. These work experiences enhance the student's academic studies and provide a first hand look at the real world of work. The program is optional but available to all qualified students. Students who are completing cooperative education experiences on a full-time basis will be designated as full-time students. University Career Services will provide the names of these students to the Of fice of the Registrar. Students who have completed cooperative education experiences on a full-time basis as part of their academic programs will have a transcript notation stating which semesters were spent in cooperative education employment. For additional information, call 404/413-1820. 1310.80 International Student and Scholar Services 252 Sparks Hall http://www.gsu.edu/isss International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) provides support for Georgia State University's non-immigrant international student, faculty, and researcher population, their dependents, and any foreign-born citizens and permanent residents of the United States who may need services.

Out-of-state tuition waivers may be available to F-1 and J-1 status degree-seeking international students on a competitiv e, need-based basis after completion of one academic year of study. International Student Orientation. Prior to registration at the beginning of each semester , an orientation program is offered to provide assistance to new students on nonimmigrant status. Students receive information and advice concerning federalimmigration regulations, the academic system in the United States, academic advisement and registration, the Atlanta community,and the mandatory health and accident insurance. International Student Associations. Georgia State University has approximately twenty international student organizations that focus on celebrating the many countries and cultures represented on campus. They provide assistance for new and continu-ing international students, present cultural activities and events, and seek ways to share their culture with the campus. Info rma- tion about the various associations and their umbrella group, the International Student Association Council, is available in th e International Services office, and online at http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwsta/org.htm . International Student Health Insurance. International Student Health Insurance is mandatory for all international students and scholars in F and J status enrolled at Geor gia State, and it is optional for other nonimmigrant status students. A special international student health and accident insurance policy is made available each academic year, and payment of the insurancepremiums is collected along with tuition during the process of registration. Individuals who may already be covered by a policyare required to submit information about the existing policy to http://www.studentinsurance.com for review and exemption approval the semester before enrollment. 1320 Course Credit This section describes the various ways students may earn credit for Georgia State University courses without actually taking those courses at Georgia State.University Academic Regulations 61 1320.10 Transfer Credit Policy When an applicant is accepted for undergraduate transfer admission, courses completed with grades of C or higher that parallel the curriculum of Georgia State University will be accepted for transfer credit. As discussed below, some credit may be awarded for courses completed with a grade of D. Developmental, vocational, and occupational courses will not be accepted for transfer credit. Credit must have been earned at institutions of higher education with full accreditation by a regional associa tion of colleges and schools and, where appropriate, the Commission on Colleges. The determination of how transfer credit may beused to satisfy the specific course requirements for a degree is made by the Student Advisement Center or the college thatadministers the degree program requirements. The college may also choose to test the student's proficiency in transferredcoursework. A maximum of 12 semester hours where grades of D have been earned may be applied toward degree requirements.These 12 semester hours include both resident credit (earned at Georgia State) and transfer credit. Transfer creditwill not be given for English composition courses where grades of D have been earned. Additional restrictions incredit accepted for courses where grades of D have been earned are included in certain degree programs. Be sure tocheck the description of your planned program in this catalog. No credit will be awarded for a grade earned at a foreign institution that is equivalent to a grade of D in the UnitedStates. A maximum of 60 semester hours from a two-year college or 81 semester hours from a four-year college may beapplied in the program for which the applicant enrolls. Courses completed at a two-year college will be grantedlower-division credit. The total number of hours that may be earned toward a degree by extension or correspon-dence courses may not exceed 30 semester hours. Because the university has a minimum academic residence requirement, the amount of transfer credit applicable to adegree program may be further limited (see Section 1430). Georgia State does not grant credit for College-Level General Educational Developmental Tests, USAFI courses, orcourses completed at any United States armed forces service schools, with the exception of the military academies.For information on DANTES examinations, see Section 1320.40. For those students seeking a baccalaureate degree, transfer credit for degrees previously awarded by other institutions will be granted as follows. 1. Students will be granted credit for all of Areas A-E of the core and the Regents' Test if they hold one of the following: a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education in the United States the equivalent of a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution of higher education in the UnitedStates (as certified by Georgia State or a Georgia State-approved agency such as Joseph Silny and Associates, Inc.) an associate's degree designed to transfer to a baccalaureate program from a USG institution 2. However, there are two exceptions to the policy stated in 1 above. Students seeking a baccalaureate degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, physics,science education, or math education who do not hold a baccalaureate degree in one of these fields will only begranted credit for all of Areas B, C, and E. They will be granted credit in Areas A and D on a course-by-course basis. Students seeking a baccalaureate degree in nursing, nutrition or respiratory therapy will only be granted credit forall of Areas A, B, C, and E. They will be granted credit in Area D on a course-by-course basis. 3. Students who hold any other associate's degree, such as an associate's degree from a non-USG institution or an associate's degree not designed to transfer to a baccalaureate program, will be granted transfer credit on a course-by-course basis. 1320.20 Credit Transfer for Transient Students The following regulations pertain to academic credit earned by a Georgia State University degree-seeking undergraduate as a transient student at another accredited institution that the student wishes to receive transfer credit toward a degree at Georg ia State. Terms other than transient (such as visiting student, unclassified student, or special student) may be used at otherinstitutions to describe this status. Whatever the term used to describe the student's status, these regulations are applicable to Georgia State students who enroll temporarily at the other institution, with the intention of returning to Georgia State, rather thanto students who officially transfer to another institution. These regulations are in addition to those described in this chapte r regarding correspondence and extension work. These regulations do not apply to credit earned through cross registration, which is considered resident credit.In general, the philosophy that underlies these regulations is the desire to allow students the opportunity to take courses not available at Georgia State that would enhance their degree programs. In addition, for students who have moved from themetropolitan Atlanta area, these provisions allow for possible progress toward the degree during the time away from Atlanta if the move is temporary or for possible completion of the degree if the move is permanent. These regulations are not primarily for th e short-term convenience of the students. The following procedures apply:62 University Academic Regulations 1. A degree-seeking undergraduate student who wishes to take academic courses elsewhere as a transient student and apply those credits toward the Georgia State degree must obtain written approval in advance from the Student Advise- ment Center or the Office of Academic Assistance of his or her college. Failure to obtain written approval in advancemay preclude acceptance of the transfer credit and/or will result in the student being required to meet the degreerequirements of the catalog in effect at the time he or she reenrolls at Georgia State. The student's advisement officeshould be consulted to determine the proper procedure for requesting to take courses as a transient student and to learnof any additional regulations applicable to the individual college; 2. a. A student must have a minimum Georgia State cumulative GPA of 2.00 and the GPA required to enroll in the Georgia State course which is most similar to the course the student wishes to take as a transient.b. A currently enrolled student who does not have the required Georgia State cumulative GPA cannot be approveduntil the current semester's grades are available and the current academic standing can be determined.c. Approval will not be granted more than three months in advance of the semester the student wishes to enrollelsewhere. 3. The content of each course to be taken elsewhere must correspond to that of a course allowed or a Georgia State course required in the student's degree program. Course outlines (syllabi) and catalog information may be required so contentcan be evaluated before approval is granted. 4. A course cannot be taken at an institution in the metropolitan Atlanta area as a transient student if either of the foll ow- ing conditions apply:a. the course has previously been attempted at Georgia State (including attempts which resulted in a withdrawal);b. the course or an appropriate substitute is routinely available at Georgia State (that is, offered each semester or ona specified regular basis, such as every fall); determination of whether the course is routinely available is made bythe advisement office in consultation with the chair or director of the academic unit that offers the course. 5. A student may not take courses for degree credit at another institution during the semester he or she expects to graduate from Georgia State. 6. In general, a minimum grade of C is required in any course taken elsewhere. A grade lower than C can be accepted only if both of these conditions exist: the student has not yet earned the maximum number of grades of D permitted in his or herprogram AND the student's degree program allows a grade of D in the particular course taken elsewhere. 7. Approval to take courses as a transient cannot be given if such approval will cause the student to violate any aspect of the university's residence requirement (see Section 1430). 8. It is the student's responsibility to comply with application procedures and any other requirements that the other institution may have regarding establishing status as a transient student there. 9. After completing the course, it is the student's responsibility to promptly request that an official transcript be sent from the other institution to: Georgia State University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, P.O. Box 4009, Atlanta, GA 30302-4009. 1320.30 Credit for Correspondence or Extension Programs Students may apply no more than 30 semester hours of work earned through correspondence or extension programs of other institutions toward the requirements for an undergraduate degree. Students are cautioned to consult with their academic adviserfor additional college regulations on correspondence or extension work. Students must obtain the permission of the dean of thei r college, or the designated college representative, prior to taking correspondence courses to be applied toward the completion o f the degree program. 1320.40 Credit by Examination Georgia State University recognizes that learning can take place in various modes and places other than the traditional college classroom. Knowledge gained through experiential learning and other means is evaluated for possible college creditthrough examination. The Advanced Placement Program (AP), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and the Interna-tional Baccalaureate Program (IB) are the most commonly used tests for this purpose. These are standardized examinationsadministered nationally each year. For information on CLEP, contact the University Testing Office, http://www.gsu.edu/testing . For information on AP and IB, contact your high school guidance counselor . Other standardized exams or special departmental examinations may be approved for credit.

Detailed information concerning the registra- tion process, registration time-ticket assignments, and GoSOLAR registration can be found online athttp://www.gsu.edu/es/office_of_the_registrar.html . Each semester students should go online for specific instructions for registering as well as a list of courses offered for the semester. Students are ur ged to become knowledgeable about registratio n instructions and to follow them exactly. Registering students are expected to have prepared a registration work sheet beforeaccessing the University's registration system. Unless approved by the department chair, a student may only register for onesection of a given course in a given session. Any deviation from the prescribed procedure may result in unnecessary delays inregistration or errors in the resulting schedule. The Office of the Registrar cannot be held responsible for errors resulting from thestudent's failure to follow the prescribed registration and schedule revision procedures. Any problems experienced with registra-tion should be reported to the Enrollment Services Center in person at 227 Sparks Hall or by e-mail to onestopshop@gsu.eduwithin 24 hours of the occurrence. 1330.12 Registration Notifications All students must notify the Office of Undergraduate Admissions prior to registering if any of the following conditions apply. 1. The student has attended another school since last attending Georgia State. The student must have an official transcript of credits sent from the school he or she attended. The student must be eligible to reenroll at the last school attended before he or she returns to Georgia State University. Failure to submit this transcript by the midpoint of the first term after returning to Georgia State could result in the placing of a registrationhold on the student's record. 2. The student has disciplinary actions pending at the last institution attended since matriculation at Georgia State.3. The student has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation since last attending Georgia State. Failure to notify the University of any of the above conditions could result in university sanctions, including expulsion. 1330.15 Registration Time-Ticket Assignments Students who are eligible to register will be given a registration time-ticket assignment. The first ten days of registration a re the only days of registration that are time-ticketed. Approximately one week before registration begins, students can find thei r registration time-ticket assignments by entering the GoSOLAR website at https://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm . Students will also receive an e-mail referring them to the GoSOLAR website where they can view their registration time-ticket assignments. A student's time-ticket assignment is valid beginning at the student's assigned time and continues through the last day of registration. Time-tickets are assigned with priority to students scheduled to graduate for the upcoming registration term andthen to continuing students according to the total credit hours earned. Once a student is allowed access, the student can adjus t his or her schedule on a first-come, first-served basis during the remaining registration period. It is to the student' s advant age to attempt to register as soon as he or she is allowed access to the registration system, because many classes fill up quickly. 1330.18 Late Registration During late registration, access is on a first-come, first-served basis. If a student's first attempt to register is during la te registration, a $50 non-refundable late fee will be charged. This $50 fee will also be charged if a student is dropped for nonp ay- ment of fees and attempts to re-register during late registration. If a student appeals to add a class after late registration has ended and if the appeal is approved, the student will be charge d a $37.50 manual schedule adjustment fee. This fee is charged for each appeal approved. Appeals should be directed to thedepartment that teaches the course the student wishes to add.68 University Academic Regulations 1330.20 Immunizations Immunization Office 141 Piedmont Avenue, Suite D http://www.gsu.edu/health/immunizations_and_travel.html All new students attending regularly scheduled classes on campus or receiving resident credit are required to submit a certificate of immunization prior to registering for and attending such classes. The immunizations required are Measles, Mumps & Rubella (MMR), Tetanus/Diphtheria (Td), Varicella (chicken pox), and Hepatitis B. In addition, the Meningitis Law requires students residing in university housing to have the Meningococcal vaccine . For more information, see the GSU Clinic website updates at http://www.gsu.edu/health . Every student attending classes on campus must complete the immunization requirements of the University System of Georgia. The requirement varies according to the age of the student as follows: Students 18 years or younger at the beginning of the term must show proof of immunity to Hepatitis B, MMR, T etanus/ diphtheria, and Varicella (chickenpox). Students 19 years and older at the beginning of the term are strongly recommended to be immunized for Hepatitis B, but they are not required to show proof of immunity to Hepatitis B. They are required to show proof of immunity to MMR,Tetanus/diphtheria and Varicella. Students born outside the United States on or before 12/31/1956 must show proof of immunity to Tetanus/Diphtheria and Varicella only. Students born in the United States on or before 12/31/1956 are required to show proof of Tetanus/diphtheria only. Students born in the United States on or before 12/31/1980 are exempt from showing proof of the Varicella vaccine. They are required to submit proof of immunity for MMR, Tetanus/diphtheria. Students born outside the United States 01/01/1957 or later must provide proof of MMR, Tetanus/diphtheria, and Varicella. The Immunization Office must receive these records before the last day of late registration. Immunization holds will be placed on student accounts to prevent registration and drop/add until the requirement is satisfied. Students seeking exemption for religious reasons must submit a completed Georgia State University Certificate of Immuniza- tion form to the Immunization Office indicating their religious exemption request. Students with medical reasons for exemption must submit a doctor's letter indicating if this is a permanent or temporary exemption, and, if temporary, the date of expirati on. When the temporary exemption expires, the student must complete all immunization requirements. In the event of an epidemic ora threatened epidemic of any disease preventable by immunization, and when an emergency has been declared by appropriatehealth authorities, additional steps will be undertaken to protect the health of the University community. In the event of adeclared public health emergency, persons who do not have proof of immunization on file will not be allowed to participate inclasses or other activities on campus. Additional information and copies of the immunization certification form may be obtained by contacting the Immunization Office located in 141 Piedmont Avenue, Ste. D, or by telephone at 404/413-1940, or online athttp://www.gsu.edu/health/immunizations_and_travel.html . Meningitis : Georgia law requires that students residing in campus housing be provided information on meningococcal disease and vaccination. After reviewing information about the risks for the disease and the benefits of prevention by themeningitis vaccine, students 18 years and older are required to sign a form kept on file in the Housing Office. Students less than 18 years of age must show their parent or guardian's signature on the form. This \"Meningococcal Disease Notification\" form documents that the information was reviewed and the option of the vaccine was provided, and/or date the vaccination waselicited. Compliance with the state law is a requirement for residing in campus housing and is part of the housing contract.Forms and further information are available from the Housing Office at 404/413-1800 or by email at housing@gsu.edu. 1330.25 Audit Status Enrolled students who wish to audit a course must get approval from the course instructor. Registration for an audit is done in the Enrollment Services Center, 227 Sparks Hall. Any fees for auditing a class are assessed just as they are for courses taken for credit. Any requirements for prerequisites must be satisfied before registering to audit a course. No academic credit is earned in this status. Audit status is not covered by financial aid, and audit hours do not apply toward full-time enrollment. Students maynot transfer from audit to credit status or vice-versa after the last day to register for course credit. 1330.30 Course Load Full-time Course Load: To be certified as full-time students, students must carry a minimum of 12 semester hours. However, a course load of 30 semester hours per year is required in order to complete an undergraduate degree program in four years. A student who is enrolled in less than a full-time course of study at Georgia State may be in jeopardy of the following:University Academic Regulations 69 1. Losing insurance coverage under his or her parent/guardian's insurance policy; 2. Being placed on a loan repayment schedule by a lender or guarantor if the student is the recipient of federal financial aid; and/or3. Losing a scholarship if the guidelines for receiving the scholarship require full-time enrollment.Half-time Course Load: Half-time enrollment is 6 to 11 semester hours for students.Increased Course Load: A student may schedule as many as 18 semester hours without special permission. See the online Registration Guide at http://www.gsu.edu/es/registration_guide.html for additional information about taking an increased course load. Requests for exceptions to the maximum course load of 18 semester hours will be considered by the StudentAdvisement Center or the Office of Academic Assistance of a student' s college if the student has completed a course load of 15 semester hours in some previous semester at Georgia State University with a grade point average of at least 3.00 for the semest er and if either of the following conditions is met: 1. The student attained the Faculty Scholar designation during his or her most recent enrollment at Georgia State and, if areentering student, has achieved a grade of A for all credit hours earned elsewhere since the most recent enrollment atGeorgia State; or2. The student has earned 60 semester hours of credit and has a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.00 for the preceding two semesters of residence. International Students: International students in the student visa status of F and J are required to carry a full-time course load as defined by the Department of Homeland Security (currently 12 credit hours per semester for undergraduate students). Aninternational student who is enrolled on a student visa may be in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the Department ofHomeland Security if enrolled in less than a full-time course of study. Additionally, those F and J international students enro lling for the first time in summer school must carry six credit hours to be considered full-time for immigration purposes. 1330.33 Registration Restrictions for 3000/4000-level Courses Registration in 3000 and 4000-level courses in the following departments or areas require a specific Georgia State University cumulative GPA (See Section 1350.20 for details on how the cumulative GPA is calculated). All departments in the Robinson College of Business 2.50 required Criminal Justice 2.00 requiredFilm and Video 2.50 requiredJournalism 2.50 required (excluding Jour 3500) In addition, registration in all 3000 and 4000-level courses in the Robinson College of Business require a total of 45 semester hours earned. Some departments also have minimum GPA requirements to obtain admission to a particular major or degree. These require- ments are specified in the college chapters of this catalog when applicable. 1330.35 Taking a Course More Than Once Colleges may limit the number of times a student can take a course for a grade. Colleges may place this limit on some courses but not others, and different courses may have different limits. All limits are stated in the catalog. For purposes of this pol icy, a student takes a course for a grade when they receive a grade notation included in the grade point average calculation. Forexample, a student who earns an A or a WF has taken the course for a grade, but a student who earns an S or W has not. Astudent who wishes to take a course more times than authorized by the college must enroll as an auditor. 1330.40 Cross Registration Georgia State University students may enroll in courses offered by member institutions of the Atlanta Regional Consortium for Higher Education (ARCHE) under a cross registration agreement provided they meet the academic eligibility and otherrequirements of the agreement. Students may learn more about cross registration or obtain an ARCHE Cross Registration form athttps://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm . Students who wish to cross register must complete and submit an ARCHE Cross Registration form to the Enrollment Services Center (227 Sparks Hall) at Georgia S tate. An approval signature of a representative of the Student Advisement Center or the Office of Academic Assistance in the student's college of study is required. To participate in this program, students must beconcurrently enrolled in at least one Georgia State course and meet the following minimum requirements: students must have atleast a 2.0 GPA and the GPA required to enroll in the Georgia State course which is most similar to the course that the studentwishes to take as a cross-registrant. Courses taken through cross registration count as residence credit, and grades are inclu ded in the Georgia State grade point average. Students are not allowed to pre-register for cross registration courses. Registration will be on a space-available basis, and the host institution will specify the time and date on which a student must register.70 University Academic Regulations For all courses taken as an ARCHE cross registration student, the tuition and fees will be at the rate of the home institution and paid to the home institution. Georgia State students pay fees after the cross registration is confirmed by the host institu tion. Students must request that the Registrar's Office of the host institution send an official transcript to their home institution upon completion of the term. Students must complete new cross registration forms for any subsequent terms in which they plan to participate in the cross registration program. Cross registration is available in the summer on a limited basis. Consult the cross registration office for more information. The other ARCHE member institutions are: Agnes Scott College, Atlanta College of Art, Brenau University, Clark Atlanta University, Clayton and State University, Columbia Theological Seminary, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology,Interdenominational Theological Center, Kennesaw State University, Mercer University Atlanta Campus, Morehouse College,Morehouse School of Medicine, Oglethorpe University, Southern Polytechnic State University, Spelman College, State Universityof West Georgia, and University of Georgia. 1330.50 Changes in Personal Data As correct personal data is vital to the student's record, students are urged to have their records updated when these changes occur. GoSOLAR, https://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm, allows students to update some of their student records (address, phone number, etc.) using a terminal or personal computer. S tudents who wish to change their names should contact the Enrollment Services Center, Room 227 Sparks Hall, to complete forms and provide the legal documents required for aname change. 1330.55 Off-Campus Courses Many courses are offered to Georgia State University students at satellite locations. Students taking these courses must meet the same academic requirements and deadlines as students attending classes at the downtown campus. Each semester a listof off-campus courses can be found on GoSOLAR. 1330.60 Transcript Request A student who has discharged all obligations to Georgia State University is entitled to receive, upon request, a copy of his or her transcript. Official transcripts of academic work completed at Georgia State University may be ordered via Georgia State'swebsite (https://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm ). A student is entitled to five free lifetime transcripts. Once a student has exhausted the five free transcripts, Georgia State will char ge a $10.00 processing fee for each transcript processed therea fter. There is a three to four business day processing period for requests. Picture identification is required to pick up transcript s. Transcript requests will not be processed until complete payment is received. Credit card payment is required for web requests. Copies of official transcripts received from other institutions will not be made. Such requests must be directed to the institution holding the student's original records. Routine copies of other information in the student's education records, with the exception of transcripts from other institu- tions and other items excluded from copying by practice or regulation, will be provided upon written request. A fee may becharged to cover the cost of copying. Special certifications based on educational records will be provided upon written requestwhen permissible. 1330.70 Enrollment and Degree Verification Enrollment verification is obtained via the web at no cost to students and takes approximately 7 business days to process. Enrollment Verification To obtain proof of enrollment, students should access GoSOLAR. At this site, students can do the following: 1. Print a Certificate of Enrollment that can be forwarded to a health insurer, housing provider, employer, credit issuer, or other student services provider; 2. View the electronic notification and deferment forms that have been sent to a lender; and3. View a list of lenders and real-time student loan information detail, such as outstanding principal balance and next due dat e that some lenders provide. Once a student drops a course, those hours cannot be used for verification of enrollment purposes. A student's enrollment status may change if he/she drops or withdraws from a course or withdraws from the university. If a student is co-enrolled atUniversity Academic Regulations 71 another collegiate institution during the same semester he or she is enrolled at Georgia State University, only the enrolled ho urs at Georgia State can be used for enrollment verification purposes. Degree Verification To obtain proof that a degree has been awarded, students should go to http://www.degreeverify .com . At this site, students can provide proof of degree to such agencies as third-party verifiers, credit card companies, and credit approval agencies. This is a website of the National Student Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse provides degree verification services to Georgia Statestudents. 1330.80 Directory Information An enrolled student may request that directory information (name, address, etc) not be public. To make this request, a student should fill out a Suppress Information Form, available at http://www.gsu.edu/es/student_information_suppr ession.html , and turn it in to the Enrollment Services Center, 227 Sparks Hall. 1332 Revision of Class Schedules (Add/Drop/Withdraw) Students desiring to revise their class schedules must follow the procedure appropriate for the period of time in the semester (see section 1332.10 below). During the published registration periods for each semester, students will revise their schedules on GoSOLAR. Schedule revisions are defined as any changes to a student's schedule and include dropping and/or adding classes.Dropped courses do not appear on the student's official record. To remove a course from a class schedule during the publishedregistration period is referred to by the university community as \"dropping\" a course. After the last day to add/drop a course,students may \"withdraw\" from a course when they decide to stop attending. Withdrawing from a course prior to the midpoint ofthe term makes the student eligible for a grade of W if the withdrawal limit has not be exceeded. This grade is reflected on th e student's official record. All schedule revisions must be completed by the official last day to register for course credit as published in the online Registraton Calendars at http://www.gsu.edu/es/20677.html . Students who wish to request to be allowed to register for a course after the deadline, based on institutional error, should contact the department offering the course. 1332.10 Dropping Classes and Voluntary Withdrawal Georgia State University reserves the right, at any time during the semester, to drop any student from classes for failure to pay tuition and fees. However, students should not assume that Georgia State will drop them from classes for failure to paytuition and fees. Students who cease to attend, but do not formally drop their classes using GoSOLAR athttps://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm, will suffer serious financial and academic consequences. A. Drop Periods, Withdrawal Periods, and Grades of W 1. During registration: When the registration system is open to students at the beginning of each term, students may drop or add classes usingGoSOLAR. When a class is dropped during this period, no grade is recorded and no record of the student's being enrolledin the class appears on the student' s transcript. Registration ends at 5 p.m. on the first Friday of the term. 2.During the second week of classes:During the second week of classes, faculty have the discretion to request to add or drop students from classes. Factorssuch as space availability and health and safety regulations may apply to such requests. When a class is dropped duringthis period, no grade is recorded and no record of the student being enrolled in the class appears on the student's transcript. The second week of classes ends at 5 p.m. on the second Friday of the term. 3.After the second week of classes and before the midpoint of the term: During this period, students may withdraw from a class or classes using GoSOLAR. Students will receive a grade of W orWF for any class dropped during this period depending on whether or not they have exceeded their limit of withdrawals witha grade of W. Specifically, students will automatically be awarded a W if they have not exceeded their limit and a WF if theyhave. Grades of W and WF appear on the student's transcript. (Note: A grade of WF is treated as an F for GPA calculationpurposes.) 4. After the midpoint of the term: After the midpoint of the term, voluntary withdrawals cannot occur. B. Limits on Withdrawals with a Grade of W 1. Students are allowed to withdraw with a grade of W a maximum of six times in their undergraduate careers at Georgia State.2. The limit on withdrawals does not apply if a student withdraws from all classes during a term before the midpoint. However, students are only allowed to withdraw from all classes prior to the midpoint twice without having their withdrawals count72 University Academic Regulations against the limit. Students who withdraw from all classes a third or subsequent time will automatically receive a grade of WF in their classes if they have reached their limit of Ws. 3. It is possible that a student will withdraw from more than one class in a particular semester and not have enough Ws left to use a W in all those classes. In that case, classes will be awarded a W based on the date and time the student initiated thewithdrawal from that class. For example, if a student had taken five Ws in their career at Georgia State and then withdrewfrom three of the four classes in which the student is enrolled, the student's sixth W allowed would be assigned to the classfrom which the student withdrew first. The student would receive a WF in the other two classes. In these cases, studentsmay make an appeal to the Student Advisement Center or their Office of Academic Advisement to shift the W from one classto another. Such requests must be made no later than the end of the semester after the semester in which the studentwithdrew from the classes. (Whether a student is enrolled in the semester after the semester in which the student withdrewfrom the classes does not change this time limit.) Students may not shift Ws between semesters. 4. The following sorts of withdrawals do not count against the limit on withdrawals with a grade of W. a. Hardship withdrawals (see Section 1332.40).b. Grades of WF (withdrawal failing).c. Grade of WM (withdrawal military).d. Withdrawals taken in semesters before Fall Semester 2006.e. Withdrawals taken at other institutions. 5. This policy applies to all degree seeking undergraduate students. It does not apply to non-degree students (such as post baccalaureate students). Students formally withdrawing from all classes may be entitled to a refund of a portion of their fees (see Section 1210). In an emergency situation that precludes personal action to withdraw from classes, a student may communicate with the Office of the Dean of Students, http://www.gsu.edu/deanofstudents . 1332.20 Withdrawals and Drops from Off-Campus Courses and Cancelled Courses In general, if a student voluntarily withdraws from an off-campus course, then the normal withdrawal policy applies (see section 1332.10). If the off-campus course's schedule does not match a Georgia State University term, then the mid-point of th e course will be the mid-point of the period from the first off-campus meeting of the course to the last meeting of the course. If a course is cancelled by Georgia State after the first week of classes, then the student may choose between three options:1. They may have the course dropped from their schedule (even if the course is cancelled after the end of Late Registra- tion ), or 2. They may take a W in the course, or 3. In coordination with the course instructor and the department chair, the student may develop an academically appropri- ate plan to complete the course. These plans must be approved by the instructor and the department chair. 1332.30 Involuntary Withdrawal Students are expected to observe all policies governing the class. Faculty must clearly state these policies in the course syllabus. When a faculty member determines that a student is in violation of one of the class policies (for example, has missed a required assignment or has excessive absences), that faculty member may withdraw the student from the course. Students involuntarily withdrawn prior to the midpoint of the course will be assigned a grade of W unless they've exceeded their maximumnumber of withdrawals allowed (see Section 1332.10). Students involuntarily withdrawn after the midpoint of the course will beassigned a grade of WF. Note that a WF is treated as an F for GPA calculation purposes. Using the official Georgia State Univer - sity email system, the instructor will notify a student who is involuntarily withdrawn, and within ten days of this notification, thestudent may petition to the department chair for reinstatement in the course. Students involuntarily withdrawn from all classes may be entitled to a refund of a portion of their fees (see Section 1240). 1332.40 Hardship Withdrawal Students may be granted hardship withdrawals when non-academic emergency situations occur which prevent them from completing their coursework (e.g., severe medical problems, traumatic events/circumstances that cause them to missnumerous classes.). Hardship withdrawals are subject to the following restrictions: 1. Students are not eligible for hardship withdrawals in any course in which they have completed the course requirements (for example, taking the final exam or submitting the final project). 2. Students must initiate an application for a hardship withdrawal no later than one academic year after the semester in which the courses were taken.University Academic Regulations 73 Hardship status normally applies to all of your courses for the semester but in some cases may be granted for some and not others. Students requesting a hardship withdrawal in some but not all of their courses must provide documentation to justify such a partial withdrawal. If a student is granted a hardship withdrawal (full or partial), the instructors of the courses from whichthe student is withdrawing must award a grade of \"W\" or \"WF,\" depending on whether the student was doing passing work asof the effective date of the hardship. For further information on hardship withdrawals, contact the Office of the Dean of Students at http://www.gsu.edu/deanofstudents . 1332.45 Military Withdrawal A student who is on active duty or is a military reservist (including members of the National Guard) may withdraw from the university if called for active duty or reassignment. The student must officially withdraw and submit Official Orders to ActiveDuty to the Enrollment Services Center, 227 Sparks Hall. A student is not eligible for a military withdrawal in any course in w hich the student has completed the course requirements (for example, taking the final exam or submitting the final project). Electiv e fees are to be prorated according to the date on which the student officially withdraws. Students who withdraw and receive a fu ll tuition refund will receive a grade of \"WM\" (military withdrawal) for all courses from which the student has withdrawn. 1332.50 Non-Academic Withdrawal A student may be withdrawn from the university for non-academic reasons when in the judgment of the Dean of Students, it is determined that the student has demonstrated behavior that: (a) poses a significant danger or threat of physical harm to self or tothe person or property of others; or (b) interferes with the rights of other members of the university community or with the ex ercise of any proper activities or functions of the university or its personnel. Except in situations where the student is believed to be animminent threat to self or others, as determined at the sole discretion of the University, a student shall, upon request, be ac corded an appropriate hearing prior to the final decision concerning his or her continued enrollment at the university. In situationsinvolving an imminent threat, the student will be provided a hearing as soon as possible after the withdrawal occurs. Theinstructor will assign students who are non-academically withdrawn a grade of W or WF (depending on whether they haveexceeded their maximum number of withdrawals allowed) if they are withdrawn before the semester midpoint and a WF if they arewithdrawn after the semester midpoint. 1334 Class Attendance The resources of the university are provided for the intellectual growth and development of its students; it is expected that students should attend class regularly. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires that institutions of higher learning immediately report to them when a student discontinues attendance. Georgia State University institutional policy requires that professors report the absence of a veteranstudent as soon as it is known that the student will not be returning to class. Generally, this should be reported after one week ofabsences and no later than two weeks of nonattendance by a student. All matters related to student absences, including the making up of work missed, are to be arranged between the student and the professor. All professors will, at the beginning of each semester, make a clear statement in the course syllabus to each of theirclasses, describing their policies for handling absences. Professors will also be responsible for counseling with their student s regarding the academic consequences of absences from their classes or laboratories. Students are obligated to adhere to therequirements of each course and of each professor. Students must be present for announced quizzes, laboratory periods, or final examinations unless the reasons for the absence are acceptable to the professors concerned. A student who is absent because of participation in activities approved by theProvost's Office will be permitted to make up work missed during his or her absence, provided that the student misses no morethan 15 percent of class hours per course per semester. If requested, the appropriate university official will provide a memo s tating the official nature of the university business in advance of the activity. Faculty are strongly encouraged to take into conside ration religious holidays of the student's faith, summons, jury duty, or similar compelling reasons for absence. 1336 Final Examinations A student shall not be required to take more than two examinations within one 24-hour period during the published final examination period. More than two examinations within 24 hours are referred to as clustered examinations. A student is considered to have an inappropriate clustering of final examinations when more than two examinations fall within 24 hours (for example, examinations at 8:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., and 6:00 p.m. on the same day, or examinations at 6 p.m. on oneday, and at 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on the following day); the student is not considered to have an inappropriate clustering of74 University Academic Regulations examinations if the third examination in sequence begins at the same time on the subsequent day as the first examination (for example, 6:00 p.m. on one day, and 2:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on the following day). Students who have three or more clustered examinations may request of one professor that the examination be rescheduled according to the following procedure: If a final examination was rescheduled and thereby created a \"cluster,\" the instructor of the rescheduled examinationwill provide a special administration for the adversely affected student. If one or more of the clustered examinations is a \"common examination\" with an established conflict resolution time,the student will request to resolve the conflict by taking one of the common examinations in the conflict resolutiontime. If two or more of the examinations are \"common examinations,\" the student may choose which \"commonexamination(s)\" is to be rescheduled. If one of the clustered examinations is not a common examination or the result of rescheduling, the instructor of themiddle examination(s) will provide a special administration for the adversely affected student. Students must inform the instructor, in writing and at least 14 days before the beginning of the final exam period, that a clustered examination situation exists with respect to that instructor's course and that the student will need to take the fina l examination as a special administration. If a student fails to inform the instructor, in writing and at least 14 days before th e beginning of the final exam period, the instructor is not required to provide a special administration of the final examination . Once a student has taken an examination, he or she cannot request a reexamination on the basis of this policy. 1340 Classification of Students and Courses 1340.10 Class Standing Students are classified on the basis of total earned hours of academic credit as follows: Student S tatus Semester Hours Freshman 0-29 Sophomore 30-59 Junior 60-89 Senior 90 or more The classification under which a student registers at the beginning of any semester will continue through that semester. 1340.20 Change of Catalog Edition Students must normally satisfy the degree requirements of the catalog in effect at the time they enter Georgia State University . However, in some circumstances, revisions may be required to provide more effective programs. The term \"degree requirements\"refers to the courses and grades required to earn the degree. Changes in academic regulations affect all students, regardless of thecatalog edition; examples include the scholastic discipline policy, procedures for removing incomplete grades, and appealsprocedures. There are several instances when a student will be required to change catalog editions and satisfy the curricular degre e requirements of the catalog in effect at the time he or she : 1. Officially changes colleges within the university;2. Officially changes majors within a college;3. Officially changes from post baccalaureate status to any degree-seeking status;4. Reenters the university after a period of two or more consecutive years during which time he or she did not earn academic credit at Georgia State; 5. Reenrolls at Georgia State after attending another institution as a transient student with the intention of transferring credits earned at the other institution to Georgia State without having received written authorization in advance from his orher college. This regulation applies to any length of absence from the university. In such cases, students are considered tobe transfer students; 6. Reenrolls at Georgia State after attending another institution as a transfer student. This regulation applies to any length o f absence from the university; and 7. Has not graduated by the time his or her catalog edition is ten years old. Students may choose to satisfy the degree requirements of a later catalog, but, if they choose to do this, they must meet all the requirements of the later catalog. Degree requirements of more than one catalog edition cannot be combined. Students whoUniversity Academic Regulations 75 choose to satisfy requirements of a later catalog must notify the Student Advisement Center or the Office of Academic Assis- tance of their college. 1340.30 Declaration of Major All applicants other than freshman must declare a degree and major at application. All freshmen must declare a degree and major one calendar year after their first enrollment at Georgia State. Students are encouraged to declare a major as early aspossible. This is especially true for students following a track in natural sciences, health sciences, or mathematics. Colleges anddepartments may require students to declare a degree and major earlier than indicated above. The Director of the StudentAdvisement Center is authorized to grant exemptions to this policy. 1340.35 Change of Major and College Students may request to change majors within one college at Georgia State University or change to another college. If the request is approved, students will transfer their academic standings (good, warning, supervision, or probation). Some programshave special requirements for admission, so students should contact the Student Advisement Center or the Office of AcademicAssistance of the desired college to determine if special criteria apply. To request a change of major or college, students should contact the Student Advisement Center or the Office of Academic Assistance of the college in which they are currently enrolled. Students who change majors or colleges will be required to sati sfy the degree requirements in effect at the time the change is officially recorded. Students who have applied to graduate mustdeclare their degree, major, and minor/concentration (if applicable) with their advisement office prior to their final semester to avoid a possible delay in graduating. 1340.40 Dual Degrees Dual degrees are earned when a student satisfies all requirements for two different baccalaureate degrees (for example, B.A. and B.S.) within one or more colleges of Georgia State University. The minimum residence requirement of 39 semester hours atGeorgia State University in courses numbered 3000 or above must be met for the first degree. If the second degree is completedconcurrently with the first degree, or within five calendar years of the first degree, this requirement shall be deemed to have beensatisfied for both degrees. Regardless of when the second degree is completed, the requirements for the second degree will com e from the catalog edition that the student followed for the first degree. After five years from the date of the award of the first degree, credit that has been used to satisfy the university's academic residence requirement for this degree cannot be applied toward the university's minimum academic residence requirement for thesecond degree. Regardless of when the second degree is completed, both degrees require that at least one-half of the coursescomprising the major or 11 semester hours in the major, whichever is less, must be taken at Georgia State. If a department offe rs more than one degree, it may prohibit a student from earning more than one degree in that department. This restriction will app ear in the Program Degree Requirements setion of the description of the major. Students who wish to earn dual degrees should consult with the Student Advisement Center or the Office of Academic Assistance of their current college and, if the second degree is offered by another college of this university, with the Office of Academic Assistance of the relevant college for information on procedures to follow. 1340.50 Double Major A double major consists of two separate majors in the same baccalaureate degree (for example, B.S. with majors in Criminal Justice and Psychology), regardless of the college or colleges in which that degree is awarded. A double major is earned when t he student completes all requirements for each of the majors and all requirements for the degree. The minimum residence requiremen t of 39 semester hours at Georgia State University in courses numbered 3000 or above must be met for the first major. If the sec ond major is completely concurrently with the first major, or within five calendar years of the first major, this requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied for both majors. Regardless of when the second major is completed, the requirements for thesecond major will come from the catalog edition that the student followed for the first major. After five years from the date of the awarding of the first major, credit that was used to satisfy the university's academic residence requirement cannot be applied toward the university's residence requirement for the second major. Regardless of whenthe second major is completed, at least one-half of the courses comprising both majors or 11 semester hours in the major, which - ever is less, must be taken at Georgia State. Whether in one degree or two, a student may not graduate with more than two majors. (For example, a student may not earn a B.S. with a double major in Economics and Psychology and also a B.A. in English. This would constitute three majors and wouldnot be permissible.) Students who wish to earn double majors should consult with the Student Advisement Center or the Office of Academic Assistance of their current college and, if the second major is offered by another college in the university, with the Office o f Academic Assistance of the relevant college for information on procedures to follow.76 University Academic Regulations 1340.60 Classification of Courses Courses are numbered as follows: Student S tatus Number Range 2000-2999 Junior Senior 4000-4999 Graduate 5000 or higher 1350 The Grading System 1350.10 Grades The following grades are used to specify level of performance in academic courses: A: Excellent B: GoodC: Average Minimum grade required for certain courses, as specified elsewhere in this catalog. D: Poor A grade of D, while giving credit hours, will not apply toward the degree in courses requiring a grade of C or higher. (See Section 1440.)F: Failure This grade indicates failure. No credit toward graduation is given for a course in which a grade of F was received. WF: Withdrawal While Failing This grade indicates failure. No credit toward graduation is given for a course in which a grade of WF was received. A WF and F are treated the same for GPA calculation purposes. The following grades are approved for use in the cases indicated but will not be included in the determination of a student's cumulative grade point average:W: Withdrawal This symbol indicates that a student was permitted to withdraw from the course without penalty. (See \"WF: Withdrawal While Failing\", above, and Section 1332.)WM: Military Withdrawal This symbol indicates that active duty military personnel and military reservists (including members of the National Guard) received emergency orders to active duty or reassignment during the term (see Military Withdrawal, Section 1332.45).I: Incomplete The notation of I may be given to a student who, for nonacademic reasons beyond his or her control, is unable to meet the full requirements of a course. In order to qualify for an \"I\", a student must: 1. Have completed most of the major assignments of the course (generally all but one); and 2. Be earning a passing grade in the course (aside from the assignments not completed) in the judgment of the instructor. When a student has a nonacademic reason for not completing one or more of the assignments for a course, including examinations, and wishes to receive an incomplete for the course, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor inperson or in writing of the reason. A grade of incomplete is awarded at the discretion of the instructor and is not the preroga tiveUniversity Academic Regulations 77 of the student. Conditions to be met for removing a grade of incomplete are established by the instructor. Registering in a subsequent semester for a course in which a grade of incomplete has been received will not remove the grade of incomplete. (SeeSection 1350.30, paragraph 2.) No student may graduate with an \"I\" on his or her record. IP: In Progress This symbol indicates that credit has not been given in courses that require a continuation of work beyond the term for which the student registered for the course. The use of this symbol is approved for dissertation, thesis, and project courses (such as student teaching, clinical practice, and internships). The IP notation may be replaced with an appropriate grade by th e instructor. This symbol cannot be substituted for an \"I.\" This grade is used in the Learning Support Program (LSP) to indicate that a student has demonstrated academic growth in the course; however, the level of achievement is not sufficient to meet all of the course requirements. In LSP, the grade of IP is a permanent grade and does not meet the minimum exit criteria for any course in the program. S: Satisfactory This symbol indicates that credit has been given for completion of degree requirements other than academic course work. The use of this symbol is approved for dissertation and thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, and proficiency requirements in graduate programs. This symbol is also used in a Regents' Test Preparation Course when theRegents' Test was passed. U: Unsatisfactory This symbol indicates unsatisfactory performance in an attempt to complete degree requirements other than academic course work. No credit will be given. The use of this symbol is approved for dissertation and thesis hours, student teaching, clinical practicum, internship, and proficiency requirements in graduate programs. This symbol is also used in a Regents' Test Prepara-tion Course when the Regents' Test was not passed. V: Audit This notation is used when a student has audited a course. Students do not earn academic credit for such courses. See Section 1330.25.K: Credit-by-examination This symbol indicates that a student was given credit for a course based on successful performance on an examination approved for this purpose. NR: Not Reported This symbol indicates that a student's grade was not reported to the Registrar's Office by the deadline for reporting grades for the term as published in the on-line Registration Guide . The grade will be updated as soon as the instructor reports the grade.GP: Grade Pending This symbol indicates a grade will be assigned pending the outcome of an academic honesty case. See Section 1380. 1350.20 Cumulative Grade Point Average The cumulative grade point average is calculated by dividing all hours carried at Georgia State University into total quality points earned. Quality points are calculated by multiplying hours earned for each course by the numerical value of the grade earned. (See the following table for numerical equivalents of letter grades.) Grade point averages are rounded to the hundredthplace. For example, 2.676 is rounded to 2.68. All attempts at all academic courses taken are included in these calculations of total number of grade points earned and the total number of semester hours attempted. Credits earned in other institutions, credit by examination, credits which carry S/Ugrades, CLEP credit, AP credit, institutional credit courses, and courses specifically excluded by university policy are not us ed in computing the cumulative grade point average. The numerical value (grade point) for academic letter grades are as follows: A 4.00 A- 3.70B+ 3.30B 0.00WF 0.00IP 0.00 The symbols I (Incomplete), IP (In Progress), W (Withdrawal), S (Satisfactory), U (Unsatisfactory), V (Audit), K (Credit-by-examination), and NR (Not Reported) do not have numerical equivalents and are not used in calculating grade point averages.The Department of Veterans Affairs defines the U and V as non-punitive grades; however, veteran students should notify theveterans' counselor immediately upon receiving a grade of U or V . 1350.30 Changes in Grade A course grade that has been reported by the instructor to the Office of the Registrar and recorded cannot be changed except in the following circumstances: 1. Error in grade. If a student believes that there is an error in a grade, the student should discuss the situation with the instructor. A request for a change of grade assigned by an instructor who has left the University should be addressed to thechair of the department. 2. Removal of an Incomplete. A student receiving a grade of I (incomplete) is expected to consult with the instructor within the prescribed time limit and to complete all necessary work. The period of time given to a student to remove a grade of I isestablished by the instructor, subject only to the maximum time limit set by the university. The university requires that agrade of I be removed not later than the end of the second academic term after the grade of I was assigned (whether or notthe student was enrolled during these two terms). The Office of the Registrar will assign a grade of F at the end of the secondacademic term unless the Office of the Registrar receives an approved grade adjustment request from the instructor. (If thestudent enrolled for S/U grading, a U will be assigned.). Using the grade adjustment form, instructors may or may not changethis F/U to an authorized academic grade (i.e., A, B, C, D, S or WF) but may not change it back to an I. Instructors may notchange an I to a W unless a Hardship Withdrawal is awarded. In exceptional cases, departments may authorize students tohave an I grade for more than two semesters. Such authorizations must be approved by the department chair. The authoriza-tion to extend the I beyond two semesters must be renewed each semester. Students need not be enrolled to completeassignments for a course in which a grade of I has been assigned. Auditing or retaking the same course will not remove agrade of I. No student may graduate with an incomplete grade. 1352 Academic Recognitions President's List: Degree-seeking students with a minimum Georgia State University cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 who complete at least nine semester hours of academic credit in fall or spring term (or six semester hours in summer te rm) with no Incompletes for the semester and who earn a 4.00 GPA will be placed on the President's List for the semester. Dean's List: Degree-seeking students with a minimum Georgia State cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 who complete at least nine semester hours of academic credit in fall or spring term (or six semester hours in summer term) with noIncompletes for the semester and who earn a GPA of at least 3.50 shall be placed on the appropriate Dean's List for the semeste r. 1360 Academic Support 1360.10 Scholastic Discipline There are four levels of scholastic discipline for students: warning, supervision, probation, and exclusion. A student who is eligible to enroll in courses is in good standing. Students are placed on warning when their cumulative Georgia State University GPA is below 2.0 and they were not on supervision or probation the previous semester in attendance. Students are placed on supervision when their cumulative Georgia State GPA is below 2.0 and they were on warning the previous semester in attendance. However, students on warning who attempt 6 or more semester hours and earn a Georgia State term GP A of 2.3 or better will remain on warning. Students are placed on probation when their cumulative Georgia State GPA is below 2.0 and they were on supervision the previous semester in attendance. However, students on supervision who attempt 6 or more semester hours and earn a Georgia State term GP A of 2.3 or better will remain on supervision.University Academic Regulations 79 Students are placed on exclusion when their cumulative Georgia State GPA is below 2.0 and they were on probation the previous semester in attendance. However, students on probation who attempt 6 or more semester hours and earn a Georgia State term GP A of 2.3 or better will remain on probation. Students on supervision or probation may be allowed to enroll with specific restrictions (see Section 1360.20). Students on exclusion are not eligible to enroll in any undergraduate program or under any status at Georgia State. No transfer credit will be accepted for courses taken at other institutions while on probation or exclusion. Students on warning, supervision, or probation should refer to Section 1360.20 and consult with an adviser in the Student Advisement Center for additional information about scholastic discipline. 1360.20 Academic Improvement Program (AIP) The Academic Improvement Program (AIP) is intended to assist students in extricating themselves from scholastic discipline and to meet the graduation requirement of a cumulative Georgia State University GPA of 2.0 or higher. The elements of AIP areregistration approvals by an adviser, course load limits, and survival skills instruction. For further information about AIP, p lease contact the Student Advisement Center at http://www.gsu.edu/es/advisement.html . Students on warning may register for no more than 13 semester hours. They are not required to meet with an academic adviser, although they are encouraged to do so as necessary for help selecting courses, understanding degree requirements andacademic regulations, and developing strategies for returning to a 2.0 cumulative GPA . Students on supervision are required to participate in AIP as follows: (a) have their registration approved by an academic adviser; (b) register for no more than 13 semester hours; (c) and take any other steps required by the academic adviser (forexample, seeing their major adviser, participating in an assessment by the Counseling Center, etc.). Students on supervision for asecond or subsequent semester must continue to participate in AIP until their cumulative Georgia State GPA is 2.0 or higher. A college may, at its option, require students on probation not to enroll at Georgia State for one semester. If students on probation are allowed to enroll, they are required to participate in AIP as follows: (a) have their registration approved by anacademic adviser; (b) register for no more than 13 semester hours; and (c) take any other steps required by the academic advise r (for example, seeing their major adviser, participating in an assessment by the Counseling Center, etc.). Students enrolling wh ile on probation must continue to participate in AIP until their cumulative Georgia State GPA is 2.0 or higher. Students participating in AIP may be assigned to GSU 1050, Survival Skills for College. GSU 1050 may be taken only once and does not count toward credit hour requirements for graduation. Credit hours enrolled in GSU 1050 count toward the 13-semester hour course load limit for students participating in AIP. Grades received for GSU 1050 are used to calculate the cumula-tive GPA and the term GPA. Students on exclusion are not eligible to enroll in any undergraduate program or under any status at Georgia State and may not participate in AIP. Appeals for exemption from some or all of the requirements of AIP should be submitted to the director of the Student Advisement Center. Appeals of decisions by the director of the Student Advisement Center may be filed in accordance with theprocedure for petition of university regulations. Information about AIP and appeals of AIP requirements is available from theStudent Advisement Center. 1360.30 Academic Renewal Under certain conditions, Georgia State University allows its former undergraduate students to apply for academic renewal. This provision is intended to allow Georgia State degree-seeking students who have experienced academic difficulty to make afresh start and to give them a final opportunity to earn a bachelor's degree. It can apply to individuals on scholastic exclusi on. These are the provisions of academic renewal: Eligibility for Academic Renewal 1. A minimum of five calendar years must have passed since last enrollment at Georgia State University. 2. Former Department of Academic Foundations (formerly Division of Learning Support Programs and Developmental Studies) students may apply for academic renewal only if they completed all learning support programs requirements prior to the five-year absence. 3. A student can be granted academic renewal only one time.4. A student who was excluded from Georgia State and has attended another college or university during the absence from Georgia State is not eligible for academic renewal. 5. A student who was not excluded from Georgia State but attended another college or university during an absence of five or more years may choose one of these options, but not both: a. Return to Georgia State as a transfer student, subject to all relevant transfer and reentry policies. The student will not b e eligible for academic renewal but transfer credit will be granted for applicable courses taken during the absence and previ-ously earned Georgia State credit is retained.80 University Academic Regulations b. Apply for academic renewal. If academic renewal is approved, no transfer credit will be granted for coursework completed during the absence. Effects of Academic Renewal 1. A cumulative GPA that reflects all attempts at all courses taken at Georgia State continues to be recorded on the student's official transcript. A new renewal GPA is begun when the student has been approved for academic renewal and is also recorded on the student's official transcript. The renewal GPA will be used for determining academic standing and eligibilityfor graduation. 2. Academic credit for previously completed course work including transfer course work will be retained only for courses in which an A, B, or C grade has been earned. 3. The grades in Georgia State academic credit that is retained are not calculated in the institutional GPA. This credit, there fore, is placed in the same category as transfer credit, credit by examination, and courses with grades of S. 4. Courses for which academic credit is not retained (those with grades of D or lower) must be repeated at Georgia State if they are required in the student's degree program. All remaining degree requirements must be completed at Georgia State. Notransient or transfer credit will be accepted. 5. Whether the retained academic credit is still applicable for degree credit will depend on the degree requirements currently in effect at the time the student returns to Georgia State and on specific program regulations. 6. All courses taken at Georgia State remain on the student's official Georgia State transcript. At the time academic renewal is approved, this approval is noted on the student's transcript. Any Georgia State course work for which credit can be retainedis listed below the academic renewal notation. 7. Reentry into a program that has specific admission requirements is not automatic. Academic renewal students who wish admission to such a program must apply directly to the program. 8. Students must meet the academic residence requirement (see section 1430) using only course credit earned after academic renewal. 9. To be eligible for honors at graduation, students must earn at least 60 hours of credit after academic renewal. Applying for Academic Renewal 1. To apply for academic renewal, the student must obtain approval both from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and from the Student Advisement Center. a. File an application for reentry to the university with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 200 Sparks Hall, http://www.gsu.edu/returning.html. b. File an application for academic renewal with the Student Advisement Center. The deadlines for applying foracademic renewal in order to enroll for a semester are: To return in Deadline Fall July 1 Spring December 1Summer May 1 Application for Academic Renewal before the prescribed deadlines will aid in the timely return of a decision. Those students whose return to Georgia State University is dependent on approval for academic renewal should be especially diligent intheir timely submission of their application. 2. If a student does not apply for academic renewal at the time of enrollment, it can be requested after reenrollment if the application is filed within one calendar year. 3. A student whose application for academic renewal is not approved will be notified by letter from the Student Advisement Center. Unless specific information to the contrary is given in the letter, the student may reapply for academic renewal afterone year has passed. 4. Evaluation of a student's application for academic renewal will be based on the student's: a. Previous academic record;b. Previous student discipline record; andc. Current commitment to academic work.University Academic Regulations 81 1380 Academic Honesty I. Introduction As members of the academic community, students are expected to recognize and uphold standards of intellectual and academic integrity. The university assumes as a basic and minimum standard of conduct in academic matters that students be honest and that they submit for credit only the products of their own efforts. Both the ideals of scholarship and the need forfairness require that all dishonest work be rejected as a basis for academic credit. They also require that students refrain from anyand all forms of dishonorable or unethical conduct related to their academic work. The university's policy on academic honesty is published in the Faculty Affairs Handbook and On Campus: The Student Handbook and is available to all members of the university community. The policy represents a core value of the university and all members of the university community are responsible for abiding by its tenets. Lack of knowledge of this policy is not anacceptable defense to any charge of academic dishonesty. All members of the academic community \u2014 students, faculty, and staff\u2014 are expected to report violations of these standards of academic conduct to the appropriate authorities. The procedures forsuch reporting are on file in the offices of the deans of each college, the office of the dean of students, and the office of theprovost. In an effort to foster an environment of academic integrity and to prevent academic dishonesty, students are expected to discuss with faculty the expectations regarding course assignments and standards of conduct. Students are encouraged todiscuss freely with faculty, academic advisers, and other members of the university community any questions pertaining to theprovisions of this policy. In addition, students are encouraged to avail themselves of programs in establishing personal stan-dards and ethics offered through the university's Counseling Center. II. Definitions and Examples The examples and definitions given below are intended to clarify the standards by which academic honesty and academically honorable conduct are to be judged. The list is merely illustrative of the kinds of infractions that may occur, and it is not i ntended to be exhaustive. Moreover, the definitions and examples suggest conditions under which unacceptable behavior of the indicatedtypes normally occurs; however, there may be unusual cases that fall outside these conditions that also will be judged unaccept - able by the academic community. Plagiarism : Plagiarism is presenting another person's work as one's own. Plagiarism includes any paraphrasing or summariz- ing of the works of another person without acknowledgment, including the submitting of another student's work as one's own.Plagiarism frequently involves a failure to acknowledge in the text, notes, or footnotes the quotation of the paragraphs, sen-tences, or even a few phrases written or spoken by someone else. The submission of research or completed papers or projects bysomeone else is plagiarism, as is the unacknowledged use of research sources gathered by someone else when that use isspecifically forbidden by the faculty member. Failure to indicate the extent and nature of one's reliance on other sources is a lso a form of plagiarism. Any work, in whole or in part, taken from the Internet or other computer-based resource without properlyreferencing the source (for example, the URL) is considered plagiarism. A complete reference is required in order that all part ies may locate and view the original source. Finally, there may be forms of plagiarism that are unique to an individual discipline or course, examples of which should be provided in advance by the faculty member. The student is responsible for understandingthe legitimate use of sources, the appropriate ways of acknowledging academic, scholarly, or creative indebtedness, and theconsequences of violating this responsibility. Cheating on Examinations: Cheating on examinations involves giving or receiving unauthorized help before, during, or after an examination. Examples of unauthorized help include the use of notes, computer-based resources, texts, or \"crib sheets\" durin g an examination (unless specifically approved by the faculty member), or sharing information with another student during anexamination (unless specifically approved by the faculty member). Other examples include intentionally allowing another studentto view one's own examination and collaboration before or after an examination if such collaboration is specifically forbidden by the faculty member. Unauthorized Collaboration: Submission for academic credit of a work product, or a part thereof, represented as its being one's own effort, which has been developed in substantial collaboration with another person or source or with a computer-basedresource is a violation of academic honesty. It is also a violation of academic honesty knowingly to provide such assistance.Collaborative work specifically authorized by a faculty member is allowed. Falsification: It is a violation of academic honesty to misrepresent material or fabricate information in an academic exercise, assignment, or proceeding (for example, false or misleading citation of sources, the falsification of the results of experiment s or of computer data, false or misleading information in an academic context in order to gain an unfair advantage). Multiple Submissions: It is a violation of academic honesty to submit substantial portions of the same work for credit more than once without the explicit consent of the faculty member(s) to whom the material is submitted for additional credit. In cases inwhich there is a natural development of research or knowledge in a sequence of courses, use of prior work may be desirable, eve n required; however, the student is responsible for indicating in writing, as a part of such use, that the current work submitted for credit is cumulative in nature.82 University Academic Regulations III. Evidence and Burden of Proof In determining whether or not academic dishonesty has occurred, the standard that should be used is that guilt must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. This means that if the evidence indicating that academic dishonesty occurred produces a stronger impression and is more convincing as to its truth when weighed against opposing evidence, then academicdishonesty has been proved. In other words, the evidence does not have to be enough to free the mind from a reasonable doubtbut must be sufficient to incline a reasonable and impartial mind to one side of the issue rather than to the other. Evidence a s used in this statement can be any observation, admission, statement, or document that would either directly or circumstantiallyindicate that academic dishonesty has occurred. IV. Procedures for Resolving Matters of Academic Dishonesty The following procedure is the only approved means for resolving matters of academic dishonesty, except for matters arising in the College of Law which has its own Honor Code for handling such matters. It is available to all members of the academiccommunity who wish to pursue an action against a student for academic dishonesty.1. Initiation: If a member of the academic community believes that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty in a course, on a test, or as a part of an academic program, that individual is responsible for initiating action against the student or bringing thematter to the attention of an individual who may initiate action against the student. In allegations of academic dishonestyinvolving course requirements, the course faculty member is generally responsible for initiating the action. If the allegedviolation involves a departmental program requirement (for example, comprehensive examination or language competencyexamination) or an institutionally-required test (for example, test of Georgia/United States history or Georgia/United Statesconstitutions), or if the individual who discovers the incident is not a faculty member, the individual should bring the matter to the attention of the faculty member and administrator who has responsibility of overseeing the activity (for example, depart-mental chair, director of the Testing Office). If that administrator decides to bring charges of academic dishonesty against th e student, then that administrator becomes the initiator. (Test proctors, laboratory assistants, and other individuals who are no t course faculty members should bring any instances of alleged academic dishonesty to the attention of the course facultymember or their administrative superior. That individual, after weighing the evidence, may become the initiator by formallycharging the student with academic dishonesty.) The channel of review, recommendation, and decision-making follows theadministrative lines associated with the course or program requirement involved. In any instance, however, when the allegedincident does not occur within the context of a course and when it is unclear which college of more than one college involvedshould have jurisdiction in review and decision-making, either unit may initiate the case. For the sake of brevity the followin g processing procedures are written from an \"academic unit/college\" perspective. Nonacademic units (i.e., Testing Center) wouldsubstitute appropriate supervisory personnel at the respective levels. Herein the \"initiator\" will be referred to as \"facultymember\" and the \"administrative unit head\" will be referred to as \"chair,\" designating the departmental chair. \"Dean\" will refe r to appropriate administrative supervisory personnel at the overall college or division level. While the matter of academicdishonesty is pending, the student will be allowed to continue in the course and register for upcoming semesters. Should agrade be due to the registrar before the matter is resolved, a grade of GP (grade pending) will be reported for the student in the course involved. Withdrawal from a course does not preclude the imposition of penalties for academic dishonesty. 2. Penalties to be Imposed: Penalties to be imposed in incidents of academic dishonesty are classified as \"academic\" or \"disci- plinary.\" Academic penalties include such sanctions as assignment of a failing grade for a particular course requirement, or fo r the course itself, or for other tests or program assignments. Academic penalties are set by the faculty member. Disciplinarysanctions can be sought in addition to those considered academic and could include, but are not limited to, the followingpenalties: suspension, expulsion, transcript annotations. Disciplinary penalties can be requested by the faculty member inconsultation with the department chair or director, must be reviewed by the University Senate Committee on Student Discipline,and are set by the provost. 3. Action at Administrative Unit (Department Level): As soon as possible after the alleged incident, the faculty member should discuss the matter with the student. This discussion should be conducted in a manner that protects the rights and confidential-ity of students. If the faculty member believes that academic dishonesty has occurred, the faculty member (with the advice ofthe chair if necessary) will determine the appropriate academic penalty. The faculty member will complete a \"notice of academicdishonesty\" form describing the incident and indicating the academic penalty imposed. Any recommendation for a disciplinarypenalty must be reviewed in consultation with the chair. The faculty member will deliver to the student the notice of academicdishonesty that includes a statement of appeal rights. If there is difficulty in delivering the notice to the student, the facu lty member/chair should request assistance from the college dean in determining the most expeditious way to inform the studentthat a notice of academic dishonesty has been filed. Once the student has been informed, the chair forwards the documentation, including the notice of academic dishonesty and an indication of when the student was informed, to the dean to be held pending possible appeal. Until the student has beengiven the opportunity to appeal, a grade of GP (grade pending) should be submitted for the student for the course involved. 4. Student Action: The student will have 20 business days after receipt of the notice of charges of academic dishonesty to submit a written appeal denying the charges and providing any rationale for the appeal. The appeal should be addressed to the collegedean of the initiator. In the event the student is found guilty of academic dishonesty, the student does not have the right toUniversity Academic Regulations 83 appeal the academic penalty assessed by the faculty member, unless the student can prove that such penalty was arbitrarily imposed or discriminatorily applied. If the student wishes to challenge a disciplinary penalty, the student must submit a writt en rationale for challenging the disciplinary penalty within 20 business days of receipt of the notice of charges of academicdishonesty. The statement of challenge should be addressed to the college dean. The college dean will forward the challengeto the dean of students for inclusion in the review of the disciplinary penalty by the University Senate Committee on StudentDiscipline. The University Senate Committee on Student Discipline automatically reviews all disciplinary penalties regardless o f student appeal. If the student has also filed an appeal denying the charges of academic dishonesty, any review of disciplinary penalty recommended will be delayed pending review of the charges of academic dishonesty by the college hearing committee. 5. College Action: 5.1. No Appeal by the Student: If the student does not submit a written appeal to the college dean within 20 business days, the dean will notify the chair/faculty member to post any pending grade(s) immediately. The dean will then forward the notice ofacademic dishonesty to the dean of students for inclusion in the student's disciplinary file. The Senate Committee onStudent Discipline also will forward any recommendation of a disciplinary penalty to the dean of students for appropriatereview. 5.2. Appeal by the Student: . If the student submits a written appeal within 20 business days, the dean will notify the registrar to issue a grade of GP (grade pending) for the course(s) in question on all transcript requests for the student pending outcomeof the appeal. The dean will forward the charges of academic dishonesty to the chair of a college hearing committee and willnotify the faculty member to set forth in writing a comprehensive statement describing the incident of academic dishonesty.This statement will be presented to the committee and to the student at least five business days prior to the hearing. 5.3. Student Hearing Committee Process: The college student hearing committee will use the following guidelines to govern the hearing of the appeal:a. Within ten business days after the committee receives the charges of academic dishonesty, a hearing date will be deter- mined. The committee will notify the faculty member and the student of the time, date, and the place of the hearing. Copiesof all charges of academic dishonesty and related materials for the hearing will be provided to the student at least fivebusiness days in advance of the hearing. b. The faculty member and the student will be allowed to make oral presentations, call witnesses, and present any documen- tary evidence regarding the incident in question. The hearing will be recorded on an audiotape. The hearing will not beopen to observers. c. At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee will meet in closed session and will make its recommendation as to the guilt or innocence of the student based on a preponderance of evidence with respect to the charge of academic dishon-esty. The committee chair will forward to the college dean its findings and recommendations in a written report within fivebusiness days of the hearing. 5.4. College Decision on Appeals: Within five business days of receiving the committee's written report, the college dean will make the final decision regarding guilt or innocence. The dean will notify all appropriate parties of the decision. If the deanfinds the student \"not guilty,\" the matter will be terminated, and no notice of charges will be filed with the dean of students . The dean will notify the chair to post the pending course grade promptly and will notify the registrar to remove the GP (gradepending) on the student's transcript. If the dean finds the student \"guilty,\" the notice of charges of academic dishonesty willbe forwarded to the dean of students for inclusion in the student's disciplinary file. The academic penalty stipulated by thefaculty member will be imposed. The dean will notify the chair to insure that any pending grade is posted promptly. The deanwill notify the registrar to remove the GP (grade pending) on the student's transcript if only an academic penalty wasinvolved. If a disciplinary penalty has been recommended, the dean will notify the registrar to continue the GP (gradepending) annotation until the disciplinary penalty can be reviewed by the University Senate Committee on Student Disci-pline. 5.5. Appeal of the Decision of the Dean: If the student or initiator wishes to appeal the decision of the college dean regarding guilt or innocence of the charges of academic dishonesty, the student or initiator may appeal to the provost. The subsequentappeal route would be to the president and then the Board of Regents. The student or initiator must submit a writtenstatement of appeal to the provost within 20 business days of notification of the dean's decision. The basis of the appealmust be on the grounds that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. 6. University Senate Committee on Student Discipline Action: In cases where a disciplinary penalty has been recommended, the Senate Committee on Student Discipline will conduct a hearing to review the disciplinary penalty. The committee will review thefaculty member's notice of academic dishonesty and the student's statement of challenge of the disciplinary penalty, if any.The faculty member and the student will be allowed to appear at the hearing to discuss the imposition of disciplinary penalties . Only the recommendation concerning the disciplinary penalty to be imposed will be considered by this committee. Issues ofguilt or innocence are determined at the college level (see above). The Senate Committee will conduct the hearing in accor-dance with its regular hearing procedures. Copies of these procedures may be obtained from the Provost's Office and/or theDean of Students. The Senate Committee on Student Discipline will provide its recommendation within five business days of84 University Academic Regulations its hearing to the provost regarding appropriateness of the disciplinary penalty recommended by the college and/or whether other disciplinary penalties are to be imposed in addition to or in lieu of those already recommended by the college. 7. Provost Action: 7.1. Decision of the Provost: The role of the provost in handling student appeals regarding the charge of academic honesty has been explained (see above). Based on the recommendation, the provost will render a decision within ten business daysof receipt of the recommendation of the Senate Committee. The provost will notify the student, the referring dean, thedepartment chair, and the faculty member of the Senate Committee's recommendations and of the provost's decision. At thattime the provost will also notify the registrar to annotate the student's transcript, if necessary. 7.2. Appeal of the Decision of the Provost: If the student wishes to appeal the decision of the provost regarding the imposition of a disciplinary penalty, the student may appeal to the president and then to the Board of Regents. The student must submita written statement of appeal to the president within 20 business days of notification of the provost's decision. The basis forsuch an appeal must be on the grounds that the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. 8. Students Involved in Two or More Incidents of Academic Dishonesty: A student is subject to disciplinary action in addition to any already undertaken once it is determined that the student has been found guilty in a previous incident of academicdishonesty. In such cases, the dean of students will forward a report to the University Senate Committee on Student Disciplineregarding the incidents of academic dishonesty that have been reported. The dean of students is responsible for initiating thisreport within 20 business days of completion of proceeding of any subsequent finding of academic dishonesty. The UniversitySenate Committee on Student Discipline will review the report of the dean of students. The student may submit supplementalwritten documents for the committee's review and may request to appear before the committee in its deliberations. Afterreviewing the matter, the committee will send a report to the provost with the recommendation for disciplinary penalty to beimposed. The provost will proceed as in IV .7. of this policy. Once the student has been informed, the chair forwards the documentation, including the notice of academic dishonesty and an indication of when the student was informed, to the dean to be held pending possible appeal. Until the student has been give n the opportunity to appeal, a grade of GP (grade pending) should be submitted for the student for the course involved. 1382 Student Complaints, Petitions for Policy Waivers and Variances, and Appeals The appeals procedure for students will follow different courses depending on the nature of the student's appeal.

See below for a complete explanation of university requirements. Consult your college's chapter of this catalog for your degree program's requirements. 1405 Learning Outcomes Learning outcomes are the goals students achieve in their programs of study. They represent the knowledge, skills and attitudes that students should gain to successfully complete the requirements of a course, major, and degree. A special set ofgeneral learning outcomes cover the goals for all students at the University. Students begin mastery of the University's learni ng outcomes in the core (first two years of study) and continue to develop these skills throughout their major. The learning out-comes for all students are: Goal I. Communication Students communicate effectively using appropriate writing conventions and formats. Students communicate effectively using appropriate oral or signed conventions and formats. Goal II. Collaboration Students participate effectively in collaborative activities. Goal III. Critical Thinking Students formulate appropriate questions for research. Students effectively collect appropriate evidence. Students appropriately evaluate claims, arguments, evidence, and hypotheses. Students use the results of analysis to appropriately construct new arguments and formulate new questions. Goal IV . Contemporary Issues Students effectively analyze contemporary issues within the context of diverse disciplinary perspectives. Students effectively analyze contemporary multicultural, global, and international questions. Goal V . Quantitative Skills Students effectively perform arithmetic operations, as well as reason and draw appropriate conclusions from numerical information. Students effectively translate problem situations into symbolic representations and use those representations to solveproblems. Goal VI. Technology Students effectively use computers and other technology appropriate to the discipline. 1410 Core Curriculum Requirements Georgia State University requires all students seeking a baccalaureate degree to satisfactorily complete a basic core of general education subjects. Georgia State's core curriculum provides students with a broad background in general education andreflects the special mission of this university as an urban research institution with an international, multi-ethnic, and multi - cultural focus. Because of ongoing evaluation changes may occur in the core curriculum. Every attempt will be made to notifystudents when these changes occur. Areas A through E of the core curriculum are designed to provide students with a wide array of courses as a means of gaining a basic education in the liberal arts and assisting students in their choice of a major. Students should normally choos e among the courses in areas A to E and select a major before taking courses in Area F. Students who have chosen a major beforethe completion of Areas A through E can review the departmental sections of the catalog to see specific recommendations forcourse selection. Some programs, such as art, music, and nursing, require students to begin major-related coursework in theirfreshman year to meet course sequencing requirements. There are restricted choices for some majors in Areas A and D. Students must follow the degree-specific requirements listed in Areas A and D for the programs they are pursuing.University Degree Requirements and Graduation 87 Students who are planning to transfer to Georgia State from other institutions in the University System of Georgia should note that this is Georgia State's core curriculum and is to be followed by students who choose to complete the core curriculum at this university. The core curriculum at a student's current University System of Georgia institution may contain different cour ses. However, Georgia State will grant credit for any approved core curriculum course taken at a student's current University System of Georgia home institution even if it is different from the course offered at Georgia State. Students should also remember tha t they may have only one University System of Georgia home institution at a time. Students who have transferred to Georgia Statemust petition for permission to take core curriculum courses elsewhere after they have enrolled. The core curriculum completed at one System institution is fully transferable to another System institution for the same major. However, specific situations may result in minor exceptions to this general rule. Students seeking credit for UniversitySystem of Georgia core curriculum courses that were not accepted during Georgia State's admissions process or who believe thatthe system rules of transferability of the core curriculum are not being honored can make an appeal to the Core CurriculumTransfer Ombudsperson, Dr. George Rainbolt, at grainbolt@gsu.edu. Appeals should be initiated by filling out a form available i n the Student Advisement Center, 255 Sparks Hall. 1410.10 Area A: Essential Skills (9) 1.

Instead of taking these courses,students may satisfy these requirements by passing the Regents' Reading Test and the Regents' Writing Test. The Regents'Reading Test and the Regents' Writing Test are the final exams for RGTR 0198 and RGTE 0199 respectively. Students must passthe tests to pass the courses. The courses do not count toward the 120 hours requirement (See Section 1470). Students withcertain SAT, ACT, AP or IB scores, non-native speakers of English, students who hold baccalaureate degrees, and students withdocumented disabilities are subject to modified rules regarding these requirements. (See below.) After reading this material,students with questions should contact the Student Advisement Center at 404/413-2300 or by emailinghttp://www.gsu.edu/es/advisement.html courses: RGTR 0198 and RGTE 0199 are designed to help students gain the reading and writing compe- tence necessary to pass the Regents' T ests and be successful in college-level work. The Regents' Tests are the final exams for the courses. The courses are graded S/U. Students will be awarded an S if they pass the test and a U if they do not pass the te st. Description of the tests: The Regents' Reading Test is a multiple-choice test taken in one hour. This test consists of a series of reading passages with five to eight questions about each passage. The passages cover a variety of subjects (for example,social science, math, natural science, humanities, etc). The Regents' Writing Test is a one-hour essay exam in which students a re asked to write an essay on one of four topics. Students are allowed to use dictionaries during the last 15 minutes of the Writi ng Test. Both tests are taken at one time. Administration: Initially, students must take both tests at the same time. If a student has passed one test but not the other, the student will retake only the test that was failed. The Regents' Tests are given during the semester at a time specified by the Board of Regents. The tests may be taken only once per semester. Students are encouraged to take the Regents' Tests as soon as possible. Students may take the Regents' Tests during a semester in which they have not enrolled in any classes. Students who have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher and have earned agrade of U at least two times in the relevant preparation course will be allowed two hours each test. To take advantage of thisoption, students must bring a current copy of their academic evaluation to the Testing Office at least seven days prior to the date scheduled for the extended time test.92 University Degree Requirements and Graduation Students entering Georgia State University with no transfer credits: If they have not met the Regents' Reading and Writing Requirements, students must take the tests or enroll in both preparation courses in their first semester of enrollment after ea rning 30 semester hours. Students who have earned 45 college-level semester hours and who have not passed the Regents' Tests must take RGTR 0198 and/or RGTE 0199 in each semester of attendance until they have passed both tests. Students who have notpassed the Reading Test must take RGTR 0198, students who have not passed the Writing Test must take RGTE 0199, andstudents who have not passed either test must take both courses. Students who have not passed both tests before earning 75hours will have a hold placed on their registration that will be lifted after speaking with a Student Advisement Center staffmember. Students entering Georgia State with AP/CLEP/IB/JE credits: Students entering with Advanced Placement, College Level Examination Program, International Baccalaureate, and/or Joint Enrollment credit are not required to take RGTR 0198 or RGTE 019 9 until they have earned at least 45 hours and been enrolled at least two semesters. USG transfer students: All students transferring from University System of Georgia (USG) programs leading to the baccalau- reate degree must follow the rules for students with no transfer credits. Non-USG transfer students: Students with 30 or more semester credit hours transferring from outside of the System are strongly encouraged to take the tests during their first semester of enrollment in a program leading to the baccalaureate degre e. Those who have not met the requirement before their third semester at Georgia State are subject to the remediation requirementsfor students entering Georgia State University with no transfer credits. For purposes of the Regent's Test, summer term isconsidered a semester, even if the student is not enrolled in classes. SAT, ACT, AP, and IB waivers:RGTR 0198: Students who have a score of 510 or higher on the national SAT I Verbal Test or a score of 23 or higher on the national ACT Reading Test have automatically passed RGTR 0198. Neither institutional SAT nor residual ACT scores areacceptable for Regents' exemptions. RGTE 0199: Students who fulfill one of the waiver options listed below have automatically passed RGTE 0199:SAT I Writing Section score of 560 or better SAT II English Writing Test score of 650 or better AP English Language and Composition Test score of 3 or better AP English Literature and Composition Test score of 3 or better International Baccalaureate English test score of 4 or better Students who have earned these scores should request to have scores sent electronically directly from the testing agency.Nonnative speakers of English: Nonnative speakers of English (NNS) will be certified as meeting Regents' requirements by passing RGTR 0198 and RGTE 0199. However, NSS students may demonstrate their competence in reading and writing andautomatically pass these courses by passing the Reading and Writing Tests of the Georgia State Test of English Proficiency(GSTEP), taking the regular Regents' Test, or taking the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). NNS students who havea TOEFL score of 23 or higher on the reading section of the computer-based TOEFL exam or a score of 57 or higher on thereading section of the paper-based TOEFL exam have automatically passed RGTR 0198. NNS students who have Test of WrittenEnglish (TWE) score of 4 or higher have automatically passed RGTE 0199. NNS students may not take the GSTEP and the regularRegents' Test in the same semester. NNS students who must take RGT courses may take the regular RGT courses or they may take RGT courses for NNS students that specifically address the GSTEP. These courses are offered by the Department of Applied Linguistics & English as aSecond Language. For more information, contact the department, http://www.gsu.edu/gstep . Students with baccalaureate degrees: Students holding baccalaureate or higher degrees from accredited institutions of higher learning have automatically passed RGTR 0198 and RGTE 0199. Students with disabilities: Students with documented disabilities may arrange for appropriate administration of the Regents' Tests and for any necessary remediation. Contact the Office of Disability Services, http://www .gsu.edu/disability. Appropriate accommodation will be made based upon the student's functional limitations as presented in their documentation. Appeal of a failing score on the writing test: A student may request a formal review of his or her failure on the Writing Test if that student's essay received at least one passing score among the three scores awarded. Students who wish to appeal shouldcontact the Director of the Writing Studio in the Department of English. The review procedures shall be as follows. A studentshould initiate the review procedure within the first three weeks of his or her first semester of enrollment after the semester inwhich the Writing Test was failed. If this deadline is missed, students may initiate an appeal within one calendar year from th e semester in which the failure occurred. The appeals review will be conducted by three members of the Department of English chosen by the Director of the Writing Studio. The review panel may (a) sustain, by majority opinion, the essay's failing score, thus terminating the review process, or (b) recommend, by majority opinion, the rescoring of the essay by the Regents' Testing Program central office. The student willbe notified concerning the results of the on-campus review. If the Georgia State University panel recommends re-scoring of the essay, that recommendation will be transmitted in writing, along with the essay, to the office of the system director of the Regents' Testing Program.University Degree Requirements and Graduation 93 All applicable regulations of the Regents' Reading and Writing Requirements Policy remain in effect for students whose tests are under review, including those regulations relating to remediation and to retaking the test. 1425 Federal and State Constitution and History Requirements As required by Georgia law, all students must demonstrate knowledge of the history and constitutions of the United States and of Georgia. To demonstrate this knowledge, students must pass Hist 2110 and PolS 1101 or pass examinations prepared by the history and political science departments to fulfill these requirements. Study aids are offered by the history and politica l science departments to assist students preparing for the examinations. If the examinations are passed, students must select additional course(s) from Section 3, Social Science Foundations in Core Area E. Transfer students who have fulfilled any or al l parts of this requirement will be advised of that fact at the time of admission and evaluation of transfer credit. 1430 Critical Thinking Through Writing (CTW) Requirement Effective for students entering fall term 2009 and thereafter, all students seeking baccalaureate degrees are required to pass two critical thinking through writing (CTW) courses in their majors. While this requirement does not apply to students governe d by the 2008-2009 catalog, this notification is included for prospective students. When the requirement goes into effect, catal og sections describing degree programs and majors will indicate the required CTW courses. 1440 Academic Residence Requirement Academic residence is defined as being enrolled in one or more courses at Georgia State University; this is not to be confused with status as a legal resident of the State of Georgia for fee determination purposes. The minimum academic residencerequirement for each baccalaureate degree is as follows: 1. The candidate must earn 39 semester hours at Georgia State in courses numbered 3000 or above with an average grade of at least a C (2.00 GPA); and 2.

The minimum criteria for entry into teacher education are listed below. 1. Students must have successfully completed Area A (Essential Skills) of the undergraduate core curriculum with a grade of \"C\" or higher for each course. 2. Students must demonstrate competence in oral communication. Screening takes place in all education courses. At any time during their courses of study, students may be referred to the Georgia State Speech-Language-Hearing Clinic.There, screening assesses the basic communication skills adults are expected to exhibit during communication inprofessional settings: hearing, articulation, fluency, appropriate grammar, comprehension of spoken language, and theability to use appropriate voice quality. Completion of referral, evaluation, and the remedial process is necessary forcontinuation in the program. 3. Students must have demonstrated competence in mathematics and science by successfully completing Area D (Science, Mathematics, and Technology) of the undergraduate core curriculum. 4. Students must have a minimum grade point average of 2.50 based on all undergraduate coursework attempted. For students pursuing degrees in some majors, the minimum grade point average requirement is 2.75. Students are encour-aged to contact their academic advisers for information regarding the grade point average requirement for their specificmajors. 5. Students must complete a separate application and pay an application fee. Students must also show proof of Tort liability insurance and criminal background check. See section 4000 College of Education in this catalog or visit theCollege of Education Office of Academic Assistance web site, http://education.gsu.edu/oaa/ , for more information. 5. S tudents must have successfully completed the Regents' Test. 6.Students must have successfully completed EDUC 2110 Investigating Critical & Contemporary Issues in Education with a grade of \"C\" or higher. 7. Georgia Assessment for Certification of Educators (GACE). An applicant who plans to complete a program to seek initial certification in the State of Georgia must present passing scores (as determined by the State of Georgia) on the GACEBasic Skills Assessment or present exemption scores from the GRE, the SAT , or the ACT. The Department of Early Childhood Education will permit out- of- state students to submit passing scores on the PRAXIS I for admission for theB.S.E. Early Childhood Education program. These students are required to pass the GACE Basic Skills Assessmentbefore continuing in the program.112 Teacher Preparation Contact the Counseling Center (404/413-1740) or the College of Arts and Sciences Office of Academic Assistance or College of Education Office of Academic Assistance and Graduate Admissions for an examination schedule and applica-tion form. Students interested in teacher education are encouraged to take the GACE Basic Skills Assessment as soon asthey complete Area A of the undergraduate core curriculum. Additional criteria, including departmental requirements, may be added. Students are assigned an adviser to plan an appro- priate course of study within the guidelines provided by this catalog. Entry into teacher education is a prerequisite for cours es designated \"(TE)\" in the course description section. 1610 Educational Field Experiences and Student Teaching Student Teaching Educational field experiences and student teaching are clinical in nature. They are designed to complement the humanistic, behavioral, and pedagogical studies in teacher education and to offer experiences in a variety of settings. At the baccalaureate level, a sequence of clinical and field experiences is planned to complement the professional education courses included in the students programs of study. The Opening School Experience provides practical experience in the school and classroom setting during the week of preplanning and the first week of school. Students learn effective procedures necessary for setting up a classroom at thebeginning of the year. This takes place at the beginning of the students' junior or senior year prior to the student teachingexperience. Students in early childhood education and health and physical education must apply for this experience in advanceand must register for the course during early registration of the fall term of the year in which the experience takes place. Opening School Experience Application Deadline Fall Semester April 1* * Health and Physical Education students must apply by February 15. Student teaching is the culmination of the clinical field experiences. Student teaching involves full participation by the students for at least one full academic term. Because student teaching constitutes a full load of academic credit, it is recom-mended that the students attempt neither regular employment nor other courses during the term of student teaching. T o be eligible for enrollment in student teaching, students must be admitted to teacher education and have: successfully completed the specific required courses of the program; earned an overall grade-point average no less than 2.50 (2.75 for early childhood education majors) the term prior to thestudent teaching experience; earned a minimum grade-point average of 2.50 (2.75 for early childhood education majors) in the major teaching areacourses and in professional education courses. (Students who earn a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in a major teaching field orprofessional education course must repeat that course and earn a grade of \"C\" or higher. The grade of \"D\" or \"F\" willstill be included in the overall grade-point average.) The Professional Education Faculty believes that all students who are in field experiences must be personally and psycho- logically equipped as well as academically prepared. Students may be denied entry to field experiences based on departmentalprerequisites or the professional judgment of faculty based on observed performance and behavior. This policy is based on thepremise that educators should be part of the evaluation of the students' ability to function adequately and safely in classroom s and that educators have a right and responsibility to make such judgments prior to placing students in schools. The practicum or student teaching supervisor has the authority to withdraw students from their classroom experience if their performance constitutes a detriment to the children in the class. If such removal is necessary, students will be given an F in each corresponding course. Applications for student teaching must be submitted according to the following schedule for all majors except early child- hood education. General Student Teaching Application Deadline Dates* Term Deadline Fall February 1* Spring February 1* *For Health and Physical Education, the deadline is February 15.Teacher Preparation 113 Failure to submit applications on or before prescribed deadline dates will result in a delay of one or more terms in student teaching or practicum placement. Further information regarding educational field experiences, practicum, and student teaching experiences for each major is available from the appropriate department in the College of Arts and Science or the College ofEducation. An additional lab fee of $125 will be charged at the time students register for the student teaching experience. Educator preparation students must be aware that extra costs such as tort liability and transportation will be incurred at various timesduring the completion of the various teacher education field experiences, particularly during the students' senior year. Final Student Teaching Seminar At the completion of the student teaching semester, all students who are eligible for certification must attend a final seminar to complete all requirements. Information concerning this seminar will be sent to the students. Criminal Background Investigations It is expected that prospective teachers maintain the highest professional standards of public responsibility. Such standards have been written and adopted by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission as The Code of Ethics for Educators . It is the intent of the Code to \"protect the health, safety and general welfare of students and educators, and ensure the citizens of Georgia adegree of accountability within the education profession.\" The first standard states, \"An educator should abide by federal, s tate, and local laws and statues.\"All students who are not already certified teachers employed in Georgia must consent to a criminal background investigation before they will be placed by the college for field experiences. The results of the background check could disqualify students from completing the program, because many school systems do not allow persons with criminal records to teach in their schools. Toconsent to the background check, students must complete a Criminal Background Consent Form ,obtainable at the Office of Academic Assistance and Graduate Admissions, 300 College of Education Building, or online at http://education.gsu.edu/aae . The form must be submitted along with a check or money order for $10.00 (made out to Georgia State University), a photocopy of theirstate-issued driver's license, and their Geor gia State University PantherCard to the Office of Academic Assistance by the deadl ine for applying for field experiences. This deadline is published on the OAA Web site. Students must report any circumstance inwhich they were convicted of a crime, paid a fine, forfeited a bond, sentenced (by a judge) to perform community service, pled nolo contendere , pled guilty, or received a suspended sentence from jail or prison . (Minor traffic offenses are excluded; however, DUI convictions must be reported.) All information obtained through the criminal background search will be kept confidential to theextent allowed by Georgia and Federal laws. Cooperating school systems may also request a separate background check before aplacement is finalized.When applying for certification with the Georgia Professional Standards Commission, they will conduct and evaluate backgroundchecks independently of the examinations performed by the institutions. Admission to a program and/or placement for fieldexperiences does not guarantee that the Professional Standards Commission will ultimately certify an individual for teaching inGeorgia. 1615 Teacher Certification Teachers and other educational personnel must be certified by the Georgia Professional Standards Commission to be employed in the state's elementary, middle, and secondary public schools. Private elementary and secondary schools may alsorequire state certification for employment. Completion of Teacher Education Requirements: A requirement for initial certification in Georgia is completion of teacher education requirements. This may be accomplished in one of the following ways at Georgia State University. (Options vary byprogram.) In all cases, \"Entry into Teacher Education\" criteria apply. Students may complete an approved educator preparation degree program as described in the College of Arts andSciences or the College of Education chapter of this catalog. Students may complete or present a noneducator preparation bachelor's degree and all additional components of anapproved educator preparation degree program. Initial certification programs in Behavior/Learning Disabilities, Communication Disorders, Educational Leadership, English Education, Health and Physical Education, Library Media Technology, Middle Childhood Education, Multiple and Severe Disabilities, Reading Specialist, School Counseling, School Psychology, Science Education, Social Studies Education, and Specia l Education are available only at the graduate level. The College of Education offers seven Master of Arts in Teaching programs which prepare students for initial certification in the following fields: Early Childhood Education, English Education, Mathem at- ics Education, Middle Childhood Education, Reading, Language and Literacy Education (ESOL), Science Education, and SocialStudies Education. \"Entry into Teacher Education\" criteria must be met for admittance into any of these Alternative PreparationPrograms. See the current Georgia State University Graduate Catalog for more information on the university's master's level programs.114 Teacher Preparation 1620 University Recommendation Students who complete a Georgia State University educator preparation program by one of the three methods above and who present a passing score or scores on the appropriate GACE Content Assessments may be eligible for the Georgia State recommendation for teacher certification. The College of Education's Office of Academic Assistance and Graduate Admissionscan issue the recommendation to the prospective teacher shortly after Commencement following the term of completion ofrequirements. 1625 Application for Teacher Certification Prospective teachers must apply for teacher certification. Applications are available online at http://www.gapsc.com . It is the students' responsibility to request the application and complete the submission process with the College of Education. Thestudents, in a single package, must forward the application, the completed recommendation form, and official transcripts from a ll colleges attended to the Professional Standards Commission. 1630 GACE Content Assessments Students seeking certification from the State of Georgia Professional Standards Commission are required to pass the GACE Basic Skills Assessment (or provide an exemption) and GACE Content Assessment in their fields. The Georgia Assessments for the Certification of Educators is developed and administered by National Evaluation Systems, Inc. (NES\u00ae). Subject Assessments include the Professional Pedagogy Assessment, Paraprofessional Assessments, and ContentAssessment Area tests. The GACE program helps the PSC meet its goal of ensuring that candidates have the knowledge andskills needed to perform the job of an educator in Georgia public schools. The GACE are aligned with state and national stan-dards for educator preparation and with state standards for the P-12 student curriculum (Georgia Performance Standards).Information about the assessments is available at http://www.gace.nesinc.com and http://www.gapsc.com/ . A requirement for teacher certification in the State of Georgia is a passing score on appropriate tests of the GACE Content Assess me nt ser ies. This test is administered at various times throughout the year. Test applications are available at http://www.gace.nesinc.com . Unless otherwise indicated in a program description, passing the GACE Content Assessment is not a degree-program requirement. All initial certification students must submit copies of complete GACE Content Assessment scores in order to be recommended for teacher certification by Geor gia State University. Students are encouraged to take the test duri ng the last term of enrollment. Questions about teacher certification in other states should be addressed to the State Department of Education in the capital city of that state. 1635 Teacher Education Core The teacher education core is common to all educator preparation programs in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education.

Career Oppor tunities and Related Courses: A recent study by the U.S. Census Bureau showed that college graduates who majored in economics were among the highest paid employees (economics ranked as the third most lucrative major). Anundergraduate degree in economics furnishes a valuable background for a domestic or international career in law, government, business or education. Government service provides many opportunities at the federal, state, and local level that require only anundergraduate degree in economics. What economists do in business is as broad and varied as the full scale of managing a firm' s operations; economists are found in staff departments handling marketing, business planning and policy, finance, international operations, government relations, and even purchasing and operating logistics. An economics degree also combines well withtraining in other disciplines such as finance, real estate, political science, journalism, history, law, and foreign languages.Andrew Young School of Policy Studies 125 Students who plan to have a career or pursue graduate work that uses economics should consider the courses listed below. The listings are suggestions for broad categories and do not exclude other offerings.

Mack Robinson College of Business, please refer to that college' s chapter in this catalog. Economics provides a way of thinking about everyday decision-making in a world of limited options. It explains the economy as a whole, how it is best organized to provide goods, services, jobs, stable prices, and other economic goals. Econo - mists study the ways a society distributes scarce resources such as land, labor, raw materials, and machinery to produce goods and services choices that must be made because time, income, wealth, workers, and natural resources are limited. Principles ofeconomics are useful at all levels of decision-making, and provide an essential framework for analyzing and understanding suchmajor issues as inflation, unemployment, deregulation of banking, tax reform, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, laborproductivity, and foreign debt crises. Most economists are concerned with practical applications of economic policy in a particular area. They use their under- standing of economic relationships to advise businesses and other organizations, including insurance companies, banks,securities firms, computer and data processing companies, management consulting firms, industry and trade associations, laborunions, and government agencies. Some economists work abroad for companies with international operations and for organiza-tions like the World Bank and United Nations. Economists use mathematical models to develop programs that predict, for example, the nature and length of business cycles, the effects of inflation on the economy, or the effects of tax legislation on unemployment levels. Preparing reports o n the126 Andrew Young School of Policy Studies results of their research is an important part of the economist's job. Being able to present economic concepts in a meaningful way is particularly important for economists who are involved in making policy for their organizations. The student with a major or minor in economics may choose from a broad array of topics including foreign trade, environ- mental and natural resources economics, money and credit, public sector economics, labor economics, economic development,international finance, urban and regional economics, economic history, industrial organization and antitrust policies, and math - ematical economics. Majors may pursue careers in many areas, some of which are listed below along with courses applicable tothe career choice. Economics majors who are considering graduate study in economics are encouraged to take Math 2211 and Math 2212 in place of Math 1111 and Math 1220. Consult the course descriptions for the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciencefor prerequisites before taking these courses.

They work on solving problems that affect us all-such as improving the environment, providing affordable health care, planning transportation options, and improving thequality of life in communities. The Bachelor of Science with a major in Public Policy (B.S. in Public Policy) degree program allows students to study a wide variety of policy areas through different departments and to develop an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of publicpolicy. While many fields in the arts and sciences contribute knowledge that is useful to public policy, no single discipline-whether economics, political science, sociology, or the natural sciences-gives students the ability to synthesize information a nd knowledge from across the disciplines to formulate comprehensive analyses of existing or proposed public policies and to be abl e to present these analyses to decision-makers. Many other undergraduate public policy degrees require that students declare a policy field of specialization within their program. The B.S. in Public Policy degree allows students the freedom to individualize their programs and work in a variety ofpolicy areas through their selection of elective courses. General background is provided to students by a common core of courses which provides them with an understanding of: The environment in which public policy is proposed, formed, implemented and evaluated; How the economy works, how we evaluate the outcomes of the market economy, how people and firms respond to incentives; The goals and tools of public policy; The quantitative and qualitative methods useful in the design and evaluation of policy; The means by which public policy is proposed, formed, implemented and evaluated.Andrew Young School of Policy Studies 133 Career Opportunities: Although programs in public administration have existed since the early twentieth-century, there is now increased demand for analysts who can contribute to the formulation and evaluation of policy, as well as its administration and management. The essence of a public policy degree is to prepare students to be able to work in the government-federal,state and local; domestic and foreign- and nonprofit settings in developing, choosing, implementing, and evaluating policy. Th e B.S. in Public Policy degree prepares students to be able to present comprehensive analyses to decision-makers in many fields.In addition to careers as governmental policy analysts, students may go into positions as policy specialists in private busines ses or nonprofit agencies, or any number of jobs involved with public affairs. The degree also provides an excellent preparation f or graduate study in law, public policy and administration, and related fields. A Top Ranked Program: The Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (AYSPS) is gaining increased national recognition as a top university in the field of public policy. Its many research centers and community outreach efforts provide opportunities to enhance students' education, as well as often opening doors to attractive jobs. The U.S. News and World Report survey published in its \" 2008 Edition America' s Best Graduate Schools \" ranked the AYSPS 26 th overall among the 253 public affairs schools in the United States, and in the top 25 programs in the specialty areas of public policy analysis and of public manage - ment and administration; and in the top dozen programs in city management and in public finance and budgeting. A B.S. in Publi c Policy provides students the resources to be leaders and innovators in the public sphere for years after they have graduated fr om the program.

A transfer student must comply with all academic regulations of the university. The College of Arts and Science s reserves the right to validate by examination any credits accepted by transfer. This provision in no way affects the acceptance of courses used to satisfy core curriculum requirements at another unit of the University System of Georgia. Students holding a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university who wish to complete another undergradu- ate degree are urged to clear all requirements with an adviser in the Office of Academic Assistance. Grades of C in Major/Minor Grades in the major and minor require a grade of C or higher. Certain departments/schools/institutes may also require a grade of C or higher in their introductory courses. Credit by Examination A maximum of 18 semester hours of degree credit may be granted before or after matriculation to a student who receives satisfactory scores on certain subject examinations of the College Level Examination Program of the College Entrance Examinatio n Board. The student should consult the appropriate department or school or the Office of Academic Assistance for furtherinformation. A maximum of 18 hours, but not more than 6 hours from one department or school, may be granted to entering freshmen who achieve satisfactory scores on the Advanced Placement Program of the CEEB. Credit awarded by examination by the academicdepartments within the College of Arts and Sciences does not apply toward the academic residence requirement. Credit for Transient Work Arts and Sciences students who wish to take course work at another institution, whether as a full-time or as a part-time student, must have prior written approval from the Office of Academic Assistance if they wish to apply the credit hours to adegree program. Failure to obtain the required prior approval will prevent the acceptance of such credits. Approval will be gra nted for no more than two terms of work and only if the student is in good academic standing at Georgia State University. No approva l of requests to take courses in Atlanta-area colleges will be granted if the course is readily available from Georgia State offe rings. During the term in which the student is scheduled to graduate, all courses must be taken at Georgia State unless prior writtenapproval has been obtained from the Office of Academic Assistance. The acceptance and application of all course work taken asa transient student is subject to any limitations imposed by the student's major department, school, or program of study.

Majors The College of Arts and Sciences requires the completion of a foreign language at the 1002 level for all students seeking a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree. This requirement can be met by taking a coursenumbered 1002 or higher. The foreign language requirement for students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies programs is most commonly included in core curriculum Area F (Courses Appropriate to the Major); however, programs may alsorequire students to complete foreign language courses in Area G , the 60 semester hours beyond the core curriculum. Studentstransferring to Georgia State with a completed core curriculum Area F, yet without sufficient course work to meet a program'sforeign language requirement, will be required to fulfill the necessary courses in the second 60 semester hours. Students whotake a language course in Area C and subsequently declare a major in a program leading to a Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor o f Interdisciplinary Studies will find that the language course no longer counts in Area C but in Area F or Area G. For this reas on, the college recommends that students in the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies programs not includea foreign language course in core curriculum Area C (Fine Arts and Humanities). Students who would like to begin a new foreign language, or to take a second foreign language, should consult a program adviser concerning the possibility of earning credit for the first semester of elementary foreign language (1001) in either cor e curriculum Area F or in the second 60 hours. 3030.20 B.A. in French, German, or Spanish and M.I.B. Joint Degree Program Highly qualified and highly motivated students interested in languages and international business may apply for this joint- degree program that leads to an undergraduate degree in French, German, or Spanish and a Master of International Business. It i s a demanding program that combines classroom study in the chosen second language with the international business curriculum.There will be at least one mandatory internship abroad in the final year, with a second strongly recommended study or workexperience abroad, usually during the third or fourth year. Completion of the program in five years will mean that students mus t be willing to attend classes in the summer, as necessary. For further information please contact: Department of Modern andClassical Languages, 841 General Classroom Building, 404/413-5980, e-mail: mclinfo@gsu.edu. For students interested in Japanese, the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies in Japanese/Asian Studies can also be com- bined with the MIB in the Joint Degree Program. For more information, contact Yuki Takatori, 404/413-5980 ormclyyt@langate.gsu.edu. 3030.30 Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree provides educational opportunities not available through the existing, traditional degree programs. The purpose of the program is to offer students an avenue by which they may take advantage of therich offerings available in the several colleges at the university. An individual student, in consultation with a faculty advis er, may tailor a program of study that meets his or her particular educational needs, desires, and interests. A student can pursue either a college-planned or a student-planned interdisciplinary program. The established college- planned programs address the needs of many students interested in a multidisciplinary, non-traditional education. Existing area s of concentration include Arts Administration-Speech/Theatre, Asian Studies, Classical Studies, Community Studies, Environmen-tal Science, International Studies, Language Studies, Law and Society, Middle East Studies, and Theatre. Students interested in developing a student-planned program have the option of choosing one of the following program plans: (1) two areas of concen-tration; (2) one area of concentration and two allied fields; or (3) one area of concentration, one allied field, and electives . Information about the B.I.S. program, including program options and the application process, is available from the college's Office of Academic Assistance, 418 General Classroom Building, 404/413-5000.142 College of Arts and Sciences Purpose The Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies degree provides educational opportunities not readily available through traditional departmental degree programs. Students have flexibility in developing a course of study appropriate to their goals by selecting courses from several departments/schools/institutes in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students may also include courses fromother colleges of this university in their interdisciplinary program. It is not the function of the interdisciplinary program to pull together an assortment of course work as a last-minute effort t o facilitate a student's graduation. A proposal should be planned by the time a student has earned 42 credit hours and shouldreflect a logical, consistent course of study that is based on acceptable and germane student objectives. Program Admission Applicants to the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies program must satisfy the admission requirements for Georgia State University and, in addition, must have a Georgia State cumulative grade-point average of 2.0. Matriculation into the program ca n occur only after the B.I.S. Council approves a student's program of study. There is a special application procedure for this de gree program and faculty advisement is a mandatory component of this process. Program Degree Requirements There are two options in the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies program, the student-planned option and the college- planned option. Descriptions are listed below. Option One: Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies Student-Planned Program Students may choose the option to propose their own program of study for approval by the B.I.S. Council responsible for the oversight of the degree. Students may select their proposed courses from any college in the university, as long as at least 50 percent of the hours in the program are chosen from courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students should have their proposed student-planned programs reviewed by the B.I.S. Council by the time they have earned 42 hours. To gain approval into the program, students must articulate a reasonable and educationally justifiable course of study. Proposed interdisciplinary degree programs cannot resemble current programs offered at the university. Students interested ininitiating the application process must first schedule an appointment with an academic adviser in the Office of Academic Assis-tance (404/413-5000). Students must also select an appropriate faculty adviser to provide guidance in developing the interdisci pli- nary program. Course of Study Outline for Student-Planned Programs Areas A-E: Core Curriculum (42) All undergraduate students satisfy a common core curriculum. These requirements are printed in the \"Academic Regula- tions\" section of this catalog. Area F: Courses Appropriate to the Major Field (18) Courses in this area should be included in the program proposal. The courses selected for this area must be at the lower- division level and judged to be programmatically appropriate to the intent of the proposed program. Foreign Language 1002must be included in Area F of all student-planned programs, except for those in science. Area G: Area of Concentration (similar to a traditional major area, except interdisciplinary in content). Area H: Allied Field (similar to a minor, except interdisciplinary in content).Area J : Electives When developing a student-planned program, the student may choose one of the following structures: Program Plan Structure One : An area of concentration (27-33 semester hours*) with an allied field (15-21 semester hours*) and electives (6-18 semester hours*). Program Plan Structure Two : An area of concentration (27-33 semester hours*) with two allied fields (15-21 semester hours each*). Program Plan Structure Three : Two areas of concentration (27-33 semester hours each*). * No more than 12 hours of the requirements in an area of concentration, and no more than 6 hours of the requirements in an allied field, may be taken from the offerings of any one department/school/institute in the university. Courses in the area ofconcentration and allied field must be at the 3000-4000 level. Also, a grade of C or higher is required in all courses in the a rea of concentration and allied field. Electives are used to build the hours in Areas G-J to 60 hours, have 39 hours at GeorgiaCollege of Arts and Sciences 143 State University taken at the 3000-4000 level for residency, and complete 120 hours required for graduation. The last 27 semester hours prior to graduation must be completed while formally enrolled in the program. Option Two: Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies College-Planned Programs Students may choose a program designed by the College as follows: Arts Administration-Speech/Theatre, Asian Studies, Classical Studies, Community Studies, Environmental Science, International Studies, Language Studies, Law and Society, Middle East Studies, and Theatre. For information about the college-planned programs, see the alphabetical list of majors later in thi s chapter of this catalog. Environmental Science has specific core curriculum requirements listed. 3030.40 The Interdisciplinary Minor The interdisciplinary minor provides educational opportunities not otherwise available and allows students the flexibility to select courses for the minor from several departments/schools/colleges at the university. Students must propose their interdisc i- plinary minor of 15-18 hours for approval by the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies Advisory Council. A proposal must identi fy the way in which the minor fits into the context of the student's entire degree program. To gain approval, students must articu late a reasonable and educationally justifiable course of study and must keep in mind that this course of study may not duplicatewhat is currently available. Students can choose to pursue either a college-planned or a student-planned interdisciplinary mino r. The following requirements apply to the interdisciplinary minor:1. The student must have a Georgia State University cumulative grade-point average of 2.0;2. All courses included must be at the 3000 level or above;3. No more than six hours may be taken in any one department or school and courses cannot be from the major area; and4. At least 50 percent of the minor must be completed after the semester in which the B.I.S. Advisory Council approves the minor program plan. Students should contact the Office of Academic Assistance at 404/413-5000 for information on the application procedure. Guidelines for college-planned interdisciplinary minors in Advanced Leadership and Management, Gerontology, Jewish Studies,Language Studies, Latin American Studies, and Middle East Studies are also available. 3040 Office of Academic Assistance 418 General Classroom Building 404/413-5000http://www.cas.gsu.edu/oaaDirector: Tammy Patterson-HillAcademic Advisers: Bradford, Harrell, King, Meier, Sanders, Terrell The Office of Academic Assistance supports departments and schools in providing academic advisement for students in the college. This office also works with students on career development and on marketing a liberal arts background in the current j ob environment. The Office of Academic Assistance prepares evaluations of transfer work done at other institutions as well asacademic program reviews for each major offered through the college. It also assists with course selections and schedulerevisions and provides information concerning college and university policies. Students are advised on an appointment basis, orthey may come by the Academic Assistance office at any time during office hours for brief consultations. During the academicyear, the office is open until 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday and until 5:15 p.m. on Monday, Thursday and Friday. Studentsseeking a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences should become familiar with the academic regulations of the universitystated elsewhere in this catalog. Academic Advisement for Majors Although the College of Arts and Sciences will endeavor to provide timely and accurate advisement, it is the responsibility of the student to know and to satisfy the degree requirements of his or her academic program. The College of Arts and Sciences encourages its majors to receive regular academic advisement in their major departments/ schools/institutes. This position reflects the belief that a strong undergraduate program is possible only if there are frequen t opportunities for students to discuss their academic work and career goals with one of their major professors. In a large urbaninstitution such as Georgia State University, contact is essential if students are to receive individual attention and enjoy th e full benefits of a liberal arts education. Students should call their major department/school/institute to make advisement appoint-ments and/or find out the department's/school's/institute's walk-in advisement schedule. A list of undergraduate directors andadvisers is available online at http://www.cas.gsu.edu/ugrad_advisors.asp .144 College of Arts and Sciences 3050 Student Complaints, Petitions for Policy Waivers and Variances, and Appeals The appeals procedure for students in the College of Arts and Sciences will follow different courses depending on the nature of the student's appeal.

Weigle, Chair Lucy Pickering, Director of Undergraduate Studies Applied linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates many perspectives on the study of human language. Studying linguistics is not a matter of learning many different languages, but rather it is the study of the nature of language in gener al. Applied Linguistics is the study of language and communication in relation to real-world problems such as language acquisition and teaching, language assessment, improving intercultural communication, and understanding the relationship betweenlanguage and social organization. The Department of Applied Linguistics and English as a Second Language offers (1) a B.A. degree in Applied Linguistics; (2) undergraduate courses leading to the Bachelor's of Interdisciplinary Studies (B.I.S.) degree in Language Studies (see Section3360), (3) a certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), (4) ESL credit-bearing courses for non-native speake rs of English, and (5) Intensive English Program (IEP) courses for non-native speakers of English. The B.A. in Applied Linguistics and the B.I.S. in Language Studies provide the opportunity for students to explore the field of linguistics from an interdisciplinary perspective. Dr. Lucy Pickering is Director of Undergraduate Studies for the departmen t and can be contacted at 404/413-5195 or esllup@langate.gsu.edu. The TEFL certificate program provides students with appropriate skills and a credential that will enable them to teach English as a foreign language abroad. Students majoring in any undergraduate program can earn the TEFL certificate. In addition, thecertificate can be earned by any postbaccalaureate student. TEFL certificate requirements consist of the following five courses : AL 3021, AL 3041, AL 3051, AL 4151, and AL 4161. AL 3021 is a prerequisite for the remaining four courses.

L. Baumstark, ChairDabney Dixon, Associate ChairDoyle J. Barrow, Jr ., Director of Undergraduate Studies, Adviser180 College of Arts and Sciences Chemistry deals with the nature of all substances and the changes that occur therein. It ranges from the study of the structure of atoms and molecules to that of the reactions occurring in living organisms. The study of chemistry can provide knowledge that will give students a greater understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. In addition, knowl-edge of chemistry is a great asset in areas such as biology, physics, and health-related fields. It is a logical basis for pre- medical training. Each student is urged to consult with a faculty adviser at the earliest possible time (even before the first semester) to outli ne a curriculum to meet his or her needs. A typical program of study for chemistry majors is outlined below. Although not required , several minors are possible for chemistry majors. Program Academic Regulations A grade of C or higher is required for all major and minor courses. Program Degree Requirements Alternatives are available to some core and major requirements. Please see a faculty adviser for specific guidelines.In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400). Chemistry Courses for Science Majors Detailed descriptions of the objectives and prerequisites of each course are available in the Department of Chemistry. The student is urged to consult these descriptions if there is any doubt about requirements or qualifications. Laboratory courses a nd courses on principles are designed to be mutually reinforcing. The laboratory is the real basis for the science, but the lectur e courses are designed to speed the learning process. The two parts are separated only to provide added flexibility in schedulingand to meet individual needs, particularly for transfer students. Great care should be exercised in scheduling one course witho ut the other. Chemistry Courses for Non-Science Majors Chemistry 1050, 1101K-1102K and 1151K-1152K are of primary interest to students in liberal arts, health sciences, education, business administration, and policy studies.

Computer science as a discipline seeks to build a scientific foundation for topics such as computer design, computer programming and software, information processing, algorithmic solutions to problems, and the algorithmic process itself. Computer science provides underpinnings for today'sapplications in industry, science, government, and business and prepares the foundation for tomorrow' s applications in ubiqui- tous computing, medical cures for diseases, and instant access to information by everyone. The B.S. degree program in computer science provides preparation in the fundamental principles and processes of computa- tion and training in applying these principles in application areas in industry, science, government, and business. The studen t completes a basic group of required courses in the early stages and chooses courses from several concentrations in the laterstages to provide for appropriate breadth and depth of knowledge in the discipline. A B.S. degree in computer science provides a good foundation for advanced studies at the M.S. or Ph.D. level as well as for careers in industry, science, government, and business. To plan the major according to particular goals, students are encourage d to consult with an adviser in the department. Majors who are interested in having a paid work experience related to their area of study should contact the university's Office of Cooperative Education, which coordinates the university's cooperative educationprograms. The courses are structured, and the department enforces the prerequisites for its courses. Students are urged to check and take the prerequisites for computer science courses and any computer science requirement as listed by their major department/school/institute.

Although the department concentrates on texts written in English by authors from Gre at Britain, Ireland, and the United States, it also examines translations of texts from other languages as well as newly emerging literatures in English from other cultural perspectives. Students may also encounter practices that are not, strictly speaking,\"writing\" at all, such as oral compositions, hypertexts, and folk art. At the freshmen level, all students in the university take courses in the fundamentals of college-level writing and in the reasoned analysis of texts. Other English courses that form part of the core curriculum provide students with opportunities tostudy topics in world literature or surveys of British, American, and World literature. English majors may concentrate in one of four areas: literature, advanced composition and rhetoric, creative writing, and secondary English (pre-education). Before choosing their concentrations, all English majors have the opportunity at the sopho-more level to gain a broad foundation in English and American literature and studies in literature or rhetoric. Then, with the help of their advisers, majors choose upper-division courses, which allow them to pursue their interests in more depth. Finally,students study within their chosen concentrations in seminars designed as capstones for the major. In addition, the department's joint studies program with the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, England, offers Georgia State University English and history majors the opportunity to complete their degrees with a concentration in British andAmerican Cultures. On successfully completing their studies, English majors will have acquired a sensitivity to the written word and an apprecia- tion for the creative process. They will have developed their skills in organization, writing, and interpretation. English cour ses offer students the opportunity to discover their own insights and to articulate them with precision. Majors who concentrate in literature take a range of courses that afford them opportunities to read poetry, prose, and drama from a variety of historical periods and cultural groups. These literature courses seek to promote students' verbal acuity andabilities at thoughtful evaluation. Closely related to the study of literature is the department's creative writing program. Faculty in this program guide students as they practice and refine their work in the genres of poetry and fiction. Students who concentrate in advanced composition and rhetoric learn about the history, theory, and practice of writing to specific audiences for particular purposes. In this concentration, students may focus on either historical rhetoric and the tea ch- ing of composition or writing within business and technical environments. Courses in this area allow students to explore thehistory and theory of writing as they apply to the teaching of composition and to writing practices in the workplace. English majors who wish to teach English in secondary schools combine studies of literature, language, and composition with a senior seminar that combines these areas with pedagogy. The Department of English offers courses in the related field of folklore. Georgia State University is the only institution in the state offering a wide selection of folklore courses. A number of courses in the Department of English have an interdisciplinary approach, and several are crosslisted with other units within the university, such as the Department of African-American Studies and the Women's Studies Institute. Because of the dynamic and varied nature of our discipline, many of the courses offered (especially on the 4000 level) focus on specific topics not indicated in detail here. Students should inquire in the department office for further information aboutcourses.College of Arts and Sciences 189 Program Degree Requirements All English majors planning to take any upper-division literature courses must fulfill the appropriate three prerequisite courses (Engl 2120, 2130, and either 3040 or 3050) with a grade of C or higher.

Joint Degree Bachelor of Arts Major in International Economics and Modern Languages Minor in French Department of Modern and Classical Languages 841 General Classroom Building404/413-5980http://www.gsu.edu/languagesFernando Reati, ChairGerman Torres, Associate Chair Georges Perla, Undergraduate DirectorDavid O'Connell, Head of French section and AdviserCarol Semonsky, Head of Foreign Language Education and Adviser The Department of Modern and Classical Languages serves a threefold purpose: to encourage an appreciation of humanistic values through the study of foreign languages, literatures, and cultures; to teach foreign languages as a means of communica- tion; and to prepare students for academic careers and the opportunities available in the field of international business. As p art of a dynamic urban university in a city of growing international awareness and status, the department is fulfilling its responsibilityto meet the increasing foreign language needs of the governmental, business, and professional communities. The department recognizes that an active command of the foreign language and a thorough exploration of the foreign culture form an essential basis for further study in the various areas of its curriculum. To this end, the department sponsors a study-abroad program in Tours (France). The department maintains a state-of-the-art multimedia Language Acquisition and Resource Center (LARC) with a digital audio laboratory with 50 student computer workstations. The digital lab serves a dual purpose in allowing both independentstudent access to digitized audio files and interactive software that accompanies the language texts, and also in providing amultimedia environment for teacher-led listening, speaking, and recording activities. In addition to the audio lab, the LARCfeatures a tutoring center and resource library, as well as 17 stand-alone computers for student use. To assist in the developm ent of the student's active language skills and to provide added cultural enrichment, the LARC contains a wide range of audiovisualmaterials, including an extensive collection of videos, CD Roms and DVDs. The department sponsors two Freshman Learning Communities each year. One group is designed for students interested in using their foreign language in international business. The other, sponsored jointly by the Department of Applied Linguistics/ESL, is in Language Studies. For students who hope to teach at the K-12 levels, the department offers a concentration that leads to certification in French.For students who view language study as a preparation for a career in the business world, the department has two special programs: a concentration in the business language of French; and a practicum in an internationally oriented business or servic e organization in the metro area for qualified and interested students in their senior year. The department also offers two progr ams in conjunction with other colleges: the Bachelor of Arts in French and MIB Joint Degree Program, in collaboration with theRobinson College of Business, and the Bachelor of Arts Major in International Economics and Modern Languages (IEML), incollaboration with the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. The department is also a testing center for diplomas certifying proficiency in business language and procedures. These diplomas are granted by chambers of commerce in various countries. All French majors are encouraged to consult regularly with their departmental adviser in designing and following a program of study that fits their own career objective and the requirements of their particular concentration.200 College of Arts and Sciences Program Degree Requirements In addition to courses in the language major, students are advised to choose courses in other areas that complement their language study. Such courses include other languages, history, philosophy, art and music, business, and education. Faculty advisers in the department are eager to discuss students' academic plans as they design their course of study. In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

Crawford Elliott, ChairJeremy E. Diem, Undergraduate Director for GeographyTimothy E. LaTour , Undergraduate Director for Geology Geoscience is the broad study of the earth, including the earth's interior, its surface, its atmosphere, and its people. Tradi - tionally these subjects have been separated into several fields that include Geology and Geography, and this distinction may st ill be somewhat appropriate; however, some of the subject matter with which Geography and Geology are concerned can be claimedby both. Taking advantage of this, the Department of Geosciences seeks to make available to students instruction and experi-ences that exploit the complementary nature of Geology and Geography. The Department of Geosciences offers the B.A. degree in Geography with five concentrations: General Geography, Human Geography, Physical Geography, Geographic Information Science, and Pre-Education; and the B.S. degree in Geology with threeconcentrations: General Geology, Environmental Geology, and Earth Science. 3280.10 Geography Program Jeremy E. Diem, Undergraduate Director for Geography Geography is the study of the relationships among people, places, society, and the environment. The geography major has been designed to enable the student to develop a broad understanding of social and environmental issues, attain depth in a specialized area within geography, and acquire skills needed to gain employment and carry out lifelong learning. In order to as sist students in attaining depth, the following concentrations are offered: human geography, physical geography, and geographicinformation science. General geography and pre-education are two additional concentration options. An undergraduate degree in geography affords someone many opportunities for employment in both the public sector and the private sector. Geographers generally find employment as cartographers, city/regional planners, conservationists, environ-mental managers, environmental regulators, Geographic Information System (GIS) specialists, historic preservationists, locationanalysts, and as physical scientists working for the government. In addition, with the diversity of their liberal arts training , geographers also qualify for professional management positions as well as more traditional work as teachers. An undergraduate degree in geography also provides a solid intellectual foundation for people getting advanced degrees in either the social or natural sciences. In addition, to being given substantial flexibility with respect to their selection of u nder- graduate courses, geography majors are required to take multiple upper-division courses in human geography, physical geogra-phy, and geographic information science. Finally, the concentration within geography enables geography majors to begin to findtheir intellectual niche. Students interested in any geography course, or in majoring or minoring in the geography program, are invited to contact the geography undergraduate adviser to discuss how the geography program may best help make their college experience positiveand productive. Program Degree Requirements In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

LaTour, Undergraduate Director for Geology Philosopher Will Durant once remarked, \"Civilization exists by geological consent, subject to change without notice.\" Almost every day we are reminded how large a role geology plays in our lives, whether it be earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, contaminated water supplies, rising oil prices, or the cost of emeralds, sapphires, and gold. Geology is the science of the earth. Geological research includes studies of minerals and rocks that compose the earth's surface and interior, the geometry and interrelationships of rock masses, the structural configuration of the earth, and fluidswithin the earth. Geology also includes the study of modern physical processes and interpretation of the earth's physical andbiological evolution through billions of years of geologic time and into the future. Because of our critical dependence on theearth, appreciation of geology is essential if we are to make informed and enlightened decisions on how to use and protect ourplanet. Many career opportunities allow for practical application of geology in industry, consulting firms, and governmental agen- cies at all levels. Practical and essential applications of geology include development and wise use of water resources, bothsurface and subsurface; land-use planning for urban, suburban, and rural development; exploration for and development ofmineral and energy resources including petroleum; and development of environmentally sound strategies for hazardous wastedisposal and treatment. The curriculum leading to the B.S. degree in geology is excellent preparation for graduate work ingeoscience and environmental science. For students who are interested in geoscience and environmental science but who intendto pursue graduate or advanced study in other fields, for example environmental law or business, the geology B.S. degree maystill be an appropriate choice. The Department of Geosciences offers the B.S. degree with three concentrations: General Geology, Environmental Geology, and Earth Science. The Environmental and Earth Science concentrations are for students seeking strong preparation for enteringthe work force with the B.S. degree. The Environmental concentration emphasizes the study of ground water and the delicate environmental balances of the natural world. The Earth Science concentration emphasizes the measure and graphical depiction of geological features andprocesses. Both are excellent preparation for jobs in the environmental area and for graduate work in environmental geology. Th e concentration in general geology is the most traditional of the programs, designed to prepare the student for graduate studies or employment in a wide variety of geoscience areas. It features the greatest flexibility in selection and scheduling of courses.Specific requirements for the concentrations are shown below. Majors should be aware that there are prerequisites for many geology courses and that several courses are offered only once a year. As soon as they have selected the geology major, students must consult with department advisers to be informed in thesematters and to ensure that programs of study accord with their specific career aspirations and needs. The department participat es actively in the university's Cooperative Education Program, whereby the student can work and attend school at the same time orin alternate years. The program enables students to develop long-term career opportunities while in school. Because of thepotential complexities of such a program, students are encouraged to seek early advisement in the department. Co-op studentsalso should discuss their academic plans and curriculum options with their employers.206 College of Arts and Sciences Program Financial Information Courses with labs and/or field trips require purchase of lab fee cards. A field camp fee is required for Geol 4120/4121. Program Degree Requirements All curricula leading to a B.S. degree in geology include students must also take one of the following allied science sequences: Bio l 1103K/1104K; Phys 2211K/2212K. Note: Physics recommended. Students in all concentrations must take either the Math 2211/2212 sequence or the following pair of math courses: Math 1070 and 1220. The Math 2211/2212 sequence is strongly recommended for students planning to go to graduate school in geology or any other natural science, or to seek employment where a year of calculus is required or expected. Students arestrongly urged to consult with the departmental adviser to determine which pair of mathematics courses would be more appropri-ate. In completing their requirements, all students follow a concentration in General Geology, Environmental Geology, or Earth Science. The choice should be based on the student's interests and expectations, within the context of the concentrationdifferences described above. In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

As p art of a dynamic urban university in a city of growing international awareness and status, the department is fulfilling its responsibilityto meet the increasing foreign language needs of the governmental, business, and professional communities. The department recognizes that an active command of the foreign language and a thorough exploration of the foreign culture form an essential basis for further study in the various areas of its curriculum. The department maintains a state-of-the-art multimedia Language Acquisition and Resource Center (LARC) with a digital audio laboratory with 50 student computer workstations. The digital lab serves a dual purpose in allowing both independentstudent access to digitized audio files and interactive software that accompanies the language texts, and also in providing amultimedia environment for teacher-led listening, speaking, and recording activities. In addition to the audio lab, the LARCfeatures a tutoring center and resource library, as well as 17 stand-alone computers for student use. To assist in the developm ent of the student's active language skills and to provide added cultural enrichment, the LARC contains a wide range of audiovisualmaterials, including an extensive collection of videos, CD Roms and DVDs. The department sponsors two Freshman Learning Communities each year. One group is designed for students interested in using their foreign language in international business. The other, sponsored jointly by the Department of Applied Linguistics/ESL, is in Language Studies. For students who hope to teach at the K-12 levels, the department offers a concentration that leads to certification in German. For students who view language study as a preparation for a career in the business world, the department has two special programs: a concentration in the business language of German, and a practicum in an internationally oriented business or servic e organization in the metro area for qualified and interested students in their senior year.

Davidson, Undergraduate Director Historians study various aspects of humanity's recorded past. Some historians explore the rise and fall of empires, while others describe the everyday lives of men and women. They are interested in every period of the past and all parts of the world . Historians also examine the principles and theories that influence the writing of history. They seek to understand the forces t hat have structured human life and the ideas that have shaped the way people perceive and experience their worlds. Historians are concerned with change and continuity within societies and interactions among cultures. Historians pay particular attention to t he effect of perspectives and values because their discipline involves the interpretation of findings, not just the collection of facts. History can teach us many lessons, not simply about our past but also about the paradoxes and potentials of our present. The Department of History offers a wide range of courses in African, Asian, European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and United States history. Arranged in three levels\u2014introductory, intermediate, and advanced\u2014these courses afford students anopportunity not only to become familiar with a body of historical knowledge but also to enhance their skills as readers, discus - sants, writers, and researchers. Because it emphasizes analytic and critical thinking, history prepares students for further pr ofes- sional training in education, international studies, journalism, law, politics, and public policy, and for all manner of career s. All students can benefit from the insights history provides into the human condition.

Hattingh, ChairDraga Vidakovic, Associate Chair Valerie A. Miller, Director of Undergraduate StudiesJoseph J. Walker, Director of Undergraduate Advisement All freshmen entering Georgia State University are required to take either the College Entrance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the assessment of the American College Testing Program (ACT). The results of the test, performance in and time of previous mathematical education, and the student's intended major or career goals are all factors to be consideredwhen registering for any mathematics course. In order to register for courses numbered 1111 or higher, students must make anappropriate score on the mathematics placement test (see Section 1410.10) or have other appropriate prerequisite work. Therefor e, students are urged to check the prerequisites for mathematics courses, and the mathematics requirement as listed by their major222 College of Arts and Sciences department/school/institute. Refer any questions to that department/school/ institute or to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Mathematics is one of the great unifying themes in our modern culture. It is a language, a science, an art form, and a tool of tremendous power. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics, in its courses for both majors and non-majors, seeks tointroduce students to this vast area of knowledge and to show them how mathematics can be used to solve problems. The B.S. degree program in mathematics prepares a student for positions in business, industry, and government; a career in the teaching of mathematics at the secondary level; or further study in mathematics or statistics leading to graduate degrees. Five concentrations are offered within the B.S. degree in mathematics. The concentration in actuarial science prepares a student to work as an actuary. The concentration in computer information systems prepares students for work in the field ofmanagement information systems. The concentration in computer science provides education in more scientific aspects ofcomputing. The concentration in managerial sciences provides training in management modeling, problem solving, and computer-assisted decision support/expert systems technologies. Finally, the concentration in statistics prepares students for work asapplied statisticians. Guidelines for minors in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are given after the program descriptions.In addition to immediate employment, there are opportunities for good students to pursue further study at the graduate level in mathematics, statistics, and other fields. In 1978, the department initiated a cooperative education program with International Business Machines, Inc. Over the years, the program has expanded to include many other firms. Hundreds of majors have benefited from a co-op experience. Majors havean opportunity for paid work experience related to their area of study. They may also make important contacts that may lead tofull-time employment after graduation. The Office of Cooperative Education has been established to coordinate the university'scooperative education programs. Majors are asked to consider carefully the career objectives they wish to pursue after graduation. A particular career objec- tive may suggest a special choice for the minor or concentration that would prepare one for that career. It also might suggest that a co-op experience would be useful. Faculty who serve as academic advisers for majors can discuss choices and concentrationsthat are available to majors. Program Financial Information There are no extra fees, scholarships or other expenses outside of regular Georgia State University fees applicable to a B.S. degree in mathematics, other than those associated with teacher preparation (see Sections 1605 and 1610).

Anderson, Chair The Department of Military Science and Leadership, most often referred to as the Reserve Officer' s Training Corps (ROTC), offers an introduction to the management opportunities available in the United States Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. The basic course (MSL 1000 and 2000 series) provides college freshman and sophomores a unique and challenging curricu- lum, and it requires no obligation to military service. The advanced program (MSL 3000 and 4000 series) is designed for student s with two years of undergraduate or graduate study remaining. The upper-level program requires service, only under contract, anobligation for the student to serve in the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, or on Active Duty as a commissioned officer. Thesummer between MSL 3000 and 4000-level classes, students will attend a 32-day leadership internship at Ft Lewis, Washington,that certifies their capability to serve as an officer in the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, or on Active Duty. Entering RO TC can be personally, physically, and financially rewarding. Stipends of $450-500 per month as well as scholarship opportunities a re available. An interdisciplinary minor in advanced leadership and management is designed specifically for those individuals who are planning a career in the U.S. Army as commissioned officers. This minor may not be used as a substitute for any minor requiredby a student's academic major and cannot be considered as a student's area of concentration. The undergraduate minor inadvanced leadership and management is intended for any student whose major does not require a specific minor, therebypermitting this minor to fulfill that requirement. Students who complete the minor will be prepared for military service and po si- tions of higher responsibility and leadership within the civilian work place.

Program Academic Regulations Undergraduate music degrees (B. Mu and B.S.) require students to take general education courses in the sciences and humanities (see section listing general degree requirements), courses in musical foundations, and courses in a concentration oftheir choice. Foundation courses include music performance (described below under \"The Applied Cluster\"), piano, music theory,College of Arts and Sciences 233 and music history/literature. In addition to foundation courses, students must complete courses in a concentration. Available concentrations for the B. Mus degree include performance (voice, guitar, keyboard, and orchestral instruments), composition,music technology (recording), music education, and jazz. The music management curriculum is available only through the B.S.degree. Some concentrations have specializations or emphases that are detailed below. Advisement Students are expected to meet with their faculty advisers every semester of residence. At first, a student should meet with the associate director of the School of Music to receive advisement. Once a decision has been made regarding a student's choice ofconcentration, the student will be assigned a faculty adviser. Thereafter, the student will meet with this adviser each semeste r. Should a student decide that a change of concentration is desired, the student should apply for such a change with the associat e director of the School of Music. Explanation of Applied Music Levels Applied music consists of individual or small-group performance instruction in a student's principal performing medium (voice, piano, trumpet, flute, etc.). All music majors must study applied music as part of their degree programs. 1000 level: Introductory. May be used by students who are admitted to the music degree program but who wish to study in a secondary area. With permission, introductory level courses may also be used by music minors or approved non-majors. Is notapplicable to degree requirements in one's principal performing medium. Authorization is required. One credit hour per semester ; one half-hour lesson each week. 2000 level: Lower level. For entering freshmen and sophomores in all music concentrations. One or two credit hours per semester; one hour lesson per week. 3000 level: Concentration. Required of juniors and seniors whose concentration is not in performance. One or two credit hours per semester; one-hour lesson per week. 4000 level: Major. Required of all juniors and seniors with a concentration in performance or jazz studies; juniors and seniors in the composition concentration are required to enroll at this level for their applied composition studies. Two or three credi t hours per semester; one-hour lesson per week. Musical Ensembles Musical ensembles (choral groups, jazz ensembles, orchestra, and wind ensembles) are open to all Georgia State University students by audition. Non-music majors should contact the School of Music or the appropriate instructor for information onscheduling an audition. Every student who is registered for applied music is required to enroll in a conducted ensemble. String, woodwind, brass, and percussion students are generally assigned to symphonic band, symphonic wind ensemble, and/or orchestra. V oice andkeyboard students typically enroll in choral society, university singers, or women's chorus. A music student may be required toperform in more than one ensemble. Factors considered in making assignments will include the specific needs and abilities of th e student and the requirements of the various ensembles. All music majors (except music education) are required to complete a minimum of eight credit hours of ensemble. Only one credit hour of ensemble per semester may be applied to the total. Assignments to specific ensembles are made each fall semesterthrough \"pool\" auditions, which are required for all students in the school. Students are required to perform in those ensemblesto which they are assigned. The Applied Cluster To insure comprehensive development in performing, all music majors are required to register for and participate in the following performing activities: a) private study (applied music); b) chamber music/performance laboratory; and c) large con-ducted ensemble, i.e. wind ensemble/band, choir/chorus, or orchestra (jazz band may count 4 semesters only for students in jazzstudies concentration; vocal jazz does not count as a large ensemble). Students may be required to participate in studio classe s as scheduled by private instructors. In addition, students must attend labs/master classes as required by studio instructors.Some programs require that students register for credit in chamber music. Those not required to register for credit must regist er for chamber music under Mus 4010. These activities are collectively known as the Applied Cluster. Students must register forlarge ensemble and chamber music or performance laboratory during each semester of applied music study. In general, music majors must register for the applied cluster for eight academic terms. The exceptions to this policy are in t he music education and music management concentrations. Concert Attendance (Mus 1100) Concert attendance (Mus 1100) is required of all music majors. Although the course shows on a student's transcript, it carries zero credit; there is no fee for concert attendance. To fulfill the requirements for the Bachelor of Music degree, stud ents must receive a grade of \"S\" for the number of semesters of Mus 1100 required by their concentration. Transfer students must234 College of Arts and Sciences fulfill Mus 1100 for the number of semesters required to earn their degree, to a maximum of six. Credit may be granted for docu - mented concert/recital attendance requirements at prior institutions. Program Degree Requirements In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

Students who meet the above requirements may enroll in music education methods courses at the 3000 and 4000 levels. To be retained in the music education concentration, students must maintain musical and academic standards, which consist ofgrades of B or higher in all music education methods courses and proficiency in keyboard, guitar and, depending on the special-ization, voice, brass, woodwind, strings or percussion. Prior to student teaching, students will be evaluated by the faculty to determine their qualifications for student teaching. These qualifications are (1) an overall GPA of 2.5 or above, (2) a GPA of at least 2.5 in all music courses, (3) grades of C or higherin all of the courses in the concentration, and (4) grades of B or higher in all music education methods courses. In addition,students must have demonstrated their teaching competence as determined by the music education faculty and must demon-strate a record of professional attributes and personal behaviors suitable for placement in a school with children. Application for Entry to Teacher Education Music education majors must file a formal application for entry into teacher education using the form available in the College of Education's Office of Academic Assistance (also available at http://education.gsu.edu/aae/index_Under.htm ) or supplied by the music education faculty. Students must apply for entry into teacher education concurrent with their applications forpracticum/internship (MUS 4260 or 4310). This normally occurs upon completion of 60 hours of course work, including coursesrequired in Areas A through D and EDUC 2110.

It is an attempt to understand the basic relationships between human beings, God, and nature that guide the personal and professional lives of people and that constitute an essential aspect of human culture. It is also a search for critical tools to evaluate these relationships and to ensure objectivity, disciplined insight, and rational argume nt. The Department of Philosophy offers two undergraduate degree programs, the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy with a Pre-Law Concentration. Majors are urged to consult with their advisers in order to preparethe course of study most appropriate to their individual interests and needs. All majors planning to attend graduate schoolshould consult closely with their advisers concerning courses appropriate for their anticipated graduate programs. Philosophyminors and all students intending to take departmental courses are invited to discuss their goals and needs with members of theDepartment of Philosophy. The department maintains an extensive website, http://www.gsu.edu/philosophy . Major in Philosophy Philosophy is an appropriate study for anyone wishing a broad liberal education that teaches one how to think and that promotes self-awareness. It is particularly appropriate as a major or minor for those contemplating a career in law, administra tion, public service, politics, business, education, the sciences, or religion. Students in other fields are encouraged to consider t he possibility of a double major with philosophy. The Department of Philosophy offers a wide variety of courses especially developed for students in business, health sciences, education, and public and urban affairs, as well as for those who pursue a scientific or humanistic career. For thosestudying the humanities or the sciences, philosophy provides invaluable critical skills, insight into methodological presupposi - tions, and an appreciation of the intellectual debates that have shaped history. The department's program also offers a series of courses in applied philosophy, the study of which provides practical skills for one's personal, social, and professional life. Courses in this area include philosophy of law, biomedical ethics, and busin ess ethics. Major in Philosophy with a Pre-Law Concentration The study of philosophy is excellent preparation for law school. The critical thinking skills, clarity in writing and argumenta - tive rigor required in philosophy provide students with the tools they need to be successful in law school and as lawyers.Moreover, philosophy majors have had traditionally the highest average scores on the LSAT and the highest admission rates tolaw school of any major. (For this data, see http://www.gsu.edu/philosphy , and click on \"Major.\") Students interested in the major in philosophy with a pre-law concentration, should consult with the Department's pre-law adviser, Dr . Andrew I. Cohen, aicohen@gsu.edu. Program Academic Regulations A 2000 or 3000-level philosophy course is a prerequisite for all 4000-level philosophy courses.

Students majoring in philosophy with a pre-law concentration are not required to take a minor.2. The department strongly recommends that philosophy majors with a pre-law concentration take the fourth semester of a foreign language as an elective course. Minor in Philosophy Students who wish to minor in Philosophy must take at least 15 hours in courses in philosophy, including at least nine semester hours at the 3000 or 4000-level. Students taking more than 15 hours in courses in the specific area may count theadditional hours toward their electives or may consider completing a double major. A grade of C or higher is required in allcourses counting toward the minor. Minor in Ethics (see section 3250) 3440 Physics Programs Offered: Bachelor of Science in Physics Standard Program in Physics Concentration in Applied Physics Concentration in AstronomyConcentration in Biophysics Concentration in Computer Science Concentration in GeologyConcentration in Pre-Medicine Minor in Physics Department of Physics and Astronomy 400 Science Annex404/413-6033http://www.Phy-Astr.gsu.eduH. Richard Miller, ChairDavid Wingert, Under graduate Director Brian Thoms, Undergraduate Director All degree programs described below are built on a core of 22 semester hours of physics numbered 3400 or above and establish a strong background in mathematics by providing nine semester hours of 3000 and 4000-level courses. The standard program is designed to prepare the student for graduate school or immediate employment upon graduation. Students selectingthe standard program must complete 15 semester hours of physics and mathematics beyond the core set of physics and math-ematics courses listed below. As an alternative to the standard program, courses in one of several specific areas of concentrat ion may be chosen as described below. The available areas of concentration are applied physics, astronomy, pre-medicine, biophys-ics, geology, and computer science. A central objective of Georgia State University is that all graduates from its programs will be proficient in writing, critical and analytical thinking, and use of information resources. In support of this objective, the Department of Physics and Astronomyexplicitly incorporates activities to develop these skills as appropriate in each course. To schedule an effective program of study, it is very important that all students intending to major in physics consult with the physics faculty adviser as soon as possible. Physics majors should pay special attention to the early completion of themathematical requirements if they are to complete their physics requirements during the usual four-year span. The first calculu s course should be taken during the freshman year, and the second and third calculus courses should be completed during thesophomore year. The department recommends that General Chemistry I and II be taken during the freshman year. The beginningCollege of Arts and Sciences 249 physics sequence (Physics 2211K-2212K) should be completed before the end of the sophomore year. Students who enter the physics major after completing a non-calculus level elementary physics sequence should consult with their departmental adviseron the best method of preparing for more advanced courses in physics. The degree programs described below do not require a foreign language. However, the department recommends that stu- dents continue their high school experience to a level of competency equivalent to Georgia State's 1002 level or higher. Program Degree Requirements In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

Downs, Chair Political science is the study of \"who gets what, when, and how\" in the distribution of goods and values in society and in groups. Specifically, political scientists study the determinants of such distributions, including political parties and voters, public opinion, interest groups, bureaucracies and administrative behavior , public law, international relations, international law and organizations, national security, intergovernmental relations, political behavior, political philosophy, comparative politics, public policy, and conflict. Students may specialize in any of the five fields of the discipline: American politics and government, comparative politics, international politics, political theory, and public policy and administration. The department also provides specific concentra tions for majors and minors in pre-law and in international affairs. The department sponsors intercollegiate academic teams for Mock Trial, Model United Nations, and Model Arab League. The department sponsors student honor societies and clubs in pre-law, international relations, and political science. In addition, the department provides advisement for pre-law students. The proximity of Georgia State University to the center of government for the Southeast and the State of Georgia and its location in an international city of business, communication, and transportation provide unique opportunities for students to observe and participate in government and politics. For example, many qualified students serve as interns as part of theiracademic program.

Faculty from these departments compose the Premedical Professions Advisory Committee and advise pre-med students. This committee maintains contact with medical schools concerning specific requirements and selection criteria and helps studentsdesign specific programs of study for dentistry, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, or veterinarymedicine. While most premedical students major in biology, chemistry or physics, requirements for admission to medical or denta l schools may be met by other majors, provided the requisite science courses are completed. A student interested in one of these preparatory medical programs should contact the Office of Academic Assistance, 418 General Classroom Building, 404/413-5000. This office serves as a liaison to the Premedical Professions Advisory Committee andmaintains pertinent information such as entrance exam applications and other appropriate materials. 3480 Psychology Programs Offered: Bachelor of Arts in Psychology General Program in Psychology Concentration in Community Psychology Concentration in Pre-Education Bachelor of Science in Psychology General Program in PsychologyConcentration in Community PsychologyConcentration in Pre-Medicine Minor in Psychology Department of Psychology 11th floor, Urban Life Building404/413-6200http://www.gsu.edu/psychologyDavid A. Washburn, ChairLisa Armistead, Associate ChairSarah L. Cook, Director of Undergraduate Studies Psychology is the science of the behavior of humans and animals. The topics of investigation range from the life sciences to the social sciences, and applications occur in clinical, industrial, community, and other social contexts. Psychological knowle dge contributes to the understanding of experience and behavior and to the formation of optimal personal relations. A career in psychology usually requires a graduate degree. An undergraduate major in psychology can serve as a prerequi- site for graduate study in psychology or as background for other careers, e.g., business, law, medical or allied health science s, and teaching. A major in psychology also can serve the general interest of liberal arts education. The department maintainsCollege of Arts and Sciences 257 reference materials, including videotapes and an Internet website to assist in career advisement. Students wishing to be psycho l- ogy majors must first be advised by Academic Assistance of the College of Arts and Sciences and then by the psychology undergraduate adviser. Program Academic Regulations Before taking upper-division courses, students must have completed 60 hours or have the permission of the instructor.All majors must complete the courses in Areas 1, 2, and 3, as specified below. Concentrations have more specific require- ments (for more details see the concentration requirements that are listed after the area requirements). Majors who meet therequirements in Areas 1, 2, and 3 and do not choose to pursue a concentration will graduate in the general program. B.A. DegreeStudents must take a foreign language and six additional hours from courses in Area E. (See \"Foreign Language Requirement for B.A. and B.I.S. Majors,\" previously described.) B.S. DegreeStudents must take nine semester hours from the courses listed below. We strongly recommend a two-course lab sequence in Principles of Biology, Introduction to Chemistry, or Introduction to Physics. Requirements The Department of Psychology offers a general program in psychology plus concentration in specific areas of psychol- ogy. The general program offers the most choice in courses for a degree in psychology. Concentrations have more restrictivecurricula than the general program and are intended to prepare students for a more specific career path. Most students will be in the general program. Students planning graduate school or other advanced training in an area related to one of the concentra-tions should consider applying for admission to that concentration. In addition to the Program Degree Requirements, students must fulfill the College of Arts and Sciences Degree Requirements (see section 3030) and the University Degree Requirements (see section 1400).

As p art of a dynamic urban university in a city of growing international awareness and status, the department is fulfilling its responsibilityto meet the increasing foreign language needs of the governmental, business, and professional communities. The department recognizes that an active command of the foreign language and a thorough exploration of the foreign culture form an essential basis for further study in the various areas of its curriculum. To this end, the department sponsors study-ab road programs in Granada (Spain), and Guadalajara (Mexico). The department maintains a state-of-the-art multimedia Language Acquisition and Resource Center (LARC) with a digital audio laboratory with 50 student computer workstations. The digital lab serves a dual purpose in allowing both independentstudent access to digitized audio files and interactive software that accompanies the language texts, and also in providing amultimedia environment for teacher-led listening, speaking, and recording activities. In addition to the audio lab, the LARC266 College of Arts and Sciences features a tutoring center and resource library, as well as 17 stand-alone computers for student use. To assist in the developm ent of the student's active language skills and to provide added cultural enrichment, the LARC contains a wide range of audiovisual materials, including an extensive collection of videos, CD Roms and DVDs. The department sponsors two Freshman Learning Communities each year. One group is designed for students interested in using their foreign language in international business. The other, sponsored jointly by the Department of Applied Linguistics/ESL, is in Language Studies. For students who hope to teach at the K-12 levels, the department offers Spanish with a concentration that leads to certifica- tion. For students who view language study as a preparation for a career in the business world, the department has two special programs: a concentration in the business language of Spanish, and a practicum in an internationally oriented business or servi ce organization in the metro area for qualified and interested students in their senior year. The department also offers two progr ams in conjunction with other colleges: the Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and MIB Joint Degree Program, in collaboration with theRobinson College of Business, and the Bachelor of Arts Major in International Economics and Modern Languages (IEML), incollaboration with the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies.

This policy is basedon the premise that educators should be part of the evaluation of the students' ability to function adequately and safely inclassrooms and those educators have a right and responsibility to make such judgments prior to placing students in schools.The practicum or student teaching supervisor has the authority to withdraw students from their classroom experience if theirperformance constitutes a detriment to the children in the class. If such removal is necessary, students will be given an F ineach corresponding course. *Tort liability insurance and criminal background check requirement: all students must show proof of tort liability insurance and consent to a criminal background investigation prior to enrollment in KH 3200 Instructional Skills for Health and Physical Education, 9-12 and at the time of application for student teaching (KH 4710 Student Teaching in Health and Physical Education,P-5, and KH 4720 Student Teaching in Health and Physical Education, 6-12).

The curriculum also focuses on the causes of crime and theoretical explanations relating to t he crime problem. The Department's curriculum is designed to provide students with a liberal arts education that focuses upon basi c skills such as the ability to read critically, to write clearly, to speak effectively, and to think analytically. The criminal justice curriculum in this department represents a broad range of study designed to meet the academic needs of both pre-professional students and those already employed in a wide range of agencies that make up the criminal justice and juvenile justice systems. Both the justice system and the causes and consequences of criminal behavior are the focus of this program of study. The juvenile or adult who is accused of conduct that violates the law will be affected by law enforcement, prosecutorial, judicial, andcorrectional agencies. The requirements of degree programs in this department stress an integrated view of the criminal justicesystem. In this view all components of the system interrelate with all other components to provide coordinated justice administ ra- tion. The criminal justice curriculum is designed to give students an understanding of the developing theoretical knowledge bas e in this field of study while simultaneously providing an understanding of how each of the component parts relate to one another . Additionally, students will learn how the justice system influences and is influenced by other institutions in society. Student's learning in the classroom is enhanced as faculty bring forth a myriad of expertise in criminal justice and criminol- ogy. Currently, faculty research topics highlight sex differences in criminality and criminal justice processing; specialty cou rts; public defense systems; community harassment; comparative justice;drugs crime; homicide co-victimization; legal issues in policing; evaluation research; community differences in the nature ofCollege of Health and Human Sciences 301 crime; place-based criminology; private security; domestic terrorism and homeland security; electronic monitoring; informal social control; juvenile delinquency and youth violence; criminological theory; active offender decision-making; and urban drugmarkets and urban violence. Faculty conduct research drawing on their expertise in a variety of quantitative and qualitativeresearch methods, thus allowing them to bring not only their topical expertise, but also their methodological experience, into the learning environment. Degree programs offered through the Department of Criminal Justice include Bachelor of Science in criminal justice and Master of Science in criminal justice. The bachelor's degree program complies with the core curriculum requirements of theUniversity System of Georgia. Program Admission There are no admission requirements specific to the Bachelor of Science degree program in Criminal Justice beyond the admission requirements to the University. A student should complete the lower-division core curriculum requirements prior totaking upper-division courses. To enroll in 3000/4000-level Criminal Justice courses, students must have a 2.00 grade pointaverage at Georgia State University. Program Financial Information No special fees are associated with the Bachelor of Science degree program in Criminal Justice. Students must pay all tuition and fees required by the University. Program Academic Regulations 1. A grade of C or higher is required in CrJu 1100 (or equivalent transfer course) and all 3000/4000-level Criminal Justice courses at Georgia State University (GSU). A grade of C or higher is required in all courses in Areas G-L. 2. A minimum 2.00 cumulative grade point average at GSU is required to register for 3000/4000-level criminal justice courses. There are no exceptions to this policy. 3. A minimum of 45 semester hours (15 courses) must be completed in 3000/4000-level criminal justice courses at Georgia State University. HHS 3000 is included in the 45 hours; CrJu 1100/3100 and CrJu 2200 are not included. 4. The Department of Criminal Justice believes that all students who are in internship experiences (class and field) must be personally and psychologically equipped as well as academically prepared. A student may be denied entry into intern-ship field experience based on departmental prerequisites or the professional judgment of faculty based on observedperformance, behavior, or documentation which indicates erratic, unpredictable, or unsuitable conduct. This policy isbased on the premise that criminal justice faculty should be part of the evaluation of a student's ability to functionadequately and safely in a criminal justice setting and that faculty has a right and responsibility to make such judgmentsprior to placing a student in an internship. The internship coordinator has the authority to withdraw a student from aclassroom and/or field experience (i.e., CrJu 4930, CrJu 4940) if the student's performance constitutes a detriment to thestudents in the class and/or to personnel at the field internship site. If such removal is necessary, the student will begiven an F for the course(s). 5. All completed applications and contracts must be turned in to the Department of Criminal Justice by the following dates in order to be considered for an internship that particular semester. There will be no exceptions . January 15 for summer semester; March 15 for fall semester; September 15 for spring semester. 6. Please note that all criminal justice majors must complete an internship during their final semester in the program. Some students will select placement with an agency that deals with sensitive information. As a result, a background checkmight be a requirement for placement. Background checks include prior arrests and convictions, abuse of illegal drugs,and DUI convictions. If students have a criminal record either before they declare their major or acquire a criminal recordafter declaring their major, they might be prohibited from participating in the internship. Since the internship is arequirement, they might be excluded from the degree program. 7. The Department has two options from which students must choose: the Crime and Justice Track or the Legal Track. The Crime and Justice Track includes the traditional curriculum for criminal justice majors. The Legal Track is designedfor criminal justice majors who are interested in an intensive exposure to law in preparation for law school. Studentswho fail to choose a track will automatically be placed in the Crime and Justice Track.

Goodfellow, School Director and Division HeadCindy D. Powell, Medical Director Respiratory therapy is a health care profession dedicated to the support and management of individuals with abnormalities or deficiencies of the cardiopulmonary system. The respiratory therapist is an expert in therapeutic and diagnostic modalities associated with the pulmonary system, as well as the heart. He or she must have a working knowledge of chemistry, microbiology,and physiology as well as respiratory therapy . This background affords the therapist the ability to become proficient in workin g with respiratory life support systems. Under the guidance and supervision of a physician, the therapist treats by employingacademic knowledge and technical skill for direct patient care. For a dedicated man or woman who finds a service field rewardin g, respiratory therapy offers a career opportunity as a vital member of the health care team that is both personally and financial ly rewarding. The Division of Respiratory Therapy offers a program that leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The program provides classroom study with observation, clinical experience, independent study, and seminars. The Georgia State University respirator y therapy program is fully accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CARC) in collaboration with thecommittee on Accreditation of Allied Health Programs (CAAHEP). The program provides classroom study, laboratory study andCollege of Health and Human Sciences 311 observation, clinical experience, computer-assisted instruction and simulation, seminars, and independent study. Classes generally meet on a daily basis from approximately 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Clinical courses in area hospitals (clinical affiliates) meet from 6:45 AM to 3:15 PM. The overall purpose of the Division of Respiratory Therapy is to provide a quality education that is relevant and profession- ally sound to meet the respiratory therapy needs of the health care community. Inherent to this purpose is the goal to preparerespiratory therapy practitioners who can demonstrate the attitudes, skills, and knowledge required to meet the changing needsof the community. It will be necessary for the respiratory therapist to cooperate with all members of the health care team inidentifying and solving the problems related to respiratory diseases and disorders of the cardiopulmonary system. The respira-tory therapist must be able to think critically, communicate effectively, demonstrate good judgment, and provide self-direction. Itis a primary objective of the respiratory therapy program to educate well-qualified, competent respiratory therapists who demon - strate leadership ability. The baccalaureate degree program in respiratory therapy seeks to establish an atmosphere in which the student achieves respect for the dignity and worth of the individual, the capacity for critical thinking, a genuine desire for knowledge, and th e realization of his or her own potential. Graduates of the baccalaureate program are qualified to enter the Registry ExaminationSystem of the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC). Program Admission Admission to the Division of Respiratory Therapy is limited. In addition to meeting the general admission requirements of the university, the applicant must meet the specific admission requirements and regulations of the Division of RespiratoryTherapy. Acceptance into the program is based competitively on the factors of demonstrated academic ability, consistency ofperformance, personal qualifications, including motivation and interpersonal abilities. International applicants whose native language is not English, regardless of language of instruction, must submit acceptable results from the Georgia State Test of English Proficiency (GSTEP). Because of the communication demands in the profession ofrespiratory therapy, both with patients and staff members, and the critical nature of clinical care, adequate verbal and writte n comprehension of English is necessary. Individuals who desire to pursue respiratory therapy as a profession and show academic ability may apply for admission. Enrollment in the Division of Respiratory Therapy is limited and, therefore, early application is advisable. The applicationdeadline is July 1 preceding the fall semester in which admission is desired. The Office of Admissions evaluates the credential s of students transferring from other colleges and universities. Acceptance into the university does not ensure admission into therespiratory therapy program. Students taking the prerequisite courses in colleges or universities other than Georgia State University should take equiva- lent course work. Students are admitted into the professional courses in the fall of the junior year. A minimum grade point average of 2.50 is required. Higher GPAs receive preference for admission. A.S. to B.S. Bridge Program The Division of Respiratory Therapy has a comprehensive advanced standing policy. Students who are graduates of CoARC-approved A.S. degree programs and are Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRT) may apply for advanced standing tothe B.S. degree program. The department utilizes the following mechanisms to assess the awarding of credit in advancedstanding: transfer credit and credit for professional credentials. The department maintains a philosophy of educational flexib ility to meet the needs of the profession. An Integrated B.S. to M.S. degree is an option to those who have a bachelor's degree in another field and wish to enter the respiratory therapy profession. See the Graduate Catalog for details. Program Financial Information During the junior year, students can expect to pay approximately $750 for uniforms, stethoscopes, student liability insurance, and books. In the senior year, expenses are estimated at approximately $1200. This includes books and expenses related toNBRC self-assessment and credentialing exams. Program Academic Regulations A minimum grade of C is required in all major, major-field-related, and mathematics and natural sciences courses for gradua- tion. If a student's progress is interrupted at any point in the program through withdrawal or unsatisfactory performance, thestudent will no longer be in the program. If an individual applies to reenter the program, consideration will be given on the samebasis as any new applicant. Curriculum changes are made whenever necessary to keep the learning experiences up to date andrelevant in this rapidly changing technological field. Students will be expected to subscribe to these changes whenever they a re necessary.312 College of Health and Human Sciences Students are expected to provide their own transportation to clinical training sites. Students are expected to comply with the policies and regulations of the division regarding absences, tardiness, standards of performance, conduct, dress code for the clinical areas, and other regulations as specified. A copy of these policies and regulations may be obtained from the division and will be given to all entering students. Although respiratory therapy courses are intended to be taken by students majoring in the Division of Respiratory Therapy, selected courses may be taken by non-majors with written permission of the instructor of each course and the division head. Allprofessional courses involving a component of clinical training are open only to professional program majors.

Social work education is based upon a specific body of knowledge, values, and professional skills, and is grounded in the profession's history and philosophy. Education for the profession promotes the development and advancement of knowledge,practice skills, and services that further the well being of people and promote social and economic justice. Social work educat ion is responsible for the production and application of research and scholarship aimed at advancing social work practice. (\"Curric u- lum Policy Statement for Baccalaureate Degree Programs in Social Work Education,\" Council on Social Work Education, Hand- book of Accreditation Standards and Procedures, 4th Edition, p. 96.) The School of Social Work offers a Bachelor of Social Work degree (BSW) through an educational program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). Both the academic content of the program and its administrative procedures areconsistent with the accreditation standards of CSWE. The social work curriculum represents a highly developed plan of profes-sional education that consistently emphasizes the interface between theory and practice. The curriculum for the BSW degreemay be viewed in two major sections. The lower division (60 semester hours), a liberal arts foundation, reflects those contentareas which meet the standards prescribed by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and by the College ofHealth and Human Sciences. The upper division courses (60 semester hours) have been developed to meet the guidelines forbaccalaureate social work education as prescribed by CSWE, particularly as those courses can maximize appropriate knowledgeand skills for entry-level, generalist social work practice. The goal of the School of Social Work is to prepare students for competent and ethically responsible generalist social work practice. Specific objectives of the school are: (1) to enable students to demonstrate appropriate knowledge, skills, and valu es necessary for the beginning level of professional generalist social work practice with individuals, families, groups, organizat ions, and communities in an urban setting; and (2) to prepare academically qualified students for graduate social work. Successfulcompletion of this program may lead to advanced standing in many accredited graduate programs of social work. Program Admission The requirements and procedures for admission to Georgia State University are summarized in the university section of this General Catalog. That application process permits a potential student to indicate the college in which the individual wishes toregister upon acceptance and to indicate the intended major. Based upon that application, an individual may be accepted by theuniversity and by the College of Health and Human Sciences. Entering students who wish to major in social work begin theiraffiliation with the School of Social Work in a Pre-Social Work (PSW) status. A later, separate application and decision proces s is required before a student can be formally accepted into the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) status. The priority applicationdeadline is June 15 prior to the junior year. However, applications will be accepted after that date. Pre-Social Work (PSW) Student All students admitted to the School of Social Work begin as Pre-Social Work (PSW) students and change their status only after the student has made formal application and formal admission has been granted. PSW status is assigned to students whohave not completed all lower-division courses in Areas A-F or have not met GPA eligibility requirements. To complete these area s, PSW students must register only for the lower-division courses specified in their advisement files. Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) Student For a student to be considered for BSW status, the student must:1. Be in good standing at Georgia State University with a minimum institutional GPA of 2.0.2. File a formal application in the school for BSW status.3. Have grades of C or higher in English 1101 and 1102.4. Have successfully completed Areas A through F (except SW 2000).5. Have a minimum grade point average of 2.5 or better in the lower-division courses counted for completion of Areas A-F and a minimum grade of C or higher in SW 2000, if completed. BSW status indicates that a student has demonstrated commitment to professional social work and has been recognized by the school as being ready to utilize that commitment in the demanding preparation for practice in this field. A student with BS W status is expected to internalize the values and ethics of social work and to develop and enhance professional practice skills. Inthis process, the BSW student is expected to abide by the academic regulations related to the program as outlined in this catal og and in the school's Student Handbook . Among those academic regulations is the requirement that a student have a grade of C (2.0) or better in each of the social work major courses that are required in Area G. Entry into the BSW program is a selective process on a space availability basis. A student who meets only the minimum GPA or other criteria is not necessarily guaranteed acceptance. Qualified students who are denied entry at one point in time will b e placed on a competitive waiting list in the order of their denial to await possible access to the program at a subsequent time.314 College of Health and Human Sciences Program Financial Information No special fees are associated with the Bachelor of Social Work program. Students must pay all tuition and fees required by the University. Program Academic Regulations Students in the School of Social Work are required to participate in academic advisement. Each entering PSW student is assigned to a professional staff member in the Student Advisement Center or in the college's Office of Academic Assistance who serves as the student's academic adviser. PSW students should meet with that assigned academic adviser prior to registering forany courses, and those advisement appointments are available during any semester. When the student achieves BSW status,the student will be reassigned to the director of the BSW program for initial program advisement. Before the end of the junioryear, the student will be assigned to a social work faculty adviser. The student is expected to meet with that assigned academi c adviser at least once each academic semester for the purpose of beginning or enhancing acculturation to the field of social wor k, as well as for sequencing course selections in accordance with school procedures. BSW advisement appointments are sched-uled only during the fall and spring semesters, so students are expected to plan accordingly. In an emergency situation, thestudent (PSW or BSW) may discuss advisement needs with the BSW program director. Course sequencing in the BSW program begins only in the fall semester, and a student is admitted to BSW status in accor- dance with that schedule. PSW and BSW students are expected to follow the written course advisement plan developed in theadvisement process, both in terms of course selections and in the sequencing of those courses. Deviations from the advisementplan without the written authorization of the assigned academic adviser or the BSW program director may result in the school'sblocking future registrations that do not conform to the advisement plan or may result in an extension of their course of study . In addition to the review and possible withdrawal of a student from the program, as described in \"Review of Academic and Profes-sional Practice Demands,\" a student who misses or fails a course but is permitted by the school to continue in the program mustwork closely with the assigned academic adviser and the BSW program director to determine the most appropriate point at whichto continue degree-related course work. If a student in BSW status is inactive for two academic semesters, the student will bereturned to PSW status and must file a new, competitive application to reenter the BSW status. Field Education Field education is an integral component of the BSW curriculum and involves the placement of social work students in educationally supervised agency settings. The primary purpose of field education is to enable students to integrate social wor k theory and practice through the direct application of social work knowledge, values, and skills. Field education provides oppor tu- nities to test and refine classroom learning in professional social work settings. BSW students must have a minimum of 400supervised hours of field education over a period of two consecutive semesters. Students are required to attend a classroom-setting field integrative seminar as part of their field education. The purpose of the integrative seminar is to provide field educa- tion students a forum for the synthesizing of classroom learning with their field-based internship. Students may apply for field education only after lower-division and prescribed social work courses and other requirements have been satisfactorily completed, as explained in the school's Student Handbook . Students enroll in field education for the fall- spring semesters. Field education applications must be turned in to the Director of Field Education by February 15 for thefollowing fall semester placement. Grant\u2014Child Welfare The School of Social Work, in partnership with the Georgia Department of Human Resources, has scholarships available under the Title IV E, Child Welfare Training. The scholarship includes tuition and fees, books, and mileage. Recipients must ta ke specific child welfare electives and must complete a field placement in a public child welfare setting. Upon graduation, recipi ents must commit to work for the Division of Family and Children Services on a year-for-year basis. School of Social Work Policies and Procedures Georgia State University is an equal educational opportunity institution. Faculty, staff, and students are admitted, employed, and treated without regard to race, sex, color, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. Georgia Stat e Univer- sity complies with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil R ights Act of 1991, Sections 503/504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the American with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam EraVeterans Readjustment Assistance Act, as well as other applicable federal and state laws. Students should refer to the current Undergraduate Catalog to ensure compliance with university policies and procedures. Codes of Ethics All students admitted into the B.S.W. program are expected to read, understand, and follow the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics . Each student who is admitted into the program is given a copy of the current code ofCollege of Health and Human Sciences 315 ethics. This code provides a set of values, principles, and standards to guide conduct and decision making when interacting wit h clients and colleagues and for when critical issues arise. A copy can also be found at the NASW website (www.naswdc.org) Review of Academic and Professional Standards - The Policy Students admitted into the School of Social Work will be held by the academic standards set by the University and the College of Health and Human Sciences. Students will be held to the professional standards set by the school and the National Association of Social Workers. Students should familiarize themselves with these requirements as found in the undergraduateand graduate catalogs for the university and the College of Health and Human Sciences. A. Academic Competence Undergraduate students are required to maintain at least a grade of C (2.00) or better in each of the social work majorcourses in Area G, and be in academic good standing with the University (an institutional GPA of 2.00). In cases where astudent has a grade of D or F in an Area G course, the student must meet with the BSW Director and another facultymember of the BSW Committee to determine whether the student is eligible to continue in the program. If the student isallowed to continue in the program, he or she must retake the course and receive a grade of C or higher. Due to coursesequencing, graduation date may be postponed in this situation. Undergraduates must also complete a minimum of 400hours of field placement. B.Professional CompetenceGeorgia State University's School of Social Work has the goal of educating competent social work practitioners. If astudent fails to meet the standards set by the National Association of Social Workers and/or the School of Social Work,corrective action may be taken. Corrective action is intended to provide students and faculty with the opportunity toopenly discuss problems and issues identified, and to seek a solution to correct the situation or problem presented.Dismissal from the program is an option and may supercede any discussion of corrective action. Professional incompe-tence signifies that a student is not adequately or appropriately performing at his or her program level. Failure to comply with the policies and procedures of Georgia State University and/or the College of Health and Human Sciences and/or the School of Social Work may result in a student's dismissal from the program.

Students in their first semester at Georgia State are not affected by this regulation for that semester only.4. Having only 3000/4000-level RCB courses remaining for degree credit is not justification for an exception to this regula- tion. The college encourages students to put forth their maximum effort throughout their academic career at GeorgiaState if they wish to avoid the time and expense involved in taking courses that do not count for degree credit. Whenthis situation occurs, however, it is the college's position that students can always benefit from any course takenregardless of whether the course is part of the students' program of study. 7020.50 Course Sequencing Requirements Students are expected to proceed through the B.B.A. program in proper sequence to receive maximum benefit from their studies. Courses that are intended for the freshman through senior years are indicated by the course numbering system (1000 lev el through 4000 level, respectively). The lower-level courses taken in the freshman and sophomore years provide a foundation ofgeneral education on which the junior and senior years are based. Sequencing requirements for all students and specifically for B.B.A. students follow. Students who violate any of the course sequencing requirements are subject to disenrollment by the college regardless of performance or time lapse and will be allowed a tuition refund in accordance with the university's refund schedule. 7020.60 Sequencing for All Students Enrolled in RCB Courses Students may not register for any 3000/4000-level course taught by the Robinson College of Business until they have earned at least 45 semester hours of college-level credit. 7020.70 Sequencing for B.B.A. Students B.B.A. students may not register for a course in the junior-year business completed with degree credit. 7020.80 Business Residence Requirement At least 50 percent of the business credit hours required for the B.B.A. degree must be taken in residence at Georgia State University. This regulation is a requirement of the college's accrediting body. These are the courses in the B.B.A. program tha t are BusA4980, courses in the hours, depending on the major chosen), RCB electives (9-12 hours). 7020.90 Core Curriculum As stated in the \"Core Curriculum\" section (1410) of the \"University Degree Requirements and Graduation\" section of this catalog, the university complies with the requirements of the core curriculum of the University System of Georgia. The 60 semes ter hours of course work for the freshman and sophomore years of the B.B.A. program are designed to conform to that core. Transfer students from institutions in the University System of Georgia who followed the core curriculum at their previous institution and earned sufficient grades in courses listed in areas A through E of the core curriculum will be granted transfer creditfor those relevant courses. This may mean that credit will be granted for courses that differ from those which would be taken a t Georgia State University, as shown in the curriculum listed below. Transfer credit will be given in Core Area F of the B.B.A. program for students who were following the business transfer program at a two-year college or the business curriculum for a bachelor's degree at a four-year college or university in theUniversity System of Georgia. If a portion of a core area has been completed, then transfer credit for the corresponding portion at Georgia State will be granted. 7030 B.B.A. Degree Requirements Areas A through E of the undergraduate core curriculum make up the first 42 semester hours of the freshman and sophomore years of the Bachelor of Business Administration degree program. These requirements are listed in the \"University DegreeRequirements and Graduation\" chapter of this catalog as part of the description of the university's core curriculum. Courses in the core curriculum that are recommended by the Robinson College of Business faculty are given in that description. TheseJ. Mack Robinson College of Business 321 suggestions reflect choices that will be particularly helpful in providing B.B.A. students with a strong foundation for Core Ar ea F and the junior and senior years of the program. The hours and course requirements for Core Area F, Business Foundation, and the junior and senior years are listed in this chapter. Please note the following information: Refer to the \"Business Residence Requirement\" section, listed previously in this chapter, for information on the business credit hours that must be completed in residence at Georgia State University. Students must have completed no fewer than 45 semester hours of college-level course work before taking 3000/4000-level courses in the Robinson College. Refer to the heading \"Sequencing for All Students Enrolled in RCB Courses,\" listed previously in this chapter.

Mack Robinson College of Business The following majors require 21 semester hours in this portion of the curriculum: AccountingActuarial ScienceComputer Information SystemsEconomicsHospitality AdministrationManagerial SciencesMarketingReal EstateRisk Management and Insurance Courses for each major should be selected after reviewing the appropriate school or department descriptions for each major that follow and, if needed, after consultation with a faculty adviser in the school or department that offers the major. The ca talog describes each major and, if applicable, lists possible areas of specialization within the major. The required courses in each major, if any, are also listed in the school or department descriptions. The college reserves the right to amend this list of majors at the end of any semester. Junior/Senior RCB Electives. (Minimum of grade of C- or higher is required in each course.) Major requiring six semester hours of RCB electives: Actuarial Science. AS 4120 must be one of the RCB electives for actuarial science majors. Major requiring nine semester hours of RCB electives: Accounting, **** Computer Information Systems, Economics, Finance,*** Hospitality Administration, Managerial Sciences, Marketing, Real Estate, Risk Management and Insurance. These electives must be selected from 3000/4000-level courses in the Robinson College of Business that are outside the student's major and are not cross-listed with courses in the student's major. Majors other than economics may also select from the 3000/4000-level courses in the Department of Economics in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. Refer to the online course listing at http://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/webforstudent.htm to determine the Georgia State college that teaches a course. Do not refer only to the course title. For example, course titles with the words \"business,\" \"management,\" or\"administration\" in them are not necessarily RCB courses. A cross-listed course is indicated by the parenthetical statement \"Same as . . .\" after the title in the course descriptions. Junior/Senior Electives Outside RCB. These electives must be selected from the 3000/4000-level courses taught by Georgia State colleges other than the Robinson College of Business. These electives enable the B.B.A. program to meet the breath requirement of the college's accrediting body and cannot be taken in the Robinson College. Economics majors may not choose anyeconomics courses for these electives. Exceptions to the requirement that and 2420 may be taken to satisfy all or part of the non-RCB elective requirement if the student will still have a minimum of 39 upper-le vel semester hours to complete at Georgia S tate. This provision ensures that the student will meet the university's academic reside nce requirement. For the following two specific majors, these required 2000-level mathematics courses may be used to satisfy part of the non- RCB elective requirement: Actuarial Science: Mathematics 2211, Mathematics 2212, and Mathematics 2215 (grade of C- or higher required in Math 2215). These courses carry four semester hours of credit each. If the student's mathematics background permits beginning this calculussequence in Core Area A or D (in place of college algebra and/or precalculus), three-semester-hour courses that meet therequirements for non-RCB electives will replace Mathematics 2211 and/or Mathematics 2212. Thus, this portion of the curriculumcan range from 10 to 12 semester hours. Business Policy. (Minimum of grade of C- or higher is required in this course.) BusA 4980 Strategic Management Policy * Students who transfer from other institutions in the University System of Georgia and have taken other approved courses in the Core Area F for business will take CIS 2010 and/or BusA 2106, as appropriate, in the Junior/Senior RCB electives section. ** Majors in actuarial science take AS 4130, Mathematical Theory of Statistics II.*** Finance majors must take Acct 4210 as one of the RCB electives. The finance major requires an additional three semester hours that are either an RCB elective or a 4000-level finance course.J.

Mack Robinson College of Business 7120 Department of Economics Programs Offered: B.B.A. in Business Economics floor, AYSPS Building 404/413-0141 Susan Laury,, ChairCourse Prefix: Econ The Department of Economics is part of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. For economics faculty listing, see the Department of Economics heading in the \"Andrew Young School of Policy Studies\" chapter of this catalog. Economics examines the material prosperity of countries and their citizens in an interdependent world of limited resources and technological change. In doing so, it studies how decisions are made by private businesses, governments, and households in producing, consuming, and distributing goods. In general, economics is concerned with how society can obtain the greatestoutput from its limited resources.

Downs, Campus Representative The certificate in European Union Studies is operated under the supervision of the European Council of the University System of Georgia. The program is open to all institutions and students of the University System as well as to professionals wi th an undergraduate degree. The program's purpose is to promote knowledge of the European Union (EU) and certify individuals as competent in the subject area of EU studies. Since the EU is the most important economic and political partner of the UnitedStates, this certification demonstrates valuable professional expertise to potential employers. For students in the academic tr ack, this interdisciplinary certificate can be earned as a supplement to any conventional undergraduate degree. Admission to the Program A certificate in European Union Studies can be earned in one of two ways. Under the academic track , a certificate is taken in tandem with an undergraduate degree program. Students from all academic majors are eligible to participate so long as theypossess a minimum 2.75 cumulative grade point average (GPA). Under the professional track , non-degree seeking students\u2014 such as business executives\u2014are eligible to enroll in the program upon proof of a valid undergraduate degree from an accreditedinstitution. The minimum GPA requirement is waived. Under either track, an application to the program cannot be made until successful completion of the following: (1) the introductory course on the European Union (PolS 4242) with a grade of \"C\" or better, (2) 30 semester hours of academic credit,and (3) a course in world or western civilization (Hist 1111 or 1112). The European Union Studies Certificate To earn the EU Studies Certificate, students must complete the certificate curriculum (18 hours) and fulfill the practicum experience requirement. Students must have a 3.0 cumulative GPA in curriculum courses upon completion of the program. Anofficial certificate is awarded upon graduation, and the certificate is noted on a student's permanent transcripts. The EU Studies Certificate Curriculum (18): The European Union (PolS 4242) (3) Multidisciplinary Menu (12)A student must complete four courses from an approved menu of courses dealing substantially with the EU. These courses must be distributed among at least three different discipline areas: Social Sciences, Humanities and Fine Arts, Business andEconomics, and Natural and Health Sciences. The program's campus representative decides which courses qualify for thecertificate and maintains an updated list of approved courses in the different discipline areas. No more than one course in thi s menu can be taken at the 1000-2000 level, with the exception of EU Studies online courses (see below) and study abroad courses.Students may substitute for up to two menu courses by performing an internship and/or composing a thesis.Additional University Programs 343 Capstone Seminar in EU Studies (3) Taken either as a Directed Study (PolS 4920) or online course, this is ideally the last course in the certificate program. It h as three learning objectives: (1) to update students on EU developments and reinforce their general knowledge of the EU, (2) toprovide in-depth knowledge of important EU issues, and(3) to allow students to conduct intensive research on EU-related topics. Practicum Experience Since it is deemed crucial that students demonstrate more than an academic knowledge of the European Union to be certified as adequately prepared in the subject, a \"real-life\" practicum experience pertaining to the EU must be performed either in the form of an overseas visit or an internship. The overseas option is broadly defined and can be accommodated by a wide range ofactivities, including study or research abroad. The same flexibility applies to the internship, which can be served domestically orinternationally. A student's specific practicum experience must be approved by the program's campus representative. Online Courses and Transatlantic Joint Certificate The EU Studies program has developed a curriculum of online courses in conjunction with European university partners. These are courses in different discipline areas that deal with various aspects of the EU and are taught jointly by UniversitySystem institutions and European universities at specified times throughout the academic year. The program's campus represen-tative maintains an updated list of these courses and a teaching schedule, as well as information about course registration. The EU Studies program offers the option of acquiring a certificate that is jointly conferred with a European institution. This option requires students to complete\u2014with a grade of \"B\" or better\u2014a minimum of two online courses that are co-taught withEuropean partner universities. Students completing this option have the EU Studies certificate awarded by both their homeinstitution and one in Europe, thus giving them an academic credential from a respected European university. Areas of Distinction In addition to acknowledging competence in the EU generally, the certificate also highlights special achievements by providing a notation of \"distinction\" in two areas: (1) foreign language proficiency (six semester hours at or above the 2000 l evel and (2) composition of a thesis. The foreign language distinction must be earned in a European language approved by the program's campus representative as appropriate to the certificate's objectives. A student with prior language skills can earn a distinction by successful compl etion of an examination demonstrating competency equivalent to the 2000 level. The exam is administered at the student's homeinstitution. The thesis can be written anytime during the final year of study. It is supervised by a committee composed of three faculty members representing at least two different academic disciplines. The program's campus representative maintains a more detaileddescription of thesis requirements. 8030 Intensive English Program 1026 Urban Life 404/413-5200http://www.gsu.edu/esl The Intensive English Program (IEP) is a non-credit program designed to prepare students in the language and study skills necessary for successful academic work in American colleges and universities.

These 35 public institutions are located throughout the state. A 18-member constitutional Board of Regents governs the University System, which has been in operation since 1931. Appointments of board members, five from the state-at-large and one from each of the state's thirteen congressional districts, are made by the governor and are subject to confirmation by the State Senate. Regular terms of board members are seven years. The chairperson, vice chairperson, and other officers of the Board of Regents are elected by the members of the board. The chancellor, who is not a member of the board, is the chief executive officer of the board and the chief administrative officer of theUniversity System. The overall programs and services of the University System are offered through three major components: instruction, public service and continuing education, and research. Instruction consists of programs of study leading toward degrees, ranging from the associate (two-year) level to the doctoral level, and certificates. Standards for admission of students to instructional programs at each institution are determined by the institution pursuant to policies of the Board of Regents. The board establishes minimum standards and leaves to each institution the prerogative toestablish higher standards. Applications for admission should be addressed to the institutions. Public service and continuing education consist of non-degree activities, primarily, and special types of college degree credit courses. The non-degree activities include short courses, seminars, conferences, and consultative and advisory services in manyareas of interest. Typical college degree credit courses are those offered through extension center programs and teacher educa-tion consortiums. Research encompasses scholarly investigations conducted for discovery and application of knowledge. Most of the research is conducted through the universities; however, some of it is conducted through several of the senior colleges. Theresearch investigations cover matters related to the educational objectives of the institutions and to general social needs. The policies of the Board of Regents provide a high degree of autonomy for each institution. The executive head of each institution is the president, whose election is recommended by the chancellor and approved by the board.
