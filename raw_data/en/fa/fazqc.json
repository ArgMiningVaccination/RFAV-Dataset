Page 5 By Hanae Armitage New evidence from a study at the School of Medicine might dismay those who have chosen sides in the low-fat ver- sus low-carb diet debate. Neither option is superior: Cutting ei- ther carbs or fats shaves off excess weight in about the same proportion, according to the study. What's more, the study in- quired whether insulin levels or a specific genotype pattern could predict an indi- vidual's success on either diet. The an- swer, in both cases, By Krista Conger Induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, are a keystone of regenerative medicine. Outside the body, they can be coaxed to become many different types of cells and tissues that can help repair damage due to trauma or disease. Now, a study in mice from the School of Medi- cine suggests another use for iPS cells: training the immune system to attack or even prevent tumors. The results suggest it may one day be possible to vaccinate an individual with his or her own iPS cells to protect against the development of many types of cancer. The iPS cells work as an anti-cancer vaccine be- cause, like many cancer cells, they resemble develop- mentally immature progenitor cells, which are free from the growth restric- tions built into mature cells that make up the body's tissues. Injecting iPS cells that ge- netically match the recipient, but that are unable to repli-cate, can safely expose the immune sys-tem to a variety of cancer-specific targets, the researchers found. \"We've learned that iPS cells are very similar on their surface to tumor cells,\" said Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, director of Stanford's Cardiovascular Institute and professor of cardiovascular medicine and of radiology. \"When we immunized an animal with genetically matching iPS cells, the immune system could be primed to reject the development of tu- mors in the future. Pending replication in humans, our findings indicate these cells may one day serve as a true patient- specific cancer vaccine.\" Wu is the senior author of the study, which was published online Feb. 15 in Cell Stem Cell. Former postdoctoral scholar Nigel Kooreman, MD, is the lead author. \"These cells, as a component of our proposed vaccine, have strong immuno- genic properties that provoke a system- wide, cancer-specific immune response,\" said Kooreman, who is now a surgery resident in the By Bruce Goldman On a wall-mounted shelf in the office of David Schneider sit two-dozen or more empty Diet Coke bottles of varying shapes and sizes. They're emblazoned with various languages, testifying to all the places he's downed one of the beverages. He's not a cof- fee drinker. There's also a nice bug collection displayed on the wall. Schneider, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology at the School of Medicine, has been col- lecting bugs since his childhood in Ottawa, Ontario. \"I've always loved biology,\" he said. When he was in 12th grade, he won first place in an international sci-ence contest, besting the future founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos. And you can't help but notice, atop a packed book - case, an assortment of odd little wooden contraptions. They're kinetic sculptures that Schneider built to repre- sent data that would otherwise be hard to comprehend. \"David's office is a unique environment that really reflects how unique he is,\" said Denise Monack, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology, whose lab is adjacent to his. \"He's extraordinarily creative.\" If Schneider's office seems a bit busy, so is he. As chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immu-nology, he oversees a complex of 150 people. He also teaches and does a lot of research. And his research generates lots of data, which is where the contraptions come in: Sometimes it makes more sense for him to plot that data in more than two dimensions. He calls his creations data sculptures. Circular reasoning Schneider focuses on infectious diseases and their ef- fects on infected hosts. Getting sick and recovering are two different sides of a circular journey, he said. \"The path you take back to health isn't the path you take getting sick,\" he said. \"It's a loop.\" The precise sci- entific term for this kind of loop is \"hysteresis.\" Not that the loop necessarily has to be represented as a circle. It could be depicted, for example, as a base- ball diamond. When you first get infected, you're stand- ing at home plate \u2014 analogous to your initial state of good health. Then the pitch comes \u2014 that is, you get infected by who knows what \u2014 and you, the infected host, respond in one of various ways, depending on the pathogen and on your initial condition: You swing and hit the ball to left field, you bunt or the umpire calls, \"Ball four!\" In any case, you're on your way to first base. At this stage, the pathogen load is increasing, and your immune system is kicking in and making you feel worse. By the time you reach second, you're at your maximum point of sickness. Recovery is analogous to scoring a run, having rounded all those bases. However, you can't score, or return to full-blown health, by going in reverse from second base back to first and then home. Very differ- ent things are happening in your body when you're ap-proaching or standing on third base as opposed to first base. And though, from the stands, those two bases may appear juxtaposed, it would be a mistake to think first base and third base are equivalent. The internal states of the players standing on those bases are quite differ- ent. You might want to give the third-base patient an entirely different set of medications from those suitable for a first-base patient. Maybe you should give one anti- microbials and rehydrate the other. Take malaria. When infected humans or mice are at their sickest, they're already well on their way to elimi- nating the microbes that cause the disease. \"Malaria infects somewhere over 200 million people Data explained with sculptures and gizmos See DIET , page 7 IPS cells probed as potential cancer vaccineLow-fat or low-carb?

It's called mental rehearsal, and psychologists and athletes alike know that it works. Now, Stanford researchers report that they've discovered how the brain learns physical tasks, even in the absence of real-world movement, and found that this ability could hinge on getting the mind to the right starting place, ready to perfectly execute everything that follows. \"Mental rehearsal is tantalizing, but difficult to study,\" said Saurabh Vyas, a graduate student in bioengineering. That's because there's no easy way to peer into a person's brain as he imagines himself racing to a win or practicing a performance. \"This is where we thought brain-machine interfaces could be that lens, because they give you the ability to see what the brain is doing even when they're not actually moving,\" he said. A paper describing the research was published Feb. 15 in Neuron. Vyas is the lead author. The senior author is Krishna Shenoy, PhD, professor of electrical engi- neering and the Hong Seh and Vivian W. M. Lim Professor. Although there are some important caveats, the results could point the way toward a deeper understanding of what mental rehearsal is and, the researchers believe, to a future in which brain-ma- chine interfaces, usually thought of as prosthetics for people with paralysis, are also tools for understanding the brain, Shenoy said. What are you thinking? The idea for the study came while thinking about how people learn to use brain-machine interfaces to perform a task, Vyas said. In a typical setup, a person \u2014 or, very often, a monkey \u2014 has to learn to move a cursor around a computer screen using only patterns of activity in his or her brain, not by us- ing hands or other movements. That got Vyas wondering whether what people (or monkeys) learned using brain-machine interfaces might somehow transfer, in a way similar to mental rehearsal, to physi- cal movements. \"He's just sitting there thinking, and as he's thinking he's getting better and better\" at moving the cursor, Vyas said, referring to one of the monkeys he stud-ied. \"The natural question becomes: What happens if you switch to another context, where now he actually has to generate muscle activity? Do you see the effects of that learning in that new context?\" The short answer is yes: Mental learning does transfer to physical per- formance. Vyas initially taught two monkeys outfitted with brain-machine interfaces to move a cursor from one place to another on a computer screen using only their minds, then introduced a complication, called a visuomotor ro- tation: What mental signals they previ- ously used to move a cursor up would now move it at an angle of, say, 45 de- grees clockwise. The monkeys easily adapted, and that adaptation carried over when they repeated the same task using their hands, rather than the brain- machine interface, to control the cursor directly. Now, if the monkeys wanted to move the cursor up, they moved their hands 45 degrees clockwise. This suggested that the monkeys were doing something like mental rehearsal, Vyas said; what they had learned to do in their minds, they could then do with their hands. Some additional experi- ments and an analysis of recorded neural activity suggest the reason why: Rehears- ing the task INSIDESTANFORDMEDICINEInside Stanford Medicine is published monthly in July and December and semi-monthly the rest of the year.

In contrast, inactivating these cells, known to neuroscientists as mossy cells, fa- cilitates the spread throughout the brain of the electrical hyperactivity initially localized at a seizure's onset, causing the full-blown behavioral symptoms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Inactivating this nerve-cell population also induces the same cognitive losses that characterize chronic, drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy in humans, the scientists found. Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide, with 150,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone. Three out of five of those affected suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy. Progressive loss of mossy cells is a hallmark of this disorder. Mossy cells are known to be damaged easily as a re- sult of head trauma and decreased blood supply. Such brain injuries, in turn, increase the risk for temporal lobe epilepsy. The role of mossy cells in epilepsy has perplexed neuroscientists for a couple of decades. The new Stan- ford study, which was published Feb. 16 in Science, of- fers an explanation. And it points to an entirely new entry point for developing drugs that could bring therapeutic relief to people with chronic, drug-resistant epilepsy, a debilitating condition that not only circum- scribes patients' lifestyles and occupational options but predisposes them to depression, anxiety and early death. \"It should, in principle, be possible to develop tar- geted therapies directed at mossy cells to control both seizures and the resulting cognitive deficits,\" said Ivan Soltesz, PhD, professor and vice chair of neurosur- gery and the senior author of the study. \"This would be great, because the 20 or more compounds now ap- proved for treating patients fail 30 to 40 percent of the time.\" The study's lead author is Soltesz's former graduate student Anh Bui, PhD, now a medical student at the University of California-Irvine. An electrical storm in the brain Epileptic seizures are sometimes described as an elec- trical storm in the brain. These storms typically begin at a single spot in the brain, called the focus, where nerve cells \u2014 for reasons that remain unclear \u2014 be-gin repeatedly firing in synchrony. All too often they spread from the focus to widespread areas throughout the brain, a process called generalization. It's this brain- wide hyperactivity that causes the classic behavioral symptoms of epileptic seizures, such as loss of consciousness, convulsions and disordered thinking. The exact location of the epileptic fo- cus in the brain varies from individual to individual. In the great majority of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the focus lies in the hippocampus, a much-studied, sea- horse-shaped midbrain structure that's cru- cial to spatial navigation and to encoding new experiences into long-term memory. Mossy cells, found exclusively in one section of the hippocampus, are few in number, but each connects with tens of thousands of other hippocampal nerve cells. Via these connections, mossy cells can stimulate a multitude of excitatory hippocampal nerve cells, whose output extends to other sections of the hippocampus. But they can also stimulate an opposing class of cells that inhibit these excitatory cells. Whether the net effect of mossy-cell activity is to promote or counter overall output of the excitatory nerve cells has, until now, been an open question. To answer the question, Soltesz, who holds the James R. Doty Professorship of Neurosurgery and Neu- rosciences, and his colleagues turned to a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.The mice the Stanford investigators used were bio- engineered so that their mossy cells responded to pulses of light, conveyed to those cells via an implanted op- tical fiber. Blue light caused mossy cells to fire, while amber light caused them to resist firing. So, by flipping a laser switch, the scientists could activate or inhibit the mice's mossy cells at will. (This increasingly widespread experimental technique, called optogenetics, is note-worthy for its capacity to target specific sets of nerve cells in order to reveal their function.) The scientists also recorded activity in the hippocampal region where mossy cells reside. Effects of inhibiting, exciting mossy cells Soltesz, Bui and their colleagues showed that inhib - iting mossy cells, while not increasing the frequency of spontaneous episodes of hyperactivity in the focus of the chronically epileptic mice, did lead to a substantial increase in the number of seizures that spread from the focus to larger areas of the brain. Conversely, excitation of mossy cells in these mice diminished the number of generalized, outwardly visible seizures while having no effect, or merely a minor one, on the frequency of purely focal seizures. In a memory test that gauges a mouse's recognition of unfamiliar objects, the epileptic mice, despite having lost more than half of their mossy cells, did fine. But they failed another test that assesses their ability to no- tice when a familiar object has been moved \u2014 a gauge of spatial memory, which suffers a decline in chronic temporal-lobe epilepsy. When the Stanford scientists also subjected optogenetically engineered but otherwise normal mice to these tests, they did great \u2014 until the researchers inhibited their mossy cells, at which point these animals' spatial recall headed south, too. \"We've shown that mossy cells' role is protective in preventing the spread to other brain regions of seizures that originate in the hippocampus, the dominant focal site for seizures associated with temporal lobe epilepsy,\" said Soltesz. \"Drugs targeting mossy cells in patients with chronic, drug-resistant cases may someday be able to reduce the incidence of convulsive seizures enough to give patients' back some of their lost lifestyles.\" Such interventions might serve as an alternative to demanding surgical procedures now employed to excise the seizure focus from patients' brains, Soltesz said.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Stanford's Department of Neurosurgery also sup- ported the work.

The medical school also finished that year with a consolidated budget surplus of $116 million. These are just a few of the many facts Samuel Zelch, MBA, chief financial of-ficer and associate dean for fiscal affairs at the school, shared Feb. 14 during a lunchtime presentation. The event, held at the Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge, was the second of a three-part series of town hall meetings aimed at giving school employees the opportunity to learn and ask questions about the school's finances. In introductory remarks at the first meeting, which was held in the fall, Dean Lloyd Minor, MD, said, \"We'll all be able to do a better job of stewarding and managing our resources responsibly if we understand where those resources are coming from and where they sit and what they're intended for.\" At the first meeting, Zelch gave a broad overview of the school's finances; this time, he briefly recapped that over- view before focusing on the revenues and expenses of units funded through the Dean's Office; university cost recov-ery; the costs of facilities maintenance, capital projects and debt service; and the revenue-sharing formula used to fund departments, programs and support for faculty. Among other takeaways: The school covers all of its own ex - penses and also pays a percentage on most of its revenue \u2014 5.68 percent on about $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2017 \u2014 for ser - vices provided by the university. This fee is called the university cost recovery. Over the next decade, most of the school's capital expenditures will go toward three major building projects: the first of two Biomedical Innovation Buildings, the first of two Centers for Academic Medicine, and the Cancer Re - search and Precision Health Building. Total funding from the Dean's Office to departments, programs and faculty support was more than $103 million in fiscal year 2017. The capital project plan through 2036 totals $2.3 billion. Minor, Zelch and Marcia Cohen, MBA, senior associate dean for finance and administration, also fielded ques- tions from the audience following the presentation.

ISM1 What new light does this study shine on antidepres- sant treatment and antidepressants generally? IOANNIDIS: Antidepressants have been one of the most widely used, misused and debated classes of drugs. Major depression is a huge problem, and having the best information available to make decisions on how to treat patients is totally essential. Relevant evidence has typically been highly fragmented and biased, which has not helped resolve the misuse of these medications or settle the debates about them. By putting together cleaned, standardized data from more than 116,000 patients and 522 randomized trials, and by using the highest possible standards of analysis, we can offer some concrete evidence to inform the proper use of 21 differ-ent antidepressants. 2 What would you say are the biggest takeaways of this analysis from the perspective of a clinician? What about from the perspective of a patient with de-pression? IOANNIDIS: Some key lessons are, first, that for acute depression in adults, antidepressants are effective, mod- estly so. Second, when a new drug is tested against an older one, there is sometimes bias favoring the newer drug \u2014 and the newest drugs should not necessarily be the top choice. Third, bias does not completely ac- count for the efficacy of antidepressants. They do have a role in treating major depression. All 21 antidepressants that we assessed are better at treating depression than placebo, although the benefit is, on average, quite mod- est. Moreover, almost all of them are more acceptable, meaning that they are better tolerated, than placebo. (Acceptability is a measure that typically combines the impact of toxicity and the perceived efficacy.)Finally, different agents have different profiles of ef- ficacy and acceptability. Our study shows the relative merits and harms of each of the 21 anti- depressants compared against one another. Some of them seem to be better, or more ac- ceptable, although the differences between them are less pronounced when we compare them against placebo. A patient can discuss this information with his or her physician and make a choice to start a specific antidepressant, if it is indi- cated, with some particular evidence-based expectations in mind. Of course, different patients may still respond differently, and this is difficult to predict ahead of time. But at least there is sensible and congruent information that informs patients on the average response that he or she can expect to have if taking one of these antidepressants. 3 How can doctors use this information to better navi- gate treatment for their patients? IOANNIDIS: Doctors may find it difficult or confusing to sift through the results of more than 500 trials in the literature, many of which may only be published in a fragmentary fashion or not at all. The network analy- sis offers a condensed version of the evidence, and they can quickly see where a specific drug is mapping itself in terms of efficacy, acceptability and other outcomes of interest. Hopefully, this will make decision-making easier and more appropriate. 4 What other classes of drugs do you think could ben- efit from this type of analysis? IOANNIDIS: For most types of drug treatments and most diseases, evidence is fragmented across a large number of mostly small and inconclusive trials, and there is substantial evidence that many of these trials are either left unpublished or have selective reporting of their outcomes. Large network meta-analyses that examine the entire body of evidence of all available drug treatments for various diseases, that make a systematic effort to unearth all the data and clean the results, would be very useful to perform across all medical spe- cialties. There is an increasing number of papers that do perform network meta-anal- yses, but most of them look at snapshots of the evidence, consider some but not all the possible available treatments and make little or no effort to get unpublished results unearthed. 5 Do you think the results of this study carry implica- tions for drug developers moving forward? IOANNIDIS: Even though depression is very common, and thus the market for effective and well-tolerated drugs is very large, there has been a slowing of research and development of new drugs in this field. Our analy- sis clearly shows that there is a lot of room for improve- ment \u2014 both in efficacy and in acceptability compared with the currently available treatments. Thus, focusing on developing new drugs would be welcome, and our analysis can provide a yardstick of what the currently available drugs can achieve for comparison. It also shows that differences between available drugs are mod- est, therefore new research is needed to find drugs that use very different modes of action and may thus achieve better results. ISMSome 350 million people globally are cur- rently diagnosed with depression, making it the world's leading psychiatric disorder. As many physicians and patients opt to use drug- based therapy, pharmaceutical companies have churned out a variety of antidepressants. An international team of researchers specializing in fields such as psychiatry, public health and statistics conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 500 clinical trials that tested any of 21 different antidepressants. The group found that all 21 drugs were mod- estly more effective than a placebo \u2014 a validation for the overall efficacy of pharmaco- logical treatment of depression.The results of the meta-analysis, which were published online Feb. 21 in The Lancet, bring new evidence and insights to drug-based depression therapies, and could provide a valuable resource for doctors and patients sorting out antidepressant options. John Ioannidis, MD, DSc, professor of medicine and co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford, is an author of the study, which he said offers the best cur - rently available, evidence-based guide for antidepressant treatments.

ISM4 FEBRUARY 26, 2018 INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINEBy Nicoletta Lanese Researchers at the School of Medicine have identi- fied elevated tissue iron as a risk factor for life-threaten- ing fungal infections in lung transplant recipients. The study, reported Feb. 21 in Science Translational Medicine, investigated why lung transplant patients are more vulnerable to this fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus. \"People rarely think about how a change in the patient's body tissues might make it better ground for invasion,\" said Mark Nicolls, MD, professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine and senior author of the study. Informed by this research, Nicolls has proposed a po - tential new approach for curbing these infections. Aspergillus fumigatus is an extremely common mold, prevalent in even the most pristine hospital settings. \"It's everywhere \u2014 we inhale thousands of these spores per day,\" said Joe Hsu, MD, assistant professor of medi- cine and lead author of the study. One-third of lung transplant recipients develop Aspergillus-related diseases, including severe asthma and often-fatal lower respira- tory infections. The leading cause of death among these patients is transplant rejection, which the mold acceler- ates dramatically. There are many risk factors for Aspergillus infec- tion that are difficult to address in lung transplant re-cipients. T ransplant patients are given medications that leave them less able to ward off infections, but without these drugs, their immune systems would attack their new lungs. During recovery, patients have no ability to cough up invading pathogens, making them especially vulnerable to the omnipresent spores. This is because the lung transplant procedure disrupts signals from the vagus nerve, which controls the cough reflex. Patients are usually put on antifungal medications in an attempt to prevent infection, but these pathogens are becoming more drug-resistant over time. 'Like fertilizer for Aspergillus' All lung transplants carry these known risks, but not all lung transplants result in Aspergillus infections. Something causes the organism to behave differently in cases of infection, Hsu said. The study identified iron as a critical factor. \"Iron is like fertilizer for the Aspergil- lus,\" Nicolls said. Hsu was interested in finding the Aspergillus trigger switch \u2014 the factor that prompts it to invade tissue. He studied the pathogen in mouse models by transplant- ing windpipes from one mouse to another. Observing the rejection process, he found that the transplanted tis - sue bled and accrued high levels of iron. Hsu biopsied human transplant patients and found the same distribution of iron, with higher levels in the transplanted tissue than the host. Thinking he may have found the trigger, Hsu introduced Aspergillus into the mice, comparing how it acted with and without access to iron. He found that elevated iron prompted Aspergillus to invade. In ex- perimental conditions that provided the pathogen more iron, it invaded the transplant. The more iron, the deeper the invasion progressed into the tissue. The results indicate in - creased iron is a major determinant of Aspergillus invasion. Differences in iron levels between transplant patients seem to explain why some become in- fected while others don't. \"You could have lots of Aspergillus in the airway, which is fine because its everywhere, but it wouldn't penetrate the tissue unless there was iron beneath it,\" Nicolls said. A potential treatment The study suggests infection can be prevented by starving the Aspergillus organism of iron. Without iron to fuel it, the mold doesn't invade. The depth of inva- sion decreased in mice injected with an iron-reducing chemical. The result suggests a novel treatment route. Rather than targeting Aspergillus itself, doctors could modify tissue iron levels to change the organism's be-havior, Hsu said. His next step is to study this treatment approach in humans, he said. High iron is characteris- tic of other pulmonary diseases, and Hsu predicts this methodology may be applicable across the field of pul- monary care. Nicolls is an inventor on a new patent describing how lung transplant blood vessels may benefit from a low-iron environment, a property that could also include preventing mold invasion. He developed the technology with a number of collaborators, includ-ing Geoffrey Gurtner, MD, professor of surgery at Stanford, and Jayakumar Rajadas, PhD, director of Stanford's Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Lab, who is also a co-author of the study. The patent is a chemical solution that captures excess iron so the pathogen cannot use it. Nanoparticles act as a vehicle to transport the chemicals into the body. \"The capacity to deliver these compounds directly to the lungs is novel,\" Hsu said. \"For the first time, we have a new way to treat these infections aside from an- tibiotics that try to wipe out the organism itself.\" The solution can be applied like a paint during surgery, in- haled into the lungs or injected intravenously. The team's work is an example of Stanford Medi- cine's focus on precision health, the goal of which is to anticipate and prevent disease in the healthy and pre- cisely diagnose and treat disease in the ill.

ISMIron triggers dangerous infection in lung transplant recipients By Ruthann Richter The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a Palo Alto-based philanthropic organiza-tion, has launched a major research effort to inject fresh energy, ideas and talent into understanding the basic biology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Al- zheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the organi- zation announced Feb. 20. The research will be funded through two programs, including one that will support early career investigators willing to pursue bold, innovative ideas. These five-year awards, known as the CZI Ben Barres Early Career Acceleration Awards, are named in honor of Ben Barres, PhD, a distinguished Stanford neuroscientist who died in December at the age of 63. CZI will also fund a series of collabor- ative science awards \u2014 three-year grants for small, interdisciplinary groups of sci- entists, clinicians and engineers working together on innovative high-risk, high-impact projects in basic science. 'A spiritual guide' Both grant programs are part of CZI's new Neurodegeneration Challenge Net- work, which aims to fill in the gaps in the still-limited understanding of the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these devastating illnesses. Cori Bargmann, PhD, president of Chan Zuckerberg Science, said the group chose to name the young inves - tigator awards in Barres' honor because he was \"a spiritual guide\" for the work. An advocate for basic science and for the mentorship of young researchers, Barres had been an adviser to CZI since its in- ception in 2015 and had a hand in help- ing craft the awards program, Bargmann said. \"Ben was a truly exceptional scientist and human being. He exemplified the values of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, especially our work in neurodegenerative disease. His commitment to collabora- tion between basic science and medicine, his creative work in neurodegeneration, and his advocacy for women, underrep-resented groups and young scientists in- spire us all,\" Bargmann said. Barres made significant discoveries about the role of glial cells, the under- recognized cells that comprise the ma- jority of brain cells, and in doing so revolutionized the field of neuroscience. A professor of neurobiology, of develop- mental biology and of neurology, he was widely praised for the passion he brought to his work. Barres was particularly known for his dedication to his trainees and was a champion for basic science, helping es - tablish the Master of Science in Medi-cine program at Stanford to teach PhD students about human biology and disease and thus prepare them to turn new discov- eries into clinically useful treatments. \"Ben was a selfless and steadfast champion of young researchers. As his colleague and friend, I am moved that these awards will commemorate him and continue his legacy of celebrating and supporting early-career scientists,\" said neuroscien - tist Marc Tessier-Lavigne, PhD, presi- dent of Stanford University. 'A remarkable person' Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medicine, said the awards \"are an inspired way to honor the memory of Ben, a remarkable person and a beloved mentor who embodied the spirit of the awards in his brilliance, creativity and passion for neuroscience.\"The CZI Ben Barres Early Career Ac- celeration Awards are open to scientists throughout the world working in a vari-ety of disciplines. The awards are open to MDs and PhDs who are new to the field of neurodegeneration. Award-ees will receive $500,000 a year for five years, for a total of $2.5 million. The collaborative sci- ence awards will provide recipi- ents with $350,000 a year for three years, or a total of $1.05 million. CZI was founded by Silicon Valley couple Priscilla Chan, MD, and Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Face- book, to advance science, education and social justice. One of CZI's first initiatives was the creation of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, an independent nonprofit research center supported by $600 million over a 10-year period. The center brings together physicians, scien- tists and engineers at Stanford, UC-San Francisco and UC-Berkeley to engage in innovative scientific exploration and in- vent new tools to advance discoveries.

The two were sitting in an impro- vised recording studio on the third floor of Stanford Cancer Center South Bay. Esther Chyan, RN, a supportive care manager, was working the audio, ensur- ing their conversation recorded clearly. Bryanna Gallaway, director of service excellence, provided information and forms in preparation for the recording session, and was ready to facilitate the conversation should it need any addi- tional guidance. But there was no need for facilitating; once the two got going, they recounted Fitzpatrick's cancer treatment journey as if they were sitting on a porch, reminisc-ing over a bottle of ros\u00e9. McCulloch recounted how she reas- sured her friend not to worry, but \"when I got the phone call that you were di- agnosed with stage-4 breast cancer, my heart sank,\" she said. Fitzpatrick had invited McCulloch to join her in volunteering for a storytelling marathon that took place last October at the San Jose Stanford Cancer Center facility. They participated in the Stan-ford Storybank program, which Stanford Health Care is conducting in partnership with StoryCorps, a national organization whose mission is to capture, honor and preserve stories about human experiences through audio interviews. The recording equipment can be taken to any SHC location. Each conversation features two people \u2014 a patient and a family member, for example, or two SHC employees \u2014 and lasts 40 minutes. If the two people agree, the conversation will be archived within the U.S. Library of Congress, and edited down to shorter story segment clips for use by SHC. The Stanford Storybank was launched to create a space for patients, families and staff to share their experiences, providing an opportunity for all to learn, connect, heal and inspire. It's built on the premise that everyone has a story to share, and provides a platform to amplify the voices of the SHC community. As of Feb. 1, 35 stories have been recorded. The Service Excellence team posts the edited audio clips on the SHC intranet, shares them during manage- ment meetings and presents them dur- ing orientation or staff training sessions. The conversations \"bring us back to why we're here, why we do what we do,\" said Alpa Vyas, vice president of patient experience. The team also posts a \"story of the month\" that's available on Sound- Cloud at https://soundcloud.com/ search?q=stanford%20storybank. Cathartic conversations While instructing Fitzpatrick and McCulloch before the recording began, Gallaway told them, \"It's OK to cry; it's OK to laugh; it's OK to do anything you would normally do in a conversation.\" The two friends, who met 12 years ago when their children were in the same kindergarten class, discussed the effect Fitzpatrick's cancer, diagnosed six years ago, has had on their lives and their friendship. \"How do you distract your mind, not to think about cancer 24/7?\" McCulloch said. \"I don't dwell on the negative stuff,\" said. \"I admire that about you,\" McCulloch said. \"The one thing that cancer has given me is a clear, concise view on my family and what's important to me,\" Fitzpatrick continued. \"I made amends with people I needed to make amends with. It's a blessing. It's been a difficult journey, but it's kind of worth it.\" The two laughed about how Fitzpat- rick's hair grew back white after a round of chemotherapy and she looked like An- nie Lennox. \"I kind of had fun with it,\" she said. T urning serious, she asked McCull - och, \"What's it like for you? I sometimes think it's harder for the people not going through it.\" \"Sometimes I think that I'm weak. I want to make you better, but I can't,\" McCulloch confessed. After the recording session was over, the two friends described the conversa- tion as cathartic. Fitzpatrick said she hoped participat- ing in the Stanford Storybank program would help other people diagnosed with cancer. \"I really want to provide hope to people in the same situation,\" she said. The Stanford Storybank stories will be archived on SHC Connect and stored in the Library of Congress.

ISM By Patricia Hannon If the tale of Dr. Victor Frankenstein and his hid- eous creation reminds us of anything, perhaps it's that being human means more than simply having a beating heart and a working brain. The relationship between the obsessed doctor and the unnamed mon - ster depicted in Mary Shelley's book also reminds us that being human also should mean being humane. In his introduction to the new issue of Stanford Medicine magazine, Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medicine, discusses how the novel's des-perate and lonely creature, who wants only to be understood, can help illustrate why humanity must help inform science and discovery. \"It is through this nuanced, complex character that we feel compassion and a deep empathy,\" Mi- nor said. \"At Stanford Medicine, empathy is vitally important to our vision of precision health, which brings together the high tech and the high touch, and recognizes the uniqueness of every individual.\" Frankenstein themes that still matter The magazine's issue delves into research that pushes boundaries in medicine, but it also looks at the implications of that research on humanity \u2014 Frankenstein themes that still matter 200 years after Shelley published her tale. The ethical and cultural challenges of charting medicine's \"out there\" frontiers are evident in several stories in the issue: Audrey Shafer, MD, notes that \"many scien- tists, doctors and patients balk at any mention of the words Frankenstein and medicine in the same breath.\" But they must not shy away from the moral and ethical questions raised by the novel, and by sci- ence itself, as we probe what it means to be human, said Shafer, professor of anesthesiology, periopera- tive and pain medicine, and director of the Stanford Medicine and the Muse program. The program is highlighting the novel's themes through a yearlong series of courses, film screenings and other events. Hiromitsu Nakauchi, MD, PhD, professor of genetics, dreams of quickly growing transplantable human organs in large animals, such as sheep or pigs, to save people whose organs are failing. But the re-search has reignited a national discussion about the potential implications of blending animal and hu - man cells. Neuroscientist Sergiu Pasca, MD, assistant pro- fessor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and his lab team are growing tiny brains balls in petri dishes so they can discover what goes wrong in the brains of people with neurological diseases, including au- tism, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Because fur-ther research could include transplanting the cells into mice, Pasca is \"actively engaged\" in conversa-tions with other scientists about how to proceed in the quickly advancing field. Researchers believe that the ability of the gene- editing tool CRISPR to quickly remove, delete and repair defective genes could improve the lives of mil- lions of people with inherited disorders. But many fear the consequences if safeguards aren't established. Those include the possibility of using it to create designer babies, or that ongoing experiments to al - ter the DNA of disease-spreading insects or geneti - cally enhance crops could have unintended negative impacts. Stanford's first U.S. adult heart transplant was considered shocking 50 years ago. Though surgeon Norman Shumway, MD, wasn't the first in the world to transplant a human heart, continuing research by him, his team and his successors led to worldwide advances in the procedure. Science author Mary Roach talks about why she isn't squeamish about writing about the crevices of our bodies where few authors venture. \"You hear a lot about the brain and the heart. People have a sense that these are miraculous, but not so much the nether regions or the inside of the nose, the nostrils, the tongue. The icky parts are just as miraculous, and people tend to overlook them. I'm the plumber,\" she said. Outside a space station The issue also includes an excerpt from a book by physician-astronaut Scott Parazynski, MD, a medi- cal school alumnus who wrote about the harrowing \u2014 and glorious \u2014 day he spent suspended outside the International Space Station Discovery to repair a ripped wing on the station's solar panels; and a story about the ideas that engineers, biologists and doctors are exploring to prevent the long-term disabilities suffered by people who've had strokes.

The cells are then treated with a panel of genes that make them rewind their developmental clock to become pluripotent, allowing them to become nearly any tissue in the body. One key test of pluripotency is the ability of the cells to form a tumor called a teratoma, which is composed of many different cell types, after the cells are injected into animals. (IPS cells used in regenerative-medicine therapies are grown in the presence of other proteins to encourage them to specialize, or dif- ferentiate, into specific cell populations before being used clinically.) Cancer, iPS cells similar Cancer cells also have long been known to echo many features of devel- opmentally immature cells. As part of their cancerous transformation, they of- ten shed the naturally occurring mecha- nisms that serve to block inappropriate cell division and instead begin proliferat- ing rapidly. Wu and Kooreman wondered exactly how closely iPS and cancer cells resem- ble one another. They compared the gene expression panels of the two types of cells in mice and humans and found some remarkable similarities, suggesting that these cells share proteins on their surfaces called epitopes that could serve as targets for the immune system. To test this theory, they used four groups of mice. One was injected with a control solution, one received geneti- cally matching iPS cells that had been irradiated to prevent the formation of teratomas, one received a generic im - mune-stimulating agent known as an ad-juvant, and one received a combination of irradiated iPS cells and adjuvant. All animals in each group were injected once a week for four weeks. Lastly, a mouse breast cancer cell line was transplanted into the animals to observe the potential growth of tumors. One week after transplantation, all mice were found to have developed tu- mors of the breast cancer cells at the in- jection site. Although the tumors grew robustly in the control groups, they shrank in size in 7 out of 10 mice vac-cinated with iPS cells plus the adjuvant. T wo of these mice were able to com- pletely reject the breast cancer cells and live for more than one year after tumor transplantation. Similar results were obtained when Kooreman and his col- leagues transplanted a mouse melanoma and mesothelioma (a type of lung can- cer) cell line into mice. Kooreman and his colleagues further found that immune cells called T cells from vaccinated mice were able to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in un - vaccinated mice. Conversely, these T cells also blocked the growth of terato- mas in mice injected with nonirradiated iPS cells, showing that the activated T cells were recognizing epitopes that are shared between the breast cancer cells and the iPS cells. Putting immune system on alert \"This approach is particularly pow- erful because it allows us to expose the immune system to many different can- cer-specific epitopes simultaneously,\" Kooreman said. \"Once activated, the immune system is on alert to target cancers as they de- velop throughout the body.\" The researchers next would like to study whether the approach works in samples of human cancers and immune cells in a laboratory setting. If successful, they envision a future in which people could receive a vaccine comprised of their own irradiated iPS cells as a way to prevent the development of cancers months or years later. Alternatively, the iPS cells could potentially be used as a part of the standard of adjuvant care af-ter primary surgery; chemotherapy or radiation therapy, or both; or immu-notherapy as a way to treat established cancers. \"Although much research remains to be done, the concept itself is pretty simple,\" Wu said. \"We would take your blood, make iPS cells and then inject the cells to prevent future cancers. I'm very excited about the future possibilities.\" Other Stanford authors of the study are postdoctoral scholars Youngkyun Kim, PhD, Ning-Yi Shao, MD, PhD, Tzu-Tang Wei, PhD, Hyoju Yi, PhD, and David Paik, PhD; former post- doctoral scholars Patricia de Almeida, PhD, Devaveena Dey, PhD; medi- cal resident Vittavat Termglinchan, MD; former research assistant Raman Nelakanti; former research associate Arnold Han, MD, PhD; medical student Thomas Brouwer; instruc- tor of medicine Idit PhD; - ogy and immunology Mark Davis, PhD; and professor of medicine Ronald Levy, MD.

ISMIPS continued from page 1By Tracie White Gerald \"Jerry\" Reaven, MD, who gained interna- tional recognition for coining the term Syndrome X \u2014 now known as metabolic syndrome \u2014 died Feb. 12 at his home on the Stanford campus. He was 89. An endocrinologist and professor emeritus of medicine at the School of Medicine, Reaven was one of the first researchers to argue for the existence of insulin re- sistance, a diminished response to the hormone insulin. It was a controversial concept that met with huge opposition. But Reaven proved the naysayers wrong. In 1988, he also introduced the novel idea of a link between insulin resistance and a cluster of other metabolic abnor- malities that together greatly increased the risk for cardiovascular disease, which he called Syndrome X. \"Jerry Reaven was a true Stanford pioneer,\" said Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the School of Medicine. \"He was the consummate scientist whose rigorous scholarship was a model for researchers at Stanford and around the world. He will be missed.\" Never one to back down from a fight, Reaven broke ground when he argued for the existence of insulin resistance as an early and critical link in the development of Type 2 diabetes and conducted nu- merous studies over many decades proving the exis - tence of insulin resistance and its many implications for metabolic diseases and cardiovascular diseases. \"Jerry Reaven was a giant in the Department of Medicine,\" said Robert Harrington, MD, professor and chair of medicine at Stanford. \"His scientific contribution in describing and then further defining insulin resistance is one of the great achievements in metabolic disease over the last 50 years.\" Insulin resistance controversy In the 1950s, when Reaven started out as a re- searcher, it was believed that there was only one type of diabetes and that it was caused by a lack of insulin. \"In the late '70s early '80s, there was a lot of con- troversy about insulin resistance, and Jerry was not shy about standing up and sharing his opinions,\" said Frederic Kraemer, MD, professor and chief of endocrinology, gerontology and metabolism at Stan - ford. \"He was tenacious when it came to defending his scientific observations. He didn't like to accept opinions; he liked to accept facts \u2014 facts generated from well-controlled scientific investigations.\"In 1988, during the American Diabetes Asso- ciation Banting award lecture, he introduced the concept of the link between insulin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities, calling it Syndrome X. This constellation of conditions \u2014 increased blood pressure, high blood sugar and abnormal HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels \u2014 later became known as metabolic syndrome and has become a useful indicator of in- creased risk for heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Reaven continued to actively con- duct research until October, when bad health finally kept him at home. He co- authored more than 800 papers in sci- entific journals and currently has at least two more in the pipeline. He was also the author of several books, including a popular book on Syndrome X and its re- percussions on cardiovascular health. He was a men- tor to many scientists both at Stanford and around the world. 'Science was his life' \"I visited him at his house just before the Super Bowl in February, when I knew he was sick,\" said Joshua Knowles, MD, an assistant professor of car- diovascular medicine. \"He was very sad he couldn't be at work. I brought a paper on the effects of insu- lin resistance on different race and ethnicities. He wanted to see the data. Science was his life.\" Reaven was a Midwesterner and a baseball fan. He was born in Gary, Indiana, on July 28, 1928, but grew up in Cleveland, which accounts for his life- long \"affection and frustration\" with the Cleveland Indians baseball team, said his son, Peter Reaven, MD, an endocrinologist and director of the diabe- tes research program at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System in Arizona. \"Both my dad and my mom were academics,\" he said. His mother, Eve Reaven, PhD, is a retired elec- tron microscopist who lives in the Stanford home where she and Jerry raised their three children. \"Of- ten dinner conversations were about academics and science. Somehow that became comfortable.\" But Peter said his father also made time for out- side interests. Gerald Reaven loved sports, Broad-way plays, jazz singers and literature. He traveled to Cuba when he was young to search for Hemingway. He always made the time to play sports with his children and continued to play on softball teams for many years. He was known for throwing birthday parties for faculty and staff, many of whom knew his favorite dessert was chocolate pie. \"He was a huge Cleveland Indians fan,\" said Knowles, who often heard broadcasts of the games coming from Reaven's computer at work. Knowles, who studies the genetic basis of insulin resistance, spoke of the many lessons he learned from Reaven over the years as both his trainee and colleague. Among them: \"The fortitude to stick with an idea if you really believe in it, against external pressure\" and \"the need to find a scientific passion that keeps you coming to the lab on the weekend.\" \"Jerry was often the only faculty member here on Saturday and Sunday,\" Knowles said. \"On many weekend mornings I would arrive after playing bas-ketball and shoot the breeze with Jerry in his office. That dedication is infectious.\" Reaven earned his undergraduate and medical school degrees at the University of Chicago and completed his residency training at the University of Michigan. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1960. He worked at the School of Medicine first in the endocrinology division and then, after semi-retire - ment, in the cardiovascular division. \"He was an amazing thinker,\" said Sun Kim, MD, an associate professor of medicine who studies insulin resistance and diabetes. \"He was a deep thinker who wanted the truth to be told. He loved work. He literally worked till the end.\" Reaven won numerous awards, including the William S. Middleton Award for outstanding achievement in medical research from the Veterans Affairs Administration, the Banting Medal for Sci- entific Achievement from the American Diabetes Association, the Banting Memorial Lecture from the British Diabetes Association, the Fred Conrad Koch Award from the Endocrine Society, the Distinction in Clinical Endocrinology Award from the Ameri- can Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the National Lipid Association Honorary Lifetime Member Award. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by daughters Marci Reaven of New York and Nancy Reaven of Los Angeles and their families.

ISMGerald Reaven, scientist who coined 'Syndrome X,' dies at 89 obituary Gerald Reaven \"Although much research remains to be done, the concept itself is pretty simple.\"INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINE FEBRUARY 26, 2018 7per year, making them really ill. About 400,000 of those people, mostly children, die every year,\" Schneider said. \"We don't have a vaccine. There's resistance to almost all the drugs we have. We need new ways of fighting the disease.\" Schneider's group has been doing experiments with malaria-infected mice, monitoring many aspects of their physiology over time. \"And we notice, in these mice, that the levels of various cell types and immune- signaling chemicals in the blood go up and down as the animal gets sick, then recovers or dies. Potential drugs work only during a limited portion of this cycle.\" What he's learned from his studies is that to treat a patient most efficiently, it would be great to know when the patient got infected. But that's somewhere between tough and impossible. \"We can't expect a child suffering from malaria to tell us when they were bitten by an infected mosquito,\" Schneider wrote in his study of malaria-infected mice and human patients published in PLOS Biology in 2016. Ups and downs That study showed that infecting mice with a ma- laria parasite resulted in a predictable set of changes, over time, in the blood levels of nine different cell types and immune-signaling substances as the mice first got sick and then recovered or, if they got too sick, were euthanized. By looking at the ratios and absolute lev- els of certain measured cell types and chemicals, the re- searchers could identify just where a mouse was along the looping path from health to sickness to recovery or death, and how likely it was to die barring further intervention. In the same study, Schneider and his colleagues ex- tended the findings to humans by looking at blood from children who had or hadn't been infected with malaria. Human infection, they showed, also follows a looping path, and the order of cellular and molecular ups and downs along that path rise and fall in the same sequence as in mice. That sequence provides a clue as to where a patient is in the sickness cycle, and factoring in the level of one or more blood markers in a patient might give you a good sense of how much danger he or she is in. Nine is a big number. \"If you're measuring nine things in a sick animal, it's hard to graph, not to men - tion grasp, nine different variables at one time,\" Schnei-der said. \"You can lose some information. You want to emphasize that as one thing goes up, another comes down.\" Having encountered difficulty in communicating such multivariate, circular data findings, Schneider has turned increasingly to building data sculptures. One looks like a wooden rotisserie holding wooden pieces of \"toast.\" The \"rotisserie\" is actually an open-front box. Its \"skewer\" is a long wooden axis running horizontally from one side of the box to the other side. The axis can be turned via an externally positioned crank. The thin pieces of \"toast\" skewered inside the box are in fact slim disks, each irregularly shaped in its own particular way, that act as cams. Each cam approximates a circle whose radius keeps changing at different points along the rim. The radius of a cam at any given point represents the level, at a par- ticular point in the sickness/recovery cycle, of one of the nine cell types or substances Schneider's team measured in malaria-infected mouse blood. Turning the crank Astride each of the nine cams sits the figure of a man's torso. The men form a line along the box's top. When you turn the crank, they variously rise up, raising their arms to the heavens, or they sink down, arms back at their sides, as each is displaced idiosyncratically by its underlying, oddly shaped cam. The left-most little man goes up, then the next, then the next, etc. Schneider turns the crank some more, and at some point the first little man starts to come back down even as the ones to the right of it are still rising. The rise and fall of the serially adjacent little men occur in a left-to-right ripple as the crank turns. \"It looks like a wave,\" Schneider said. \"You might have missed that if you were looking at numbers or a graph, or just focusing on one point in time. But when you look at it this way, you can't help but see that there's a wave moving through the data over time.\" By analyzing the ratios and phases and rates of the rise and fall of all of the parts of this data sculpture, Schneider has shown it may be possible to figure out where in the disease/recovery cycle a patient is. The hope is eventually to be able to predict early on whether a patient is headed for recovery or not and, if not, how to best treat the patient based on where he or she is in the disease cycle. \"I think these sculptures show the cyclical nature of infections better than any graph I've been able to use previously,\" Schneider said. \"But I still have to figure out how to publish these things. The journals always want flat pictures. We have to find a way to get around that.\" Grant-writing, too. \"The proposal formats often only let you submit a flat PDF . I've snuck movies into my PDFs in the past. But the granting agencies imme- diately banned doing that.\" From 2013 through 2016, Schneider, who teaches year-round, began offering postdoctoral scholars and graduate students a 10-hour course in scientific ani- mation. In spring 2017, Schneider switched to teach-ing similar classes, between quarters, in data sculpture. These classes, which are limited to a dozen students, typically attract as many as 50 applicants. The next one is in March. Katharine Ng, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Bioengineering, has been Schneider's teaching assistant for both the scientific-animation and data-sculpture courses. \"David's always open to new vi- sualization techniques,\" she said. \"He's always looking for ways to, first, convey science to lay audiences, and, second, force his fellow scientists to confront his data in a new way, hoping that maybe they'll catch some new aspect or perspective they might have otherwise over- looked.\" ISMSchneider continued from page 1 was no. \"We've all heard stories of a friend who went on one diet \u2014 it worked great \u2014 and then another friend tried the same diet, and it didn't work at all,\" said Christopher Gardner, PhD, professor of medicine and the lead author of the study. \"It's because we're all very differ- ent, and we're just starting to understand the reasons for this diversity. Maybe we shouldn't be asking what's the best diet, but what's the best diet for whom?\" Past research has shown that a range of factors, including genetics, insulin lev-els (which helps regulate glucose in the body) and the microbiome, might tip the scales when it comes to weight loss. The new study, published Feb. 20 in JAMA, homed in on genetics and insulin, seek- ing to discover if these nuances of biol- ogy would encourage an individual's body to favor a low-carbohydrate diet or a low-fat diet. The senior authors of the study are Gardner; Abby King, PhD, professor of health research and policy and of medicine; Manisha Desai, PhD, professor of medicine and of biomedical data science; and John Ioannidis, MD, DSc, professor of medicine. A tale of two diets In his quest to find out if individual biological factors dictate weight loss, Gardner recruited 609 participants be- tween the ages of 18 and 50. About half were men and half were women. All were randomized into one of two dietary groups: low-carbohydrate or low-fat. Each group was instructed to maintain their diet for one year. (By the end of that year, about 20 percent of participants had dropped out of the study, due to outside circumstances, Gardner noted.) Individuals participated in two pre- study activities, the results of which were later tested as predictors of weight loss. Participants got part of their genome se- quenced, allowing scientists to look for specific gene patterns associated with producing proteins that modify carbo- hydrate or fat metabolism. Then, par- ticipants took a baseline insulin test, in which they drank a shot of glucose (think corn syrup) on an empty stomach, and researchers measured their bodies' insulin outputs. In the initial eight weeks of the study, participants were told to limit their daily carbohydrate or fat intake to just 20 grams, which is about what can be found in a 1\u00bd slices of whole wheat bread or in a generous handful of nuts, respectively. After the second month, Gardner's team instructed the groups to make incremen- tal small adjustments as needed, adding back 5-15 grams of fat or carbs gradu-ally, aiming to reach a balance they be- lieved they could maintain for the rest of their lives. At the end of the 12 months, those on a low-fat diet reported a daily average fat intake of 57 grams; those on low-carb ingested about 132 grams of carbohydrates per day. Those statistics pleased Gardner, given that average fat consumption for the participants before the study started was around 87 grams a day, and average carbohydrate intake was about 247 grams. What's key, Gardner said, was empha- sizing that these were healthy low-fat and low-carb diets: A soda might be low-fat, but it's certainly not healthy. Lard may be low-carb, but an avocado would be healthier. \"We made sure to tell every- body, regardless of which diet they were on, to go to the farmer's market, and don't buy processed convenience food crap. Also, we advised them to diet in a way that didn't make them feel hun-gry or deprived \u2014 otherwise it's hard to maintain the diet in the long run,\" said Gardner. \"We wanted them to choose a low-fat or low-carb diet plan that they could potentially follow forever, rather than a diet that they'd drop when the study ended.\" Continuing to mine the data Over the 12-month period, research- ers tracked the progress of participants, logging information about weight, body composition, baseline insulin levels and how many grams of fat or carbohydrate they consumed daily. By the end of the study, individu- als in the two groups had lost, on average, 13 pounds. There was still, however, im- mense weight loss variability among them; some dropped upward of 60 pounds, while others gained close to 15 or 20. But, contrary to the study hypotheses, Gardner found no associations be- tween the genotype pattern or baseline insulin levels and a propensity to succeed on either diet. \"This study closes the door on some questions \u2014 but it opens the door to others. We have gobs of data that we can use in secondary, exploratory studies,\" he said. Gardner and his team are continu- ing to delve into their databanks, now asking if the microbiome, epigenetics or a different gene expression pattern can clue them in to why there's such drastic variability between dieting individuals. Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this study, Gardner said, is that the fun- damental strategy for losing weight with either a low-fat or a low-carb approach is similar. Eat less sugar, less refined flour and as many vegetables as possible. Go for whole foods, whether that is a wheat- berry salad or grass-fed beef. \"On both sides, we heard from people who had lost the most weight that we had helped them change their relationship to food, and that now they were more thoughtful about how they ate,\" said Gardner. Moving forward, he and his team will continue to analyze the reams of data collected during the yearlong study, and they hope to partner with scientists across Stanford to uncover keys to indi- vidual weight loss. \"I'm hoping that we can come up with signatures of sorts,\" he said. \"I feel like we owe it to Ameri- cans to be smarter than to just say 'eat less.' I still think there is an opportunity to discover some personalization to it \u2014 now we just need to work on tying the pieces together.\" The study's other Stanford co-authors are postdoctoral scholars John T repanowski, PhD, and Michelle Hauser MD; research fellow Liana Del Gobbo; and senior biostatistician, Joseph Rigdon, PhD.

Christopher Gardner 8 FEBRUARY 26, 2018 INSIDE STANFORD MEDICINEwith a brain-machine interface got patterns of activity in the monkeys' brains into just the right spot, so they could carry out the same rotation task with their hands, even though they had never done so before. A new way to probe the mind \"There are key differences between our paradigm and true mental re- hearsal,\" Vyas said, and there are rea- sons to be cautious about interpreting the results too broadly. For one thing, one can't just ask a monkey to imagine ice skating, as one could with a per- son. For another, mentally rehearsing a task is not the same as using a brain- machine interface to do it. In the lat- ter case, people get feedback on how they're doing, something they can only imagine in mental rehearsal. \"We can't prove the connection beyond a shadow of a doubt,\" She - noy said, but \"this is a major step in understanding what mental rehearsal may well be in all of us.\" The next steps, he and Vyas said, are to figure out how mental rehearsal relates to practice with a brain-machine inter- face \u2014 and how mental preparation, the key ingredient in transferring that practice to physical movements, relates to movement. Meanwhile, Shenoy said, the results demonstrate the potential of an en- tirely new tool for studying the mind. \"We used a brain-machine interface to probe and advance basic science, and that's just super exciting,\" Shenoy said.
