Read To Know By Priya Mewada +2 more By Priya Mewada +2 more Amid the advancement of [COVID-19 vaccination drives](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/where-are-we-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/) across the globe, the confusion and rumours around the efficacy of the vaccines are still rising. People are trying to find answers to their questions like - \"When do they become immune to the virus?\", \"How long does the immunity last?\" and many more. Well, these confusions exist because people tend to believe every rumour they come across, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) has appealed multiple times to only trust the authentic sources about the information related to [Coronavirus](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/omicron-the-new-variant-of-covid-19-risks-and-safety-precautions/). One of the most prevalent confusions around the [Coronavirus vaccines](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/do-existing-vaccines-work-against-omicron/) these days is how long should a person wait to get the vaccine after getting infected. Table of Contents Some of the researchers have recently claimed that [a person can take the COVID-19 vaccine](https://pharmeasy.in/blog/want-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-check-the-step-wise-procedure/) right after recovering from the disease but only if they do not have any symptoms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, suggests waiting for 90 days from the day you test positive for COVID-19 disease if you haven't received any shot yet. The CDC also suggests, people who got infected after receiving their first shot may take the second dose on their scheduled date, but only if their quarantine period is over and they do not have any symptoms. The CDC has also clarified that if you have had COVID-19 and now you have recovered, you must be having some [natural protection](https://peasy.onelink.me/OvPM/38cf9fe7) against the virus, but it is still unclear how long that [immunity](https://peasy.onelink.me/OvPM/38cf9fe7) is going to last. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience potentially severe illness or post-COVID conditions. Vaccination can be taken safely post 90 days of successful recovery from COVID.Rs. 361 The CDC has suggested not to take the vaccine for at least 90 days if you have undergone an antibody therapy for COVID-19. Currently, India has vaccinated over 62.5 lakh healthcare workers and frontline workers. The authorities have confirmed that about 3.3 lakh people are being inoculated on a daily basis. The authorities, however, have cautioned COVID-infected people not to get the vaccine if they have any symptoms of the disease. Moreover, long-haulers, people who have recovered from COVID-19 but still have some symptoms, should consult their physician before taking the shot. There are plenty of myths that are discouraging people from showing up at the vaccination centres, causing a huge blow to India's fight against the Coronavirus. Here we have listed a few myths which CDC has described as completely baseless: Many people around the country believe that those who are taking the vaccine shots are suffering from serious side effects. They agree that the people may suffer from some mild side effects, which are listed below: More serious side-effects include: With the kind of results India's indigenous vaccines are fetching, people have started showing more interest in taking the shot for COVID-19. We, however, have to work together to stop the spread of misconceptions to eventually defeat the disease which had literally confined the world to their houses. Let's pledge not to forward any information related to the disease without cross-checking it with the official sources, like the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, WHO, CDC, etc. [Know your current health status.](https://pharmeasy.in/diagnostics/search/all?q=Advanced+full+body+checkup?intid=371) Disclaimer: The information included at this site is for educational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for medical treatment by a healthcare professional.
