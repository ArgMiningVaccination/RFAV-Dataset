As a licensed naturopathic physician who specializes in integrative, regenerative sports medicine at a successful practice in Bellevue, Washington, I support some of the nation's most ambitious outdoors and team-sports athletes in excelling at their art. I have a tremendous passion for helping people to be athletic throughout their lives and doing all of the things they desire for as long as possible. I believe any athlete, of any age, should seek sound advice and recommendations that allow them to stay in the game. It's important to note that in sports and athletic performance circles, there are countless performance hacks, wellness trends, and false promise fads that boast miraculous results. Instead, what about sustaining an active lifestyle? What about consistently preventing injury by achieving the next level of resilience? What about building habits and routines surrounding fitness and performance that allow you to keep doing what you love for years to come? This eBook has so many inspiring examples of elite-level athletes who have taken charge of their health so they can perform safer, smarter and simply better. This eBook is designed to give you an added advantage to be better and stronger than you've ever been before. A lot of what I teach in my practice and helped create in this eBook is about helping people get back into doing the sports and physical activities that they want to without feeling like they could be injured. Add to this an unprecedented year of sedentary life during the pandemic, the rapid return of opportunity for us all to resume our activity in the heat of summer, the additional motivation that comes with the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, the excitement of getting outdoors, exploring new trails, and setting new fitness goals only increases further. So, my goal with this eBook is to provide as much information as I can to help you not only feel prepared, but to truly be ready to safely get back out there and perform at your absolute best for far longer than just this season. The ability to use our body to engage in physical activities, sports, and just being outdoors is one of the most naturally exhilarating experiences in life. When you read this and learn something new in your athletic journey - even in the smallest way possible - I consider it a win.

All Rights Reserved.4 We've all been talking about the Return to Office (RTO), but for athletes and outdoors enthusiasts, what about the Return to Exercise (RTE)? Getting back into physical activity after some time away requires planning to prime the body and get it ready. This is where \"prehab\" comes in. When returning to sports after being sedentary, prehabilitation or \"prehab\" focuses on moving from a lesser state of physical fitness to a higher activity level with a step-by-step order to prevent injury. The term prehab and overall concept are often used in pre-surgical care with goals such as improving nutrition or a positive mindset prior to surgery as a way to improve healing time and decrease potential complications, or lose weight before a knee replacement to minimize the risk of poor outcomes and shorten hospital stays. The same rules apply for sports and physical activity, but in a broader sense that emphasizes a planned and gradual transition to higher intensity physical exertion. When working with athletic patients, I often emphasize a period of prehab to prepare their bodies before treatments like regenerative injection therapies. These treatments are much more effective when we've prepped the body or particular area to increase blood flow, improve mobility and range of motion, improve kinesthetic awareness, and strengthen functional capacity. Active prehab actually paves the way for a better - and faster - recovery from both medical interventions and exercise. And as I get into later, the recovery after a workout is where you truly lock in those gains ... or lose them if done improperly. How to return to physical activity after being sedentary? Get Walking Start slow if you haven't been active. The single, most important first step is to start walking or begin some form of basic movement - whatever that means for you. If walking, the goal is to get comfortable with 30-to-60 minutes a day (somewhere between 3000-to-6000 steps a day for the average person). Get used to that first. Breathe In and Out Through the Nose This is just as important as getting moving. Breathing in and out only through the nose is the simplest and most innate way to regulate the nervous system and stay relaxed while regulating blood carbon dioxide levels. By incorporating a regular breathing practice as part of a daily routine, it helps athletes learn how to appropriately pace their breathing. This paced breathing contributes to one's ability to regulate the body's response to physical and mental stressors, as well as the response to rising carbon dioxide in the blood - both of which increase during intense exercise and performance. The better the body is at dealing with carbon dioxide, the better it becomes at combating any and all types of stress: physical exertion and fatigue, mental stress, environmental stress, etc. When you are better able to manage carbon dioxide levels and improve the body's tolerance of it, you can drastically improve performance of any type. Consequently, as physical exertion getting back in the game with Ashok Bhandari, NDemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.5increases, the ever-increasing challenges of regulating breath, stressors, and carbon dioxide levels can be more easily managed with a solid foundation of nasal-only breathing. There are other more complex breathing techniques to ask your trainer or physician about as well. Be sure to consult with them so that your breathing practice is not counterproductive to your particular sport or activity, or you are not exacerbating a pre-existing health condition. Upgrade Your Stretching Once you've returned to a comfortable form of movement, with a routine breathing practice in place, the next stage of prehab is evaluating your range of motion and mobility. As always, exercises and treatment plans should be customized to meet the demands of a specific sport or activity. But if you are just getting back into general exercise, then gentle dynamic stretching exercises (leg swings, walking lunges, \"high knees,\" for example) and self-myofascial release techniques such as foam rolling can be very beneficial. In the simplest terms possible, foam rolling affects both the skeletal muscles and the connective tissue wrapping of the muscle, called fascia. Fascia can be manipulated by stretching, massaging, and rolling out, similar to pizza dough. Muscle tissue contains muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs (GTO) and two neural receptors. Muscle spindles are sensory receptors that run parallel to muscle fibers and are sensitive to muscle lengthening. When the body puts pressure on the foam roller, the GTO turns off the muscle spindle activity and allows the muscle to stretch and smooth out any knots. The combination effect of foam rolling is the temporary and oh-so-satisfying loosening up of the muscles that are worked on. Focus on a Fit Heart The next step is about improving cardiovascular fitness - always strengthen the heart first. This will require a combination of the previous steps. As you get comfortable with the increased walking, start with a 20-minute moderate-intensity aerobic-focused workout (60 - 75% of your maximum heart rate) a couple of days each week. Incorporate the nasal-only breathing, which has already become part of your routine. Allow your body time to become acclimated to this state of physical activity and make sure you can comfortably regulate your breathing and workout intensity. Keep an eye on the demands of your heart rate and breathing to navigate this steady increase. This is a great way to prehab the heart and metabolic system before you get into more intense sport. By the end of your prehab period, daily 20 minute sessions at moderate-intensity exercise while nasal-only breathing should feel doable. Build Strength with Stability and Proper Form The last step on the prehab list is improving strength. Notice how each step builds upon the former. Strength and stability gained through proper form are two important considerations in preventing injuries like sprains, strains, muscle aches, and joint pain. Similar to the other steps, it is important to start slow and with familiar movements. If general exercise is new to you, start with large muscle groups or compound exercises, where multiple muscle groups are fired or turned on simultaneously. The best example of this is a squat because it works the quadriceps, glutes and calves, and even your core. getting back in the game ...continued6emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.Also, if you are getting back into the game after injury or being sedentary for several months to a year, do strength-building exercises that involve bigger movements, such as squats, pushups or modified push ups, (assisted) pull ups, rowing, lunges, shoulder presses, and deadlifts. I typically tell patients to begin by keeping it easy and start with a full-body workout a couple of times a week. As you get stronger, add more intensity. The strength phase of prehab helps prime the joints for increased physical demands and more intensive activity. Don't skip out on strength. As you move through bigger movements, it will strengthen the muscles along your spine and engage the core muscles. This helps prevent injury and primes your body to add more heavy lifting, and more sport-specific, fast and powerful movements/activities. Have Goals, but Be Kind with Expectations With all this talk about prepping the body, remember that your mind needs to be primed too. Your mental state and attitude can be some of the greatest tools in improving athletic performance. The sports industry has come a long way from pushing through the pain. It's important to be kind to yourself, take it slow, and be patient. The body adapts to what we tell it to do, so if life or lockdown has led to you being in a state of rest for several months, we have to acknowledge that the body did what we asked. Once we start challenging what our body has already acclimated to - by increasing physical activity - the adaptation phase will have to begin once again. We have to give it time to do that. We can't simply jump into what we used to do immediately, and attempting to do so can lead to counterproductive results - like injuries. Body composition is going to change again, too. If your relationship with your body changed or was strained while you were sedentary, be kind with yourself as you return to physical activity. If you're jumping into physical activity with the intent of building muscle and/or losing weight, keep in mind that those changes take time. Physiology takes time, and so does building mental resilience. If you are impatient with this process, I recommend going back to the breathing exercises, but not for the reasons you'd think. One of my favorite parts about these exercises is that they really help us work on slow, rhythmic breathing (in-and-out of the nose) and that, in turn, helps us pace ourselves throughout prehab. If you've ever run a 5k before and tried to switch your breath partway through to only breathing through your nose, you would have to dramatically slow down or eventually start breathing through your mouth. To slow down from escalating too quickly during that prehab ramp up, these breathing exercises force one to acknowledge that the body is going to have to slowly get back into this. So, emphasizing nasal-only breathing places a naturally progressing intensity gauge into training. As one starts moving through prehab, the body and mind become more comfortable. Only then should one push a little bit harder. The priming takes time. It can take weeks if not months depending on how long you were out of an exercise routine. Be patient with your body and your mind as you're changing, because now you know what you're asking it to do.getting back in the game ...continuedemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021.

If we're not properly prepared to exercise in hot weather, it lowers our ability to perform and raises the risk of heat exhaustion. What Happens to our Bodies When We Work Out in the Heat? Exercise is one of the most effective ways of increasing core body temperature (CBT), but CBT is very narrowly regulated by the body. Even our body's smallest biochemical processes involving proteins and enzymes can only function properly in a very narrow window of temperature. Generally, cold temperatures slow these processes down and warmer temperatures speed them up. When the temperature gets too hot, though, proteins can change shape and stop working. When we're working out in the heat and start to feel fatigued, many people try to push themselves harder without taking into account how the humidity or other environmental conditions impact the body. When sweat evaporates off our body, it takes heat with it. Humidity makes it much harder for us to cool down since it is more difficult to get rid of that sweat through evaporation. In a way, it is almost trapped in our body and the heat isn't able to dissipate as easily. Under these conditions, the body's natural ability to regulate its core temperature becomes constrained. Conversely, when the environment is extremely dry, we evaporate sweat too quickly and also dehydrate rapidly via increased sweat loss. Those who are used to long distance exercise may be familiar with the concept of cardiovascular drift, a gradual increase in heart rate during steady-state exercise even after just 10-20 minutes of moderate exercise in warm temperatures. This happens as fluid dynamics in the body change. Increased sweating leads to decreased blood volume, more blood is pushed to the periphery, and that leads to decreased blood pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Our heart rate increases to maintain the same amount of blood flow and oxygen supply to the working muscles. This process is even more apparent and active in high heat conditions.staying cool when workouts get hot by Ashok Bhandari, ND and Griffin McMath, NDemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.8Heat Illness, Exhaustion and Heat Stroke Heat illness is the umbrella term that heat exhaustion and heatstroke fall under, but generally it is used to describe the early stage of heat-related health issues. Think of it as a continuum. Heat stress or illness The body begins to lose its ability to compensate against the heat stressors of the person's environment. Heat exhaustion The body reaches temperature ranges between 101 - 104 degrees Fahrenheit. We start to become dehydrated to the point where it's affecting our performance and our health. That's when we start to see the signs that our body is really compensating - our skin becomes clammy and moist, and we notice increased sweating in an attempt to cool the body down more rapidly. We may become somewhat pale, start to get a headache, and even feel faint or dizzy because of the decreased blood volume. Some also may experience nausea and heat cramps. If untreated at this point, our condition quickly worsens and may progress to heat stroke. Heat stroke A dangerous and life-threatening condition. When this sets in, headaches become severe and throbbing. There is no sweating, and the skin becomes hot and dry because the sweat that was there has evaporated and the body is unable to produce more sweat to keep the body cool. Severe dehydration has set in which means blood volume has dropped dramatically and then the core body temperature rises incredibly fast. Vomiting begins, and commonly, even experiencing delirium or a loss of consciousness. If still conscious, the mind is unable to make appropriate decisions due to reduced comprehension and awareness. This is seen in various highly competitive sports where athletes push themselves past the point of heat exhaustion and they become confused and delirious. Brain damage is possible at this stage and cooling down the athlete or person experiencing heat stroke has to happen immediately. At this point it's far beyond risking losing the game due to decreased performance, they're at an increased risk of injury that could set them back not just a few weeks, they are at the point of risking their life. Warning Signs and Prevention Stop exercising at the first signs of heat exhaustion. If you start getting cramps, feel a little lightheaded or dizzy, or your skin is becoming clammy, take breaks, find shade, rehydrate and catch your breath. Once you feel yourself cooled back down, you can consider starting again. Prevent heat illnesses Avoid the high heat and high humid conditions with sports activity. For instance, 98 degree weather with 40% to 50% humidity is not a good time to exercise. 1. Consider exercising earlier in the morning or later in the evening. 2. Avoid direct sunlight when you are working outdoors - choose a shaded environment. 3. Choose the right equipment, like moisture wicking breathable clothing that allows you to sweat. 4. Choose activities that don't require heavy equipment, such as padding, gloves, helmets and heavy boots. They stop your body from being able to dissipate heat and can become problematic. 5. Try nasal-only breathing during high heat exercise. This helps prevent excess dehydration from mouth breathing (which is associated with increased water loss), and can decrease net water loss by nearly 40% when switching from mouth breathing.staying cool when workouts get hot ...continuedemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.96. Keep hands cool during exercise as it can help cool the whole body efficiently. As an example, you can toss a cold water bottle or ice pack back and forth between your hands during a run in the high heat. Training Anyway in these Conditions, Will Our Bodies Adapt? There is an interesting phenomenon with human adaptation to cold and hot temperatures - we are actually relatively good at it. But our body tends to focus only on one type of temperature adaptation and can't really be great at both hot and cold at the same time. Typically, when we are accustomed and acclimated to heat, we can workout. But, if we've spent a bunch of time in cold winter weather, or indoors, and not spending time in warm weather exercising, it takes extra time getting used to that. So if you're getting ready for summer sports but had a cold winter, your prehab needs to be longer and involve more heat-acclimation. Don't Take These Risks There are some risk factors that should be avoided if you exercise outdoors in the heat, they include: Exercising when already dehydrated from recent alcohol intake, When you are dealing with a viral or bacterial infection or are simply feeling under the weather, Overestimating how fit you are, assuming you'll be able to jump right back into an aggressive fitness routine in hot weather, Exercising away from your home environment, such as running a marathon in the Arizona summer when you live in the Pacific Northwest. Don't Play Through the Pain, Especially in the Heat It can be detrimental to long-term performance, recovery, and overall health if you push too hard in the heat. The harder you push, the more damage you create; you may raise CBT, break down proteins, muscle, and even neurons (those don't come back). There is a point of no return with this kind of injury, when there are no benefits. We can falsely assume that a few extra minutes while trying to push the cardiovascular system or metabolic system a little further in that heat might be a good thing. You are much better off stopping a training session early and allowing the body to recover well. You can choose to be stronger for the next time or potentially not recover and be out for four to five days or worse. This is similar to working out in the gym and pushing too hard, and being too sore to work out for the next week. In the end, you lose training time anyway. Recovery is where we make our gains. If you're not recovering because you pushed too hard then the session you just did now becomes irrelevant.staying cool when workouts get hot ...continued emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.10staying cool when workouts get hot ...continued If you're exercising or training in the heat, as exciting as some of the summer activities and sports can be, it's important to remember a few key tips: prepare well with hydration, acclimation, and prehab. Adjust performance goals during activity - don't be a hero. Shorter workouts and better recovery is always more valuable than longer, more intense sessions with prolonged and worse recovery. Recipe for Hydration There's some really interesting research showing that if people double their fluid intake, even for a week prior to high heat physical activity, they retain up to 600 milliliters of water. This is almost half a liter more than the body's natural fluid balance. This prehydration can really help when you're entering hot environments to exercise. During heavy exercise in hot environments, exercise can produce anywhere from 600-to-1200 mls of sweat in an hour of exercise. If you're working out for greater than 30 minutes in the heat, add electrolytes sodium chloride, potassium and magnesium malate to help prevent heat illness. We have to replenish the salts that we lose through all that sweat. Dr. Bhandari's formula is 0.5-1 tbsp raw honey, malate in 250ml water, per every 15 minutes of exercise. Recommendations during high heat exercise: First, hydrate before exercise by consuming at least two-to-three liters of water daily (more if you are exercising). Keep high-water foods, apples, berries, melons, cucumbers, on hand to restore sugar, electrolytes and minerals. Maximize fluid intake with coconut water as a base for rehydration. After exercise, drink 1.25-1.5 liters of water plus electrolytes per kg of body weight lost during heavy exercise. Keep carb intake to 0.8g/kg + 0.4-.8g/kg body weight of protein (Dr. Bhandari says increased protein intake, especially after high heat workouts, results in potentially greater muscle breakdown). Salt your food to replace minerals and electrolytes. the mind game called sports Winning Over the Head Game, with Coach Jonah Herscu, NBA Sacramento Kings By Amy Rothenberg, ND emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved. 11 Keeping the mind healthy and nimble can be just as important as the rest of the body for optimal sports performance. Naturopathic doctor, Amy Rothenberg ND, sat down with her son, Jonah Herscu, to talk about the role of the head game for athletes. Coach Herscu is an assistant coach for the NBA Sacramento Kings. Dr. Rothenberg: Jonah, what do you mean by the head game? Coach JH: The head game is an overall approach to your life and your craft. It is a set of skills and an attitude that support your ability to have a wide range of emotions and experiences, while staying focused, positive and effective in whatever you are trying to accomplish on or off the court or playing field. A strong head game transcends the ups and the downs of sport and of life. It reminds you to cultivate equanimity and to not worry about things you cannot control, rather to stay focused on those things you can. You fall to the level of your preparation. Most athletes prepare physically, but if you're not preparing mentally, then when you face adversity, you will be in trouble. And everyone faces adversity, whether you are a championship team member or a weekend warrior. We can all be upbeat and have a good attitude when things are going well, but the benefits of a strong head game manifest most when things are not going well. Dr. Rothenberg: What's the best way to build a strong head game? Coach JH: The answer will be different for every person. Develop and practice habits every day, and here I suggest less is more. Choose a couple things to focus on and then refine that focus and integrate it into your day-to-day. For me, that includes positive self-talk, and putting my energy into those things I can control, like my routine, exercise, meditation and eating well. Dr. Rothenberg: What can throw off an athlete or team member's head game? Coach JH: Things that are out of their control. Distractions like a bad call or another player trash talking or an opponent doing something unexpected. For other athletes, it could be the weather or an intimidating crowd or a distracting thought from other parts of life. Or maybe something unplanned happens, like you forgot, say, your lucky socks. Players with a strong head game adapt and bring their best effort even when caught off guard by internal or external distractions. Dr. Rothenberg: Do you feel there's openness to talking about and training for the more psychological parts of the game? Coach JH: Definitely. As a society we are becoming better at de-stigmatizing mental health issues. In the last number of years many professional athletes have come forward to share their own stories, including WNBA player Liz Cambage, NBA players DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love, and Michael Phelps, the Olympic swimmer. There are more conversations about mental health than ever before. Most NBA teams have psychologists, sports psychologists and performance coaches on staff for ongoing mental training, Jonah Herscu MA, is an Assistant Coach for the NBA Sacramento Kings. Previously he has worked as an assistant coach in the WNBA, the NBA Development League and as video coordinator and advance scout across the leagues. A native of Amherst, MA he played competitively both Basketball and Ultimate Frisbee though his high school and college careers. Dr. Amy Rothenberg is a licensed naturopathic doctor for over 35 years. In addition to Jonah, she is a proud mom to Sophia and Misha. When not busy with natural medicine practice, teaching and writing, she enjoys healthy cooking, training for triathlons and time on the ballroom dance floor. emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021.

Meditation apps for players, positive imagery and visualization, as well as one-on-one counseling, are all essential pieces to helping players define and hone in on habits that support a positive head game. Dr. Rothenberg: What would you say are some common habits among players and coaches, who have the strongest and most effective head games? Coach JH: One of our King's coaches, Rico Hines says, \"Be at peace with yourself.\" Don't worry about impressing other people, be confident in who you are, first as a person, and then as an athlete. Of course, you never have enough confidence until you have too much. You don't want to doubt yourself, but don't become cocky. You may not always have positive thoughts, or you may have moments of distractions or self-doubt, but having a good head game includes the capacity to, when you lose focus, quickly bring yourself back to the task at hand and mentally lock into a better zone that leads back to your effective practiced skill. Dr. Rothenberg: What do you do to stay in shape and healthy while you're on the road, physically and mentally? Coach JH: I am a creature of habit and very committed to my routine. I meditate when I wake up, I do a core workout. I run outside regardless of weather, so I am sure to spend some time outdoors every day. I follow that with a stretching routine. I do a Sudoku puzzle to get my head going, and I read at least one chapter of whatever book I am reading. This daily routine, which I have done for many years, has a positive impact on my overall health and on my head game. I take daily nutritional supplements and am mindful about my diet, after all, my parents are naturopathic doctors! One of the perks of working in the NBA is that the team puts tremendous resources into nourishing its players for optimal performance and longevity in the sport. The coaching staff is a beneficiary there, too. I limit alcohol intake. Lastly, I put a premium on regular and adequate sleep, not always easy with our travel schedule and changing time zones. I make up for lost sleep with naps almost every day. I aim to nap for an hour and 20-25 minutes or if time is limited, just a 20-25 minute catnap can help. Dr. Rothenberg: What's on the top of your reading list for people who want to improve their head game particularly with regard to getting and staying fit and competitive regardless of sport or level of play? Coach JH: Mind Gym: An Athlete's Guide to Inner Excellence by Gary Mack and David Casstevens is my all-time favorite book on this topic. It is appropriate for student athletes as young as 8-or-9, all the way up to weekend warriors and professional players. It's an easy read and immediately inspiring. Others include: Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections On and Off the Court by legendary basketball coach John Wooden with Steve Jamison. This book has many applications across all sports and life Grit by Angela Duckworth is further essential reading on the power of passion and perseverance.the mind game called sports ...continuedemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021.

Though her leg was numb, she and her partner Craig Buntin placed third with a bronze. The team had only two slots for the Olympics, which meant they would stay home. \"It was a wake-up call. My injury was from overuse,\" Duhamel said. \"And I thought, 'if I can prevent this type of pain from ever happening again, I will do it.\" After experiencing consecutive pain-free days following a chiropractic appointment, she stopped all weekly visits to her physiotherapist and the long-term pain medications she'd been taking. It was time to turn her life around. She started taking vitamin B-12, upped her Pilates and yoga routines and added a practice called eccentrics. Each helped to prevent injury, but also added flexibility, elongation and strength. She also built her own care team of health experts outside of the Skate Canada care providers, who were assigned to the team. They included an osteopathic doctor, who is now with the US skating team, a chiropractor, and a massage therapist who was also trained in acupuncture. Though the team would not pay for her massage therapist to travel with her, she eventually paid out of pocket because it was critical to her wellbeing. \"I made the decision to do exactly what I did during training while competing.\" In a sport that looks like ballet on ice, the rigors of pairs figure skating can be deceiving. For instance, rotations take a toll on the body. \"I had two cupping sets that I brought with me to competitions to help with a chronic back problem,\" she says. \"In skating you only rotate to the left, so after 35 years of turning the same way, my left side was stuck from repeatedly turning only one way.\" The combination of cupping, massage, acupuncture and movement work from her osteopathic doctor and chiropractor were critical to avoiding injury. Her persistence would lead to a bronze medal in the 2014 Olympics, gold and silver in the 2018 Olympics, two world titles, and becoming a seven-time national champion. Whole Foods as Fuel As Duhamel's commitment to integrative therapies pushed her career forward, so did her commitment to plant-based foods. Instead of eating string cheese and granola bars, which is what the team nutritionist recommended, she honed in on the nutritional value of whole foods. \"I didn't have my first avocado or mango until I was 22,\" she says. \"I grew up on meat and potatoes. The only fruit I ever ate was at the bottom of a yogurt cup.\" Her kick start into vegan foods began with a simple book on the subject. \"I am an all-or-nothing kind of person,\" she says. \"The next morning after reading the book, I had black coffee and cleaned out my fridge,\" she says. \"It wasn't as easy to give up Diet Coke,\" she admits (that took a little more time). \"My skin got this wonderful glow. And I started to notice that my body was recovering quickly after training. I was recovering faster than my partner who was doing the same training. But he was getting injured. He was lacking energy,\" she recounts. \"The only thing we were doing differently was the food.\"emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.14fueling the champion mind and body ...continued A plant-focused nutrition plan gave her a new outlook on her skating career, one with foods she loved, along with no more injuries and better mental clarity. Always a competitor, that wasn't enough. \"This led me down a path where I wanted to learn more.\" While competing, she enrolled in the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition in Montreal to study holistic nutrition in 2010. The CSNN school allowed her to study by correspondence while she trained, toured and competed. Her hunger for learning continued. She later enrolled in the Alive Academy in Vancouver in 2015 to reinforce her interest in vegan eating for athletes. Eating well while in training can be difficult. Eating well while traveling and competing is even more challenging. Duhamel recounts a particularly horrific performance. Though it was a small competition and didn't put a dent in her overall career, it was a lesson she would never forget. Coming off the ice, she mentally replayed the tape of her day. What had she done differently? She quickly realized it wasn't about training or preparation, her body had not been fueled properly. From then on, she carried a lunch bag filled with healthy snacks. If she had a media appointment, she ate while being interviewed. In between warming up, she ate bits of banana and other healthy snacks like Mama Chia pouches. \"I started to notice that if I ate well while training, I could pay attention better and grasp what my coaches were telling me. No matter how nervous or busy I was, I had to eat.\" Duhamel also noticed that a whole-foods, plant-focused diet kept her hydrated. Though because she trained on ice and never trained longer than 50-minute blocks, she didn't sweat. Even so, she and her teammates were required to do hydration tests and often competed to see who was the most hydrated. Duhamel typically scored higher than others. She relied on water with a little beet powder, plain coconut water, or hot lemon water to stay warm while training on the ice. As she delved deeper into a vegan diet and her wins continued, other athletes noticed. She began to mentor figure skaters to help them navigate a plant-based diet while competing. They too were looking for whole-food ways to heal their bodies, bring down inflammation and to allow them to compete longer. Duhamel realizes that what she eats for her own wellness and recovery may not work for everyone. She helps other skaters understand the need for foods that may be missing from their diet, like whole grains such as oatmeal and quinoa, as well as healthy fats and more greens. In a sport where winning is decided by decimal points, it's easy to get caught up in the numbers whether it's a final score, grams of macronutrients or one's weight. As a general rule, Duhamel says it's best to keep the numbers to the scoring aspect of the sport and focus instead on the nutritional density of the food. During the pandemic, she taught online cooking classes to athletes. \"I told the athletes, 'I am not going to talk about calories, or grams of protein, or fat,'\" she says. \"I stayed clear of all these numbers and focused on the why. Why are we putting lentils in our muffins? What does that do for us as athletes? Why are we putting hemp seeds in our smoothies? Why is it important to eat nut butters, coconut oil and avocados?\" She wants the athletes to understand that if they fuel their bodies properly before training, they will have sustained fuel to train harder and recover more quickly. Since skating is a performance sport, the issue of disordered eating is a reality. \"We wear tiny dresses, so there is an expectation of appearance. It's a tough subject to talk about,\" she admits. \"When skaters switch to a plant-based diet, it's naturally lower in calories, so I encourage them to eat more. They need to have healthy fats and whole grains.\" She emphasizes that for skating, performance and recovery is not all about protein. \"Recovering optimally is about carbohydrates, fats and proteins.\" She encourages athletes to rely on whole foods and less on the protein bars and powders. \"I am often asked, \"What is the best protein powder for my smoothies?'\" Her answer, \"hemp seeds and kale - more whole foods and less of the package and processed foods they are familiar with.\" Her favorite recovery food is fresh pineapple, for anti-inflammatory bromelain, sprinkled with hemp seeds, for healthy fats and protein. Today, Duhamel is a new Mom who plans to use her training and education to pursue teaching and helping other athletes with everything she learned in her Olympic journey. She is grateful that she followed her own wellness path, which not only made her a world champion, it also allowed her to leave the sport with a healthy mind and body. She is grateful to have found other passions that she can pursue as she transitions away from being a full-time athlete.emerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021.

It is a gravity sport, which means weight matters. The heavier the sled, the faster the ride. The thing was, Jones is 5 foot 3 inches strong, but at least 30-40 pounds lighter than her competitors and team mates. Her slight build was more like a figure skater than a women's luger, giving her the nickname \"pint-sized wonder.\" Known for resilience and hard work, she was the first in and the last out at the gym. She tried to bulk up. Jones and another teammate would regularly consume an entire Dairy Queen ice cream cake in one sitting. They even ordered ahead, with sayings like \"You are the coolest\" inscribed in luminescent frosting on top of the cake. Jones says though ice-cream cake wasn't first on the team menu, whey protein powder was highly recommended to bulk up. But the Ice cream and whey protein never really worked, all Jones had to show for it was weight loss and a terrible stomach ache. \"Everyone feels this way after eating whey,\" the team dieticians said. Despite her small stature, Jones toured on the Canadian team for six years from 2010 to 2016 and was second-ranked Canadian woman for three straight years. Her Olympic dreams came true in 2014, where she competed in Sochi at the age of 24. But, within less than a year, a blinding pain took over from her neck down to the nerves in her legs. Within a few days her entire body seized and she was rendered immobile. A doctor shared the bad news, her back was broken, but not her spirit. While the rest of the team went on touring and competing, Jones was left behind to heal and reflect. She formed what she calls Team Jones, a group of coaches, doctors and physiotherapy trainers to help her heal her broken back. But that wasn't enough. \"I did a complete 180-degree change,\" Jones says. Always the competitor, she challenged herself to give up sugar for 30 days. At first glance, she thought it would be easy. Then she realized that yogurt and granola bars she ate frequently had as much sugar as a candy bar. \"I was really angry when I started detoxing from sugar. But over time I felt amazing. This was the first time I realized that what I ate mattered,\" Jones said. Avoiding sugar led to shedding other inflammatory foods like dairy - no more whey protein shakes and Dairy Queen. Plant-based smoothies, with berries, greens and chlorella became the norm. \"I started moving away from inflammatory foods like pasta and dairy, and toward more plant-based foods, with B-vitamins and higher quality meats.\" Not everyone was supportive of her eating changes. \"Many thought 'you can't eat only or mostly plant foods and be an athlete,'\" she recalls. While in the best shape of her life, Jones' detractors were quickly silenced when Arianne Jones, Olympic luge underdog and tireless advocate for health and balance By Kimberly Lord Stewartemerge stronger \u00a9 Published by the Institute for Natural Medicine, 2021. All Rights Reserved.17Arianne Jones, Olympic luge underdog and tireless advocate for health and balance ...continued in February 2016, she won her first World Cup gold medal for team luge in Germany. She turned her training and professional goals toward the next Olympics. The victory celebration and her future Olympic dream were short-lived. By May of 2016 she was hit with chills and body aches that felt like the flu. A week later she was back to training only to get sick again. This pattern repeated until she was falling asleep on the gym floor and pulling over while driving because the fatigue was so overwhelming. Deep breathing became difficult and brain fog set in. Jones describes the feeling like a full-body concussion with every nerve in her body set afire. Frightened, she reached out to her trainers and coaches for help, who had no idea what was wrong and suggested she get psychological help. In a world where being tough is celebrated and weakness scorned, she was told that she just couldn't cut it any longer. Insulted, deeply hurt, and unable to train or compete as she has done with such determination in the past, Jones was forced to retire from her sport just a few months after bringing home a gold medal. It would take another four years to get a definitive diagnosis of Lyme Disease from a new kind of Team Jones. This time it was with the help of an integrative doctor trained in functional medicine and a naturopathic doctor trained in Chinese Medicine who specializes in Lyme Disease. Her Lyme disease caused a chronic inflammatory response. Jones strongly believes that had she not made so many dramatic changes to her diet and health before being infected, her health would have suffered even more so. \"It accidently played a big role,\" she says. It's not always easy and it's not over. \"It's been a roller coaster,\" Jones admits. Today, as she looks toward the future, she is just as determined as during the height of her training, because she understands so much more about what keeps the body and mind strong, healthy and balanced. \"I have the mindset that I will put this in remission with the help of Eastern and Western medicine.\" Setting Top Podium Performance Goals for Others In the midst of her Lyme Disease journey, Jones found the energy to become certified in holistic nutrition from the Canadian School of Natural Nutrition in Calgary and became a certified chef at the Natural Gourmet Institute (now the Institute of Culinary Education). In hindsight, her determination and education to get to the cause of her symptoms helped keep her gut healthy, which supported her immune health through a devastatingly difficult virus. It was this innate fighting spirit that is the foundation for her new company, The Podium Performance Program (PPP). She and her business partner, Paige Lawrence (a Canadian pair figure skater and Olympian) founded the company to help women develop life-changing tools to \"eat, drink and think\" better. Whether it's a health challenge or a career change, the PPP program is designed to give women the toolkit they need to take control of their goals, fulfill their dreams and tackle life's challenges.

All Rights Reserved. 18real food for athletes Olympian marathoner Shalane Flanagan and healthy lifestyle expert Elyse Kopecky on eating real food that is quick, nutritious and exciting to your taste buds. How to eat to nourish your body, while staying active, should be as easy as a walk in the park. But in reality, it can feel more like an ultra-marathon with advice being thrown at you in every turn. Shalane and Elyse know all too well how what seems like good advice can go terribly wrong. The two met in college when they ran cross country together at University of North Carolina. Their friendship and common interests in running and real-food nutrition led them to write their first book together Run Fast, Eat Slow,: Nourishing Recipes for Athletes and a second book, Run Fast, Cook Fast, Eat Slow, both by Rodale Press. A new third book is forthcoming, so if you like what you see here keep an eye out. The two women are committed to helping runners understand the importance of fueling one's body to perform well, avoid injury and avoid food phobias and dependency on processed foods for sake of convenience. The Institute for Natural Medicine was particularly impressed by the emphasis on whole foods and macro-nutrients like healthy fats, complex carbohydrates and proteins that the body needs when you put it through the rigors of training and a very active lifestyle. The two women understand the importance of fueling the body with nutritious foods. Shalane, has a long list of accolades, including (but not limited to) being an Olympic Silver medalist, four-time Olympian and third fastest American runner in history and fastest woman to run the Boston Marathon. Co-author, Elyse is a runner, nutrition coach, healthy and holistic chef, inspirational speaker and mother of two. In Run Fast, Cook Fast, Eat Slow, they talk about the pop-culture food fad pitfalls they each fell into, particularly uber-restrictive diets and avoiding fats. They get very real about unhealthy relationships with food for the sake of one's sport and how athletic amenorrhea (absence of menstruation from energy deficiency) is a problem among endurance athletes. For instance, when Elyse was 30, she worked in Switzerland, where her diet changed from low fat to full fat and for the first time, she got her period naturally. \"This indulgent diet that I learned to label in our country as unhealthy, actually made me stronger, happier, and healthier than ever before,\" she writes. Every recipe in their books is a lesson in debunking the myths that actually prevent athletes of all types from staying strong and performing at their best. Shalane says that before Elyse helped her change her diet, she often ran 17-24 miles per day. Hanger followed these grueling workouts. \"I found myself reaching for pretzels, chips, processed bars, or cereal as snacks between meals or before bed. I knew this wasn't ideal but I was hungry ALL THE TIME!,\" she writes. Now she says, \"One of the best gifts I've been given to enhance my running career and overall well-being has been learning to cook.\" Unfortunately, we can't share all the fantastic recipes here (we recommend you buy the books), but the following pages are a few from Run Fast, Cook Fast, Eat Slow to help with sustainable energy, fend off inflammation and hydrate while recovering from a workout.Run Fast.
