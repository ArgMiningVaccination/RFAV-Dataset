Listing a study does not mean it has been evaluated by the U.S. Federal Government. Read our | |ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00317603| | | Recruitment Status : Completed First Posted : April 25, 2006 Results First Posted : October 14, 2021 Last Update Posted : April 1, 2022 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT00317603) of Vaccination With Autologous, Lethally Irradiated Breast Cancer Cells Engineered by Adenoviral Mediated Gene Transfer to Secrete Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients| |Actual Study Start Date |Actual will be administered on days 1,8,15 and every two weeks thereafter until the supply of vaccine has been exhausted or the patient is removed from study. As indicated in 5.2.5, vaccine cell dosage will be approximately 1x10 7 , 4x10 6 , 1x10 6 , or 1x10 5 on the final cell yield. | Biological: Autologous, Lethally Irradiated Breast Cancer Cells | Vaccine will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 29 and then every 2 weeks until the supply of vaccine runs out - Minimum Number of Vaccine Doses Created Using Participant Tumor Sample [ Time Frame: Vaccine doses created and banked soon after registration, up to 8 days. ]Tumor samples were obtained via malignant effusion or a surgically accessible tumor nodule of 2 cm in greatest diameter. Tumor cells were processed to single cell suspension and transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Then, the cells washed extensively and irradiated with 10,000 cGy. Over the next 14 days, sterility cultures were tested for endotoxin and mycoplasma contamination. Individual vaccine cell dose and number varied depending on the final cell yield from vaccine production. The minimal dose was 1 x 10^5 cells and the maximal dose was 1 x 10^7 cells. - Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events [ Time Frame: Up to 58 Months ]Number of participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. - Number of Participants With RECIST Criteria Responses [ Time Frame: Up to 14 Years ]Clinical outcomes as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
