What we currently know asmodern medicine grew largely fromthe discoveries made since the scien-tific revolution and the ongoing link-age of medical knowledge to rigorousresearch methods. The coupling ofexpert knowledge to compassionatedelivery of care\u2014modern medicine\u2014is often held out as one of the mosttangible examples of human progress.It produced a dynamic, self-correct-ing system that evolves and makes useof new discoveries to deliver the bestpatient care possible. But not everybody came along for the ride. The progress of scientificmed icine continues in stark contrastwith other sectarian, cultural, and overt -ly religious belief systems related tohuman health. These remained staticand there is little to distinguish beliefsystems like naturopathy, homeopa-thy, chiropractic, traditional Chinesemedicine, and so on today from thepractices as they were originally con-stituted. In the early 1800s a schism devel- oped between medical practitionerswho espoused the beliefs of JosephHahnemann, the inventor of homeo -pathy (where infinitely dilute prepara-tions of noxious substances are pur-ported to cure illness), and those whofelt such ideas were inadequate. It wasHahnemann himself who coined theterm allopath. The term was intended to indicate, in a pejorative way, thatconventional practitioners of the early19th century only treated disease byopposing symptoms and that theyoffered nothing in terms of preventing illness or addressing the root causes ofdisease. The term allopath was reject- ed by mainstream medicine, but hascontinued to be used by homeo pathsand other unconventional practition-ers when referring to medical doctors. While physicians of the early 1800s had much less to offer patients thanthey do today, a knowledge of anato-my, the natural history of many dis-eases, and the early appreciation ofthe microbial causes of infectious dis-eases had begun to allow physiciansto do far more than was captured bythe derogatory term. Indeed, as timewent on conventional medicine beganto develop and deploy discoveriessuch as vaccines, insulin, new medi-cines and surgeries, cancer therapies,and public health campaigns that notonly treated symptoms but effectivelyeliminated a large number of diseasesand prevented many others. It is all the more ironic, then, that the term allopath has become more commonly and effectively leveled byadherents of complementary/alter - native/integrative therapies at themedical profession. Perhaps unknow-ingly, some physicians apply the termto their own trade, not understandingthat the term connotes a practitionervery different from themselves. Theword is derived from the Greek allos (against) and pathos (suffering) and really denotes a process of diminish-ing symptoms. It is notable that whilemodern medicine has done more tounderstand, treat, cure, and preventdisease than any other entity in the history of humankind, practitionerswho essentially do nothing but em -ploy placebo effects to make patientsbelieve they're getting somewhat bet-ter are the ones who somehow are notallopaths. More interestingly , depicting sci- entific medicine as allopathic medicineis often used as a device to definedebate at an administrative level whenunconventional practitioners wish toposition themselves as equal partnerson the health care playing field. TheBCMA has heard this from the mouthsof government officials in the discus-sions around scope of practice, and itappears with some regularity in thesubmissions of unconventional prac-titioners to health ministries whenextra status is being sought. Whenadvocating for scarce governmenthealth dollars, it sounds so much bet-ter to offer naive administrators achoice between naturopathic, homeo-pathic, allopathic, Native healing, andEastern medicine than it does to tellthe truth: that you can choose betweenmedicine that's consistent with thebest information available, or thingsthat aren't. \u2014Lloyd Oppel, MD Chair, Allied Health and Alternative Therapies Committee council onhealth promotion Allopathy \u2014a term that diminishes the profession Depicting scientific medicine as allopathic medicine is often used as a device to define debate at an administrative level when unconventional practitioners wish to position themselves as equal partners on the health care playing field.
