If you were to get an acupuncture treatment solely for preventative purposes (aka, a \"tune-up\"), your acupuncturist would select a group of points that do the following: boost qi (our vital energy and the foundation of how everything in our body works, including the immune system) strengthen digestion (that connection between gut health and immunity) strengthen the lungs (in Chinese Medicine, the lungs are our first line defense against contracting external \"wind conditions\" like colds, flus, and allergies) settle the mind (stress can weaken the immune system) In between/ in lieu of your regular acupuncture treatments, a great way to stay healthy during \"viral\" times is with acupressure. Applying pressure to acupuncture points can help stimulate the channels and communicate with the nervous system to achieve the above actions. Some helpful points to stimulate our natural defenses are: GB20, KI27, ST36, LU7, and LI4. When locating points, feel for a tender spot or a place when your finger seems to dip slightly. Most acupuncture points are noticeable once you find them! Spend 30 seconds on each point. Apply firm pressure while breathing steadily into your abdomen. Tip: Press the point on each side of the body to feel which one is more tender/sensitive. If you notice a difference, focus your acupressure session on the tender side. Bonus tip: Acupressure points for immune support pairs well with eucalyptus, pine, tea tree, frankincense, and lavender essential oils ACUPRESSURE POINT SELECTION FOR IMMUNE SUPPORT: Gall Bladder 20 (GB-20) \"wind pool\" Location: on the back of the head, in the depression between the upper portion of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the trapezius Actions: protects the body from exterior pathology (\"wind invasions\"); releases a headache and a stiff neck; nourishes the brain and benefits the eyes; and, clears the head and calms the spirit.
