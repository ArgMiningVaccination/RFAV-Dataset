The MIIX System through the Mississippi Department of Health.

Two hours of continuing education on vaccinations are required if vaccine training occurred more than one year ago. The pharmacist must be currently certified in basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The pharmacist is the ordering prescriber , not the prescriber from a previous protocol. The HHS recently ordered that pharmacy technicians have the authority to administer the COVID -19 vaccine, with a pharmacist's supervision, during the ongoing pandemic. The Mississippi Board of Pharmacy 's current regulations require that licensed professionals administer vaccines; however, upon recognizing the Executive Order, we have recom mendations to emphasize or add: The Executive Order allows for the following : The pharmacy technician or pharmacy intern/extern must be registered with the Board of Pharmacy. A pharmacist MUST supervise the qualified pharmacy technician or pharmacy intern/extern. The qualified pharmacy technician or pharmacy intern/extern must complete a practical training program that is approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). This training program must include a hands -on injection technique and the recognition and treatment of emergency reactions to vaccines. The pharmacy technician must be currently certified in basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Mississippi Board of Pharmacy Technician (one pharmacist to three technicians) ratio will still be enforced. The Executive Order allows pharmacy technicians to administer immunizations ONLY for COVID -19 to persons age three or older and vaccines to persons aged three through 18. The Board recommends that a training file is kept on each technician participating in the vaccination program. Compliance agents will check to ensure each technicia n has the proper certification and training required "}
