A easy black gray background or similar. Thanks for the watch Veronica September 5, 2023 Really cool layout! I do not get what the \"move bar\" is for? On my venu I can not change/edit it Petra Kamman September 3, 2023 Nice watch face. Is it possible to add degrees celcius besides Fahrenheit? Ted Just September 2, 2023 Great watch face. Love it. Only addition I would make or ask for would be for body battery to be displayed on either of the side bars, but even with out that it's permanently on my watch as its so clear and informative. Job September 1, 2023 Absolutely amazing watch face, I get to put all the stuff I want. I only have one problem though i opted for sunrise/sunset on data field 2 but on my watch I get (gps ?)Is there something i need to do ? Clifford D Meadows August 31, 2023 Only watchface I like and have been comfortable with since Venu debuted. I hope it will be upgraded to function with Venu 3! Herrera August 30, 2023 Excellent face! But I'd like to display active calories as well on the main screen. Can you please add it? Ji\u00ed ech August 30, 2023 Definitely the best face for Garmin watches! What about FR 965 and VENU 3 compatibility - AMOLED 454x454? Has anyone tried please? Sartura August 29, 2023 I like the style. Is therw a way to always Show seconds, not just on gesture? Natalie McBryant August 25, 2023 My FAVORITE watch face for my Venu 2 plus!! It tells me everything I want to know at a glance in a very well-designed format. Excellent job! Would love to see more colors for the dark theme (especially a soft pink and/or lavender/purple option). Keep up the great work! Kenny Zaremba August 17, 2023 Great watch face. I would prefer to see battery percentage as an indicator but otherwise this has become my favorite. Guillou August 16, 2023 Un excellent fond pour ecran, design, fonctionnel et dont les donnees sont claires et lisibles. Le plus, la date est en francais ! Adoptee !! "}
