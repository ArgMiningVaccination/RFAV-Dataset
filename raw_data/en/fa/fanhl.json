The two-dose Sputnik vaccine was 91.6% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe and moderate disease in a study involving 19,866 participants. The data were published in [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00191-4/fulltext). No data, however, was available on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the vaccine's efficacy. By comparison, the single-dose JNJ vaccine was 57% to 72% effective at preventing moderate to severe disease, depending on the geography. The vaccine was least effective in South Africa, where 95% of infections were the result of a more-infectious variant circulating there. AstraZeneca's (LON: [AZN](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/AZN:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit46qC1tLsAhVFHjQIHTpgCLsQ3ecFMAB6BAgXEBk)) two-dose vaccine was between 62% and 90% effective, depending on the dosing regimen. The organization that developed the vaccine, the Gameleya Institute, has experience developing vaccines for Ebola, MERS and smallpox. Like those from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, its vaccine is adenovirus-vectored. The Sputnik V vaccine, however, is novel in its use of two separate adenovirus vectors. The first dose of the vaccine uses adenovirus-26, which is the same variant Johnson & Johnson uses in their vaccine. The second dose uses adenovirus-5, a commonly used viral vector used in clinical research. CanSinoBIO-Beijing Institute of Biotechnology is also experimenting with an adenovirus-5-based vaccine. Gameleya Institute scientists have also [experimented with AstraZeneca's non-replicating chimpanzee adenovirus](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/studies-to-investigate-combining-astrazeneca-and-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccines/) for "}
