Dempsey, MD, PhD, MPH Background: Rural adolescent vaccination rates lag behind urban. We sought to assess rural-urban differ- ences in barriers to adolescent vaccination, perceived parental vaccine attitudes, and immunization delivery practices among public health nursing (PHN), pediatric (Peds), and family medicine (FM) clinicians. Methods: Internet and mail survey of Colorado PHN, Peds, and FM clinicians from June-August 2019. Study population was recruited from local health plans and the American Medical AssociationPhysician Masterle. Rural and urban responses were compared using Cochran Armitage trend, Fisher's exact, and chi-square tests. Results: Response rate was 38% (163/433; 91 rural, 72 urban). Rural respondents were less likely than urban to agree most patients have insurance that covers vaccination (86% vs 97%; P= .02). Rural respondents were less likely than urban to indicate most parents in their practice would agree with statements about vac-cine benets ( P= .02) and trust in medical providers (P = .05). Rural respondents were more likely than urban to report adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines at public health departments (65%vs 28%; P<.0001) and less likely to report adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines at pharmacies (26% vs 45%; P= .02). Fewer providers strongly recommended HPV vaccine (81% for females, 80% for males 11 to 12 years) than other adolescent immunizations (Tdap: 97%, MenACWY at 11 to 12 years:87%; 11 to 17 years: 87%; each P<.005, rural-urban responses did not differ). Conclusions: Rural barriers to adolescent vaccination include logistic issues and parental vaccine attitudes. Efforts to improve rural adolescent vaccination should include public health departments andaddress vaccine condence and access barriers. ( J Am Board Fam Med 2021;34:937-949.)

Downloaded from found that 90% of all 13- to 17-year-olds had received 1 dose of Tdap, 89% had received 1 dose MenACWY, 72% had received 1d o s eH P V , and 54% had completed the HPV vaccination se-ries. 3In the same year, vaccination rates for 13- to 17-year-olds living in rural areas were 89%, 84%,64%, and 47% for 1 dose of Tdap, 1 dose MenACWY, 1 dose HPV, and HPV series com- pletion, respectively. 3This gap in HPV vaccination coverage among rural adolescents has been a persis-tent disparity since at least 2013. 4Even though ru- ral-urban differences in in fluenza vaccination were not described in these studies, the NationalImmunization Survey-Flu (NIS-Flu) found that 52% of 13- to17-year-olds received an in fluenza vaccine during the 2018-19 season. 5 Studies of adolescent vaccination, many focused on the HPV vaccine and conducted among urbanand suburban populations, have identi ed a lack of a provider recommendation, nancial and insurance concerns, questions about the need for vaccination and vaccine safety, and decreased access to care or low health care-seeking behavior as barriers to vac- cination. 6-11Less is known about barriers to vacci- nation for rural adolescents. Studies of rural adolescent HPV vaccination have identi ed the influence of race, religion, parental education, and lack of collaborative provider communication as barriers, along with some of the same issues noted across geographic settings.12-17While the gap between rural and overall vaccination rates is larger for HPV, rural adolescent Tdap and MenACWY rates also lag as research focuses on HPV. Rural ad- olescent vaccination must also be understood in the context of more general rural health challenges such as nancial constraints, lack of health care pro- viders, and transportation barriers.18,19More research is needed on barriers to vaccination among rural adolescents, including studies that address all adolescent vaccinations alongside HPV. Colorado consists of 64 counties, of which 17 are urban, and 47 are rural (including a subset of 23 very sparsely populated frontier counties).20Am a - jority of rural counties in Colorado had adolescent vaccination rates that were below the state average for Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV in 2018.21In this survey, our objective was to assess whether therewere rural-urban differences in perceived logistic barriers to adolescent vaccination, perceived paren- tal vaccine con dence and beliefs, and adolescent immunization delivery practices among Coloradovaccine providers, including public health nursing (PHN), pediatric (Peds), and family medicine (FM)clinicians. While most of the survey addressed ado- lescent vaccination in general, perceived parental HPV vaccine beliefs were measured separately because adolescent HPV vaccination rates continue to lag behind Tdap and MenACWY. 22 Methods Study Population Between June and August 2019, we administered an Internet and mail survey to practicing PHN, Peds, and FM clinicians in Colorado. The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board approved this study. We recruited PHN, Peds, and FM clinicians from 16 rural counties in Colorado 'sW e s t e r n Slope region and 4 urban Colorado counties. Rural counties in eastern Colorado were excluded due to the presence of concurrent adolescent vaccination projects that may have impacted provider attitudes and experiences in those locations. Counties wereclassied using the Of ce of Management and Budget de nition: urban counties are part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. All counties not part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area are rural. 20,23 Public health nursing clinicians were identi ed using a Colorado Department of Public Health andEnvironment (CDPHE) list of public health direc- tors and immunization program leaders. Pediatric and FM clinicians were identi ed from the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Master le supplemented with a local health plan provider list for Western Colorado to identify addi-tional rural providers. To facilitate comparisons between rural and urban providers, we sampled roughly equally between the 2 groups (n = 227 ru-ral, n = 210 urban providers). In rural counties, we included all Peds (because there are few Peds in ru- ral locations 24),lled the remainder of the sample with randomly selected FM clinicians, and includedup to 2 PHNs per county. In urban counties, welled 2-thirds of the sample with Peds and 1-third with FM clinicians (to re flect national trends in the distribution of adolescent vaccine visits by PCPs 25), and we included up to 2 PHNs per county. Survey Design Logistic barriers to adolescent vaccination were measured using a 4-point Likert scale ( \"strongly September -October 2021 Vol. 34 No. 5 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Perceived parental vaccine condence was measured using an adapted version of the 8-item Vaccination Con dence Scale.26The Vaccination Con dence Scale has been validated using parent responses and was adapted for this sur- vey to ask providers what proportion of parents in their practice would agree with each item in thescale: 0% to 25%, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%, or >75%. We used the same response options to ask providers what proportion of parents in their prac-tice, they thought believed several statements related to adolescent HPV vaccination. Respondents were asked whether they routinely administer each adoles- cent vaccine (Tdap, MenACWY, HPV, in fluenza), a n dr e s p o n s e sw e r ec o l l a p s e di n t oy e s( \"Yes rou- tinely \")o rn o( \"Yes, stock and administer on request\" or\"No\"). Use of locations where adolescent patients are likely to go for vaccination was assessed using a4-point Likert scale ( \"not at all likely, \"\"a little \"\"somewhat likely, \"\"very likely \"). Use of evi- dence-based immunization delivery practices wasmeasured with yes/no questions about whether a respondent 's practice used standing orders for vacci- nation, walk-in or vaccine-only visits, and remindersor recall noti cations for Provider vac- cine recommendation practices were measured sepa- rately for each adolescent vaccine and for patients of different ages using a 4-point response scale (\"strongly recommend the vaccine, \"\"recommend the vaccine, but not strongly, \"\"make no recommen- dation,\"\" recommend against the vaccine \"). Survey Administration Surveys were sent via e-mail (Qualtrics) and/or mailbased on the contact information available from public health, AMA, and local health plan databases.Providers with only e-mail addresses available received an initial e-mail message followed by up to 8 e-mail reminders. Providers with only physical addresses available received an initial mailing with up to 2 mailed reminders. Providers with both e-mail and physical addresses available received up to 9 e-mail contacts interspersed with up to 3 mailings. Statistical Analysis We combined Internet and mail survey responses for analyses because prior work has shown that physician attitudes about vaccination are similar when obtained by either method. 27-29Nonrespondent characteristics were obtained from the AMA andlocal health plan databases. We used descriptivestatistics to summarize survey results. The chi- square test of proportions or Fisher 's exact test was used to assess differences between responses from rural and urban providers for the use of evidence- based immunization delivery practices and vaccine recommendation practices. For items with Likert- type response scales, the Cochran Armitage trendtest was applied to assess for differences between responses from rural and urban providers. For items in which too few respondents selected 1 or more Likert response categories, the Fisher 's exact test was used instead. To preserve interpretability of results in the text, we combined response categories for perceived logistic barriers to vaccination (\"strongly agree \"with \"somewhat agree \"and \"some- what disagree \"with and adoles- cent vaccination location items ( \"not at all likely \" with \"a little likely \"and \"somewhat likely \"with \"very likely \") and used chi-square tests to compare rural and urban responses. Statistically signi cant results of rural-urban comparisons for these com-bined response categories are only presented in textwhen rural-urban comparisons of non-combined response categories using Cochran Armitage trend tests are also statistically signi cant ( P.05). All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Results From our survey sample of 437 providers, 30 optedout of additional contact, and 4 were unable to be contacted due to inaccurate e-mail or mailing addresses. The response rate was 38% (163/433; 91 rural, 72 urban); 15 surveys were incomplete, limit- ing most analyses to 148 respondents (79 rural, 69urban). Compared with nonrespondents, respond- ents were more likely to work in public health or pediatrics (Table 1). Rural respondents were less likely than urban respondents to be physicians and work in pediatrics and were more likely to special-ize in family medicine or public health (Table 2). Rural respondents saw fewer adolescent patients in their practice, had fewer Black/African American patients, and had more patients insured by Medicaid than urban respondents. Perceived Logistic Barriers and Facilitators of Adolescent Vaccination Overall, 59% of providers somewhat/strongly agreed that adolescents do not come to primary care for annual well visits, and 36% somewhat/ doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.05.210107 Rural Adolescent Immunization 939copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from strongly agreed that parents often take adolescents places other than their primary care doctor 'so fce for vaccines. More than 85% of respondents some- what/strongly agreed with statements describing facilitators for adolescent vaccination in their com- munity (Figure 1). Rural respondents were less likely than urban respondents to agree with the statement, \"Most of my patients have insurance that covers vaccination costs \"(86% vs 97%, P= .02). Agreement with other statements about barriers and facilitators for adolescent vaccination did not differ by rural versus urban location. Perceived Parental Vaccine Condence and HPV Vaccine Beliefs Provider Perceptions of Parental Vaccine Condence When asked about the proportion of parents in their practice who would agree with various state- ments indicating con dence in vaccines, most respondents indicated that >75% of parents would agree with statements about trust in medical pro-viders and bene ts of vaccines and that 25% of parents would agree with statements about harmsrelated to adolescent vaccination (Figure 2). Rural respondents were less likely than urban respondents to indicate that large percentages of parents in theirpractice would agree that vaccines are necessary to protect the health of adolescents ( P= .02) and that medical professionals in charge of vaccinations havetheir adolescent 's best interest at heart ( P=. 0 5 , Figure 2).Provider Perception of Parental HPV Vaccine Beliefs When asked about various HPV vaccine belief statements, the statements that most respondents reported large proportions of parents in their prac- tice would agree with were \"Parents experience dis- comfort talking with their adolescent about sex, \" \"Their adolescent does not need the vaccine because they are not sexually active, \"and \"Their adolescent is unlikely to get an HPV-related dis-ease \"(Figure 3). Responses to perceived parental HPV vaccine belief items did not differ by ruralversus urban location. Vaccine Availability/Location of Vaccination Vaccine Administration/Stocking Eighty-four percent of all were no differences in whetherrespondents routinely administered any adolescentvaccinations by rural-urban location. Location of Vaccination Ninety-four percent of all respondents indicated that adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines from a primary care clinic. Overall, fewer respondents indicated adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines at a publichealth department (48%), pharmacy (35%), or hos- pital-based immunization clinic (15%). Thirty-nine percent of respondents indicated adolescents might receive vaccinations at other locations, including school-based health, urgent care, and walk-in clin-ics. More rural respondents than urban respondents indicated that adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines at a public health depart- ment (65% vs 28%, P<.0001). Fewer rural than urban respondents indicated that adolescents were somewhat/very likely to receive vaccines at a phar- macy (26% vs 45%, P= .02; data not shown in g- ures/tables). Provider Vaccine Delivery and Recommendation Practices Evidence-Based Practices for Immunization Delivery Alternative visit types (eg, walk-in or immunization- only visits) and standing orders for immunization were used by 90% and 75% of respondents,Table 1.

Downloaded from each bivariate comparison for females and males, Figure 4). Recommendation practices for Tdap, MenACWY, HPV, and in fluenza did not differ between rural and urban respondents. Discussion Rural and urban providers reported logistic andperceived parental attitude barriers to adolescent vaccination in Colorado. Rural providers were more likely than urban to identify insurance cover- age and perceived parental vaccine con dence bar- riers. Rural respondents also reported an increased likelihood for adolescents to receive vaccines in a public health department compared with urban providers. Vaccine recommendation practices did not differ between rural and urban providers; across rural and urban groups, providers were less likely tostrongly recommend HPV vaccine than other ado- lescent vaccines. Our survey showed that providers perceived some concerns about vaccine bene ts and the need for vaccination to be more common among parentsof rural adolescents than urban. Parental questions about whether adolescent vaccines are necessary and uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the se-verity of disease prevented by these vaccines are commonly identi ed barriers to vaccination across geographic settings, particularly for the HPV vac- cine. 6-10Noting the increased perceived prevalence of these barriers in rural settings, evidence-based interventions to increase adolescent vaccination in rural areas must address parental vaccine con dence and vaccine attitudes alongside logistic barriers. Provider communication strategies that have been shown to increase HPV vaccine uptake includeFigure 2.

Downloaded from using an announcement approach30to vaccine rec- ommendations or presumptive recommendation and motivational interviewing.31These strategies may need to be adapted to ensure effectiveness inrural settings as rural parents may have differentunderlying reasons for decreased vaccine con dence and different responses to these communicationtechniques. Studies in various rural settings haveidenti ed parental education and religion as factors associated with decreased vaccination; these mightbe prominent drivers of vaccine con dence in rural areas. For example, rural providers in Kentuckyidenti ed that a lack of HPV vaccine education and lack of promotional materials adapted for their loca-tion, and low parental literacy were barriers to vac-cination. 15In contrast, results from a study of national data from the Behavioral Risk factorSurveillance System showed girls whose mothershad lower income and educational achievementwere more likely to receive HPV vaccine in ruralareas than urban. 12A survey of parents of adoles- cents in rural Ohio showed that increased religiositywas associated with vaccine refusal. 32Another sur- vey of African-American parents in rural Georgiafound that Baptist parents were less likely to reportintent to vaccinate for HPV; 16interviews with African-American parents in rural Georgia foundthat religiosity was a prominent in fluence on vacci- nation decisions. 33In addressing parental vaccine concerns and vaccine con dence among rural parents, messages adapted for a broad range of edu-cation levels and tailored to religious beliefs may benecessary. Perceived logistic barriers more commonly reported by rural providers than urban onesincluded lack of insurance and differences in loca-tions for adolescent vaccination. Fewer rural pro-viders agreed that most of their patients haveinsurance covering vaccination costs, including uninsured or underinsured families. In a 2019 sur- vey, 4.3% of Colorado children 18 years old were uninsured, and 16.9% had changed insurance,gained, or lost coverage within the preceding12 months; direct rural-urban comparisons werenot included in this report. 34In general, a higher proportion of people in rural areas of the UnitedStates are uninsured 35, and a higher proportion relies on public insurance than in nonrural areas.36Figure 3.

Downloaded from Rural communities often have fewer insurance options, and those insurers often have limited pro- vider networks.37While commercial insurance plans must cover ACIP-recommended vaccinations under the Affordable Care Act,38grandfathered employer-sponsored insurance plans and alternativecoverage arrangements (eg, health care sharingministries and transitional policies) are not subjectto the same regulation. 39A lack of adequate health insurance options may lead rural families to choosealternative coverage arrangements, although dataon this concern are lacking. Insurance barriers could be addressed with policy interventions to improve insurance coverage in rural markets or totighten regulations on alternative coverage arrange- ments. 39Some uninsured or underinsured rural adolescents may also be eligible for, but not en- rolled in, Medicaid or the Children 'sH e a l t h Insurance Program (CHIP).

Strength of Provider Recommendation for Vaccination by Vaccine type and Patient Age Among ColoradoClinicians in 2019 (n = 146). Proportion of respondents who strongly recommend HPV vaccine for 11- to 12- year-old females was signicantly lower than the proportion of respondents who strongly recommend Tdap at 11to 12 years( a), MenACWY at 11 to 12 years(b), and influenza at 11 to 17 years(c) [Chi-square test, P<.005 for each bivariate comparison].

Downloaded from uninsured families through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program would not require policychanges and could be accomplished through improved communication about and linkage to existing services. Rural providers were more likely than urban to report that adolescents were likely to receive vacci- nations at the public health department, which may be another logistic barrier for some rural families. Rural providers also reported higher proportions of their patients covered by Medicaid. For some pri- mary care providers, regulatory and record-keeping standards of the VFC program 40and concerns about reimbursement for the administration ofVFC vaccines 41are deterrents for participation in the VFC program that provides vaccines at no cost for children and adolescents insured by Medicaid, among others. Rural primary care providers who see small numbers of children and adolescents may be even less motivated to participate in VFC if they must take on challenging regulatory requirements and concerns about reimbursement to provide a service to a small portion of their patient popula- tion. Rural families who are underinsured or cov-ered by Medicaid may not be able to afford vaccination at their primary care clinic, particularly if that clinic does not participate in VFC. These families may seek medical care in the clinic and then need to make a second trip for vaccination at the public health department. Public health depart- ments provide vital access to low- or no-cost vac-cines; however, they cannot address the full spectrum of other pediatric and adolescent health needs. Some families accessing vaccinations through public health departments might forgo additional primary care services entirely, missing important medical and developmental care for these adolescents. A 2005 study of National Health Interview Survey data showed that rural adolescents were less likely than urban adolescents to report apreventive health visit in the prior year. 42Efforts are needed to link vaccination services with primarymedical care in clinics and public health department vaccination programs. Fewer rural providers reported that adolescents were likely to receive vaccinations at pharmacies. Although pharmacies are unlikely to address the concern about disconnecting vaccination from primary care, pharmacies provide opportunities for vaccination access and seem to be less com- monly used or less commonly available for ruraladolescents. This nding may re flect poorer access to pharmacies in rural areas 43-45or differ- ences in services provided at rural pharmacies. We did not nd differences between rural and urban providers in evidence-based practices for im-munization delivery or vaccine recommendationpractices. There is room to increase the use of standing orders, reminders, and recall noti cations among the providers surveyed (use reported by75%, 49%, and 48%, respectively); however, rely- ing on these strategies alone is unlikely to address the gap in rural and urban adolescent vaccination rates. The proportion of providers who strongly recommend Tdap, MenACWY, HPV, and in flu- enza vaccination did not differ between rural and urban respondents. Both rural and urban providers were less likely to strongly recommend HPV vacci- nation than other adolescent vaccinations, as shown in prior research. 46Continued efforts are needed to increase provider use of a strong recommendationfor HPV vaccination for adolescents of all ages, highlighting the importance of recommending on- time vaccination for 11- to 12-year-olds. However, addressing provider recommendations alone isunlikely to address lagging HPV vaccine uptake in rural areas completely. These survey results should be interpreted in the context of some limitations. Our response rate was low, and nonrespondents may have different vacci- nation practices, experiences, and views than respondents. Providers who do not stock and admin- ister adolescent vaccinations or who see few adoles- cents in their practice may not have responded to the survey, and unique barriers among those providers may be missing from our data. Rural-urban differen-ces in survey responses may re flect differences in ge- ographic setting and may also be in fluenced by medical specialty; rural respondents were more likely to be FM or PHN clinicians. Survey data are based on provider self-report and may not re flect actual practice. We did not survey parents directly, andprovider reports may not accurately re flect parental vaccine beliefs and attitudes. Providers may holdbiases that impact their perceptions of rural andurban adolescents and parents differently and there- fore in fluenced their survey responses. Surveys or interviews with parents could directly measure pa-rental vaccine attitudes while investigating whether the provider and parental perceptions are similar and whether the accuracy of provider perceptions differs for rural adolescents and parents.

Downloaded from conducted qualitative interviews with Colorado parents and providers to explore barriers to adoles-cent vaccination unique to rural areas; nal data anal- ysis is forthcoming. 47Finally, these data may not represent experiences across all Colorado countiesor among all types of Colorado clinicians. Results may not be generalizable outside Colorado, includ- ing in other rural settings. Rural barriers to adolescent vaccination include unique logistic issues and prominence of perceivedparental vaccine attitude barriers common to ruraland urban settings. To improve rural adolescentvaccination uptake, interventions must address bothof these domains. Efforts should include work by providers and health systems to increase awareness of the need for vaccination and bolster vaccine con-dence and systemic solutions to minimize insur- ance barriers and improve access to vaccinations.Assessment of parental perspectives about vaccina-tion directly from parents of rural adolescents is needed, along with studies of whether existing strat- egies to improve vaccination rates translate well torural settings.
