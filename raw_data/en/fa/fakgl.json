For the last several decades, the wireless industry used the playbook of the Tobacco and Fossil Fuels industries to cloud the overwhelming science about the dangers of their technology ( Exxon understood the science about global warming 40 years ago , and spent millions to promote misinformation). In a similar vein, the Tahoe Prosperity Center has spent thousands of dollars of City grant money in promoting disinformation on behalf of Verizon and AT&T locally (their flyers blatantly mischaracterize findings of the NIH , EPA, and the scientific community ).

Thank you for your consideration, Gerald Barney Wireless data use almost doubles in just one year. Wireless data puts the internet in the palm of our hand and allows us to access nearly anything or anyone on the go, and its tremendous value to consumers shows no signs of slowing. This year, we saw mobile data grow by 12.89 trillion MBs to a total of 28.58 trillion. That's an 82 percent increase in the last year alone and is more than was used in the rst six and a half years of this decade combined. In fact, data use is up over and failing to provide fast wireless networks is no dierent than failing to provide clean drinking water, natural gas, sewage service, or electricity.

We present an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobilclimate change communications, including peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and advertorials in The New York Times . We also investigate advertorials using inductive frame analysis. We nd that the company has publicly overemphasized some terms and topics while avoiding others. Mostnotably, they have used rhetoric of climate ''risk'' and consumer energy ''demand'' to construct a ''FossilFuel Savior'' (FFS) frame that downplays the reality and seriousness of climate change, normalizes fossilfuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility. These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documentedstrategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations\u2014which knowingly sold a deadly product whiledenying its harms\u2014and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry's useof demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism. INTRODUCTION In previous work, we have shown that Exxon, Mobil, and Exxon- Mobil Corp misled the public about anthropogenic global warm-ing (AGW) by contributing to climate science through academic and internal research, while promoting doubt about it in adverto- rials and other propaganda. 1-3(We refer to Exxon Corporation as Exxon, Mobil Oil Corporation as Mobil, ExxonMobil Corporation as ExxonMobil Corp, and generically refer to all three as Exxon- Mobil.) We have also observed that, starting in the mid-2000s,ExxonMobil's statements of explicit doubt about climate science and its implications (for example, that ''there does not appear to be a consensus among scientists about the effect of fossil fueluse on climate'' 4) gave way to implicit acknowledgments couched in ambiguous statements about climate ''risk'' (such as discussion of lower-carbon fuels for ''addressing the risksposed by rising greenhouse gas emissions,''5without mention of AGW). This invites research as to how, beyond outright disin- formation, ExxonMobil may have employed rhetoric and framing to construct misleading public narratives about AGW. Here, wetake up this question. ''Framing'' is a term of art in communications science that re- fers to how an issue is portrayed and understood. 6-9Frames construct meaning by selecting ''some aspects of a perceived reality'' and making them ''more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem denition,causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recom- mendation.'' 10(Here and throughout, we strictly refer to ''emphasis frames'' rather than ''equivalency frames.'')11 Analyzing which frames are present and absent in publicdiscourse helps to reveal how actors have tried to shape policy debates by setting agendas and legitimating certain participantsSCIENCE FOR SOCIETY A dominant public narrative about climate change is that ''we are all to blame.'' Another is that society must inevitably rely on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. How did these become conventional wisdom? We show that one source of these arguments is fossil fuel industry propaganda. Ex- xonMobil advertisements worked to shift responsibility for global warming away from the fossil fuel industryand onto consumers. They also said that climate change was a ''risk,'' rather than a reality, that renewableenergy is unreliable, and that the fossil fuel industry offered meaningful leadership on climate change. Weshow that much of this rhetoric is similar to that used by the tobacco industry. Our research suggests warn-ing signs that the fossil fuel industry is using the subtle micro-politics of language to downplay its role in theclimate crisis and to continue to undermine climate litigation, regulation, and activism. 696 One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021 \u00aa2021 The Author(s).

Our analysis com- pares the terms and topics between ExxonMobil's different AGW communications, including peer-reviewed publications,internal documents, and paid, editorial-style advertise-ments\u2014known as advertorials\u2014published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times (NYT). We also identify frames in the latter. These well-dened, longitudinal corpora areconducive to a rigorous case study of fossil fuel industry messaging on AGW. Our study offers the rst computational assessment of how ExxonMobil has used language to frame public discourse about AGW. By bringing to bear the mixed-methods of computational linguistics and inductive frame analysis, our results add to (1) an-alyses of ExxonMobil's public affairs practices, 32-44(2) qualita- tive accounts of the company's AGW communications,23,45-49 and (3) the application of discourse and (algorithmic) content analysis to AGW communications by ExxonMobil and the widerclimate countermovement. 1,2,17-19 ExxonMobil's AGW communications offers three practicaladvantages. 58First, it complements the qualitative and/or manual methodologies previously applied to the AGW communi- cations of ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel interests, and corrob-orates our prior work, which used manual coding to demonstrate systematic discrepancies between ExxonMobil's private and public AGW communications. 1,2Second, automated methods of textual analysis allow detection of broad, sometimes subtle,patterns of language that would otherwise be unattainable. Third, by using existing corpora to establish the application of computational techniques to the analysis of AGW discourse,we help demonstrate the efcacy of these approaches, which researchers will be able to use to analyze the large numbers of documents that lawsuits against fossil fuel companies areanticipated to generate. Our analysis is the rst computational study illustrating how the fossil fuel industry has encouraged and embodied AGWnarratives xated on individual responsibility. Our ndings corroborate the insights of qualitative discourse analyses about the role of fossil fuel interests, and add to what Kent 59has called an ''under-theorised'' understanding ''of why contempo-rary interest focuses on individual responsibility for climate change.'' 26,51In so doing, this work helps to decrypt the fossil fuel industry's playbook of climate delay framings, illuminatinghow sense-making schema conveyed by subtle yet systematic deployments of language may have ''penetrated publicdiscourse to become naturalized as common sense or unfortu- nate realities.'' 13,26Although misleading frames that deceive the public may be defended on First Amendment grounds, the history of tobacco litigation shows that a misleading frame-work may also be held in some circumstances to be part of a pattern of fraudulent activities. Our work may, therefore, be relevant to ongoing lawsuits against ExxonMobil alleging''deceptive marketing'' and ''greenwashing,'' as well as to callsfor policymakers to ban fossil fuel industry advertisements or require that they come with tobacco-style warning labels. 60-65 Our research also adds to an expanding scholarly and journal- istic AGW literature\u2014spanning emissions accounting and extreme weather attribution;66,67supply-side policy anal- ysis;68-70decarbonization theory;71,72the history of climate denial, lobbying, and propaganda by fossil fuel interests;73-83 ethical philosophy;84,85and climate litigation86,87\u2014challenging the zeitgeist of individualized responsibility. Finally, this studycontributes to broader literatures on discourse and contentanalysis; 88-91corporate issue management and advocacy mar- keting;56,92-96and the cross-pollination of corporate strategies of public affairs, litigation, and deceit.13,86,97-100 We adopt a mixed-method, computational approach to rhetorical frame analysis of 180 ExxonMobil documents previously compiled for manual content analysis1,2: 32 internal company documents (1977-2002; from ExxonMobil Corp,101 from ExxonMobil Corp),104and 76 advertorials in the NYT expressing any posi- tions on AGW (real and human caused, serious, or solvable) (1972-2009; from PolluterWatch and ProQuest).105,106To our knowledge, these constitute all publicly available internal andpeer-reviewed ExxonMobil documents concerning AGW, including those made available by the company. They also include all discovered ExxonMobil advertorials in the NYT takingany positions on AGW. These corpora thus offer bound sets reflecting ExxonMobil's internal, academic, and public AGW communications, respectively. Following text pre-processing and vectorization into docu- ment-term matrices, we rst use frequency score (FS) and Dunning log-likelihood (LL) ratio corpus comparison algorithmsto identify statistically distinctive keywords (''divergent terms'')that help locate rhetorical frames. 107-110The FS indicates how often a given term appears in corpus A versus corpus B (ac- counting for corpus sizes), and ranges from 0 (only in corpusA) to 1 (only in corpus B). The LL ratio ( G 2)i n d i c a t e st h es t a t i s - tical signicance of the relative frequencies of a given term be- tween corpora A and B, and ranges from large and negative(term is disproportionately co mmon in corpus A) to large and positive (disproportionately common in corpus B). Second, we complement this approach with latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) topic modeling to identify statistically distinctive, themat- ically connected texts and vocabularies (''divergent topics''), which are commonly equated to either frames or frame ele-ments. 111-115Third, we integrate these quantitative tools into an inductive, qualitative approach to constructing frames as ''frame packages'' in advertorials.17,116-118In the discussion , we examine the congruence of our ndings with the tobaccoindustry's rhetorical strategies in public relations and litigation. 13,109,119,120ll OPEN ACCESS Article One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021 697RESULTS In the section entitled '' divergent terms and topics ,'' we compare divergent terms and topics between pairs of document cate- gories. In '' rhetorical frames ,'' we summarize the ndings of frame package analysis of advertorials: three dominant framescommunicated by 11 constituent discourses. Other sections then focus on two of these complementary discourses, ''discourse of climate risk '' and '' discourse of individualized re- sponsibility ,'' and analyze how they work alongside other dis- courses to construct one specic frame, Fossil Fuel Savior (FFS) ('' FFS frame ''). Divergent terms and topics Table 1 presents a selection of highly divergent terms in Exxon- Mobil Corp advertorials versus Mobil advertorials, as identiedby LL and FS. Likewise, Tables 2 and 3compare highly diver- gent terms between all advertorials (Mobil plus ExxonMobil Corp) and, respectively, Exxon internal documents ( Table 2 ) and Exxon/ExxonMobil Corp peer-reviewed publications ( Table 3). In all three tables, the highest | G 2|-scoring terms, marked with asterisks, are suggestive of distinctive themes aroundwhich we group other relevant terms. These themes closelyresemble the divergent topics shown in Table 4 , which emerge from LL analysis of our LDA topic model solutions in all adver- torials (top half of Table 4 ) and in combined internal and peer- reviewed documents (bottom half). The top 20 words associ- ated with each topic are listed, together with assigned topic labels.Mobil versus ExxonMobil Corp advertorials We have previously shown that both Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp advertorials often promoted doubt about climate science. 1,2 Terms conveying explicit doubt are therefore common to both corpora, and so do not appear in Table 1 (for examples, see S2.1, supplemental information ). This undercuts ExxonMobil Corp's suggestion that only Mobil, not ExxonMobil Corp, pro- moted doubt.2,3Both did. Moreover, when Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999, ExxonMobil Corp inherited legal and moral re-sponsibility for both parent companies. Comparison of advertorials over time can nevertheless be insightful in revealing other rhetorical trends. In this regard, Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp advertorial corpora serve as well-denedlongitudinal proxies. Table 1 shows, for example, that earlier, Mobil advertorials disproportionately contested climate science head-on, discus-sing emission(s) of CO 2/carbon dioxide and the global warming effect (terms exhibiting statistically signicant divergence are underlined throughout). Mobil advertorials also notably engagedin climate policy debates concerning the role of the US (and Senate ) compared with other nations as part of the Kyoto treaty plan. By contrast, ExxonMobil Corp advertorials no longer referred to ''global warming '': the term became taboo (FS = 0.10). Relative usage of ''climate change'' versus ''global warm- ing'' went from 3-to-1 post merger. Indeed, ExxonMobil Corp mostly sidestepped detailed discus-sions about climate science, acknowledging only the long-term risks of climate change before reframing it as a challenge to meet the public's energy demand and needs .

Current solar and wind technologies were presented as inadequate.Advertorials versus internal documentsComparing divergent terms in all advertorials against those in internal documents, a combination of the above advertorial themes emerges ( Tables 2 and4). Numerous Mobil and Exxon- Mobil Corp advertorials promoted explicit doubt about whether AGW is real and human caused. They emphasized debate and focused on what scientists ''do and don't know '' [Climate science uncertainty ] (topic labels from Table 4 are indicated in bracketed italics throughout). This eventually gave way to rhetoric about potential long-term risks of AGW (after several years of overlap in /C242000-2005 and 2007), juxtaposed against the challenge to meet demand [Energy/emissions challenge ]. The energy use and needs of consumers , such as electricity and oil and natural gas , are presented as necessitating greater energy efciency and new technologies [Energy/emissions challenge ;Vehicles ]. The public is told about how ExxonMobil Corp is partnering with GCEP at Stanford to develop solutions such as more efcient gasoline vehicles and ''clean .natural gas'' [Vehicles ;Energy technologies ]. ExxonMobil Corp touts its efforts to plant trees , but renewables such as wind and electric vehicles/EVs are given short shrift [ Conservation ; Energy technologies ]. Algorithmic analysis also documents Mobil's public rhetoric on the Kyoto Protocol: targets that exempt developing countries threaten American jobs , prosperity , and economic growth ; instead, governments and industry should pursue market-based , voluntary steps to reduce emissions [Climate policy ]. Compared with Mobil advertorials, which promoted debate about climate science, and ExxonMobil Corp advertorials, which did the same or ignored it, Exxon's internal conversationsfocused on it. Internal documents are notable for their detailed articulation of the causes and consequences of AGW. The source of the observed CO 2increase in the atmosphere wasfossil fuel combustion [AGW science/projections ]. Effects of the resulting greenhouse effect would include a global temperature increase . Internal discussions adopted a rigor absent from the company's public communications, including reference to climate models , scenario s, and rate s of change [Climate modeling ]. One scenario they examined\u2014the doubling of atmospheric CO 2concentration by 2050 \u2014threatened melting of the polar icecaps, a decrease in ocean pH, and rising sea levels [ AGW science/projections ]. ExxonMobil advertorials disputed or remained silent about not just this early knowledge of climate science and its implications but also Exxon's ''CO 2 program '' that helped acquire and apply that knowledge [ AGW science/projections ]. Internal memos report that this program included measuring CO 2with a tanker , monitoring DOE (US Department of Energy) climate science, and evaluating theCO 2emissions from their natural gas project in Natuna , Indonesia [ Climate research programs ]. Advertorials versus peer-reviewed publicationsTable 3 compares divergent terms in all advertorials against those in peer-reviewed publications. Advertorials are distin- guished by the same rhetorical themes as in '' advertorials versus internal documents ''; indeed, the contrast against academic articles is more pronounced. Independently and collectively, Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp advertorials offset the risks of manmade climate change by also promoting debate about complex science [Climate science uncertainty ]. Advertorials are again seen to frame AGW as a challenge to meet the needs of consumers for more energy from fossil fuels , while seeking to allay concerns by publicizing the promise of advanced technology innovation (including cogeneration )[Energy/emissions challenge ;Energy technolo- gies]. In comparison with peer-reviewed papers, advertorials stand out for their emphasis of corporate environmental programs to reduce emissions through energy efciency and conservation [Conservation ]. While advertorials talk about the scientic process\u2014 research , science , and the extent of scientists ' knowledge are disproportionately discussed\u2014peer-reviewed publicationsTable 2.

As expected, academic articles\u2014even more so than internal documents\u2014are distinguished by their articulation of AGW science. Observed atmospheric CO 2 concentrations are reported in ppm (parts per million), anthropogenic temperature change due to radiative forcing by GHG (greenhouse gases) such as CO 2and CH 4is acknowl- edged, and AGW model projections are run for different scenarios based on climate sensitivity [AGW science/projec- tions ]. The academic language of estimates and noise and ref- erences to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are commonplace [ Climate modeling ]. While adverto- rials offer unfocused representations of technologies such as renewables , nuclear , and EVs as or insufcient, Exxon/ExxonMobil Corp supported peer-re-viewed studies that squarely centered AGW mitigation around approaches consistent with continued reliance on fossil fuels: CCS (carbon capture and storage); and the injection of CO 2 into oceans through dissolution of minerals such as CaCO 3to increase alkalinity [CO 2disposal/storage ;Carbon cycles ]. As a recent literature review observed, the ''use of enhanced oceanalkalinity for C storage was rst proposed by [chief Exxonclimate scientist Haroon] Kheshgi.'' 122 Like internal documents, peer-reviewed publications attribute GHG emissions and/or AGW to fossil fuels signicantly moreoften than advertorials (p < 0.01-0.03). Common terms include fossil fuel emissions , fossil fuel CO 2, and fossil fuel combustion [AGW science/projections ] (see Table 5 ).Rhetorical frames Frame package analysis leads us to identify three dominant frames in ExxonMobil's advertorials, which we name (1) Scientic Uncertainty, (2) Socioeconomic Threat, and (3) Fossil Fuel Savior(FFS) (for details, see S4, supplemental information ). The Scienti- c Uncertainty frame presents AGW as unproven and advocates additional climate science research. The SocioeconomicThreat frame argues that binding climate policies (such as theKyoto Protocol) are alarmist and threaten prosperity, urging voluntary measures instead. The FFS frame describes AGW as the inevitable (and implicitly acceptable) risk of meetingconsumer energy demand with fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, and presents technological innovation as the long-term solution. These frames are constructed of reasoning and framing devices variously communicated by the 11 discourses listed in Figure 1 . Figure 1 is a Venn diagram representing the chain of logic (i.e., reasoning devices) of each frame as dened by Entman: 10prob- lem, cause, moral evaluation, and solution (as indicated, these reasoning devices are the logical bases challenged by denialsthat AGW is real, human caused, serious, and solvable, respec-tively). 10Discourses are manifest in one or more framing devices (e.g., lexical choices, catchphrases, depictions), and their posi- tions in Figure 1 depict their contributions to the reasoning devices of each frame (denitions and examples of each frame's reasoning and framing devices are provided in S4 and S5, supple- mental information ).

In the remainder of this paper, we focus on the role of two specic, complementary discourses, Climate Risk and Individualized Responsibility, in constructing the FFS frame. AsFigure 1 suggests, these discourses serve as rhetorical gateways connecting the problem and cause of the FFS frame to its moral evaluation and solution. Discourse of climate risk We have previously noted that, accompanying the emergence in the mid-2000s of implicit acknowledgments by some Ex-xonMobil Corp advertorials that AGW is real and humancaused, there appeared to be a rhetorical framework focused on risk. 2Algorithmic analyses here demonstrate that this was part of a wider trend in which, following the merger of Exxonand Mobil at the end of 1999, ''risk'' was incorporated into ad- vertorials communicating explicit doubt. Specically, LL and FS results in Table 1 show that ''risk(s)'' is among the terms that most statistically distinguish Mobil advertorials from Ex- xonMobil Corp advertorials. Within all advertorials published prior to the merger and expressing any positions on AGW(as real and human caused, serious, or solvable), ''risk(s)'' ap- pears three times, only once in reference to the risk(s) of AGW or greenhouse gases. By contrast, from 2000 onwards, such''risk(s)'' are cited 46 times: an average of once per adverto-rial; 10 times higher than an average NYT 2000, for instance, ExxonMobil Corp's rst post-merger advertorial in our corpus promoted ''scientic uncertainty'' thatAGW is real, human caused, serious, and solvable, acknowl- edging only that it ''may pose a legitimate long-term risk, and that more needs to be learned about it.''147By the time the com- pany took out its last advertorial expressing a position on AGW in2009, its tune had changed but ''risk'' rhetoric remained. The advertorial was entitled, ''Tackling climate risks with technol- ogy,'' followed by the subtitle, ''Support for oil and natural gasinnovation can reduce emissions.'' 148 The function of ''risk'' rhetoric in moderating the conveyed sta- tus of AGW or greenhouse gases is unambiguous. First, ''risks''is among the top terms characterizing the LDA-generated topic ofEnergy/Emissions Challenge , which is the primary topic that introduces readers to AGW (and compares it with energydemand; see '' discourse of individualized responsibility '') (Ta- ble 4 ). Second, ''climate (change) risk(s)/risk(s) of climate'' is, like ''risk(s)'' itself, a statistically distinctive term of ExxonMobilCorp advertorials versus Mobil advertorials, internal documents,and peer-reviewed publications ( Tables 1 ,2, and 3). Indeed, automated collocation analysis reveals that the highest scoring collocate of ''climate and ''global warming'' in contrast, Mobil adver- torials, it ''science'' (followed by ''gases'' and ''debate'') (Table S18 ). Discourse of individualized responsibility Table 5 (top half) collates terms that are (1) identied by frame package analysis as framing devices communicating Individual- ized Responsibility in advertorials, and (2) highly divergent be- tween all advertorials and internal and/or peer-reviewed docu-ments according to LL and FS analyses. Two patterns emerge. First, we observe that advertorials disproportionately employ terms that present consumer demand for energy (rather than corporate supply of oil, coal, and gas) as the cause of fossilfuel production, greenhouse gas emissions, and/or AGW. A characteristic example of this ''(energy) demand '' rhetoric is a 2008 ExxonMobil Corp advertorial ''By 1 and gas combustion\" as the \"source [s]\" of CO 2,C H 4, and SO 2143 fossil fuel use 0 13 NA /C010.35*/NA 0**/NA \"[F]or scenarios with higher fossil fuel use (hence, higher carbon dioxide emissions .\"139 fossil fuel CO 2 0 NA 64 NA/ /C05.96** NA/0*** \"This long tail on the fossil fuel CO 2forcing of climate may well be more signicant to the future glacial/interglacial timescale evolution ofEarth's NA/ /C05.03** NA/0*** \"We use our Integrated Science Model to . estimate the time variation fossil fuel emissions of CO 2.required to match the [IPCC] concentration stabilization scenarios.\"145 Divergent terms in advertorials are identied by frame package analysis as framing devices of individualized responsibility discourse. Examplequotations illustrate how advertorials use divergent terms to disproportionately present: (1) consumer demand for energy as the cause of\u2014and culpable for\u2014fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and/or AGW; and (2) individual/demand-side actions as accountable for mitigating AGW. By contrast, divergent terms in internal and/or peer-reviewed documents often articulate the causality and culpability of fossil fuel combustion.p values < 0.001 for all G 2and FS scores except: * <0.005; ** <0.05; *** R0.05.

Typology of discourses of climate denial and delay Using frame package analysis, we identify three dominant frames in ExxonMobil's advertorials: (a, top) Scientic Uncertainty; (b, middle) Socioec onomic Threat; and (c, bottom) Fossil Fuel Savior (FFS). For each frame, a Venn diagram is presented corresponding to the reasoning devices (i.e., chains of logic) de ned by Entman:10(left) problem and cause; (middle) moral evaluation; and (right) solution (as indicated, these reasoning devices are the logical bases challenged b y denials that AGW is real, human caused, serious, and solvable, respectively). Each reasoning device is communicated by one or more of the 11 discourse so f climate denial and delay listed within each chain of logic. Although not shown, these discourses are manifest in one or more framing devices (e.g., lex ical choices, catchphrases, depictions), as identied in S4, supplemental information . As an example, discourses of Technological Shell Game, which, as Schneider et al.27 dene them, use ''misdirection that relies on strategic ambiguity about the feasibility, costs, and successful implementation of technologies,'' serve to downplay the need for public and political concern by trivializing the seriousness and solvability of AGW. Technological Shell Game discourse is therefore pl aced in the overlapping areas of Moral evaluation (''Serious'') and Solutions (''Solvable'') in the diagram.

Synonyms for ''(energy) demand '' include ''needs '' (''fossil fuels must be relied upon to meet society's immediate andnear-term needs '') and ''energy use '' (''man-made greenhouse gas emissions arise from essential energy use in the everyday activities of people, governments and businesses''). Fossil fuelsare either presented as passively responding ''to meet this demand '' of consumers , developing countries , and the world ; or they are left out of the equation entirely: ''[A]s populationsand economies have grown, energy use has increased, and so have greenhouse gas emissions .''150 Second, we observe that, to the extent that advertorials admit the need for AGW mitigation, they disproportionatelyintroduce terms conveying individual and/or demand-side ac- tions as the appropriate response. Even while promoting explicit doubt about the reality of AGW, advertorials focus ondownstream energy efciency and greenhouse gas emissions , rather than upstream supply of fossil fuels, as the appropriate target of mitigation efforts. ''During the [climate science] fact-nding period,'' a 1997 advertorial states, ''governments should encourage and promote voluntary actions by industry and citizens that reduce emissions and use energy wisely. Govern- ments can do much to raise public awareness of theimportance of energy conservation .''128Twelve years later, advertorials continued to equate the ''global environmental challenge '' with ''curbing greenhouse gas emissions ,'' but not with constraining fossil fuel supply.151As one 2000 advertorial put it: ''Prudent measures such as conservation and investment in energy-efcient technology make sense, but embarking onregulatory [energy] policies that may prove wasteful or counter- productive does not.'' 134 Advertorials repeatedly highlighted ways the public could, as one in 1998 put it, ''show a little voluntary 'can do.'''152A 2008 advertorial suggested that the ''cars and trucks we drive aren't just vehicles , they're opportunities to solve the world's energy and environmental challenges .''123A 2007 advertorial offered readers ''simple steps to consider'': ''Be smart about electricity use''; ''Heat ''; ''Improve your gas mileage''; ''Check your home's greenhouse gas emissions '' using an online calculator.153Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp pre- sented themselves as facilitating, and participating in, such de- mand-side AGW mitigation. A 1997 advertorial laid the ground-work: ''We're supporting research and technology efforts, curtailing our own greenhouse gas emissions and helping cus- tomers scale back their emissions of carbon dioxide.''124In 1999, Mobil announced that ''we're pleased to extend our sup-port of.American Forests .whose 'Global Releaf 2000' pro- gram is mobilizing people around the world to plant and care for trees .''131This narrative was echoed by advertorials a decade later: ''By enabling cars and trucks to travel farther on a gallon of fuel, drivers .emit less carbon dioxide (CO 2) per mile,'' saida 2008 advertorial.127''We also are developing new vehicle tech- nologies that can help consumers use energy more efciently ,'' said two more the following year.125,126 By contrast, Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp's internal and/or ac- ademic communications recognized AGW and/or greenhouse gases as also an upstream problem caused by fossil fuel supply and burning (see also S2.2, supplemental information ). ''[F]ossil fuel combustion is the only readily identiable source [of CO 2 consistent with the rate and scale of] observed increases .,'' observed Exxon scientist James Black142in a 1978 presentation to the Exxon Corporation Management Committee. Other inter-nal (1979) and peer-reviewed (2001) documents likewise attrib- uted CO 2accumulation in the atmosphere as ''due to fossil fuelburning'' and ''fossil fuel combustion .''138,139A 1984 internal report and a 1994 academic article spoke of ''fossil fuel emis- sions of CO 2,'' while a 1998 paper referred to ''fossil fuel CO 2 forcing of climate.''136,144,145A 1982 internal memo went further, acknowledging ''the connection between Exxon's major busi-ness and the role of fossil fuel combustion in contributing to the increase of atmospheric CO 2.''140The 1979 and 1984 internal documents discuss the CO 2emissions of specic fossil fuel sources such as shale oil and Exxon's natural gas reservoir off Natuna Island in Indonesia.136,138 In sum, ExxonMobil's advertorials statistically overuse terms that reduce AGW to a downstream problem caused by con- sumer energy demand, to be solved primarily by energy ef- ciency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, theirprivate and academic documents disproportionately recognize that AGW is an upstream problem caused by fossil fuel supply. As we show in S6.2, supplemental information , this statistical dichotomy extends throughout all of ExxonMobil Corp's flagshipreports concerning AGW spanning 2002-2019 compared with the rm's internal and academic publications. FFS frame In addition to Climate Risk and Individualized Responsibility, theFFS frame comprises the ve other discourses shown in Figure 1 and dened in S5, supplemental information . Together, they establish the frame's chain of logic (i.e., reasoning devices, seeTable S4 ). First, as shown in the previous two sections, discourses of Climate Risk and Individualized Responsibility present AGW as the inevitable ''risk'' of meeting consumer energy demand. In response to this problem denition and causal attribution, discourses of Scientic/Technological Optimism (which gives primacy to scientic or technological breakthroughs as the solu-tions to AGW) and Greenwashing/Corporate Symbolic Environ- mentalism (which is when companies make changes for environ- mental reasons that, in the case of greenwashing, are merely anddeliberately symbolic) lend what Plec and Pettenger 52(2012) call ''an aura of scientic and technical authority,'' which ''resigns us to putting our faith in the power of industry, technology, and sci-ence'' (see also Schneider et al. 26). ''[W]e believe that technology provides the key avenue to solutions that manage long-term risk and preserve prosperity ,'' says the voice of reason presented by a 2002 advertorial entitled ''A responsible path forward on climate.'' ''[This] will almost certainly require decades.''154Ex- xonMobil asserts its leadership in this challenge with advertorials citing ''our industry-leading investments in research andll OPEN ACCESS Article 708 One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021development,''149such as ''supporting climate-related research efforts at major universities , including Stanford and MIT.''155Vi- sual images such as graphs, charts, and science iconography reinforce this impression. This technocratic authority helps legitimize accompanying discourses of Fossil Fuel Solutionism and Technological Shell Game, which join the dots between energy demand andcontinued reliance on fossil fuels. An example of Fossil Fuel Sol-utionism (which presents fossil fuels and their industry as an essential and inevitable part of the solution to AGW) is a 2007 advertorial that unequivocally depicts the future: ''Coal, oil, and natural gas will remain indispensable to meeting total projected energy demand growth'' through 2030 .156''Oil and gas will be essential to meeting demand ,'' reiterates another in 2008.5 ''Meeting this growing long-term demand requires that we develop all economic sources of energy - oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear and alternatives,'' says a third in 2009.151 The non-fossil fuel alternatives are then dismissed by Techno- logical Shell Game discourse promoting doubt and confusion about AGW's technological solvability, such as three advertorials in 2005 depicting, again unequivocally, how ''Wind and solar . meet about 1% of total world demand by 2030 .''157-159Another, 3 years later, updates the gure to ''only 2 percent'' (including bio- fuels).5ExxonMobil also takes aim at clean energy subsidies and renewable energy's ''highly variable output'' and ''enormous land-use requirements.''133,154,160Meanwhile, the three 2005 ad- vertorials, and another in 2009, falsely promote natural gas as''clean -burning'' and ''clean ,'' respectively.157-159 In a 2009 advertorial, ExxonMobil acknowledges that there is ''a dual challenge '' to ''provide energy '' and ''protect the environ- ment'' (notably, they say that this challenge concerns energyrather than fossil fuels, and that it applies to ''all of us''). 150But then they tip the scales by pitting concrete, unequivocal benets (''[Energy] lights our homes. Fuels our transportation. Powersour industries. .[D]riv[es] our economy and rais[es] living stan- dards '') against amorphous, uncertain costs (the ''risks of climate change ''). Two 2007 advertorials similarly compare ''economic growth and human development'' against undened ''risks of climate change .''161,162 In cases such as these, discourses of Energy Poverty/Pros- perity and Policy Apocalypse (which respectively articulate so-cial justices of energy access and alleged socioeconomic tolls of decarbonization\u2014the latter strictly assigned to the socioeco- nomic threat frame), contrasted against that of Climate Risk,work to afrm the moral evaluation of the FFS frame that fossil fuel lock-in is righteous and reasonable. DISCUSSION The patterns observed in '' results '' are similar to those docu- mented in the tobacco industry. In '' risk rhetoric facilitates Ex- xonMobil's have-it-both-ways position on AGW '' and '' energy demand rhetoric individualizes AGW responsibility ,'' we discuss the strategic functions of AGW ''risk'' rhetoric and individualized responsibility framings, respectively, in comparison with the his- tory of the tobacco industry. '' Energy demand rhetoric individu- alizes AGW responsibility '' distinguishes how consumer energy demand is presented in public ( '' demand as fossil fuel lock-in in public relations '') versus in legal defense ('' demand as blamein litigation ''). ''Historical contexts, ramications, and trajectories of ExxonMobil's tactics historical contexts, ramications, and trajectories of ExxonMobil's ''risk'' individualized responsibility framings ('' indi- vidualized responsibility ''). Risk rhetoric facilitates position to ''risk'' rhet- oric (see '' discourse of climate risk '') is broadly consistent with independent ndings. Jaworska 51observes the emergence of ''risk'' as one of the most frequent collocations of ''climate change'' in the late 2000s within the corporate social responsibil-ity reports of the world's major oil corporations, including Exxon- Mobil. Grantham and Vieira, 44examining ''welcome letters'' from ExxonMobil's in the company's Corporate Citizenship Re-ports, note that ''risk'' is one of the most influential words coin-ciding with emphasis on the ''planet.'' Schlichting 17concludes that, over the course of the 2000s, industry actors increasingly adopted the framing that ''climate change [might be/is] a risk.'' ExxonMobil's rhetorical pattern of stressing ''risk'' is consis- tent with the company's effort in the mid-2000s, chronicled by journalist Steve Coll,48''to reposition ExxonMobil's arguments about warming to more fully account for consensus scientic opinion, without admitting that any of the corporation's previous positions had been mistaken, for that might open a door tolawsuits.'' This approach resembles the tobacco industry's well-docu- mented response to the scientic consensus on the harms of to-bacco use, described by historian Allen Brandt 163as a ''shift'' focus from scientic of smok- ing (see also Proctor164,165). This scientic hedging strategy was made explicit in a 1996 Reynolds training manual instructingnew employees to tell reporters that smoking was ''a risk factor'' but ''not a proven cause.'' 165In 1998, for example, Philip Morris's CEO Geoffrey Bible conceded a ''possible risk'' but not a''proven cause,'' the distinction being in what historian Robert Proctor 165calls ''a kind of legal having-it-both-ways: an admis- sion strong enough to ward off accusations of having failed towarn, yet weak enough to exculpate from charges of having mar-keted a deadly product.'' This carefully parsed conclusion became the industry's new ofcial position. 163 ''Risk'' facilitates ExxonMobil's have-it-both-ways position on AGW. It is a '''good' candidate to serve various rhetorical pur- poses,'' Jaworska51notes, because it ''opens up many semantic slots.'' Fillmore and Atkins'166work on the conceptual meaning of risk, for example, shows that ''risk'' has two dominant sub-frames, ''Chance'' and ''Harm,'' and many optional valence description categories. ''Chance'' is dened as ''uncertainty about the future,''such that risk rhetoric (1) implies inherent uncertainty and (2) is subject to temporal discounting heuristics. 167-169''The essence of risk is not that it ishappening, but that it might be happening.''170,171 ''Risk'' is never clearly or consistently dened by ExxonMobil. The presence and absence of risk's various sub-frames introduce so-called strategic ambiguity\u2014and therefore flexibility\u2014incontemporaneous and retrospective interpretations of what Ex- xonMobil wants us to see as a ''risk'' rather than a ''reality.'' 27,172 For instance, does the ''Chance'' sub-frame of ''risk''\u2014andll OPEN ACCESS Article One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021 709therefore the implication of uncertainty\u2014apply to whether AGW is happening, human caused, serious, or solvable? Sub-frames of Harm, Actor, Victim, and Valued Object are also rarely articulated: who assumes the risk(s) of AGW: the public, the company, itsshareholders, or others? What might be the consequences, and when? In contrast, the ''Gain,'' ''Beneciary,'' and ''Motivation'' sub-frames of risk taking, manifest in discourse of Policy Apoca-lypse, are stated explicitly, as discussed in '' demand as fossil fuel lock-in in public relations .'' Like its weaponized rhetorical cousins\u2014such as ''uncer- etc.\u2014''risk'' has the strategic advantage of not necessarily implying intent to deny or delay, because it is coopted from common academic, regula-tory, journalistic, and colloquial parlance (S1.4.2, Supran and Oreskes 1).15,146,167,173,174It can be used correctly (for example, to refer to expected future damages and stranded fossil fuel as- sets\u2014a risk that we have previously shown ExxonMobil waspublicly silent about) or incorrectly (for example, to describe AGW and past/present climatic changes such as sea level rise as risks rather than realities). 1 ExxonMobil employs almost identical ''risk'' language in ad- vertorials promoting explicit doubt about AGW as in those that implicitly acknowledge it. For example, they refer to ''the risk ofglobal warming'' in 1989 (accompanied by explicit doubt); the ''risk(s)'' ''that climate changes may pose'' in 2000 (alongside explicit doubt); and ''the risks of climate change'' in 2009 (which,in the absence of doubt, is coded as an implicit acknowledg- ment). 150,175,176This is not limited to advertorials (for wide- ranging examples, see table 3 of Supran and Oreskes2). In Ex- xonMobil Corp's 2005 Corporate Citizenship Report , for instance, which extensively questions whether AGW is human caused and serious, a member of the public asks: ''Why won't ExxonMobil recognize that climate change is real.?'' The company replies: ''ExxonMobil recognizes the riskof climate change and its potential impact'' (emphases added).177By shift- ing the conversation from the semantics of reality to the seman-tics of risk, they inject uncertainty into the AGW narrative, even while supercially appearing not to. Energy demand rhetoric individualizes AGW responsibility Two dimensions of issue responsibility are commonly identiedin communications and psychological research: causality and treatment. 16,178Causality responsibility addresses the source of a problem\u2014who or what causes it. Treatment responsibilityidenties who or what has the power to alleviate the problem, and should be held responsible for doing so. Studies of respon- sibility framing and attribution theory argue that attribution ofthese responsibilities broadly takes two conflicting forms: indi- vidual versus social. 16,179,180Expressing our ndings in ''discourse individualized responsibility '' through this analyt- ical lens, ExxonMobil's public advertorials are biased towardindividualist both causality and treatment responsi- bilities for AGW as compared with their private and academic representations. Jaworska 51has observed similar appeals to energy demand as the driving force behind greenhouse gas emissions in the corporate citizenship reports of ExxonMobil Corp and other fos-sil fuel companies, noting that they are ''an example of differen- tiation, which shifts the responsibility to other constituencies.'' Princen et al.72similarly argue that a focus on carbon and green- house gases\u2014and away from fossil fuels\u2014is reductionist. ''Thischemical framing,'' they note, ''implies that the problem arises after a chemical transformation, after fuels are burned. It effec- tively absolves of responsibility all those who organize to extract,process, and distribute .So constructed .the burden of harm and responsibility for amelioration falls on governments and con- sumers rather than extractors.'' ''The most effective propaganda,'' Parenti 181contends, ''is that which relies on framing rather than on falsehood.'' As with the language of risk, a rhetorical power of narratives that individ- ualize responsibility is that they do not require the statement ofoutright falsehoods. After all, consumer demand is one valid and universally recognized aspect of the AGW problem and its solution, and not all advertorials entirely disregard the role of fos-sil fuels. On balance, however, the disproportionate public xa-tion of ExxonMobil, a supplier company, on demand-side causa- tion and accountability (as shown in '' discourse of individualized responsibility '') fullls the fundamental function of emphasis frames to ''call attention to some aspects of reality while obscuring other elements.'' 10It is in this selection process that the individualized responsibility framing device creates a false di-chotomy, leading readers toward AGW problem denitions, evaluations, and solutions skewed toward consumer demand and away from industry supply. 11,16,178 ExxonMobil's framing is reminiscent of the tobacco industry's effort ''to diminish its own responsibility (and culpability) by cast- ing itself as a kind of neutral innocent, buffeted by the forces ofconsumer demand.'' 165It is widely recognized that the tobacco industry used, and continues to use, narrative frames of personal responsibility\u2014often marketed as ''freedom of choice''\u2014to combat public criticism, influence policy debates, and defendagainst litigation and regulation. 13,100,119,164,182-184Friedman et al.13recently demonstrated that tobacco companies use ''freedom of choice'' to imply two distinct concepts: liberty andblame. In their public relations messaging, industry asserts smokers' rights as individuals who are at liberty to smoke. In the context of litigation, industry asserts that those who chooseto smoke are solely to blame for their injuries. In the following two subsections, we further explore the congruence between ExxonMobil's public responsibility framing and these tobacco tactics ('' demand as fossil fuel lock-in in pub- lic relations ''; ''demand as fossil fuel lock-in in public relations ''). We discuss how this Individualized Responsibility discourse is rationalized and reinforced by the semantic duality of ''risk.''Demand as fossil fuel lock-in in public relations In ''FFS frame ,'' we showed that ExxonMobil's FFS frame in- sists\u2014typically as self-fullling fact rather than opinion\u2014uponsociety's inevitable and indenite reliance on fossil fuels. Rather than asserting that demand is a personal choice and liberty, Ex- xonMobil's public ''(energy) demand'' rhetoric frame, discourses of Energy Poverty/Prosperity and Policy Apocalypse contrast against that of Climate Risk(''FFS frame ''). The role of ''risk'' rhetoric here is to downplay the downside, namely AGW, of this alleged dichotomy: fossilll OPEN ACCESS Article 710 One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021fuels are essential, whereas the potential effects\u2014indeed real- ities\u2014of AGW are uncertain.26Such assertions, St. John III35 notes, extend Mobil's messaging in its ''Observations'' columns''about what constitutes reasonable risk.'' Observations were''pithy, easy-to-read'' advertorials that Mobil ran in Sunday newspaper supplements between 1975 and 1980. 35,185In a 1980 ''Observations'' column, for example, Mobil lamentedthat ''the country seems to be afflicted with the Chicken LittleSyndrome'' of ''cry[ing] that 'The sky is falling!''' 186''Hardly throughgovernment regulation is impossible, the advertorial reasoned, because ''everything people do everyday involves a slight mea- sure of risk'' (emphasis in original). The company concluded withthe warning that to ''avoid risk, ght change'' may be a short- term solution, ''but for the long pull, it's a way to certain stagna- tion.'' Tobacco industry apologists made the same arguments,calling it ''the menace of daily life.'' 187 To the extent that advertorials concede AGW may be a prob- lem, the \"risk\" angle helps frame AGW as unpredictable, posi- tioning the oil industry ''not as a contributor but as a victim''alongside consumers. 51As a 2009 advertorial put it, ''[we'll need] a global approach to managing the risks of climate change . Everyone has a role to play - industry, governments, in- dividuals.''150This complemented Mobil's broader use of adver- torials as what Kerr42terms a citizen.'' ''A citizen of many lands'' is how Mobildescribed itself in a 1999 advertorial. 131''Climate change: we're all in this together,'' another was titled in 1996.188With this narrative of an ''empathetic fellow traveler,'' St. John III35ar- gues, ''Mobil offers up the reasonable, risk-taking corporatepersona who is willing to take the initiative to provide a benecial product to all Americans .[B]y appealing to Americans' penchant for valorizing the self-starting individual, such a mes-sage of energy harvesting as never being 100% safe could well explain how a signicant amount of Americans today do not see fossil fuel-induced climate change as a signicant risk.'' 35 ExxonMobil's advertorials say almost nothing about the seri- ousness of AGW.1,2Nor do they mention the concepts of carbon budgets and stranded fossil fuel assets, which are part of theargument for the fundamental incompatibility of unrestricted fos-sil fuel supply with climate mitigation. Overall, the didactic framing of demand as fossil fuel lock-in communicates what Plec and Pettenger 52describe as ''a rhet- oric of resignation, naturalizing consumption of resources and teaching us to put our trust in industry solutions to energy problems.'' Or as Schneider et al.27and Cahill26put it, quoting the neoliberal bromide: ''There is no alternative'' to the sta- tus quo . Demand as blame in litigationAlthough the tobacco industry sells ''freedom of choice'' as liberty in public relations, in litigation they equate it with blame toward in- dividuals who exercised their choice to smoke. 13,164,183,184 Climate litigation is nascent, yet the fossil fuel industry has already successfully repackaged demand as lock-in to instead impute blame on customers for being individually responsible. In 2018, arguing in defense of ve oil companies (including Ex- xonMobil Corp) against a lawsuit brought by California cities seeking climate damages, Chevron lawyer Theodore BoutrousJr. offered his interpretation of the IPCC's latest report: ''I think the IPCC does not say it's the production and extraction of oil that is driving these emissions. It's the energy use. It's economic activity that creates demand for energy.'' ''It's the way people areliving their lives.'' 189The judge's dismissal of the case accepted this framing: ''[W]ould it really be fair to now ignore our own re- sponsibility in the use of fossil fuels and place the blame forglobal warming on those who supplied what we demanded?'' 190 Even if plaintiffs prove their case, fossil fuel companies can invoke ''afrmative defenses''\u2014as tobacco companies often have\u2014such as ''common of therisk.'' 164,183These respectively argue (1) ''that the plaintiff had engaged in an activity [such as smoking] that involved obvious or widely known risks,'' and (2) ''that the plaintiff knew aboutand voluntarily undertook the risk.'' 13As Brandt163explains it, ''If there was a risk, even though 'unproven,' it nonetheless must be the smoker's risk, since the smoker had been fullyinformed of the 'controversy.' The industry had secured thebest of both worlds.'' By way of the FFS frame, ExxonMobil appears to have con- structed an ability to do the same. On the one hand, ''risk'' rhetoricis weak enough to allow the company to maintain a position on climate science that is ambiguous, flexible, and unalarming (''risk rhetoric facilitates ExxonMobil's have-it-both-ways position on AGW ''). On the other, it is strong enough\u2014and prominent enough, in NYT advertorials and elsewhere\u2014that ExxonMobil may claim that the public has been well informed about AGW.This duality has been a cornerstone of the tobacco industry's legal position on the ''risks'' of smoking: ''Everyone knew but no one had proof.'' 163,164Akin to early, tepidly worded warning labels on cigarette packages, ExxonMobil's advertorials in America'snewspaper of record help establish this claim, sometimes explic- itly: '' Most people acknowledge that human-induced climate change is a long-term risk,'' a 2001 advertorial states 13,130(em- phases added). ''The riskof climate change and its potential im- pacts on society and the ecosystem are widely recognized ,'' says another the following year.191As Baker192has pointed out about the socialization of risk, ''a transfer of risk is also a transfer of responsibility ..[ R ] i s k creates responsibility.'' The fossil fuel industry's use of demand-as-blame framing is not limited to its legal defenses. As Schneider et al.27describe, fossil fuel interests have likewise sought to delegitimize AGW activism, such as the fossil fuel divestment movement, by deploying a rhetorical ''hypocrite's trap [that] performs thedisciplinary work of individualizing ramications, and trajectories of ExxonMobil's communication tacticsExxonMobil's selective use of rhetoric and discourse to frame AGW epitomizes the rst ''general principle'' of effective public affairs according to Herbert Schmertz, 185Mobil Oil's Vice Pres- ident of Public Affairs (1969-1988) and the pioneer of their adver-torials: ''Grab the good words - and the good concepts - for yourself.'' 185''[B]e sensitive to semantic inltration, the process whereby language does the dirty work of politics .Be sensitive to these word choices, and be competitive in how you use them. Your objective is to wrap yourself in the good phrases while sticking your opponents with the bad ones.''ll OPEN ACCESS Article One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021 711Risk ExxonMobil Corp's systematic introduction of ''risk'' rhetoric into its doubt-mongering advertorials coincided with the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil, suggestive of a strategic shift in pub-lic relations. A second shift, in the mid-2000s, from explicit doubt to implicit acknowledgment confused by ''risk'' rhetoric, coincides withwhat one ExxonMobil Corp manager saw as ''an effort by [thenCEO Rex] Tillerson to carefully reset the corporation's prole on climate positions so that it would be more sustainable and less exposed.'' 48 To this day, ExxonMobil Corp's (also Chevron's and Conoco- Phillips') refrain on AGW, and the primary basis on which the company is now widely perceived to accept basic climate sci-ence, is that it is a ''risk.'' 26,194,195Across all of ExxonMobil Corp's flagship reports concerning AGW, by far the of ''global warming'' is''risk(s)'' ). Compared with inter- nal and peer-reviewed documents, terms in flagship reports invoking ''risks of climate change'' are highly divergent (S6.1). As with advertorials, none say that climate change is real and hu-man caused. Individualized responsibility The ndings in the results section lead us to conclude that Exxon- Mobil advertorials used frames of individualized responsibility and the rhetoric of ''risk'' to construct what St. John III 35calls a ''sense- making corporate persona'' that appealed to the enduring princi-ples of ''rugged individualism'' and self-reliance that pervade US culture and ideology. 35,196-201Their public affairs campaign coin- cided with solidifying, intertwined notions of distributed risks andindividualized responsibility in western public policy debates sincethe 1970s, which have been driven by the global embrace of neoliberalism and globalization 27,197,202,203and encouraged by reductive, episodic news framings16,179(and which are conceptu- tapped into this trend toward the individualization of social risks, and brought it to bear on AGW.59,208,211 ExxonMobil is part of a lineage of industrial producers of harm- ful commodities that have used personal responsibility framingsto disavow themselves. 212-214Among them: tobacco com- panies;13,119,120the National Association of Manufacturers;215 plastics producers (including Exxon, Mobil, and ExxonMobil Corp), packaging and beverage manufacturers, and waste com- panies;197,216-222and purveyors of rearms.228 Among, in particular, the public AGW communications of ma- jor fossil fuel companies, individualized responsibility framings\u2014and the accompanying narrative of fossil fuel lock-in\u2014have become seemingly ubiquitous. 26,51The very notion of a personal ''carbon footprint,'' for example, was rst popularized in 2004-2006 by oil rm BP as part of its $100+ million per year ''beyondpetroleum'' US media campaign. 229-235Discourse analysis of this campaign led Doyle236to conclude that ''BP places respon- sibility for combatting climate change upon the individual con-sumer.'' Smerecnik and Renegar 57have shown that subsequent BP branding activities similarly ''plac[e] participatory emphasison consumer conservation behavior as opposed to corporate re- sponsibility.'' This industry framing continues to dominate today.26,81In 2019, for instance, BP launched a new ''Know your Carbon Footprint'' publicity campaign.237In 2020, the CEO of Total said that ''Change will not come from changing the source of supply. You have to reduce demand.''238Until 2020, all major oil and gas companies disregarded or disavowedaccountability for all Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions result-ing from the use of their products. ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips continue to do so. 239 The result is that fossil fuel industry discourse on AGW appears to have encouraged and embodied what Maniates197describes as ''an accelerating individualization of responsibility'' that''is dangerous ways, our 'environmental imagination''' by ''ask[ing] that individuals imagine themselves as citizens second.'' 197,26,27,52,56This depoliticized ''capitalistic agency,'' Smerecnik and Renegar57argue, works to ''prohibit fundamental social change that would disrupt the fossil fuel indus-try.'' 57,59Experimental evidence appears to support this conclu- sion. Palm et al.,240for example, observe that messages framed in terms of individual behavior not only ''decreased individuals'willingness to take personal actions'' but also ''decreased willing- ness to [take collective action such as to] support pro-climate can- didates, reduced belief in the accelerated speed of climatechange, and decreased trust in climate scientists.'' Illustrations of how narratives of individualized responsibility have protected fossil fuel interests from climate action are widespread. One isYale University's 2014 refusal to divest from fossil fuel companies, which was ''predicated on the idea that consumption of fossil fuels, not production, is the root of the climate change problem.'' 241 Another is the Republican Party's 2020 legislative agenda onAGW, whose premise was that ''fossil fuels aren't the enemy. It's emissions.'' 242,243A third is that the Paris Agreement ''is silent on the topic of fossil fuels.''68 Summary and conclusionAvailable documents show that, during the mid-2000s, Exxon- Mobil's public AGW communications shifted from explicit doubt (a Scientic Uncertainty frame) to implicit acknowledgmentcouched in discourses conveying two frames: a SocioeconomicThreat frame, and a Fossil Fuel Savior (FFS) frame. According to the FFS frame: (1) Everything about AGW is uncertain: a ''risk,'' as con- trasted with a reality. (2) Fossil fuel companies are passive suppliers responding to consumer energy demand. (3) Continued fossil fuel dominance is (1) inevitable, given the insufciency of low-carbon technologies; and (2) reason- able and responsible, because fossil fuels lead to pro- found, explicit benets and only ambiguous, uncertainclimate ''risk(s).'' (4) Customers are to blame for demanding fossil fuels, whose ''risk(s)'' were common knowledge. Customers knowinglychose to value the benets of fossil fuels above their risks. Ignored and obscured by these perspectives are fossil fuel in- terests' pervasive marketing, disinformation campaigns, and lobbying against climate and clean energy policies, all of whichll OPEN ACCESS Article 712 One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021have served to establish and reinforce infrastructural, institu- tional, and behavioral carbon lock-ins, thereby undercutting consumer choice and agency.244,245 Propaganda tactics of the fossil fuel industry such as these have received less scrutiny than those of their tobacco counter- parts. Further attention is needed, because although individual- ized narratives of risk, responsibility, and the like are less blatantthan outright climate science denial, such ''discursive grooming''is now pervasive in structuring the agenda of scholars, policy- makers, and the public. 59,68,69,197,246 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Resource availability Lead contactFurther information and reasonable requests for resources by qualied re-searchers should be directed to and will be fullled by the lead contact, Geof-frey Supran ( gjsupran@fas.harvard.edu ).

Corpora For detailed descriptions of how we previously compiled the 180 ExxonMobildocuments analyzed in this study, see Supran and Oreskes. 1,2For a catalog of all 180 documents, and links to their public archives, see S7, supplemental in- formation . In summary, the 32 internal company documents (1977-2002) were collated from public archives provided by ExxonMobil Investigations Center.103The 72 peer-reviewed documentsamong ExxonMobil Corp's lists of Contributed Publications, except for three articles discovered independently during our research. All 72 publications were (co-)authored by at least one ExxonMobil employee. 104The 76 adverto- rials (1972-2009) expressing any positions AGW (real and human caused,serious, or solvable) were identied computational analysis, scanned documents were converted tosearchable text les using optical character recognition. Text was strippedof formatting details and punctuation, tokenized, and lowercased (for details,see S1.1, supplemental information internal, peer-reviewed, and corpora comprising 69,802 words, 716,477 words, 18,020 in ExxonMobil Corp adverto- rials), respectively. For divergent term (topic) analysis, we added (substituted) several synthetic tokens that combine: terms of identical cognate form (e.g., ''effect'' and ''ef-fects'' became ''effect(s)''); and terms judged by the authors to be near-syno-nyms (e.g., ''co2'' and ''carbon dioxide'' 109,247Document collections were transformed into document-term matrices comprising all: 1- to 5-grams (unique, contig-uous word strings of 1-5 tokens in length) for divergent term analysis; and 1-grams for divergent topic analysis. 248Divergent term analysis (FS and LL ratio)Internal, peer-reviewed, and advertorial corpora were compared pairwiseto identify rhetorical distinctiveness (or divergence) between the termscommunicated in each text. (We combine all (Mobil plus ExxonMobil Corp) ad-vertorials before comparing them against internal and peer-reviewed docu-ments from Exxon and Exxon/ExxonMobil Corp, respectively. This simpliesthe presentation of results without substantively affecting our ndings.)To capture different forms of divergence, we applied two algorithms: FS andDunning LL ratio ( G 2) score.108-110FS and LL are established, complementary tools for word frequency analysis in computational linguistics and digital humanities.110,249,250 The FS indicates how often a given term appears in one corpus versus another. The score ranges from 0 (when only corpus A features the term) to1 (when only corpus B includes the term). To account for the difference inword counts between corpora, we normalized scores by using relative fre-quencies. For example, a score of 0.8 means that 80% of all normalized in-stances of a term appear in corpus B. As Risi and Proctor observe, ''FSs areuseful for identifying taboos: terms generally avoided by one side or theother.'' 109 FSs produce immediately interpretable results, yet to over-represent rarewords. 108To identify subtle patterns that might otherwise escape notice, we also use the LL ( G2) statistic proposed by Dunning (1993), which is a para- metric analysis that primarily identies ''surprising,'' additively over-repre-sented words, while also giving some weight to multiplication. 108,110,251Large |G2| scores indicate terms that have statistically signicant relative frequency differences between two corpora. LLs are therefore useful for identifyingtropes: terms used disproportionately by one side. Divergent topic analysis (LDA) In the eld of automated text summarization, divergent terms identied by LLare referred to as ''topic signatures.'' 249,252In order to identify the topics rep- resented by such terms, and to better understand the roles these terms play inframing each topic, we also examine the documents using topic modeling with LDA. 111LDA is a computational, unsupervised machine-learning algorithm for discovering hidden thematic structure in collections of texts.253A priori coding schemes are not supplied. Rather, 'topics' (clusters of words associated with asingle theme) emerge inductively based on patterns of co-occurrence of wordsin a corpus. We are specically interested in identifying the topical distinctiveness (or divergence) between document categories. In the main text, we comparetopics between ( a) all advertorials and ( b) combined internal and peer-re- viewed documents. To do so, we rst model the distribution of topics over all document cate- gories, by inputting to LDA an aggregated corpus comprising all advertorials,internal documents, and peer-reviewed publications (for details of LDA modelselection, topic validation, and labeling, see section S1.2, supplemental infor- mation ). Once topic-word distributions are obtained, we then take an approach analogous to that for nding divergent terms above, noting thatjust as LL ratios of term frequencies identify divergent terms, LL ratios of topicweights identify divergent topics. We compute LL ratios of topic weights byconstructing document-topic matrices for each of sub-corpora aandb. Although they are run independently, analyses of divergent terms (by FS and LL) and topics (by LL of LDA) are complementary. The former identies thedistinctive usage of individual n-grams by one corpus versus another. Thelatter helps contextualize the thematic role that these words together play incommunicating and framing topics. Frame package analysis Van Gorp 117argues that the ''strongly abstract nature of frames implies that quantitative research methods should be combined with the interpretative pros-pects of qualitative methods.'' To this end, we use the distinctive terms andtopics identied using computational techniques to then inform an inductive,qualitative approach to constructing frames as frame packages in advertorials.Van Gorp 117denes frame packages as an integrated structure of framing devices (manifest textual elements that function as indicators of a frame) andreasoning devices (logical chains of causal reasoning), and proposes Straussand Corbin's 254three-step coding scheme for identifying frame packages andll OPEN ACCESS Article One Earth 4, 696-719, May 21, 2021 713assembling them into a so-called ''frame matrix.''6,10,17,116-118 ,254We adopt this approach. Open coding The rst step is to compile what Van Gorp116calls an ''inventory of empirical indicators that may contribute to the readers' interpretation of the text,'' comprising feasible framing or reasoning devices identied in each document. We used FS, LL, and LDA to systematize this process of locating frames anddetecting how they are shaped by lexical composition (for details, see S1.3,supplemental information ). We further investigated these discursive con- structs by performing collocation searches. 51The logDice statistic was computed to measure collocational association because it permits meaningfulcomparison of different sized corpora. 255,256 Axial coding The second step is to arrange coded devices along ''axes of meaning'' bycomparing and contrasting open-coding results between documents andthen reducing the results to broader meanings or dimensions. 113,116We do so with reference to an inventory of discourses that we assembled based ona literature review of past studies of AGW communications by fossil fuel inter-ests (see S3, supplemental information ). 116 Selective coding The last step is to enter axial codes into a ''frame matrix'' that summarizes theframing and reasoning devices of each frame package. 116 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Supplemental information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j. oneear.2021.04.014 .

One 1989 advertisement, however, was here omitted because, as noted in ref. 2, it is not in fact an advertorial, but an advertisement in The New York Times Magazine that may or may not have actually included Exxon among its industry sponsors3. Unlike advertorials in the NYT, peer-reviewed publications disclosed by ExxonMobil Corp, and internal documents recovered to date, all three of which are bound sets, 'non-peer-reviewed' documents analyzed in our original study are virtually limitless in potential number and scope and so are excluded in this study. Indeed, as noted in ref. 1, there are countless additional climate change communications from ExxonMobil that could be included in future work, including as yet undiscovered internal documents, advertorials and advertisements published in outlets beyond the NYT, and non-peer-reviewed materials such as speech transcripts, television advertisements, social media posts, patent documents, shareholder reports, and third-party communications (for example, from lobbyists, think-tanks, and politicians funded by ExxonMobil). These documents are potentially important, but are not the focus of the present study. See section S6, however, for algorithmic analysis of all ExxonMobil Corp flagship reports concerning AGW. S1.2. Pre-processing To enable computational analysis in R, scanned documents were converted to searchable text files using Readiris Corporate 17 optical character recognition (OCR) software4,5. We then used regular expression search algorithms and manual cleaning to strip out formatting details such as boilerplate archive timestamps and copyright statements; column breaks and whitespaces; author, journal, and publisher information; publication dates; and page numbers. Bibliographies, contents pages, disclosure and acknowledgment statements, appendices, and forewords (unless written by ExxonMobil representatives) were also removed from internal and peer-reviewed documents. In the case of advertorials, company logos and graphics (except for pullout quotations) were removed. Spellcheck was used to identify and correct common OCR-generated errors. We did not use a stemmer or lemmatiser to reduce related words to their base forms, but we added several synthetic tokens that combine terms of similar cognate form (e.g. and \"effect(s)\"). For divergent term analysis (section 2.3), stopwords were not removed. For divergent topic analysis (section 2.4), stopwords were removed, after which word counts of internal and peer-reviewed corpora were respectively scaled down - by randomly sampling the same fraction of words from each document of each corpus - to match one another and to collectively match the word count of advertorials. Only terms appearing at least 10 times in a corpus were included in document-term matrices. S1.3 Topic Modeling S1.3.1 Model selection LDA topic modeling is performed using the R 'topicmodels' package by Gr\u00fcn and Hornik (2011) 6,7. The units of analysis were individual words. These words were itemized for LDA into 'documents' (as defined by Maier et al. (2018)) comprising the original 180 articles8. As prescribed by Maier et al., hyperparameter {0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1} was optimized by maximizing intrinsic topic coherence (as defined by Mimno et al. (2011)) for fixed = 1/K and for a range of K values {10, 11,..., 30}8-10. For each value of K, models corresponding to the two top-scoring values were retained. The most appropriate model was then selected based on intersubjective qualitative author judgment, using what Maier et al. (2018) term a substantive search in coherence-optimized candidates8. This involved assessing the interpretability and relative efficacy of the optimized models for each value of K (and two values) in terms of (a) per-term-per-topic probability distributions (w,k) and (b) reordered lists of the top words assigned to each topic using Sievert and Shirley (2014)'s relevance metric11. Models with K < 15 led topics to blur together, while K > 20 yielded diminishing returns due to excessive granularity. Final parameters based on this recursive process were K = 16, = 0.1, = 1/K = 10. S1.3.2 Topic validation and labeling The semantics of each topic solution were examined on the basis of (a) authors' expert knowledge about climate (denial) communications and familiarity with the documents; (b) four metrics proposed by Maier et al. (2018): (i) Rank-1, which counts how many times each topic is the most prevalent in a document; (ii) intrinsic coherence of individual topics10; (iii) relevance (with weighting =0.6), which accounts for both per-term-per-topic probabilities (w,k) and the marginal probability of each term in the corpus (pw)11; and (iv) concentration (Hirschman-Herfindahl Index), which measures the extent to which topics are spread across documents8; and (c) LL ratio, which, as previously introduced, quantifies the distinctiveness of topics in one sub-corpus versus the other. Accordingly, three \"junk\" topics were excluded owing to semantically incoherent word lists, and/or low Rank-1, and/or low coherence, and/or low LL ratio, and/or high concentration. Remaining topics were validated by intra-topic and inter-topic semantic validity. To evaluate the former, for each topic, we read all documents with relatively large per-document (d)-per-topic (k) probabilities d,k > 0.2, with particular attention to terms with high relevance scores and that are most exclusive to that topic8,12. The guiding questions in our readings were: (i) Is the topic semantically coherent - communicating a substantive theme consistent with the qualitative meaning of the texts?; and (ii) What label should be given to the topic to describe the theme most comprehensively? Table 4 in the main text presents these validated, manually labeled topics. (Note that due to the relatively small corpora under investigation, and, accordingly, a relatively small number of topics emergent from our LDA model, semantic validation based on algorithmic clustering of topics into higher-order themes is not applicable here8,9,13.) Finally, following Boussalis and Coan (2016), we evaluated inter-topic semantic validity by comparing LDA model topic assignments against those identified by manual content analysis of a random sample of 72 documents (40% of all documents)9. In the pilot phase of human coding, two coders - one author and a research assistant - independently coded 10 randomly selected documents. This involved assigning each document a primary topic of either: one of the 13 topics in table 4; or \"other\" if none of those LDA model-derived topics meaningfully captured the main theme. The coders then compared and discussed their coding choices. The coders then independently coded an additional 10 randomly selected documents and again reviewed their assignments. Finally, the coders independently coded another 36 randomly selected documents (20% of all documents); the results of this sample were used to calculate intercoder reliability in terms of percentage agreement (81%) and (0.79) using coders, intercoder agreement was also calculated (89%; = 0.88)17. Having achieved satisfactory intercoder reliability and agreement, one of the coders proceeded to code an additional 36 randomly selected documents. These results, combined with those of the previous 36 coded documents, yielded a sample of 72 randomly coded documents (40% of all documents, including: 47% of peer-reviewed publications; and 33% of advertorials). This sample was then compared against our LDA model's assignments. We find the microaveraged precision and recall for primary topic classifications to be 0.59 and 0.60, respectively. Although these values are lower than common cutoffs of 0.7 to 0.8, they are comparable to those reported by Boussalis and Coan (2016) and are considerably better than rolling a 13-sided dice9,18. Moreover, as Boussalis and Coan (2016) note, \"assessing a topic model using only the primary topic offers a conservative estimate of performance. Several distinct themes often contribute to a document's composition and deciding which is 'primary' is often quite difficult for both human and machine. Indeed, allowing documents to be composed of multiple topics...is one of the major advantages of using the LDA\"9. When we account for the two most probable topics identified by our LDA model, the proportion of documents correctly recalled rises to 0.74. Figure S1 displays the relative prevalence of LDA-generated topics over time in (a) advertorials and (b) internal and peer-reviewed publications. Although, as noted in section S1.4.1, these trends fall short of a comprehensive longitudinal frame analysis and as such should be interpreted with caution, the topic proportions in fig. S1a nevertheless suggest some initial insights. We see, for example, that the topics of 'Climate science uncertainty' and 'AGW science/projections' are interwoven and ExxonMobil Corp's advertorials in the 2000s. We also observe the strong emergence of the 'Climate policy' topic in the run up to and wake of the 1997 UN climate negotiations in Kyoto. Even more apparent is an ever-growing dominance of the 'Energy/emissions challenge' topic throughout the 2000s. These trends are broadly consistent with (i) our observations during 'frame package' open-coding of shifts in the relative prevalence of ExxonMobil's public framing devices over time; (ii) our past codings of ExxonMobil's public positions on climate change over time (Supran and Oreskes (2017, 2020))1,2; and (iii) Schlichting shifting climate change \"master frames\" over time29. The trends we observe paint an overall picture of coevolving topics - and, by approximate extension, frames - whose center of mass has gradually shifted away from explicit attacks on science (represented by our Scientific Uncertainty frame) and towards subtler narratives about energy and emissions (represented by our Socioeconomic Threat and Fossil Fuel Savior frames). S1.3.3 Log-likelihood ratios of topic weights We compute LL ratios of topic weights by constructing document-topic matrices for each of sub-corpora and . In these matrices, we include only those topics whose weights correspond to 1% of each sub-corpus's total word count. S1.4 'Frame package' analysis As noted above, due to the relatively small corpora under investigation, a relatively small number of interpretable topics emerge from our LDA model. We therefore adopt a qualitative approach to inductive frame analysis rather than, for instance, algorithmically clustering topics into frames. The units of analysis in our frame package analysis were individual advertorials. The unit of observation was the advertorial corpus. S1.4.1 Open-coding We conducted open-coding using NVivo digital annotation software, and used corpus linguistic tools to systematize the process in two ways19. First, we used FS and LL as statistical methods for extracting central meanings and locating potential frames; and ran concordance searches to automatically collect text extracts for frame analysis20,21. Although we analyzed each advertorial in its entirety, this approach helped us identify the loci for frames. Touri and Koteyko (2015) have previously demonstrated the efficacy of combining LL analysis with the frame package approach in this way22. Indeed, this was a mutually reinforcing process in that open-coding aided contextual interpretation of how divergent terms identified by FS and LL analysis construct meanings. Second, and in parallel, we used LDA analysis to extract topics that may generally be regarded as \"frame elements [or] a full frame package, or...a combination of the two\" (Walter and Ophir (2019))12. Just as divergent terms from FS and LL help extract central meanings and locate potential frames, \"regularities of [word] co-occurrence\" in topic models, write Klebanov et al. (2008), \"are considered in some linguistic theories as the major building block for characterizing meaning; this idea is well expressed in the famous distributional hypothesis: \"Know the word by the company it keeps\"\"23. Thus, in order to further help detect frames shaped by lexical composition, we also ran concordance searches based on LDA top words to automatically collect text extracts for frame analysis. As Van Gorp (2010) notes, \"[t]he intention of an inductive framing analysis is to reconstruct the frames that are useful to define a certain topic\"24. We therefore open-coded together documents sharing similar LDA topic weightings, which tend to display recurring linguistic elements or framing/reasoning devices indicative of frame packages12,24. We further investigated discursive constructs by performing collocation searches using the logDice statistic applied to corpora tokenized by sentence25-27. Our inventory resulting from open-coding comprised manifest framing devices such as catchphrases, lexical choices, visual images, depictions, metaphors, and exemplars; and (often latent) reasoning devices in the form of apparent definitions of the AGW problem, assignments of responsibility for causing it and/or solving it, identifications of solutions, and moral assessments. As Entman, Matthes, and Pellicano (2009) note, a defining feature of a frame is that it \"repeatedly invokes the same objects and traits, using identical or synonymous words and symbols...\"28. The linguistic tools employed in this study are amenable to the detection of such cues, and therefore to the identification and differentiation of frames from other features such as themes, arguments, and assertions. Digital annotation during open-coding allows us to code the dates of all entries in this inventory. Following Schlichting (2013), this offers insights into how ExxonMobil's public frames have shifted over time29. The primary contribution of our inductive frame analysis, however, is its frame matrix, which may serve as the basis for a coding scheme in future quantitative, deductive, and fully longitudinal content analyses24,30. S1.4.2 Axial coding We codify our axial codings with reference to an inventory of discourses that we assembled based on an informal literature review of past studies of AGW communications by fossil fuel interests24. A summary of discourses identified by this literature review is provided in section S3. S2. SUPPLEMENTAL DIVERGENT TERM ANALYSIS RESULTS S2.1. Mobil versus ExxonMobil Corp advertorials In section 2.1.1, we note that because both Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp advertorials often promoted doubt about climate science, terms conveying explicit doubt are common to both corpora and so do not appear in table 1. One example of this is the term \"debate\", which appears nEM = 9 times in ExxonMobil Corp advertorials and nM = 17 times in Mobil advertorials. This corresponds to FS = 0.37 and G2 = -1.69, indicating statistically insignificant divergence (p = 0.24 and 0.19, respectively). Likewise, \"uncertain(/ty/ties)\" appears nEM = 13 and nM = 18 times, equivalent to FS = 0.44 (p = 0.59) and G2 = -0.35 (p = 0.55). Other common terms displaying statistically insignificant divergence include \"(un)know(/n/ing/ledge)\", \"believe\", \"compl(ex/exity/icated)\", \"answer(s)\", etc. S2.2. Advertorials versus internal and documents In section 2.4, we observe that ExxonMobil's advertorials statistically overuse terms that reduce AGW to a downstream problem caused by consumer energy demand. We here note that advertorials do, in fact, contain divergent terms of \"oil and natural gas\" (compared to internal and peer-reviewed publications - see tables 2 and 3) and \"fossil fuels\" (compared to peer-reviewed publications - see table 3). In the majority of cases, however, these terms are employed in discourses such as Energy Poverty/Prosperity (\"Abundant and affordable, fossil fuels have contributed to unprecedented prosperity for much of the human race. In decades to come, the benefits of modern fossil fuel energy will extend even further\" 152); Policy Apocalypse (\"World economic health will suffer as nations are forced to switch from fossil fuels...\" 181); and Greenwashing/Symbolic Corporate Environmentalism (\"ExxonMobil is also leading the way in increasing safety and reducing marine spills in the oil and natural gas industry.\"137,138). Such examples do not speak to the cause of - or accountability for - AGW or greenhouse gas emissions. If anything, they generally reinforce the narrative that fossil fuels passively satisfy demand; for example: \"[F]ossil fuels...[f]or at least several decades, they will continue to be the major source of the world's energy needs\"128. The number of cases concerning responsibility for AGW or greenhouse gases is statistically insignificant even at p 0.05 levels (\"oil and natural gas\": LL ~ 0.01, FS ~ 0.53; \"fossil fuels\": LL ~ 2.79, FS ~ 0.63). Virtually all such cases appear in advertorials that simultaneously promote doubt about whether AGW is real and human-caused and/or serious and/or solvable. S3. LITERATURE REVIEW OF FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY AGW DISCOURSES As noted in section S1.3.2, frame package analysis was guided by an informal literature review of existing studies of AGW communications by fossil fuel interests. Table S1 summarizes the results of this meta-analysis of contemporary (~1990-present) discourses. The scope of this review was limited to publications concerning AGW communications by fossil fuel producers. 15 such studies were investigated. For studies regarding discourses of climate denial and delay by a broader range of actors, such as conservative news media, columnists, think tanks, and other industries, see for example refs. 9,13,31-36. For a review of AGW framing and discourse literature as a whole, see for example ref. 37. For detailed taxonomies of Doubt Mongering discourse, as labeled in table S1, see ref. 1 and several of the foregoing references. S4. FRAME PACKAGE ANALYSIS RESULTS The following are frame matrices summarizing framing and reasoning devices of each identified frame package. S4.1 Scientific Uncertainty Frame Table S2. Frame matrix of Scientific Uncertainty frame package. Scientific Uncertainty Frame Package Reasoning Devices Description Problem Global warming is unproven Cause Global climate system is complex, science is unsettled Moral evaluation We don't know enough Solutions Wait for better climate science research Framing Devices Discourse Example/Description Catchphrases & lexical choices Climate Doubt Graphs and charts Scientific/Technological Optimism Graphs and charts Exemplars Doubt Mongering Quotations of contrarian scientists (e.g. Heidelberg Appeal; S Fred Singer) Depictions Climate Risk Amorphous \"risk(s)\" of AGW Scientific/Technological and climate\"; \"Climate change: a degree of uncertainty\" Example discourse quotations Climate Risk \"[C]limate changes may pose long-term risks. Natural variability and human activity may lead to climate change that could be significant and perhaps both positive and negative.\"51 Doubt Mongering \"Weather and climate. In the debate over climate change, there is an understandable tendency to use recent weather events to draw conclusions about global warming.\"52 Scientific/Technological Optimism \"To address the scientific uncertainty, governments, universities and industry should form global research partnerships to fill in the knowledge gap, with the goal of achieving a consensus view within a defined time frame.\"53 The Scientific Uncertainty frame presents AGW as unproven and, accordingly, advocates additional climate science research before any policy action is taken. Central to this frame's problem definition and causal attribution is the discourse of 'Doubt Mongering', which promotes false scientific debate about whether AGW is real and human-caused. One example, a 2004 ExxonMobil Corp advertorial entitled \"Weather and climate\", argued that \"In the debate over climate change, there is an understandable tendency to use recent weather events to draw conclusions about global warming\"52. At work here are the key framing devices of catchphrases (such as \"debate\") and metaphors (such as \"weather and climate\"). The advertorial goes on to insist that \"in the face of natural variability and complexity, the consequences of change in any single factor, for example greenhouse gases, cannot readily be isolated and prediction becomes difficult... scientific uncertainties continue to limit our ability to make objective, quantitative determinations regarding the human role in recent climate change or the degree and consequences of future change\". Visual images (such as graphs and charts) and exemplars (such as quotations of the minority opinions of contrarian scientists) help falsely legitimize such claims. Discourses of 'Scientific/Technological Optimism' and 'Climate Risk' help further the impression of scientific debate while simultaneously prescribing the moral evaluation that enough is not yet known to take any policy actions, and the solution of further scientific research. \"To address the scientific uncertainty\", reasons a 2007 advertorial, \"governments, universities and industry should form global research partnerships to fill in the knowledge gap, with the goal of achieving a consensus view within a defined time frame.\"53 Such Scientific/Technological Optimism repeatedly alleges \"gap(s)\" in scientific knowledge and emphasizes the \"promise\" of \"breakthrough\" research collaborations. The \"risk\" rhetoric that emerges in ExxonMobil Corp advertorials serves similar dual functions of presenting AGW as a risk rather than a reality and of thereby rationalizing research rather than policy action, as discussed in section 3.1. As a 2000 advertorial entitled \"Unsettled Science\" puts it, \"[C]limate changes may pose long-term risks. Natural variability and human activity may lead to climate change that could be significant and perhaps both positive and negative.\"51 ExxonMobil Corp accordingly argue that \"future scientific research will help understand how human actions and natural climate change may affect the world and will help determine what actions may be desirable to address the long-term\". S4.2 Socioeconomic Threat Frame Table S3. Frame matrix of Socioeconomic Threat frame package. Socioeconomic Threat Frame Package Reasoning Devices Description Problem Climate policy threatens prosperity Cause Alarmist policy and politics are outrunning science Moral evaluation Binding climate policies are unwarranted and economically dangerous Solutions Voluntary efforts, especially energy efficiency Technology R&D No policy exemptions for developing countries Framing Devices Discourse Example/Description Catchphrases & lexical choices Climate on U.S. economy and livelihoods Whataboutism Projected emissions of developing countries Depictions Climate Risk Amorphous \"risk(s)\" of AGW Energy Poverty/Prosperity Concrete benefits of energy allegedly in jeopardy Dire forecasts for developing countries Free-Market Solutionism Voluntary, free-market responses Policy Apocalypse Concrete alleged costs of climate policy Scientific/Technological Optimism Company scientists committed to \"decades\" of technology R&D University research collaborations Example discourse quotations Climate Risk \"Businesses, governments and NGOs are faced with a daunting task: selecting policies that balance economic growth and human development with the risks of climate change.\"54,55 Energy Poverty/Prosperity \"A global approach [to \"addressing the risk of climate change\"] is needed that recognizes...the need for developing countries to weigh emissions control against energy-intensive economic development which lowers poverty and improves public health.\"56 Free-Market Solutionism \"Governments should...harnes[s] free markets and voluntary measures...[and] encourage and promote voluntary actions by industry and citizens that reduce emissions and use energy wisely.\"53 Policy Apocalypse \"Committing to binding targets and timetables now will alter today's lifestyles and tomorrow's living standards...Carpooling in; sport utility vehicles out. High fuel and electric bills. Factory closures. Job displacement...[T]ax or carbon rationing...\".57 Scientific/Technological Optimism \"[W]e believe that technology provides the key avenue to solutions that manage long-term risk and preserve prosperity. [This] will almost certainly require decades...\".58 Whataboutism \"At what point will developing nations begin to participate in emission-reduction activities?\"59 The Socioeconomic Threat frame argues that binding climate policies (such as the Kyoto Protocol) are alarmist and threaten prosperity, urging voluntary measures instead. Central to this frame is the discourse of 'Policy Apocalypse', which depicts dramatic socioeconomic decline due to climate policies on what Schlichting (2013) observes to be both national (macro) and individual (micro) economic levels29. On the macro level, catchphrases of Policy Apocalypse articulating the \"economic impact\" that climate policies would bring, for example on \"jobs/employment\", were given added credence by exemplar figures from economic studies. One 1997 advertorial, for instance, cited a study by Charles River Associates predicting \"an annual drop in gross domestic product ranging from $105 billion in the year 2010 to $460 billion in 2030\", \"depending on the timing and severity of the plan selected\" to limit emissions60. Another advertorial the following year warned that WEFA, Inc. \"estimates the cost of achieving the Kyoto target by 2010 would result in a loss of 2.4 million jobs, a doubling of electricity prices and an annual loss in economic output of $300 billion...\"61. ExxonMobil also made broader moral appeals, such as a 2000 advertorial calling on policymakers to \"Do No Harm\"62. A key thrust of their argument was that policies such as the Kyoto Protocol could \"entail enormous transfers of wealth [from the United States] to other countries\". On the micro level, advertorials depicted damage to individuals' wealth and wellbeing. \"Committing to binding targets and timetables now will alter today's lifestyles and tomorrow's living standards...\", said a 1997 advertorial57. \"Carpooling in; sport utility vehicles out. High fuel and electric bills. Factory closures. Job displacement...[T]ax or carbon rationing...\". ExxonMobil's scaremongering is offset by, at best, 'Climate Risk' discourse, and at worse, explicit climate denial (which was commonplace through the mid-2000s). As a result of this imbalanced alleged dichotomy, the frame's moral evaluation is that any ambiguous, uncertain \"risk(s)\" of AGW are outweighed by severe economic damages threatened by mandatory climate policies. Such policies are therefore unwarranted and economically dangerous. They are also ineffective, 'Whataboutism' discourse argues. For example, quoting a report by The Business Roundtable, Mobil wrote in a 1998 advertorial that \"'Without full participation by developing countries, the Kyoto Protocol will not lead to a net reduction of global...emissions.'...The Protocol uses 'differentiated targets' for countries to meet, which potentially could put the U.S. at a disadvantage.\"63 Thus, Whataboutism, which also displays elements of discourses that Lamb et al. (2020) term \"The 'free rider' excuse\" and \"Policy perfectionism\", effectively extends the economic scaremongering arguments of Policy Apocalypse discourse, but does so by directly questioning the efficacy of proposed policies rather than simply highlighting their alleged societal costs50. The issue is further confounded by Energy Poverty/Prosperity discourse, which tends to imply that alternative binding policies including developing countries would not be viable either. \"Kyoto failed to include developing countries\", said an advertorial in 2000. \"Yet poorer countries need more energy if they are to provide economic growth and a better life for their people\", implying that developing countries should not be included after all. The only solutions, then, according to Discourses of 'Science/Technology Optimism' and 'Free Market Solutionism', \"[I]t is time to move beyond Kyoto\", the 2000 advertorial above concludes. \"[W]e believe that technology provides the key avenue to solutions...\", said a 2002 advertorial58. \"Governments should...harnes[s] free markets and voluntary measures...\", argued another in 200753.

Specifically, from ExxonMobil Corp's 2020 listing of 'Publications and reports', we identified reports pertaining, in whole or in part, to AGW, AGW mitigation, and/or greenhouse gas emissions120. By way of ExxonMobil Corp webpages (only recent years of reports are made available), digital archives of ExxonMobil Corp webpages (via Wayback Machine), and other online and private collections, we obtained and analyzed the following editions of those reports (see table S1): Corporate Citizenship Reports, 2002-16 (discontinued after 2016, replaced by Sustainability Report) Sustainability Report, 2017 (this is the only edition at the time of analysis) Outlook For Energy, 2005-19 (except 2008 and 2011, which could not be not located) Energy & Carbon Summary, 2017-18 (these are the only editions at the time of analysis) Innovating Energy Solutions, 2019 (this is the only edition at the time of analysis) In the case of Corporate Citizenship Reports and Outlook For Energy reports, which are broad in scope, only sections primarily concerned with AGW, AGW mitigation, and/or greenhouse gas emissions were extracted for analysis, as indicated in table S1. All documents were aggregated into a single corpus, pre-processed (this yielded a flagship report corpus comprising 113,695 words), and algorithmically analyzed according to the same protocols applied to advertorials: corpus comparison to internal and peer-reviewed publications (using frequency score (FS) and Dunning Log-Likelihood (LL) ratio G2 score); and collocation analysis using the logDice statistic. Notable results of these analyses are summarized in the following sub-sections. Table S16. Inventory of the five ExxonMobil Corp flagship reports analyzed: Corporate Citizenship Reports/Sustainability Report, Outlook For Energy, Energy & Carbon Summary, and Innovating Energy Solutions. Shown for each report are the editions (years) retrieved and the sections (chapter titles and corresponding pages) analyzed. \"NA\" = report not located. \"-\" = no report published, to our knowledge, at the time of analysis.

Collocation analysis reveals that across these flagship reports, by far the highest scoring collocate of \"climate change\" and \"global warming\" is \"risk(s)\" (table S18). (Note that, for clarity, we here present the results of FS, LL, and collocation analyses in which all flagship reports were aggregated into a single corpus. Substantively the same results are obtained by treating each type of report as a separate corpus.) Table S17. \"Risk\" rhetoric: highly divergent terms invoking \"risk\" in ExxonMobil Corp flagship reports, versus internal and peer-reviewed publications, by Log-Likelihood ratio (G2) and Frequency Score (FS).

Three strongest collocates reports, by human 11.57 S6.2. Discourse of personal responsibility in ExxonMobil Corp's flagship reports Table S19 (top half) collates terms in ExxonMobil Corp's flagship reports that (a) based on our frame package analysis of advertorials, are characteristic of a Personal Responsibility frame; and (b) are highly divergent between flagship reports and internal and/or peer-reviewed documents according to LL and FS analyses. As with advertorials, we observe that ExxonMobil Corp's flagship reports disproportionately employ terms that present consumer demand for energy as the cause of fossil fuel production, greenhouse gas emissions, and/or AGW; and disproportionately introduce terms conveying individual and/or demand-side actions as accountable for mitigating AGW. By contrast, Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp's internal and/or academic communications disproportionately recognize AGW and/or greenhouse gases as also an upstream problem caused by fossil fuel supply and burning. Table S19. Rhetoric of Personal Responsibility: Highly divergent terms in (top) ExxonMobil Corp flagship reports, by Log-Likelihood ratio (G2) and Frequency Score (FS), characteristic of a Personal Responsibility frame. Example quotations illustrate how flagship reports use these terms to disproportionately present: (a) consumer demand for energy as the cause of - and culpable for - fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, and/or AGW; and (b) individual/demand-side actions as accountable for mitigating AGW. By contrast, divergent terms in (bottom) internal and/or peer-reviewed documents often articulate the causality and culpability of fossil fuel combustion.

Houston1,2, Bruce V. R. John & Geoffry N. De iuliis 1,4* Artificially generated radiofrequency-electromagnetic energy (RF-EME) is now ubiquitous in our environment owing to the utilization of mobile phone and Wi-fi based communication devices. While several studies have revealed that RF-EME is capable of eliciting biological stress, particularly in the context of the male reproductive system, the mechanistic basis of this biophysical interaction remains largely unresolved. To extend these studies, here we exposed unrestrained male mice to RF-EME generated via a dedicated waveguide (905 MHz, 2.2 W/kg) for 12 h per day for a period of 1, 3 or 5 weeks. The testes of exposed mice exhibited no evidence of gross histological change or elevated stress, irrespective of the RF-EME exposure regimen. By contrast, 5 weeks of RF-EME exposure adversely impacted the vitality and motility profiles of mature epididymal spermatozoa. These spermatozoa also experienced increased mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species after 1 week of exposure, with elevated Dn A oxidation and fragmentation across all exposure periods. notwithstanding these lesions, RF-EME exposure did not impair the fertilization competence of spermatozoa nor their ability to support early embryonic development. this study supports the utility of male germ cells as sensitive tools with which to assess the biological impacts of whole-body Rf-eMe exposure. With rapid advances in technology and increasing demand for electronic communication, mobile phone usage has become virtually ubiquitous in the developed world 1. Mobile phone devices receive and emit radiofrequency-electromagnetic energy (RF-EME) to transfer information, and accordingly our exposure to this form of energy is now unprecedented. Thus there is a clear imperative to establish public safety guidelines around the use of these mobile devices. It is, however, difficult to meet this demand due to a current lack of understanding concerning how RF-EME interacts with biology. While to date, no overwhelming clinical effects have been asso- ciated with RF-EME exposure 2-6, multiple studies suggest that this form of energy can elicit subtle detrimental effects on biological systems7-10. Accordingly, the International Agency for Research on Cancer have yet to dis- miss the risks of RF-EME, instead classifying this form of energy as a potential carcinogen. While we continue to debate the biological effects of chronic RF-EME exposure, a growing body of evidence now proposes that acute in vitro RF-EME exposure can elicit oxidative stress in a range of model cell lines 7,9,11-13. A leading hypothesis to account for the mechanistic basis of this response is that RF-EME targets the mitochondria, leading to perturba-tion of proton flux across the inner mitochondrial membrane and promoting electron leakage from the electron transport chain. The resultant formation of superoxide anion serves as a progenitor for additional reactive oxygen species generation (ROS), eventually creating a ROS imbalance and a state of oxidative stress 1,12. 1Priority Research Centre for Reproductive Science, School of Environmental and Life Sciences, Discipline of Biological Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia. 2School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, 3800, Australia. 3School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia. 4Hunter Medical Research Institute, Cancer Research Program, New Lambton Heights, NSW, 2305, Australia. *email: 9:17478 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/The potential for this mechanism of biophysical interaction provides the impetus for well-designed stud- ies to ascertain the effect of RF-EME following whole-body irradiation regimens that more accurately mimic human exposure. In this context, a focus on the male reproductive system is justified owing to the common practice of storing mobile phone devices in the pant pocket, placing them in close proximity to the reproductive tract. Further emphasizing the relevance of the male reproductive system is mounting evidence that male germ cells are particularly susceptible to RF-EME 14 and the associated production of oxidative stress7,12. Indeed, it has been shown that spermatozoa provide a sensitive model to study the specific physical and chemical responses to RF-EME15. The situation arises because of the unique architecture and metabolism of spermatozoa, which places these cells at heightened vulnerability to damage by free radicals16. Moreover, spermatozoa provide a readily assessable means of monitoring adverse biological effects, through functional parameters such as motility, or more detailed analysis that can pinpoint biochemical disruption and more subtle endpoints such as the accumu-lation of DNA damage. Besides serving as a sensitive model, these cells are also clinically important, since the induction of DNA damage in the male germ line contributes to infertility 16 and has the potential to propagate in the embryo, altering developmental trajectory and the health of the offspring16,17. To date, a handful of studies have sought to assess the effects of RF-EME on the male germ line. However, the majority of these studies have focused on isolated spermatozoa or immature male germ cells12,15,18-21. While this approach is conducive to examination of the intricate biochemical and cellular responses to direct RF-EME exposure, the use of alternate in vivo rodent models is likely to present a closer clinical representation of exposure, which can also serve to extend our understanding of EME-perturbed biochemical pathways highlighted from in vitro studies. Whole body models afford the added advantage that they enable observation of the holistic effects of RF-EME on all stages of male germ cell development 22, encompassing the differentiation of germ into spermato- zoa and their subsequent functional maturation as they transit the epididymis. With a sustained interest in estab-lishing the biophysical mechanism(s) of action for RF-EME on biology, we report the use of a mouse model to probe reproductive stress following whole-body RF-EME exposure regimens. Specifically, a dedicated waveguide machine (Fig. 1), similar to that developed by Puranen and colleagues 23, was constructed to facilitate exposure of unrestrained mice to RF-EME at 905 MHz with a specific absorption rate (SAR) of 2.2 W/kg. Mice were exposed to RF-EME for 12 h per day, over a period of between 1 to 5 weeks and subsequently the testes and epididymides were collected to investigate the effects of RF-EME on spermatogenesis and sperm function. Results Whole-body Rf- eMe exposure does not elicit gross histological changes in the mouse testis. Following exposure of unrestrained mice to whole-body RF-EME exposure, we first examined the effects of our varied regimens on the average growth rate (Fig. 2a) of irradiated animals over the 5 weeks; revealing no changes in rate between the sham and RF-EME exposure groups. Similarly, gross testis morphology of sham and RF-EME exposed mice also remained comparable to that of control mice (Fig. 2b), with all samples exhibiting healthy tubule growth and extensive germ cell proliferation irrespective of the duration of exposure. All mice were 8 weeks of age at the commencement of the 1, 3 and 5 week study, however, some variance in body weight between cohorts was observed on their arrival. Nevertheless, no significant change in average growth rate was recorded between exposures, over the 35-day study (Fig. 2a). Guided by our previous studies in which we have shown that in vitro RF-EME exposure can induce a state of oxidative stress, leading to DNA damage in some male germ cell types 7,12, we next explored the levels of DNA fragmentation and lipid peroxidation present within the testes of RF-EME exposed animals. For the former analy-sis, testis sections were probed with an anti- H2AX antibody, a marker of DNA double strand breaks (Fig. 3). This revealed modest levels of DNA damage, which was largely restricted to meiotic germ cells within the seminiferous tubules. Furthermore, this tissue localization and levels of H2AX staining were consistent across the panel, with no effect observed due to EME exposure (p = 0.07) or time. With regard to lipid peroxidation (Fig. 4), we doc- umented a similar response, with no substantive increases in the lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal being detected within the testis sections of any RF-EME treatment group with respect to the untreated or sham controls (p = 0.22). Whole-body RF-EME exposure adversely impacts the vitality and motility profiles of mature spermatozoa. To explore the effect of in vivo RF-EME exposure on mature spermatozoa, we next investi- gated the outcomes of our irradiation regimen on sperm motility and vitality (Fig. 5). It was observed that the total number of live spermatozoa isolated from the cauda epididymis was diminished with RF-EME exposure (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5a), an effect that was particularly evident after 5 weeks of exposure (p < 0.001); whereas no changes were observed in our sham-exposed populations. In a similar manner, we noted a significant reduction in the percentage of motile spermatozoa isolated from RF-EME exposed mice following a treatment regimen extending over 5 weeks (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5b). This reduction in overall sperm motility occurred commensurate with defects in the objective measurements of progressive and rapid sperm motility (Fig. 5c,d) in exposed mice. In this regard, the impact on both parameters was again most notable following 5 weeks of exposure (p < 0.001). Conversely, spermatozoa isolated from the sham exposure groups displayed no such changes in their vitality or motility profile; with both parameters remaining indistinguishable from those documented in an unexposed control group of males. Whole-body Rf-eMe exposure elevates oxidative stress and Dn A damage in mature spermatozoa. To determine whether the functional lesions in motility and vitality documented in the spermatozoa of RF-EME exposed mice were linked to the induction of oxidative stress, we next investigated the levels of cellular and mito-chondrial ROS present in these cells (Fig. 6). Specifically, the dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescent probe was uti- lized to provide insight into levels of cellular ROS production (Fig. 6a). Approximately 14% and 75% spermatozoa 3 Scientific RepoRtS 9:17478 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/stained positively for DHE in the negative (untreated) and positive (i.e. hydrogen peroxide exposed) control pop- ulations, respectively. When the experimental groups were analyzed, neither the sham nor the RF-EME treatment conditions resulted in a significant deviation from basal ROS generation detected by DHE labeling. This was in contrast to mitochondrial ROS production, where the MitoSOX Red (MSR) probe (Fig. 6b) revealed a significant, two-fold elevation in ROS generation within the sperm mitochondria of animals exposed to RF-EME for periods of either 1 or 3 weeks, compared to the control and sham-exposed cell populations (p < 0.05). Intriguingly, sperm mitochondrial ROS generation had normalized to basal, control levels following 5 weeks of RF-EME exposure. DNA damage assays were next employed to gain insight into the consequences of RF-EME induced ROS generation on the DNA integrity of mouse spermatozoa (Fig. 7). The halo assay (Fig. 7a), which evaluates DNA integrity based on the presence or absence of a halo-like stained DNA structure, revealed a modest but significant increase (i.e. ~5-6%) in the percentage of DNA-fragmented spermatozoa following 3 and 5 weeks of RF-EME exposure (p < 0.05). Consistent with these findings, the application of an alkaline comet assay (Fig. 7b) con - firmed that whole-body RF-EME exposure stimulated sperm DNA fragmentation. After 1 week, sperm DNA fragmentation was elevated by 18%, however, this increase only gained significance after 5 weeks of exposure (23% increase in fragmentation; p < 0.05). Given the elevation in mitochondrial ROS, we next demonstrated that this DNA damage was likely oxidative in nature, highlighted by an increase in the percentage of RF-EME exposed sperm displaying positive staining for 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG; Fig. 7c); a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage. Indeed, across each of the three exposure times assessed, RF-EME induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in 8-OH-dG labelling relative to control and sham exposed populations. As anticipated, 8-OH-dG label-ling was localized to the nuclear compartment of the sperm head and was consistently more intense in RF-EME treated spermatozoa (Fig. 7d). Figure 1.

Shown are (a) the complete waveguide apparatus with lid in open configuration and (b) close-up view illustrating the dimensions of the inner chamber. (c) A graphical experimental overview. (1) Mice were RF-EME or sham exposed for 1, 3 or 5 weeks and compared to a control population that did not enter the apparatus (untreated). Mice were culled and their spermatozoa were examined using sperm functional assays and a variety of oxidative stress assays (2). The testes of these mice were also examined for gross histological abnormalities and for markers of oxidative stress, via tissue sections (3).4 Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:17478 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/Whole-body Rf-eMe exposure does not impair the fertilization competence of spermatozoa. In order to determine if RF-EME mediated induction of sperm DNA damage was sufficient to compromise the fertilization competence of these cells, we undertook an assessment of selected markers of sperm capacitation and in vitro fertilization success utilizing the spermatozoa from 5 week RF-EME exposed mice (Fig. 8). Of the capac- itation markers assessed, neither the number of sperm displaying complete flagellum phosphotyrosine labelling (Fig. 8a) or the ability to undergo a calcium ionophore induced acrosome reaction (Fig. 8a) differed significantly between the control and RF-EME treatment groups. Similarly, the average number of spermatozoa bound to the zona pellucida of fixed oocytes was also unchanged across our control (25), sham (25) and RF-EME exposed (19) populations (Fig. 8c,d; p = 0.99). As an extension of this assessment of sperm function, the ability of spermatozoa from all three treatment groups to achieve fertilization and progression to the blastocyst stage of development was then investigated. Exposure to RF-EME under our regime, did not exert any observable effect on fertilization rate (Fig. 8d), with all treatment groups resulting in the fertilization of between 83-87% of inseminated oocytes. Furthermore, when these zygotes were cultured through to the blastocyst stage of development (Fig. 8e), a modest increase was observed in the development rate of the RF-EME group, although this did not prove to be signifi- cantly different from the sham exposed or untreated sperm groups. Discussion Several lines of evidence now propose RF-EME to be capable of inducing a state of oxidative stress in a variety of cell types24-27, including the male germline7,12. It is also well established that spermatozoa are particularly sensitive to oxidative insults, a phenomenon that may be traced to their surplus of oxidizable substrates and restricted anti-oxidant capacity 16,28. What remains less certain is how RF-EME is capable of inducing such cellular responses in the absence of a thermal induction mechanism. In seeking to resolve this question, here we have utilized an in vivo exposure model that not only approximates the complexities of environmental RF-EME exposures, but also ena-bles the dissection of RF-EME effects on key stages of male germ line development. Specifically, our exposure reg-imen enabled determination of the interaction of RF-EME with spermatozoa held exclusively within the luminal environment of the epididymis (1 week exposure), as well as those exposed during their progression through a spermatogenic cycle and transit of the epididymal tract (5 week exposure). Consistent with our previous in vitro investigations 7,12, we here contribute data to support the dysregulation of sperm mitochondria as a pivotal target for driving RF-EME associated stresses in the male reproductive system.

Similarly, both the somatic and germline tissue within the seminiferous tubules also proved recalcitrant to RF-EME induction of DNA damage or lipid peroxidation. Such findings are not entirely unexpected given the lack of robust evidence to support the ability of environmental RF-EME exposure conditions to elicit such obvious overt tissue damage 1. Rather, on the basis of prevailing evidence we consider that any biophysical RF-EME interactions would likely result in more subtle phenotypic changes 1, thus justifying our primary focus on the male germ line as a sensitive model cell type16 to explore mechanisms of RF-EME mediated stress. Accordingly, we observed a clear attenuation of sperm motility, occurring in concert with increased mitochondrial ROS generation, after 1 and 3 weeks of whole-body RF-EME exposure. In the absence of commensurate increase in cytosolic ROS production, these data provide correlative evidence that sperm mitochondria are indeed prone to RF-EME dysregulation and that the ensuing production of ROS was sufficient to compromise the most vulnerable aspects of sperm cell function. Additional support for this model rests with a growing body of literature implicating RF-EME in the generation of a state of oxidative stress in a variety of cell types other than the male germ line 11,13,31-34. An interesting observation to arise from our study was that the induction of mitochondrial ROS generation after 1 and 3 weeks of RF-EME exposure was followed by an apparent normalization of mitochondrial ROS after an additional 2 weeks of exposure. At present, we remain uncertain what mechanism(s) could account for the Figure 3. RF-EME exposure does not induce H2AX expression in the testis. Testis sections from untreated control animals (UT), as well as those of the sham and RF-EME exposure groups, were probed with anti-phospho- H2AX antibodies (red) to detect DNA double strand breaks.

(b) Analysis of pixel intensity was performed on the germ cell population within the seminiferous tubules in order to quantify H2AX expression levels across treatments. Graphical data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 3 mice/treatment group, with 8-25 tubules being analyzed for each testis).6 Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:17478 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/mitigation of this response, but speculate they may be associated with reduced mitochondrial function in germ cells subjected to prolonged RF-EME exposure, or that these cells are capable of responding to this challenge through an elevation of intrinsic antioxidant defenses. As an extension of this hypothesis, it is possible that the male reproductive tract also mounts a protective response to chronic RF-EME via an upregulation of exogenous antioxidant production. In keeping with this notion, it has been shown that the concentrations of both vitamin A and E increase in the testis of RF-EME exposed rats 35. Alternatively, this phenomenon could be linked to mor - phological changes in the mitochondrion during spermatogenesis36; such as the extensive vacuolization these organelles undergo during the maturation of spermatogonia to spermatocytes37. Accompanying such changes, mitochondrial activity is also elevated in spermatocyte and spermatid populations, whereas mature mouse sper - matozoa are known to limit their investment into oxidative phosphorylation and instead utilize glycolysis to meet their energy demands38. Finally, there is also evidence that the mitochondria of caput epididymal spermatozoa are silenced39, which may afford some protection against perturbed mitochondrial ROS production while also identi- fying a dynamic sensitivity of spermatozoa. The cauda epididymal spermatozoa sampled after enduring 5 weeks of EME exposure, will comprise a mixture of cells exposed during various stages of germ cell development and mat-uration, however the majority of the cells will likely have encountered EME as morphologically mature spermato-zoa, which may house less vulnerable mitochondria. Irrespective of the mechanism(s) responsible for suppression of ROS production, the downstream detrimental legacy of RF-EME exposure persisted in mature spermatozoa Figure 4. RF-EME exposure does not induce elevated 4-hydroxynonenal formation in the testis. Testis sections from untreated control animals (UT), as well as those of the sham and RF-EME exposure groups, were probed with anti-4-hydroxynonenal antibodies (green) to detect by-products of lipid peroxidation. (a) Representative images are depicted, with the scale bar equating to 200 \u00b5m. A secondary antibody only control is also included. Corresponding DAPI stained images illustrating tubule morphology are included as insets included in the upper right corner of each panel. (b) Analysis of pixel intensity was performed on the germ cell population within the seminiferous tubules in order to quantify 4-hydroxynonenal expression levels across treatments. Graphical data are presented as mean + SEM (n = 3 mice/treatment group, with 10-20 tubules being analyzed for each testis).7 Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:17478 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/after 5 weeks of treatment as evidenced by the demonstration that these cells suffered the highest losses of vitality and motility. Thus, although the production of mitochondrial ROS was ameliorated in spermatozoa after 5 weeks of RF-EME exposure, these cells were unable to repair the oxidative damage they sustained during prior exposure. The identification of sperm motility as being vulnerable to RF-EME exposure is consistent, independent evi- dence that this functional attribute is among of the first to succumb to elevated levels of ROS 40,41. ROS mediated lipid peroxidation is known to drive the production of reactive aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, which causes irreversible protein modifications and alkylation of the sperm axoneme 42. Where oxidative stress levels may spike at an earlier window in sperm development, limiting the amount of detectable ROS in the sperm collected at 5 weeks, these cells can retain hallmarks of this pathology, in the form of oxidized DNA lesions. Consistent with this notion, we detected an increase in the oxidative stress biomarker, 8-OH-dG, in the nuclei of sperm across all exposure regimens; indicating abundant guanosine oxidation and supporting RF-EME as a mediator of oxidative stress. A similar finding has been reported by Liu et al . 19, who documented a significant elevation in 8-OH-dG formation in spermatocytes exposed to RF-EME. Accompanying oxidative DNA damage, we observed elevated sperm DNA fragmentation in the form of single strand breakage following whole-body RF-EME exposure. These data accord with the enhanced levels of DNA fragmentation documented in sperma-tozoa 7,21,43 and spermatocytes19 exposed to RF-EME; a phenomenon that may describe a continuum of DNA damage, originating from oxidative DNA insults44. While further studies are required to pinpoint variations in the sensitivity of different germ cell populations to RF-EME in vivo , our data suggests that a window of vulnerability may extend across both testicular and post-testicular (i.e. epididymal) phases of development. Not with standing an elevation in oxidative stress mediated DNA damage and an attendant reduction of motil- ity, the spermatozoa recovered from mice exposed to 5 weeks of whole-body RF-EME did not display any associ- ated lesions in their fertilization potential. Thus, these cells retained their ability to capacitate, acrosome react, and bind zona pellucidae at rates that were statistically indistinguishable from those of untreated and sham exposed mice. Moreover, these spermatozoa were capable of supporting normal rates of in vitro fertilization and early embryo development. In seeking to reconcile these data, a key limitation is that the in vitro fertilization strategy adopted in this study, introduced selection bias for the higher quality, motile spermatozoa which potentially harbour only basal levels of DNA damage. Even in the lowest motility group, after 5 weeks of EME exposure, 60% of the recovered cells remain motile. This notion is consistent with studies of human IVF patients, which have revealed that in vitro assays of sperm-zona pellucida binding are highly selective for spermatozoa with intact DNA and normal motility profiles 45. Alternatively, it is possible that the burden of DNA damage harbored by the fertilizing spermatozoon was sufficiently resolved by the oocyte. In any case, this clearly illustrates, reassur - ingly, that even at the supraphysiological regimens of whole-body RF-EME exposure used in this study, no overt impairment to fertilization potential and early embryo development was observed. This is perhaps in alignment to the lack of overt morphological changes observed in the reproductive tissue of exposed mice, confirming Figure 5. Sperm vitality and motility declines in response to RF-EME exposure. Spermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymis of untreated control animals (UT), as well as those of the sham and RF-EME exposure groups. (a) Sperm vitality was assessed via the eosin-exclusion method. Next, the percentage of sperm displaying (b) any form of motility, (c) progressive motility, and (d) rapid motility was determined using computer assisted semen analysis.

In this context, and given the evidence of cellular oxidative impacts, we cannot yet discount the possibility of transmission of subtle phenotypic or epigenetic changes in the offspring. Thus, future studies focused on trans- and multi-generational outcomes will likely play a key role in resolving any potential for cumulative changes caused by RF-EME. While more targeted investigations into this aspect of exposure is warranted, it is perhaps comforting that whole-body chronic exposure (life-long, 24 h/day) to electromagnetic fields has been reported to elicit no harmful effects on the fertility or development of mice over four successive generations 46. In summary, our evidence supports the hypothesis that sustained whole-body RF-EME is capable of inducing a state of oxidative stress in the male germ line, a cell vulnerable to the effects of ROS. Furthermore, our data further implicate the mitochondria as the target for RF-EME biophysical interaction, with a consequential eleva-tion of mitochondrial ROS generation being linked to reduced motility and elevated oxidative DNA damage and DNA fragmentation in the spermatozoa of exposed males. Whilst these lesions were not sufficient to compromise fertilization competence or early embryo development, it will nonetheless be of interest to investigate the trans-generational influence of whole-body RF-EME in future studies. Methods chemical reagents. The reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless stated otherwise. Fluorescent probes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA), unless otherwise stated. All fluorescence imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). Figure 6.

Adult ( >8 weeks) male C57BL/6 mice were irradiated with 2 W/kg and 905 MHz RF-EME in a waveguide (Fig. 1) for 12 h daily, during a night (7 pm-7 am) cycle while the waveguide lid was closed. This waveguide was constructed by the Physics Department at the UON and comprises a cylindrical aluminium chamber (radius of 60 cm and depth of 16 cm) and mechanically operated lid. The chamber sides were insulated with carbon impregnated foam (RFI Industries, VIC, Australia) to prevent RF-EME reflection. Small fans were implemented for external air circulation into the chamber through the base. RF-EME was generated by a Rohde and Schwarz SMC100A signal generator (Macquarie Park, NSW , Australia), connected to a signal amplifier. Chamber lid operation was controlled by a timed motor in order to raise or lower the lid every 12 h. Mice were housed in plastic cages with Perspex lids and plastic water bottles to ensure there was no metal, which interferes with RF-EME distribution. Cages were arranged radially around a central RF-EME emitting antenna, and oriented so that the water bottle furthest from the radiation source to minimize liquid interference. When mice were removed they were replaced with 'phantoms' composed of a 50 ml Falcon tube filled with 142 mM NaCl in deionized water to mimic blood. Sham exposed males were placed in the waveguide under identical conditions, however, the signal generator was turned off, thus receiving no exposure to RF-EME. All treatment groups were sacrificed at three time points; 1, 3 and 5 weeks of exposure and compared to an untreated control population of mice that were not placed inside the chamber. Mice were weighed weekly throughout the treatment regime (EME or sham exposed) during the time the waveguide lid was open. The weights were recorded after mice were individually placed in a tared container on top of the weigh tray of an electronic balance. The SAR delivered to the mice was calibrated using a NARDA NBM 520 electric field meter with an EF1891 probe to measure electric fields in the empty irradiation system. Radial electric field measurements were made as a function of distance from the vertical aerial mounted in the center of the system after the antenna length was adjusted to maximize power supplied to the system at a frequency of 905 MHz. For 1 W input to the aerial a max- imum electric field of 94 V/m was measured 16 cm from the center, whereas in their slightly larger setup, Puranen et al. 23 measured a maximum electric field of 80 V/m at 15 cm from the center. The variation of E field with radial distance and the maximum electric fields in the two setups were found to be similar for the same power input. The SAR (W kg-1) is related to the electric field, E, in a sample of conductivity (S m-1), and density (kg m-3) by =| | SARE 2/ (Wkg 1) (1) Figure 7. RF-EME exposure induces oxidative DNA damage in spermatozoa. Spermatozoa were isolated from the cauda epididymis of untreated control animals (UT), as well as those of the sham and RF-EME exposure groups. These cells were assessed for DNA fragmentation using (a) the halo assay showing the percentage of cells fragmented (n = 5-8 mice/treatment group, each with 100 sperm assessed for each replicate) and then (b) quantified by the alkaline comet assay, expressed as percentage tail intensity and normalized to control data for each run (n = 3 mice/treatment, each with 50-70 sperm cells assessed).

Puranen et al . (2009) measured a SAR of 0.11 W/m for the above 1 W input to the aerial. During our irradiations the input RF power was 20 W , corre- sponding to an average SAR of 2.2 W/kg since the geometry of our irradiation system is very similar to that of Puranen et al.23. Assessment of testis sections. Upon dissection, testes were fixed in Bouin's solution, sectioned, dewaxed and rehydrated using standard protocols47. One section from each testis was stained with hematoxylin and eosin to investigate testis morphology, while the remainder were prepared for immunohistochemistry as previously described48. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving slides in 50 mM Tris (pH 10.5) for 9 min. Tissue sections were blocked (3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-PBST, 10% goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS for 5 min and labeled with appropriate pairs of primary (either anti-phospho- H2AX (2 \u00b5g/ml) or anti-4-hydroxynonenal (1/300) overnight at 4 \u00b0C) and AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 h at 37 \u00b0C). After washing in PBS, sections were counterstained with DAPI (0.5 \u00b5g/ml), and viewed using fluorescence microscopy. Mean pixel intensity analysis was conducted on images using ImageJ version 1.48 V (NIH, USA). Pixel intensity determination was performed only on the seminiferous tubules, with surrounding interstitial tissue isolated from this analysis. For H2AX, meiotic germ cells were excluded from the analysis due naturally occurring high levels of double strand breaks in these cells 50. Figure 8. RF-EME exposure did not compromise the fertilization competence of spermatozoa. Spermatozoa were isolated from the cauda epididymis of untreated control animals, as well as those of the 5-week sham and RF-EME exposure groups. These cells were driven to capacitate and then assessed for (a) anti-phosphotyrosine labeling of the sperm flagellum, and (b) their ability to undergo a calcium ionophore induced acrosome reaction [assessed via peanut agglutinin (PNA) labeling of the sperm outer acrosomal membrane with values being normalized to the untreated control], and (c) binding to the zona-pellucida (ZP) of homologous oocytes (the average number of spermatozoa bound to ZP intact oocytes is shown). In each instance a non-capacitated (NC) population of spermatozoa from untreated animals was included as a negative control. Alternatively, spermatozoa were examined for their ability to (d) fertilize oocytes in vitro and subsequently (e) support early embryo development through to the blastocyst stage. In all instances, assessed spermatozoa were isolated from each of three animals and data are presented as mean + SEM, except for (d), where 3-7 mice were used. The number of biological replicates is shown in each bar. (a, b) A minimum of 100 spermatozoa from each animal were assessed for phosphotyrosine labelling of the sperm flagellum, and PNA labelling of the acrosome. (c, d) 8-10 oocytes per replicate were assessed for sperm-ZP binding and 11-30 for fertilization, and (e) 11-30 embryos were assessed for blastocyst development.11 Scientific RepoRtS 9:17478 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-53983-9 www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/preparation of spermatozoa. Epididymides were dissected immediately after euthanasia and mature sper - matozoa were collected from the caudal segment by retrograde perfusion before being resuspended in 1 ml of modified Biggers, Whiting, Whittingham media (BWW)49. Objective sperm motility was assessed by computer assisted sperm analysis (IVOS, Hamilton Thorne, Danvers, MA, USA) as previously described50, and sperm vital- ity was determined via eosin exclusion. Determination of Ro S production in spermatozoa. Spermatozoa were assessed for ROS generation via flow cytometry with the mitochondrial superoxide in with previously described51. Sperm chromatin dispersion (Halo) assay. Spermatozoa were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Spermatozoa were defrosted and mixed with 1% low melting point agarose at 37 \u00b0C and applied to Superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-coated with 0.65% agarose. The slides were sealed with a coverslip and placed at 4 \u00b0C to solidify for 5 min. After removing the coverslips, the slides were treated with 0.08 N HCl for 7 min in foil, followed by Halo solution 1 (pH 7.5; 0.4 M Tris, 1% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 0.8 M DTT) for 10 min and Halo solution 2 (pH 7.5; 0.4 M Tris, 1% SDS, 2 M NaCl) for 5 min at room temperature to lyse the cells, relax and neutralize the DNA. Next, slides were exposed to Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5; 0.1 M tris, 0.09 M boric acid, 0.002 M EDTA) for 2 min, then washed in ethanol (70%, 90% then 100%) for 2 min each to dehydrate the slides. After air drying, slides were counterstained with DAPI (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS and mounted. Alkaline comet assay. The alkaline comet assay was performed as described previously52. DNA damage was analysed using Comet Assay IV software (Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, UK). Hydrogen peroxide treatment (500 \u00b5M, 5 min at room temperature) was utilized as a positive control. To compare sperm DNA damage between treatments, percentage tail DNA values of each cell in the treated samples were normalized to that of the average percentage tail DNA of the respective untreated control for each time point. The control itself taking on the value of 1. The normalized data for each sample then contributed to a biological replicate. The average of these replicates are then graphed. The normalization process is required to minimize the noise generated by the small fluctuations in tail intensity between independent runs and days. oxidative DnA damage assay. Oxidative DNA damage was assessed by suspending 2 \u00d7 106 spermatozoa in Oxidative DNA/RNA damage antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1/40 in PBST overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 450 \u00d7 g and washed in PBS before incubation in AlexaFluor-488 goat rabbit secondary (Abcam, Massachusetts, US) diluted 1/400 in PBST for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Finally, cells were again washed and resuspended in PBS for counting and imaging via fluorescence microscopy. Sperm functional assays and in vitro fertilization. Cauda epididymal spermatozoa were assessed for their ability to undergo capacitation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation, a calcium ionophore (A23187) induced zona pellucidae 53,54. 2 \u00d7 - matozoa female C57BL/6 mice55. The gametes were co-incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C prior to the oocytes being assessed for fertilization (i.e. extrusion of second polar body and/or pronucleus formation). Zygotes were cultured in HTF medium overnight and trans-ferred into G1 PLUS culture medium (Vitrolife, Stockholm, Sweden) on the morning of day 2 followed by an Assay/measurementUntreated control1 week 3 weeks 5 weeks Sham EME Sham EME Sham EME Body weight NA 20 20 14 14 8 8 Testis histology 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Testis staining: H2AX 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Testis staining: 4-hydroxynonenal 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Sperm vitality 5 6 6 5 6 8 8 Sperm motility, progressive and rapid 5 5 6 5 6 8 8 Dihydroethidium staining 4 6 9 5 8 8 8 MitoSOX red staining 6 6 12 5 11 11 11 DNA fragmentation 5 6 6 5 6 8 8 Comet tail intensity 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 8OHdG 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 Tyrosine phosphorylation 3 NA NA NA NA 3 3 Acrosome reaction 3 NA NA NA NA 3 3 Sperm-zona pellucida adhesion 3 NA NA NA NA 3 3 Fertilization 7 NA NA NA NA 3 5 Blastocyst development 3 NA NA NA NA 3 3 Table 1.

The percentage of fertilized oocytes as well as embryos that had reached blastocyst stage by the morning of day 5 was calculated. Study design. Twenty adult male mice were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (untreated control, sham exposure control, RF-EME exposed), determined by the number of mice that could fit in the waveguide (10 cages, 2 mice per cage). Six mice were randomly selected for the 7 and 21 day intervals, while eight mice were selected for the 35 day interval. After each interval the mice were phenotyped for male fertility. For the pur - pose of this study, we ran the experiment twice to generate sufficient numbers of biological replicates for certain assays, e.g. MitoSOX, where we used 11 replicates. Each of the two treatment cycles consisted of 6 males treated for 1 week, 6 males treated for 3 weeks and 8 males treated for 5 weeks. The individual number of replicates for each assay can be found within the figures and is also shown in Table 1, below. As 20 mice were utilized for end point assays over the period of 5 weeks, the reduction in the number of replicates for body weight measurements decreases with the use of these individuals at the 1 and 3 week time points accordingly. Statistical analysis. Samples from each animal were considered as a single biological replicate. Experimental data was analyzed using JMP version 11 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Normality of datasets was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks test ( = 0.05). A one-way ANOV A was used to compare normally distributed treatments, with a post-hoc Tukey's honest significant difference test ( = 0.05). For data not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon test was used ( = 0.05), with a post-hoc Dunn's test. Error bars represent standard error values around the mean. ethics statement.

Recombination physiologically induces DNA DSBs, and we tested if low doses of EMF irradiation affect this developmental stage. Recombining preB cells, were exposed for 48 h to low intensity EMFs (maximal radiative power density flux S of 9.5 \u00b5W/cm2 and electric field intensity 3 V/m) from waves of frequencies ranging from 720 to 1224 MHz. Irradiated preB cells show decreased levels of recombination, reduction which is dependent upon the power dose and most remarkably upon the frequency of the applied EMF. Although 50% recombination reduction cannot be obtained even for an S of 9.5 \u00b5W/cm2 in cells irradiated at 720 MHz, such an effect is reached in cells exposed to only 0.45 \u00b5W/cm2 power with 950 and 1000 MHz waves. A maximal four fold recombination reduction was measured in cells exposed to 1000 MHz waves with S from 0.2 to 4.5 \u00b5W/cm2 displaying normal levels of H2AX phosphorylated histone. Our findings show that developing B cells exposure to low intensity EMFs can affect the levels of production and diversity of their antibodies repertoire. Somatic or V(D)J recombination is the process that assembles in all jawed vertebrates the gene segments encoding the variable regions of the specific antigen immune receptors (T cell and Immunoglobulin IG) of the lymphoid T and B cells1. This process occurs in lymphocyte precursors, is mediated by RAG (recombination activating gene proteins) recombinase a heterotetrameric complex made of a dimer of RAG1 and two monomers of RAG22,3. RAG1 a member of the DDE transposase/Integrase family is the key catalytic component of RAG. RAG binds specifically to recombination signal sequences (RSS) flanking germinal coding V , (D), J gene segments in the variable region at the IG and T cell receptor loci and catalyzes their rearrangement4. RAG recombination gen - erates two DNA hairpins at the coding ends and two blunt double stranded DNA cuts at the signal ends. RAG maintains the paired cleaved ends in proximity and allows the ubiquitous set of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair enzymes (Artemis, ATM, DNAPk, XRCC4, DNA Ligase IV) to resolve the hairpins and join the cleaved ends. For B and T lymphocytes recombination occurs at two stages during their differentiation5. We will discuss only the B lineage development in the bone marrow. First two rounds, D to J (in pre-pro stage) followed by V to DJ recombination (in late-pro stage) occur in pro-B cells at their Ig Heavy chain locus ( IgH). Once IgH locus is rearranged, expressed Ig\u00b5 together with a surrogate light chain comprising 5 Vpre B proteins and two Ig, signaling subunits assemble the pre-B cell receptor(pre-BCR)6, which marks the large pre-B cell stage. Stromal bone marrow cells secreted interleukin IL-7 binds to their receptor (IL-7R), a signal which is transduced as pro-survival the activator of transcription 5A and B (STAT5A and B)9,10 which stimulate transcription of Ccnd3 encoding Cyclin D311 and the B D3 and pre-B cells through cell cycle G1 checkpoint allowing the replication of their DNA. Secondly, IL-7R signals in large pre-B cells through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)13 and protein Kinase B (AKT) phosphorylating the forkhead box O 1, 3 (FOXO1,3) transcription factors, modification which exports them from nuclei and targets the proteins for degradation14-16. FOXO1, 3 activate e-rag enhancer and transcription14,17. In large pre-B cells IL-7R also signals via the nuclear factor kappa light chain OPEN 1Department of Physics of Life and Environmental Sciences, Horia Hulubei National Institute for R&D in Physics and Nuclear Engineering, 077125 Mgurele, Ilfov, Romania. 2Department of Immunology, Internal Medicine, Colentina Clinical Hospital, 72202 Bucharest, Romania. 3Center for Advanced Laser Technologies, National Institute for Laser Plasma and Radiation Physics, 077125 Mgurele, Ilfov, of activated B cells transiently downregulating RAG proteins in large pre-B cells. After four to five rounds of replication the large pre-B lymphocytes get under the influence of cell surface pre-BCR receptor aggregation and stimulation (in absence of a bonified ligand), a signal which antagonizes that of IL-7R, induces cell cycle arrest and transitions cells towards small pre-B stage20. Stimulation of pre-BCR cascades through RAS and extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) upregulating the E2A 3' Igk locus accessible for recombination21. Another effect of pre-BCR stimulation signals through spleen tyrosine kinase(SYK) and B cell-linker protein(BLNK) which together repress PI3K but stimulate mitogen activated p38 kinase which activates FOXO1 to express RAG 13,20,22. Consequently, in small pre-B cells subsequent V to J rearrangements occur at Ig L k or light chain loci. Upon completion of a successful V to J recombined allele, the cell develops into na\u00efve immature B cell, exposing IgM B cell receptors (BCR). Interference of V(D)J recombination with other concurrent exogenous factors favoring DNA DSBs, like ionizing or EM irradiation can induce DNA damage which may lead to oncogenic translocations such as those described in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)23,24. Exposure of human blood lymphocytes from healthy donors to strong EMFs (2 h irradiation with sinusoidal pulses at 4 \u00d7 105 V/m 50 Hz with a carrier wave of 10 Hz25) causes DNA DSBs and chromosomal lesions whose severity correlate with the intensity of the applied fields and the duration of exposure. However, less clear results come from studies with irradiated lymphocytes using low intensity, high radiofrequency(RF) EMFs (3 kHz-300 GHz)26. Most of these studies have assessed the levels of EMF inflicted DNA single and DSBs on lymphocytes using the microgel electrophoresis technique or 'comet assay' , which detects brakes with a sensitivity limit of 50 strand events per diploid cell27. RF EM irradiation from cell phones was first studied by Phillips et al. in Molt-4 human lymphoblastoid cells exposed for 2-21 h to fields of 813.5 and 836.5 MHz with specific absorption rate (SAR) (2.4-26 \u00b5W/g)28. Variable degree of DNA dam- age is reported, mainly induced by high SAR values waves (increased at 24 or 26 \u00b5W/g and decreased at 2.4 or 2.6 \u00b5W/g) and longer exposures (21 h versus 2 h). Another study by Mashevich et al .29 reveals that continuous 72 h exposure of human peripheral blood lymphocytes to EMFs of 830 MHz waves, with SAR ranging from 1.6 to 8.8 W/kg lead to SAR dependent aneuploidy with specific abnormalities on chromosome 17. However, in vitro exposure of human blood lymphocytes for only 2 h to short pulses of 2450 MHz, at an average power of 5 mW/ cm2 30 showed no significant DNA damage as assessed by alkali comet assays. No signs of genotoxicity were found when total human blood leukocytes were in vitro exposed for 24 h either at a continuous or a pulsed-wave 1.9 GHz EMF with a SAR ranging between 0.1 and 10 W/Kg 31. Absence of significant DNA damage response in human blood lymphocytes was also reported by a study by Stronati et al.32 in which blood specimens were continuously exposed for 24 h at a Global System Mobile Communication generated EMF of 935 MHz with a SAR of 1 or 2 W/Kg 32. Similar negative results with respect to EMF induced DNA damage was reported in a study by Hook et al.33 with cultured Molt-4 human lymphoblasts exposed for 24 h to four types of frequency mobile network modulations around 815-850 MHz with SAR values ranging from 2.4 to 3.2 W/Kg 33. In our work we test the effects of in vitro irradiating V(D)J recombining pre-B cells with very low doses of RF EM waves. RAG stimulation is obtained either mimicking a pre-BCR stimulus with AKT inhibition, or with 950-1000 MHz RF EMF cell irradiation, in the absence of detectable DNA DSBs, causes a four-fold reduc- tion in recombination levels in exposed pre-Bs versus that assessed in non-irradiated cells. Results Design and specific experimental conditions used to assess Ig k locus rearrangements. Our study tests how gene recombination levels are influenced by exposure to EMFs with distinct emitted frequencies and power levels (dose-response). In vitro grown vAbl transformed murine pre-B cells stimulated to recombine V(D)J are exposed to a broadband (0.8-3 GHz) emission antenna which broadcasts an EMF from a RF generator (Fig. 1A upper region). For all experiments we standardized our cellular growing conditions to control irradiation parameters (see Supplemental Material section S1 and Fig. 1Sa and b). RAG expression and V(D)J recombina- tion can be induced in vAbl transformed pre-B cells(differentiating them in small pre-B cells) an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib(mesylate of imatinib)(IMA)34,35(Supplemental Material Fig. 1Sb growing dish wells 1, 2 and 3), or with an AKT inhibitor GSK-690693(GSK)19(wells 4, 5 and 6 , Fig. 1Sb). Whereas IMA induces RAG by kinase a (see Supplemental material section Time course experiments with RAG induction in vAbl pre-B cells using both drugs show maximal RAG1 levels after 36 h of stimulation (see Supplemental material S2 and Fig. 2Sa and b). Using this finding, after 48 h post drug induction (to allow recombination), all synchronized cultured cells were harvested and their genomic DNA extracted. A previously described two-steps nested PCR (polymerase chain reaction) which assesses the recombination extent taking place at Igk kappa light chain locus (chromosome 6, locus schematic and primer positions shown in Fig. 1B), is templated with the equivalent genomic DNA extracted from 2 \u00d7 106 cells from each tested culture set36,37. In the absence of V(D)J recombination (control reactions with no stimulation Fig. 1C lane 2) the variable region V and J segments in germline configuration are too far apart on the chromosome to yield appropriate amplification products. The PCR amplification products obtained only from recombined templates (Fig. 1C lane 3) are sepa- lower drawing Fig. 1A, and gel scan Fig. 1C). This typical nested PCR reaction reports k locus recombination events with two detectable products; the predominant one Vk-Jk2 of 280 bp (95%) and Vk-Jk1 of 3 Vol.:(0123456789) Reports Densitometric quantifications of the DNA Vk-Jk2 recombination products allow us to assess the EMF influence on recombination (Fig. 1A lower drawing). A dose-response (recombination) effect obtained with increasing IMA concentrations in 48 h stimulated pre-B cells is shown in supplementary Fig. 3Sa, gel and quantified data from three such experiments shown in Fig. 3Sb histograms. The lowest drug concentration (3 \u00b5M for IMA and of 10 \u00b5M for GSK,) for which maximal recombination effects are obtained, is used for each drug in our irradiation assays. For linear range quantifications of the image scans each reaction uses genomic DNA template at least at three distinct dilutions from the cellular extraction stock solution and the final result may be reported as an average of the three quantified products values corrected by the histone H1 band intensity of the corresponding sample. In Supplemental material in Fig. 3Sc an 3Sd a set of nested PCR Figure 1. (A) Schematic depiction of the flow chart of the experimental design. Murine A-70 vAbl pre-B cells grown with or without exposure to Electromagnetic field influence(EMF), in the absence or presence of RAG stimulation either by Mesylate of Imatinib (IMA) or by GSK-690693(GSK), are harvested and their genomic DNA subjected to a two-steps PCR recombination assay identifying Vk to Jk rearrangements at IgL kappa loci. The electrophoretically separated recombination products (Vk-Jk) are quantified by densitometry to assess the extent of locus rearrangements influenced by EMF.

Such recombination amplified reactions are then used for densitometry quantifications. The entire gel from which (C ) was cropped displaying amplifications (Vk to Jk response) from cells treated with a wide range of increasing IMA concentrations , is shown in Supplemental Material Fig. 3Sa. Figure 2. Absorption spectra measurements of filtered deionized water (dashed thin black line), tap water (green thick line Water + Ions) and RPMI cell culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS)(red thick line RPMI + FBS) All measurements were done using a Keysight-AGILENT-HP N9935A spectrum analyzer as described in \" Methods \" Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:12651 with serial dilutions of input genomic DNA from IMA stimulated cells, followed by quanti- tation of the signal are shown to illustrate that the assay responds linearly in its amplified Vk-Jk2 band intensity. EM wave absorption spectrum of the cell culture medium. We measured how the EM waves with frequencies ranging from 700 to 1224 MHz are absorbed by the fetal bovine calf serum supplemented cell culture medium (RPMI + FBS in Fig. 2) in which the pre-B cells are cultured. For comparison only absorption meas- urements were also performed for deionized water (conductivity < 5 \u00b5S/cm), and for ions containing unfiltered tap water samples (see Methods Water + ions, Fig. 2). The measurements were done using a setup in which an emission and a reception horn antenna were spaced 1 m apart with the liquid sample container positioned in the vicinity(1 cm) of the later (see Supplemental material Fig. 4S). The emission antenna was connected to a generator and signals from the receiver antenna were collected and recorded by a standard spectrum analyzer. In Fig. 2 are presented the background corrected absorption spectra per 1 cm width of each liquid sample measured. A well-defined absorption peak is observed at 938 MHz for the RPMI + FBS medium sample which is twice as large as the others measured at this frequency. All samples have similar absorption values for the rest of the tested spectral frequencies. This finding is important since the range of frequencies (720 MHz, 850 MHz, 950 MHz, 1 GHz and 1.2 GHz) to be used for cell irradiation centers our window of exposure between 950 MHz and 1 GHz, proximal to the maximal culture medium absorption peak. To test how the cell growing medium affects the electric intensity of the exposing fields, EMF electric flux density (D displacement) measurements were made inside the incubator for each mentioned frequency, in the absence or presence of culture medium in the culture plate (Supplemental Material S3 and Fig. 5S). Values greater than one of the Dm/Dair_inc (1.8-1.95) ratios measured between 750 and 1000 MHz (Supplemental material sec- tion S3 and Fig. 5Sc) show in this range, the complete RPMI + FBS cell growing medium selectively potentiates the developed fields. EMF irradiation effects on V(D)J recombination in vAbl preB cells. Murine vAbl pre-B cells were grown under normal conditions or stimulated either with 3 \u00b5M IMA or with 10 \u00b5M GSK in the presence/ absence of an antenna which emits a generator controlled EMF from waves of 720 MHz, 850 MHz, 950 MHz, Figure 3. A two steps PCR recombination assay is used to identify Vk to Jk1 or Vk to Jk2 rearrangements A Sybr Green 1.5% TBE gel in the PCR reactions templated with initial 1:5 dilutions of genomic DNA extracted from each distinct cell treatment lot (2 \u00d7 106 cells) are electrophoretically resolved. The cells were either unexposed (gel reaction lanes 4 and 5) or subjected for 48 h to 1 GHz EMF irradiation (lanes 1 to 3 and 6 to 8) with the generator setting at 13 dBm. The color code designating the positions of exposed EMF (exp.Well) wells in the dish is the same with the one used in supplementary Fig. 1Sb. Last lane (9) of the gel, -DNA control reaction. The bottom black box (cropped from a distinct gel) displays Hisone H1 PCR reactions templated with the same amount of genomic DNA as the recombination reactions above(control genomic DNA). (B ) Identified Vk to Jk2 recombined products were quantified from scanned gels corresponding to PCR reactions from cells +/ Irradiation and the calculated ratios of band intensities expressed + EMF/EMF(irradiated/nonexposed) for each well (color code consistent with that shown in Fig. 1S). The histograms represent the average values of three independent quantified experiments. EMF-Electromagnetic Field, Recombination pharmacological stimuli (Imatinib, histograms correspond to lower 7 dBm (l) and brighter to higher 13 dBm(h) generator power settings.5 Vol.:(0123456789) GHz each with 7 or 13 dBm output power setting. For all exposures, the antenna was held at 2.4 cm above the composite 6 wells plate as depicted in Supplemental material Fig. 1Sb (lower profile drawing) consist- ently keeping it in the same location with respect to the incubator walls (Supplemental material S1 and Fig. 1S). Cells were grown +/ EMF constant continuous exposure for 48 h with +/ IMA or +/ GSK. In Fig. 3A is shown a gel with resolved reactions either from nonexposed cells (lanes 4 and 5) or from cells continuously subjected for 48 h to the influence of 1 GHz fields (gel for generator set at 13dBm-h), with both RAG induction treatments (plate Exp. wells IMA 1, 2, 3 and GSK- 4, 5, 6 with color code shown in Supplemental material Fig. 1Sb). Visually one can see, a reduction of Vk to Jk2 recombination products obtained in reactions from irradiated cells versus those from similarly drug induced, non-irradiated cells (see Fig. 3A compare lane 4 non-irradiated to reactions in lanes 1-3 exposed for IMA, and lane 5 unexposed to lanes 6-8 from irradiated GSK stimulated cells). The irradiating effects are most pronounced in the plate wells closest to the actively emitting antenna elements (/2 for 1 GHz waves use as main element the 15 cm one located near wells 3 and 6 (Supplemental material Fig. 1Sb) hence, recombination reduction for plate Exp. wells 3, 6 > 2, 5 > 1, 4 or correspondingly gel lanes 1, 6 > 2, 7 > 3, 8). The value of the calculated ratios between recombination Vk-Jk2 PCR band intensities obtained from irradiated/ non-irradiated(+ EMF/-EMF) cells for all tissue culture wells are shown as histograms in Fig. 3B. Values less than one show specific Vk-Jk2 recombination reduction associated with EMF irradiation. Similar experiments were performed with EMF exposures at 720, 850, 950, 1000 and 1224 MHz (each fre - quency centers on a different antenna element), generator setting either at 7 dBm or 13 dBm. To display a wider palette of EMF dose exposure values we summed up the data from all of the wells in Fig. 4 which displays cell Vk-Jk2 recombination Fractions(+EMF/EMF -ordinates), against logarithm of measured irradiating power flux density S values (\u00b5W/cm2-abscissas) at each location. Each row of the two panels is for a distinct frequency with panels for each drug located on the same column: Fig. 4A(GSK- left) and B(IMA- right). Consistently all diagrams show power dependent reduction in cellular Vk-Jk2 recombination. S values into the emitting antenna were calculated from antenna recorded voltages, circuit impedance, and antenna constructive elements dimensions and reflect S in the air inside incubator, surrounding the involved culture well. In each panel with dotted black lines we pointed the EMF power dose required to induce a two-fold Vk-Jk2 recombination reduction from that of the non-irradiated lot (+EMF/EMF 50% reduction shown as 0.5 ratio for Vk-Jk2, Cellular Recombination Fraction). In Fig. 4 when 50% recombination reduction (exposed versus non-irradiated cells) is not reached, the minimal recombination ratios obtained and their inducing S levels are shown in parenthesis. The most remark- able finding of our study is that even for such a small window of frequencies (between 720 and 1224 MHz), the power dose-response effect is dramatically influenced by the frequency of the irradiating EMF. If at 720 MHz one reaches a 0.56/0.70 maximal recombination reduction for 9.49 \u00b5W/cm2 exposure, similar reduction in recombination effects are obtained at 950 MHz and 1 GHz with only 1/15th respectively 1/20th (0.63 or 0.43 \u00b5W/ cm2) the power used at 720 MHz. The power dose-cell recombination response curves at 950 MHz and 1 GHz EMFs show by far the most accentuated measured effects (for both drugs). For GSK at 1 GHz irradiation, an almost four-fold decrease in V(D)J recombination (from 0.90 to 0.22) is observed over a moderate increase in S exposure from 0.1 to 4.53 \u00b5W/cm2 (see second from the bottom panel in Fig. 4A GSK 1000 MHz). Both curves in Fig. 4 for 1 GHz display an abrupt recombination decrease at a small increase in S (0.25-1 \u00b5W/cm2) after which the cellular effect plateaus out over a larger window of higher exposure power S values (1-4.5 \u00b5W/cm2). To emphasize the influence of EMF frequency Table 1 shows how recombination fractions (+EMF/EMF) vary at a relatively constant 1.5 \u00b5W/cm2 irradiating power flux density S exposure level for all tested EMF frequencies. At this small irradiating power no effect is detectable at 720 MHz, whereas at 950 MHz a two-fold recombination reduction is measured reaching almost three-fold recombination inhibiton at 1 GHz.. To circumvent the cellular growing medium polarization effects (which significantly change polarity at 720 MHz and above 1100 MHz, Supplemental material 3S and Fig. 5Sc) or its enhanced wave absorption at 938 MHz (Fig. 2), we intentionally represented in Fig. 5 the recombination fractions for two constant electric field intensity E exposure values, measured inside the medium; one of 0.4 V/m (Fig. 5A.) and the other of 0.6 V/m (Fig. 5B). The approximative intensity of the emitted electric field was calculated in the cell medium from the measured electric flux density ( Dm displacement) values38 described in the previous section, and aver - aged for the central plate well. For both E values and both pharmacological stimuli (IMA-red and GSK-blue) the most accentuated plots concavities (maximal irradiation induced recombination reduction effect), correspond to 950-1000 MHz. At both E values represented in Fig. 5 the recombination ratios are unaffected by EMFs at 720 MHz. In contrast, at 1000 MHz, a two-fold reduction is observed for the 0.4 V/m EMF intensity, and a three (IMA) to four-fold (GSK) decrease is measured at the stronger 0.6 V/m field exposure. The electric fields dose exposures -recombination reduction effects in Fig. 5 and those reported for EMFs power dose exposures in Fig. 4 are qualitatively similar. These data strongly suggest that exposure even to very low irradiation doses from specific 900-1000 MHz radiofrequency waves dramatically affect in irradiated pre-B cells the efficiency of V(D)J recombination at their Ig kappa locus. Histone H2AX phosphorylation shows no detectable DNA DSB damage cell response in EMF exposed preB cells. We asked whether the observed EMF irradiating effects on V(D)J recombination are due to DNA damage and presence of unrepaired DSBs. Impairment of DNA integrity can be assessed by the extent with which irradiation induces H2AX histone phosphorylation (H2AX), a process associated with DNA DSBs and their intranuclear repair. The nuclear H2AX repair foci are the fairest indication that the NHEJ DNA repair machinery acts properly in these cells repairing DSBs caused by any DNA lesion-causing agent39,40. We grew cells under similar stimulation (+/ IMA, +/ GSK) and +/ EMF irradiation conditions (7 dBm or 13 dBm generator power settings at 950 MHz) with those described above but instead of extracting DNA, the harvested cells were fixed and doubly stained: (a) with Hoechst 33342 dye (for nuclear total DNA staining in 6 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:12651 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91790-3 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 4.

As a DNA DSBs control an extra lot of cells were either noninduced o similarly drug treated but instead of EMF they were subjected to a quick 1 Gy, X ray irradiation dose prior to their harvest. Nine immunofluorescent images are shown in Fig. 6 A-I where blue contours show the cell nuclei and the green dots the DNA DSBs repairing H2AX foci from: at 950 MHz, 7dBm exposure and the control lot of cells exposed to 1 Gy X ray. Such foci were also counted and their number reported per cell to a number of total 100 counted cells gathered from more than twenty successive field views for each experimental lot (shown as histograms in Fig. 6J for both 7 dBm and 13 dBm generator power settings). 1 Gy dose X ray irradiated cells are shown in Fig. 6B control with DMSO solvent, E with IMA, H with GSK and in 6 J the corresponding foci/cell counted histograms. All images (Fig. 6B,E,H) and the quantified histograms from X ray irradiated cells show similar and considerable DNA DSB lesions with consequent accumulation of H2AX repair foci, regardless of the chemical stimulus used. On the contrary, the long 48 h EMF exposure experiments do not show signs of detectable unrepaired DNA DSB damage (Fig. 6C DMSO solvent, F with IMA and I with GSK, and counted foci/cells in Fig. 6J), above the background level of non-irradiated control cultures (Fig. 6A,D,G and ctrol. histograms in Fig. 6J). Exposing for 48 h cells to EMF , regardless of drug treatment, does not seem to inflict significant/ cumulative unrepaired DNA DSB lesions, (unlike those caused even by mild quick irradiation with 1 Gy dose of X rays). Only such DNA injuries could have caused a detectable accumulation of repairing H2AX foci at the time of their harvest. Indi- rectly, these results suggest that the significant EMF induced reduction in pre-B cells recombination reported in Figs. 3B, 4, 5 and Table 1 is probably not caused by an enhanced level of accumulated unrepaired DNA DSBs. Discussion V(D)J recombination the central process in lymphocyte development physiologically generates DNA DSBs dur - ing its course, when cells become susceptible to external sources of DNA damage5. Our work tests how pre-B lymphocytes exposure to low dose EMFs of frequencies ranging from 720 MHz to 1.2 GHz, used in utilitarian purpose telecommunication, affects the efficiency of their Igk loci rearrangements. First, we established a setup Table 1.

Cultured pre-B cells synchronously recombining V(D)J were EMF exposed during a 48 h window, which starts with RAG expression and ends with the NHEJ DSBs DNA repair5. A nested PCR assay is then used to study the cellular EMF irradiation gene effects. The measured data in Figs. 3B, 4, 5 and Table 1 consistently show, EMFs cause a dose dependent reduction in V(D)J recombination in the irradiated pre-B cells, with similar effects for both RAG inducing stimuli (IMA or GSK) used. The magnitude of effects is tightly determined by the EMF frequency. A two-fold reduction in Vk-Jk2 recombination at Igk locus narrowly can be obtained by an emitted S power value of 9.49 \u00b5W/cm2 at 720 MHz (Cell Recomb. Fr. 0.56 for GSK and 0.7 for IMA), whereas this effect may be achieved by a field developing one twentieth of that S dose at 1000 MHz (0.5 Cell Recomb. Fr. for both drugs at 0.43 \u00b5W/cm2) (Fig. 4). The recom- bination reduction although observed for all EMFs tested, seems to be maximal for 950 and 1000 MHz waves, a small domain where the serum containing cell culture medium displays maximal EMF absorbance (Fig. 2), and augments by its molecular polarization the EMF electric intensity (supplementary Fig. 5Sc). We measured EMF local antenna emissive S values only in the incubator air surrounding the cell culture plate. Despite this limita- tion we measured and calculated the average irradiated electric field intensity E, inside the culture medium. The maximal effects were measured at 950 and 1000 MHz, where Igk recombination levels for an EMF of E 0.4 V/m are only half (Fig. 5A), or for one of 0.6 V/m E a quarter of those reported for same E values at 720 MHz (Fig. 5B). E dose effects parallel the frequency dependency described for the antenna emitted power dose S. However, the cell medium electric properties mentioned above, (increased absorbance and polarization between 900 and 1000 MHz), cannot account for the frequency results shown in Fig. 5 for irradiations at constant electric field E values. Besides such intrinsic medium properties there must be also a major EMF frequency direct influence on the cellular components linked to recombination. Various wireless network service providers use for mobile phone communication frequencies ranging between 700 and 2100 MHz. At 1 cm distance, during outgoing calls the measured emitted field E intensities vary with +/ 5-15% from the 41.25 V/m ( recommended ICNIRP value) with cell phone models, whereas their maximum output recorded power levels for a GSM1800 net varies between 0.25 and 1 W41,42.

From the levels of detected H2AX repair foci of the EMF irradiated pre-B cells we could not reveal in exposed cells above background DNA DSBs repair activity (Fig. 6 compare panel A with C, G with I, and histograms in Fig. 6J). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Savic accumulation in IgK locus after 24 h post STI571 (Imatinib) treatment of pre-Bs, but a dramatic more than two-fold decrease in H2AX detection as cells were kept from 24 to 48 h post STI571 treatment43. We could not detect above background H2AX foci levels in IMA or GSK treated cells after 48 h culture growth. This could be due either to a considerable post RAG DSBs repair recovery, or to a reduced sensitivity of our immunofluo - rescence assay (less sensitive than ChIP in detecting H2AX). The onset of DNA DSBs either prior to or during pre-B cells maturation inhibits rag1 , 2 transcription44 and reduces the levels of Igk locus rearrangement events45. These cellular stress effects are caused by ataxia teleangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase either via GADD45 inhibition45, both pathways directly targeting rag genes transcription levels. If very few EMF induced DSBs (below those detectable by H2AX foci assay), or breaks already repaired before our cell harvests could have reduced RAG expression in our experiments(via ATM kinase) this could explain our observed reduced recombination effects. We used in our experiments two RAG induction stimuli, IMA sensitive to ATM kinase via GADD45 inhibition 44-46 and the second GSK690693 AKT-inhibitor insensitive to this signaling pathway19. If very few EMF induced DNA DSBs would have reduced RAG expression prior to, or during drug action, one would have expected experiments to show a more accentuated recombination reduction for IMA than that obtained for GSK treatment. Instead, the experimental data in Figs. 3B, 4, 5 and Table 1 show for both drugs very similar EMF induced reduction of Igk loci rearrangement levels(if not even slightly more pronounced reduction for GSK). IMA although a more potent RAG inducer than GSK has the disadvantage that post recombination blocks cells in Go phase preventing further their division36,47-49. On the contrary, the AKT inhibitor GSK-690693 not only is a weaker RAG induction stimulus (closer to the one physiologically occurring in small pre-B cells)50,51 but also enables cells to divide prior to and after Igk loci rearrangements and protect their progress to the next stage of development19. Because our PCR assay intentionally uses the amount of templating genomic DNA from the same number of 2 millions harvested cells, replication would have \"diminished the EMF recombination reduction\" in GSK treated cells in contrast to those incubated with IMA (the later, on the contrary, \"freezes\" the EMF effect on BCL2 maintained survivors). As pointed earlier, in treated cells, both drugs show very similar EMF induced reduction of rearrangements in treated cells. Although we cannot fully refute that the observed EMF recombination effects may have been caused in irradiated pre-B cells by undetectable DNA DSBs via ATM, the line of evidence gathered from our experiments in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and the arguments presented above for the comparative IMA/GSK treatments make this mechanism a less likely candidate for their account. Indirectly our work addresses the longstanding question of how innocuous low dose EMF irradiation from our telecommunication devices may be and whether it may affect the immunity of our organisms. It remains only to our speculation to extend the observed recombination effects induced by small EMFs from an in vitro culture system to the in vivo situation on the ability of irradiated B cells to elicit an unaltered antibody response to antigen challenge. Methods Materials. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies and IDT DNA: S is G or C, R is A or G, W is T or A, Jk2-1 primer 5 CAA AAC CCT CCC TAG GTA GAC AAT TAT CCC TC 3 Jk2-2 primer control prim- (v-Abl preB, A70 line, that harbor a E\u00b5-Bcl2 transgene) were a kind gift from Barry Sleckman Duke University47. The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 10% FBS (both 2-mercaptoetanol and induced at 0.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml density either with 3 M Imatinib (SIGMA-ALDRICH) or with in solutions with 0.1% DMSO. After 48 h the cells were collected and analyzed using the nested PCR described below. Pre-B Cells irradiation was performed with a 1 Hz-1.224 GHz, 13 dBm radiofrequency generator (Hameg Instruments 1 Hz-1.2 GHz programmable synthesizer HM8134-3, used throughout our study as emission gen- erator) using broadband irradiating 800 MHz-3 ALP logarithmic antenna, in regular CO2 incubator (SANYO Electric Co. MCO-17AIC), with CO2 5 vol. %, and 95% purified water humidity. Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in 5 ml medium in standard six flat bottom wells (16.8 ml capacity) polystyrene lidded plates (Corning Costar), which were always positioned in the same place with respect to the incubator walls (in the center of the incubator, see Supplemental material Fig. 1Sa) and the emission antenna (antenna central guiding label positioned midway between wells 3 and 6 at 2.4 cm above the mid plane of the plate, see supplementary Fig. 1S). Two parallel sets of experiments were performed with wells 1, 2, 3 containing cells stimulated with 3 \u00b5M IMA, whereas wells 4, 5 and 6 cells were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M GSK (Fig. 1SB). Two steps nested PCR reactions for K locus recombination. Template DNA was prepared for PCR using a modified technique developed by Schlissel37. Pre-B A-70 v-Abl cells were harvested after 48 h IMA36,47, GSK19 or unstimulated. Cultured cells (2 \u00d7 106-2 millions) were pelleted for 15 s in a microfuge, washed once in PBS(phosphate saline buffer pH 7.2), resuspended in 200 \u00b5l PCR lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.4, 2.5 incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 3 h followed by 15 min at 95 \u00b0C. Dilution of templates 10 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific done Proteinase K. Two successive PCR amplifications were done in a final volume of 50 \u00b5l containing 2 to 5 \u00b5l template DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4; at room temperature), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 \u00b5g/ml gelatin, 0.2 mM of all four dNTPs (all from ThermoFisher scientific), each oligonucleotide primer at 0. 4 \u00b5M (20 pmol each primer per reaction), and 1 U TAQ DNA polymerase (GoTaq PROMEGA) in nested reactions. First step PCR reactions for 25 cycles use Vk, and Jk2-1primers. In the second step various dilutions (from 4 \u00b5ls 1:100 dilution of first PCR to 0.5 \u00b5ls of the first undiluted PCR) are individually used to template the second PCR reactions to which Vk and Jk2-2 primers are added and an additional round of 30 cycles amplification is performed. Cycling steps were: an initial 1 min denaturation at 94 \u00b0C, then repeated cycles each, 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 0.5 min annealing at 50 \u00b0C, and 1.5 min polymerization at 72 \u00b0C. A final additional 5 min extension step was performed at 72 \u00b0C 36,37. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose either with ethidium bromide or Sybr (THERMOFISHER scientific) and visualized using the PharosFX system (BIORAD). The bands intensities were quantified using QuantityOne software. Kappa locus amplification products analysis. Each Vk-Jk2 product band density of the gel scan image is quantified and the ratio between the densitometry value of the PCR product band detected from cells grown in the presence of EMF and the corresponding one without field exposure (EMF+/EMF, Cell Recomb. Fr., Figs. 3, 4, 5) reports the changes in V(D)J recombination occurred upon each cell treatment (IMA/GSK). To normalize for DNA extraction levels we performed similar PCR amplifications from the same amount of template DNA using a pair of primers H1fw and H1rv to specifically detect the histone H1 gene. H2AX foci analysis for irradiation induced DNA damage cellular response. Cells were grown under similar conditions with those described above for recombination assays. Additionally, a DNA DSBs con- trol cell lot either uninduced or one for each RAG stimulus (IMA or GSK) was exposed to a quick 20 min X ray cumulative dose exposure of 1 Gray (X-ray irradiation with a slow rate 50-milligray /min with a Mevatron Primus 2D, 6MV , SIEMENS instrument) prior to their harvest. The samples were irradiated at 100 cm distance from the source axis, the field size being of 30 \u00d7 30 cm. The dosimetry was performed using a water phantom (1 cm water depth). Symmetry and homogeneity were checked, the dose proved to be homogenous throughout the sample in the used plates. For all treatments, twenty minutes after harvest, instead of extracting DNA, the cells from each individual culture type were separately spread onto clean designated slide sets using a Cytospin Centrifuge. The cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X and then doubly stained with: (a) Hoechst 33342 dye (THERMO SCIENTIFIC) (for their nuclei-DNA total staining in blue) and (b) immuno- fluorescently with primary unlabeled anti H2AX antibodies of mouse antigen specificity complemented with secondary Cy2 labeled anti primary source antibodies (rat anti mouse IgG Cy2 detection antibodies-green)(both from SIGMA ALDRICH); to identify in green the DSB repairing H2AX foci40. The slides were examined with a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX60) with adequate filter for the fluorophores, and images of the nuclei and H2AX foci recorded with a camera connected to the microscope. The images were analyzed using specific analysis software to quantify the number of foci per each cell treatment type, and morphologically to indicate their level of dispersion or nuclear positioning (see Fig. 6). Western blot analysis for endogenous RAG time course induction in pre-B cells (Supplemental material Fig. 2S) following IMA/GSK treatment was performed as previously described in our work using anti RAG1 and anti RAG2 mouse monoclonal antibodies (gift from Dr. David G. Schatz, Y ale University), and control sample purified murine core RAG1(384-1040) and coreRAG2 (1-387) fused to Maltose in co-transfected HEK293T cells52 (source ATCC CRL-3216). Absorption spectra measurements were made using two identical broadband (0.8-16 GHz) horn antennas facing each-other and placed at 1 m distance. The measurement subjected sample was placed in close proximity (1 cm) of the receiver whereas the emission antenna (supplementary Fig. 4S a and b), was coupled to the genera- tor. The receiver antenna was connected to a commercial Spectrum Analyzer (Keysight-AGILENT-HP N9935A, 0.1- 9 GHz) on which the received signals were recorded and analyzed. The shown absorption spectra in Fig. 2 were obtained after subtraction of the background spectra with no liquid sample placed in the container in front of the receiver antenna. The deionized water used for measurement has the conductivity < 5 \u00b5S/cm, whereas the used unfiltered tap water with ions has the following characteristic measured chemical parameters per liter (l) pH 6.5-9.5, Conductivity < 800 \u00b5S/cm, ammonia < 0.5 mg/l, free residual Chlorine < 0.5 mg/l, Fe < 200 \u00b5g/l, Mn < 50 \u00b5g/l, Al < 200 Received: November Accepted: 31 May 2021 References 1.
