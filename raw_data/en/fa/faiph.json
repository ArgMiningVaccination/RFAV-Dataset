She completed her Yoga Teacher Training in 2015, and she loves to practice yoga and teach during her spare time. Her passions include yoga, hiking, arranging flowers, and crafting. She has always had an interest in eastern medicine and holistic health, and she soon realized after working with children with autism and stroke patients supporting them in Vision Therapy, completing her yoga training and then working selling IV fluids to hospitals and wellness centers how much she really wanted to dive deeper into her learning and journey in the naturopathic field. She is passionate about helping children with Autism and women in recovery and working at an all women's treatment center to help individuals recovering from addiction, depression, and trauma. She strongly believes in the mental, physical, and emotional healing naturopathic medicine has to offer and is passionate about learning and sharing how to heal the body with natural remedies. "}
