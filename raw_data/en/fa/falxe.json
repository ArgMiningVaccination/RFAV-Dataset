Lipomap works on improving digestion, metabolism, and elimination of toxins from the body. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. As per Ayurveda, our body is a combination of doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), Malas (metabolic impurities), tissue elements). These 7 dhatus are sequentially transformed by the Agni (Digestive fire). Weak Agni negatively affects the transformation of one Dhatu into another, leading to the formation of Ama (toxins). Ama, the sticky, foul-smelling waste product of improper digestion, when combined with Meda Dhatu, blocks the channel of the body, such as arteries. Maharishi Ayurveda Lipomap helps in removing Ama from the channels, thereby balancing cholesterol levels KEY INGREDIENTS Prevents cholesterol synthesis in the liver/ Increases cholesterol catabolism and excretion from the body Detoxifies and strengthens the liver/Helps produce good quality cholesterol Strengthens liver and purifies blood and muscles tissues Improves Metabolic Transformation/Prevents accumulation of Fats Maharishi Ayurveda Lipomap can be taken by anyone who is facing the issue of high cholesterol According to Ayurveda, there are three main metabolic body types (physiologies), that form the basic framework of a person.
