Ameri can Medical Student As sociation: The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) is the oldest and largest independent association of medical students in the country with a membership of over 65,000 physicians in training. AMSA is a completely student -governed organization comm itted to representing the concerns of medical students. We represent no single point of view, and there is a wide array of issues that we address \u2014there is something for everyone. AMSA members champion such concerns as fighting for universal health care, eliminating health disparities, and transforming the culture of medicine. AMSA, for example was one of the leading organizations responsible for the Residency Work Hours Reform movement, resulting in the limitation of an 80 -hour workweek for all residents th roughout the country. Our U of R AMSA chapter focuses on community initiatives, education and reform. We have leaders focused specifically on Universal Health Care, Community and Public Health and Advocacy. Examples of past events include: Seacover -- a com parison of US and Canadian Healthcare systems in Seattle and Vancouver; A6575 Bill complain - a letter writing campaign with 8 other medical schools in New York State urging our state senators to support an initiative to investigate universal health care. 3 American Medical Association - Medical Student Section: This is the U of R student chapter of the American Medical Association. As the student section of the larger physician organization, this chapter works with doctors to bring about change in areas o f medicine that will affect our health care system for years to come. At the same time , we have our own policies, leaders, and meetings that are separate from the larger organization. Specifically, our organization focuses on ways to cover the uninsured, promote public health, end healthcare disparities and reform medical education. To this end we send delegations each year to two annual meetings of the entire AMA -MSS which are focused on creating and updating policy which the AMA will advocate for in Congress, as well as state and regional meetings to address policy on those levels. We also have an active community service arm that organizes several events each year to foster relations with the Rochester community. American Medical Women's Association: American medical women's association was created by a group of women across the country i n order to provide a networking opportunity for women to support each other, discuss the unique challenges of being a woman in medicine, and promote education and advancement of women's health. Past activities have included educational lunchtime talks on b eing a woman in medicine, volunteer opportunities at the women's group and Sojourner House to help women recovering from substance abuse and other hardships, monthly meetings to talk about your experiences with fellow students and faculty, mentoring opport unities and opportunities to attend the national conference. Asian -Pacific Medical Students Association: APAMSA is a national organization aimed to address the issues relevant to the Asian population that reside in America and elsewhere. As a significant portion of our patient population will be of Asian descent, it is particularly important to learn how to care for them in a culturally sensitive manner as well as promote the health and well -being of the Asian community. We offer opportunities to engage wi th the Asian community and explore alternative forms of medicine. In addition, we will have guest speakers to discuss the regional differences in healthcare that exist in Asia today, as well as the medical crises that afflict them, in hopes of providing a worldwide perspective on healthcare to medical students. EMPEX: EMPEX gives students the unique opportunity to practice procedures in the Strong ER. Students volunteer for shifts in which they have the opportunity to work with nurses to learn how to place IVs, suture, place EKGs, drain abscesses, and perform catheterizations. Students also help out by getting vitals and responding to patient requests. Each shift, there is also the opportunity to spend time observing in the trauma bay. Students will re ceive EMPEX training for various procedures at the beginning of the school year. Finger Lakes Community and Migrant Health Care Project: FLCMHCP is a federally funded organization that provides health care to Migrant farm workers in New York.

We volunteer at a local elementary school once a week. Participating in this group is a very rewarding experience, and you get to serve the community, which is what URMC students are all about! Homeless Response Team : The goal of this group is to establish meaningful, long -term connections with the homeless patients who are admitted to the hospital. Students are assigned to a team of 3 -4 students (a mix of students from all class years), and when a homeless person is admitted to the hospital, one of these teams is alerted. Members of that team then meet up with the homeless person in their hospital room, chat, introduce thems elves, get to know the patient, and exchange contact info. The goal is to figure out what the patient's most pressing psychosocial needs are (do they need/want a job? Do they have a PCP? Do they need a cell phone? Do they want more permanent housing?), and then follow up with that patient once every 1 -2 weeks for about 6 months (meet them somewhere in the community, help them arrange doctor appts and meet them there, etc.). The team's role will be to serve as their advocate, and a positive liaison between t hem and the medical community. The ultimate goal of the program is to set up homeless individuals with a PCP (or reinforce their relationship with an already existing one), improve their trust in the medical system, and help them accomplish as many psychos ocial --and sometimes medical --needs as possible (connect them with resources to find a job, housing, cellphone, etc). The teams will work closely with social workers to help accomplish this. Intervol: Intervol is a Rochester organization that takes donate d medical supplies and sends them to underserved areas worldwide. Medical students participate in packing parties to help sort unused and recyclable medical supplies at INTERVOL's warehouse.
