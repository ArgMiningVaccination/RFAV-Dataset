Free from jargon, the book clearly explains the evidence base and psychological processes that make mindfulness and related practices such as meditation and mantra so valuable to trauma treatment, recovery, and resilience. It provides a systematic, session-by-session explanation of the well-grounded IR program. Waelde's approach to proactively accommodating diverse client spiritual orientations is a valuable corrective and a much-needed model for a more culturally and spiritually inclusive mindfulness. Highly recommended for clinical practitioners, instructors, researchers, and students.\"--Doug Oman, PhD, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley \"Clear, thoughtful, well researched, and obviously based on years of in-depth clinical and meditative experience. Waelde offers clinicians of all levels an excellent step-by-step guide to utilizing mindfulness and related practices to help traumatized clients. Her approach is accessible, culturally sensitive, wise, and compassionate. Carefully laying out how to implement the 8-week IR program, the book provides rich, nuanced insights about trauma and meditative practices that also can inform other approaches to treatment. This book is an invaluable asset for any clinician hoping to integrate meditative practices into their work.\"--Ronald D. Siegel, PsyD, Center for Mindfulness and Compassion, Harvard Medical School/Cambridge Health Alliance \"Written by a noted leader in the field, this book provides a skillfully structured, manualized group intervention for those suffering posttraumatic stress and other effects of adversity. Waelde deftly integrates a deep understanding of the spiritual and philosophical roots of meditation and mindfulness with the clear-eyed pragmatism of a trauma-focused scientist-practitioner. Filled with tools, activities, scripts, and detailed examples, this is a highly ambitious book that succeeds in all important respects.\"--John Briere, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of "}
