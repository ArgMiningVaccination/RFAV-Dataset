This action includes authorizing the current bivalent vaccines (original and omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains) to be used for all doses administered to individuals 6 months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations. The monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are no longer authorized for use in the United States. What You Need to Know: Most individuals, depending on age, previously vaccinated with a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine who have not yet received a dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine. Most individuals who have already received a single dose of the bivalent vaccine are not currently eligible for another dose. The FDA intends to make decisions about future vaccination after receiving recommendations on the fall strain composition at an FDA advisory committee in June. Individuals 65 years of age and older who have received a single dose of a bivalent vaccine may receive one additional dose at least four months following their initial bivalent dose. Most individuals with certain kinds of immunocompromise who have received a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine may receive a single additional dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine at least 2 months following a dose of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, and additional doses may be administered at the discretion of, and at intervals determined by, their healthcare provider. However, for immunocompromised individuals 6 months through 4 years of age, eligibility for additional doses will depend on the vaccine previously received. Most unvaccinated individuals may receive a single dose of a bivalent vaccine, rather than multiple doses of the original monovalent mRNA vaccines. Children 6 months through 5 years of age who are unvaccinated may receive a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine (6 months through 5 years of age) OR a three-dose series of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine (6 months through 4 years of age). Children who are 5 years of age may receive two doses of the Moderna bivalent vaccine or a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine. Children 6 months through 5 years of age who have received one, two or three doses of a monovalent COVID-19 vaccine may receive a bivalent vaccine, but the number of doses that they receive will depend on the vaccine and their vaccination history. Bivalent Doses COVID-19 vaccines continue to be very effective when it comes to preventing hospitalizations and death, but effectiveness against getting the virus may be reduced over time largely due to the emergence of new variants. Boosters and vaccines increase the strength of your antibody response and your protection against symptomatic COVID infection, hospitalization, and deaths. The updated bivalent vaccines target two strains of COVID-19: the original strain of the virus, and two of the Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5), the parent strains of the most widespread variants in the world. Other important information: Individuals 5+ may choose to receive any available brand of the bivalent booster, regardless of which primary series vaccine or original booster dose they had previously. Please see your doctor or pharmacist for more information. (There are restrictions on the bivalent doses for children ages 6 months to 4 years. Please see the guidelines above for details or visit the CDC and FDA websites.) The original vaccine doses (the monovalent vaccine) are no longer authorized or available for any age groups. Those who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine (with the exception of children ages 6 months to 4 years) can now receive one bivalent dose rather than multiple doses in a primary series. Booster Doses COVID-19 vaccines continue to be very effective when it comes to preventing hospitalizations and death, but effectiveness against getting the virus may be reduced over time largely due to the emergence of new variants. Boosters and vaccines increase the strength of your antibody response and your protection against symptomatic COVID infection, hospitalization, and deaths. The updated bivalent boosters target two strains of COVID-19: the original strain of the virus, and two of the Omicron variants (BA.4 and BA.5), the parent strains of the most widespread variants in the world. Please use the chart above to determine if you and your family members are eligible for the updated bivalent booster dose today! Other important information: Individuals 5+ may choose to receive any available brand of the updated bivalent booster, regardless of which primary series vaccine or original booster dose they had previously. Please see your doctor or pharmacist for more information. (There are restrictions on the bivalent doses for children ages 6 months to 4 years. Please see the chart at the top of this page for details.) The original booster doses (the monovalent booster) are no longer authorized or available for any age groups. Monovalent doses are still used for primary series vaccines at this time. There are similarities in the packaging ofthe bivalent boosters and the primary series vaccines for both Pfizer and Moderna products.

[de.gov/getmyvaccine.](http://de.gov/getmyvaccine)If you're looking for a specific vaccine brand, use the search on [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/)that can help you find a location with that brand in stock. Those who are eligible for a booster dose are recommended to seek them at existing vaccine sites including pharmacies, health care providers, DPH clinics, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (for patients). Additional (Third) Doses Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has amended the emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for both the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to allow for the administration of an additional dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. The Physicians may use clinical judgment and consider additional factors when determining a person's level of immunocompetence (being immunocompromised) - and whether they may benefit from a third dose in the primary series of vaccine. Providers may consider multiple factors. This third dose will be administered in accordance with all CDC and FDA guidelines. Individuals are encouraged to contact their primary care or specialty care provider with questions or for a vaccine. If your provider is not administering vaccines, you may go to any pharmacy or DPH Vaccination clinic for your vaccine or booster after determining the best course of action with your provider.
