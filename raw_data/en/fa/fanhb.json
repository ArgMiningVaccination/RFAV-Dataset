Today, one out of every eighty-eight children are affected by autism (Snyder). Autism can be defined as a disorder that causes an immense lack of social, communication, and behavioral skills (Tombers). There are many different theories to explain why this disease occurs and why it is on the rise. Some of these theories include genetics, problems during pregnancy, environmental factors, and irregular brain development, but the only theory that has solid evidence is vaccines. Studies done on the way gender specific hormones interact with vaccines show why the amount of boys affected by autism is much higher than the amount of girls. Over the past thirty years, the governments of both the United States and Italy have awarded millions of dollars to families that have been affected by autism shortly after vaccination. The experts of these governments have also admitted, due to pronounced evidence, that the MMR vaccine causes autism (Wakefield).Numerous studies and statistics prove that there is a direct link. These studies explain the toxicity of the preservative in vaccines, the reaction between vaccines and the male and female sex hormones, and why no child is diagnosed prior to six months. Because of these studies and other studies similar to them, other countries such as Denmark, Austria, Japan, Great Britain, and all the Scandinavian countries have banned certain chemicals from their vaccines. The harmful chemicals in vaccines, such as mercury and aluminum, can be related to irregular brain development that can lead to autism. "}
