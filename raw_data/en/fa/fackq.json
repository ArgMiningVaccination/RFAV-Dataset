Invaplex is a large, macromolecular complex consisting of the major Shigella antigens: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) proteins B and C. Over the past several decades, the vaccine has progressed from initial observations through pre-clinical studies to cGMP manufacture and clinical evaluations. The Invaplex product maintains unique biological properties associated with the invasiveness of virulent shigellae and also presents both serotype-specific epitopes, as well as highly conserved invasin protein epitopes, to the immunized host. The vaccine product has evolved from a native product isolated from wild-type shigellae (native Invaplex) to a more defined vaccine produced from purified LPS and recombinant IpaB and IpaC (artificial Invaplex). Each successive \"generation\" of the vaccine is derived from earlier versions, resulting in improved immunogenicity, homogeneity and effectiveness. The current vaccine, detoxified artificial Invaplex (InvaplexAR-Detox), was developed for parenteral administration by incorporating LPS with under-acylated lipid A. InvaplexAR-Detox has demonstrated an excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in initial clinical studies and is advancing toward evaluations in the target populations of children and travelers to endemic countries.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-04-01", "cleaned_text": "From Concept to Clinical Product: A Brief History of the Novel Shigella Invaplex Vaccine's 1](#vaccines-10-00548-f001)) and represents stepwise, progressive discoveries and improvements that often reflect the current state of knowledge on Shigella proteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and immunology. The progress not only involves research on the unique properties of the invasin complex but also critical improvements in product manufacturing, assay development and necessary adjustments to satisfy current regulatory standards and potential commercial development. The Invaplex product today (called artificial detoxified Invaplex or InvaplexAR-Detox) represents the latest improvement and is a candidate vaccine that stimulates pronounced systemic and mucosal immune responses in humans that most reflect the immunity observed after natural infection. 2. Shigella Antigens [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00548), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00548)]. aeruginosa exoprotein A protected immunized individuals against future disease in studies conducted in the early 1990s [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00548), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00548)]. Although the O-SP conjugate vaccine approach was very promising and is still being pursued today [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00548), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00548), [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00548)], it was becoming clear in the late 1980s and early 1990s that a pronounced immune response to the virulence-specific proteins (primarily invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) proteins IpaB, IpaC and IpaD) also occurred in humans after infection [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00548)]. At the time, the only vaccines capable of stimulating an immune response to both LPS and the Ipa proteins were the live, attenuated vaccines, although the responses to the Ipa proteins were only secondarily evaluated [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00548), [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00548), [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00548)]. More recent CHIM data have complemented field studies and pre-clinical animal studies to make a strong case for immune response to the Ipa proteins playing an important role in protection against shigellosis [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00548), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00548), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00548), [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00548), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00548), [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00548)]. Coupled with this early research on the biomechanics of the Ipa proteins' secretion and function were the first observations that IpaB, IpaC and IpaD were prominent, conserved antigens Shigella-infected individuals [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00548)]. Although antigen-specific assays for the Ipa proteins would come later, it was clear that the infected host responded vigorously to virulence-specific antigens found in the water extracts of virulent Shigella [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00548), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00548), [20](#B20-vaccines-10-00548), [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00548)]. It was unclear what role, if any, the host immune response to the highly conserved Ipa proteins had in protection against disease, since dogma clearly identified LPS as the antigen responsible for protective, serotype-specific immunity [ [1](#B1-vaccines-10-00548), [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00548), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00548), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00548)]. Even so, one hypothetical outcome of the response to the conserved Ipa proteins would be the potential for broad protection against all Shigella serotypes and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC). Researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) investigated methods to identify and measure the host response to protein antigens. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that could measure the virulence-specific immune response utilized water extracts from wild-type shigellae, which contained the Ipa proteins, VirG (IcsA), LPS and several other undefined proteins [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00548)]. To prepare more specific reagents, attempts to isolate the native Ipa proteins or Ipa complexes from the water extract by various chromatographic methods always resulted in IpaB and IpaC-containing fractions that copurified with LPS [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00548)]. Although the LPS was initially viewed as a \"contaminant\", an alternative explanation was that a naturally occurring complex of Ipa proteins and LPS had been isolated. Ultimately, the isolated invasion protein-LPS complex became known as Invaplex and more specifically as native Invaplex (InvaplexNAT), the first generation of Invaplex isolated using ion-exchange chromatography antigens IpaB, IpaC, IpaD and LPS and was the formulation for a possible vaccine. Other proteins were also found in InvaplexNAT 24 and InvaplexNAT 50, but neither contained any major outer membrane proteins. The universality of InvaplexNAT was demonstrated by isolating complexes from all Shigella species and EIEC [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00548)], which were immunogenic and provided homologous protection in mice and guinea pigs after intranasal immunization [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00548), [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00548)]. Subsequent evaluation of bivalent and 1 and S. sonnei) iterations of the InvaplexNAT product were also successful against homologous challenges [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00548), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00548)]. 3.2. Biological Properties of InvaplexNAT [28](#B28-vaccines-10-00548)]. Maintenance of Ipa protein functionality in InvaplexNAT was evaluated in a series of in vitro studies on InvaplexNAT and its ability to interact with non-phagocytic eukaryotic cells. After a brief incubation with host cells InvaplexNAT rapidly decorated the host cell surface, followed by an induced, actin-dependent endocytosis similar to the process utilized by wild-type shigellae. Internalized InvaplexNAT migrated through the retrograde endosomal pathway (early endosome to late endosome to Golgi apparatus) and was ultimately localized free in the cytoplasm [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00548)]. The uptake of Invaplex could be inhibited with antibodies specific for IpaB and IpaC, but antibodies to LPS had no effect on the uptake event. The property of inducing phagocytosis by host cells is considered an essential biological property of Invaplex found in all generations of the product ( [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00548-t001)) and may be a possible mechanism by which LPS and the Ipa proteins are presented to the host immune system via antigen-presenting cells. In fact, separate studies exploited the native biological activity of Invaplex to deliver and enhance the immune response to otherwise non-immunogenic antigens in which InvaplexNAT was serving as an adjuvant and/or transporter of heterologous, functional cargos (proteins, nucleic acids) [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00548), [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00548), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00548), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00548)]. Furthermore, maintenance of the biological activity suggests that a native structure similar to that found in wild-type shigellae is present in the native complex, making it not only a good vaccine candidate but also a good antigen for use in immunological assays to measure responses to the native invasin complex. 3.3. Intranasal Delivery of Invaplex without an Adjuvant [33](#B33-vaccines-10-00548), [34](#B34-vaccines-10-00548)]. This strong response to the Ipa proteins likely reflects their inherent immunogenicity and critical interaction with the host. Although other Shigella proteins are recognized by the immune system, no other antigens stimulate such a dominant, virulence-specific response post-infection. [35](#B35-vaccines-10-00548)], was often necessary to drive a mucosal response. In contrast, immunization in the nasal cavity and exploitation of the \"common mucosal pathway\" to stimulate migration of mature lymphocytes and production of secretory IgA at distant sites [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-00548), [37](#B37-vaccines-10-00548)], such as the intestinal tract, would provide a simple way to stimulate intestinal immunity [ [38](#B38-vaccines-10-00548), [39](#B39-vaccines-10-00548)]. Utilization of the non-injectable, intranasal route would alleviate many of the clinical concerns associated with administering the wild-type LPS (endotoxin) found in InvaplexNAT and would overcome many limitations of oral immunization with a subunit vaccine, such as antigen quantity, the need for an adjuvant and stability upon delivery into the gastrointestinal tract. [40](#B40-vaccines-10-00548), [41](#B41-vaccines-10-00548)]. The intranasal route was used for all animal and human immunizations with InvaplexNAT. Pipets were used for all animal studies, but evaluation of different nasal delivery devices was required for humans. Over the course of clinical development, three devices were used for human intranasal immunization: a micropipette, the Dolphin device (Valois of America, Inc., Congers, NY, USA) and the VaxINator device (Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA). Each device was able to deliver the targeted amount of vaccine, with the Dolphin and VaxINator devices providing optimal spray distribution to the nasal mucosa. Results from the human studies clearly showed that intranasal immunization led to a significant mucosal immune response in the gut [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548), [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548)], which was one of the first direct demonstrations in humans that local intranasal immunizations led to an immune response in the gut. Subsequent studies with the Invaplex vaccine would show that circulating immune lymphocytes carrying the gut mucosal homing marker (47 + B cells) were prominent after intranasal immunization (InvaplexAR) and after parenteral immunization (InvaplexAR-Detox) (see below). and Results [44](#B44-vaccines-10-00548), [45](#B45-vaccines-10-00548), [46](#B46-vaccines-10-00548)]. The antigens used in early studies consisted of purified LPS to detect serotype-specific responses, the water extract preparations from virulent (Vir+) and avirulent (Vir) Shigella [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00548)] and, later, the InvaplexNAT product. Purified IpaB and IpaC were prominently used in more recent studies once they became readily available and were used to measure a response that would potentially react with all Shigella species and EIEC. One antigen frequently used was InvaplexNAT prepared from the same Shigella serotype used to produce the vaccine. Studies using sera from animals or humans immunized with the live attenuated vaccine S. InvaplexNAT [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548), [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548)] consistently demonstrated that there were more seroconversions measured with InvaplexNAT than with any other antigen. Although not fully understood, InvaplexNAT, when used as an immunological assay antigen reagent, seems to maintain a native conformation not found in purified LPS, IpaB or IpaC [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00548)]. For this reason, InvaplexNAT has been used as an ELISA antigen to measure the immunogenicity of all Invaplex products. [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00548)]. Western blot analysis of guinea pig immune sera indicated that IpaB and IpaC were dominant immunogens in InvaplexNAT 24- and 50-immunized animals, but antibodies to several other non-virulence-specific proteins were found in animals immunized with InvaplexNAT 50. In both guinea pigs and mice immunized with either InvaplexNAT 24 or 50, significant protection was observed upon challenge with homologous, virulent shigellae [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00548)]. Similar immune responses were observed with InvaplexNAT prepared from all Shigella species and EIEC. The one notable difference was for S. sonnei InvaplexNAT 24, which had much lower quantities of IpaB and undetectable LPS and was not protective in mice or guinea pigs [ [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00548), [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00548), [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00548)]. These results suggested that either IpaB or LPS or both antigens were crucial for protection in these models. The S. sonnei InvaplexNAT 50 product stimulated antibodies to LPS, IpaB, IpaC and other proteins and was fully protective. 3.5. Heterologous Immunity Induced by Invaplex [50](#B50-vaccines-10-00548), [51](#B51-vaccines-10-00548)]. Studies with epitope-defined monoclonal antibodies have several epitopes for IpaB and IpaC are conserved on Ipa proteins from all Shigella spp. [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00548), [51](#B51-vaccines-10-00548)]. The high degree of sequence and epitope conservation suggests that a vaccine containing IpaB and IpaC, such as Invaplex, has the potential to stimulate immunity to multiple Shigella spp. Using InvaplexNAT 50 prepared from S. sonnei, it was possible to protect mice from a lethal challenge with not only the homologous S. sonnei but also the heterologous S. flexneri 2a [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00548), [52](#B52-vaccines-10-00548)]. The level of protection was highly significant against both challenge organisms. None of the animals immunized with the S. sonnei InvaplexNAT 50 produced antibodies to S. flexneri 2a LPS, but antibodies to several cross-reactive proteins, including IpaB, IpaC, elongation factor G (84 kDa) and DnaK (72 kDa), were produced after immunization with InvaplexNAT 50 [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00548), [52](#B52-vaccines-10-00548)]. [53](#B53-vaccines-10-00548)]. Studies in other labs have also demonstrated heterologous immunity in mice with purified IpaB and IpaD and an IpaB/IpaD fusion protein [ [54](#B54-vaccines-10-00548), [55](#B55-vaccines-10-00548), [56](#B56-vaccines-10-00548)]. However, the broad-based protection identified in the mouse model has not been replicated by this team in the guinea pig model [ [57](#B57-vaccines-10-00548)]. The mechanism by which conserved protein targeted immunity is involved in protection in mice is unknown, and furthermore, it is not clear what role, if any, it has in humans exposed to shigellae. Even so, as the immune response to the Ipa proteins is dominant post-infection in humans, it is likely the anti-Ipa immune responses are key components of protective immunity [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-00548)] and would enhance any vaccine's effectiveness against the entire Shigella genus. As clinical trials progress, investigations on cross-protective immunity will be a key component of the studies to demonstrate a role of anti-Ipa protein immune responses [ [34](#B34-vaccines-10-00548)]. 3.6. cGMP Manufacture of InvaplexNAT [58](#B58-vaccines-10-00548), [59](#B59-vaccines-10-00548)] and growth in a WRAIR-developed medium using non-animal-sourced components to remove the concern of bovine spongiform encephalopathy-causing prions in the final product (Lot 1307). Lot 0994 which was used in the first-in-human trials conducted in 2004 [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548)], and Lot 1307 was used in phase 1 and phase 2b clinical trials from 2007 to 2009 [ [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548), [60](#B60-vaccines-10-00548), [61](#B61-vaccines-10-00548)] (see [Table 2a InvaplexNAT [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00548-t003)). Modeled after experiments in small the three-dose, two-week-interval immunization schedule and the immunological assays were maintained. The first two human trials focused on safety and used a gradual dose escalation (10, 50, 240, 480 and 690 \u00b5g) delivered with a micropipette (Lot 0994) [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548)] or the Dolphin intranasal spray device (Lot 1307) [ [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548)]. The InvaplexNAT product was well-tolerated after three immunizations, with no serious adverse events (SAE) and the majority of adverse events (AE) reported as mild. Individuals immunized with the Dolphin device had higher immune responses. The mucosal immune response (ASC levels and fecal IgA), particularly with the high dose (690 \u00b5g), were of significant magnitude and frequency to warrant moving the InvaplexNAT vaccine product to a phase 2b inpatient challenge study. An expanded phase 1/2b study was conducted with Lot 1307 in 2008. Unlike the initial phase 1 study with Lot 1307, the second study using only the 690 \u00b5g dose amount did not achieve the magnitude or frequency of positive immune responses seen in the earlier studies, and upon challenge, the subjects were not protected, although the challenge study was compromised by low volunteer numbers and a suboptimal level of disease in the unvaccinated controls [ [60](#B60-vaccines-10-00548)]. |Study Title||Phase||ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier||Study| Start an Invaplex with Greater Effectiveness [49](#B49-vaccines-10-00548)]. Additionally, the absence of an HMMC in S. sonnei InvaplexNAT 24 coinciding with the previously noted lack of IpaB and LPS in S. sonnei InvaplexNAT 24 and its lack of protection in small animals suggested that the HMMC is the effector of Invaplex potency and efficacy. The ability to isolate the active component (highly purified Invaplex or HP Invaplex) of InvaplexNAT consisting of only IpaB, IpaC and LPS in an HMMC provided the foundation for the next generation of Invaplex (called artificial Invaplex or InvaplexAR) in which purified components were assembled into an HMMC. 4. Artificial Invaplex (InvaplexAR) 4.1. Development of InvaplexAR [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00548-t001)). Existing methods to purify each antigen were available but, for the most part, yielded low quantities of the purified component. Therefore, development of improved purification methods for each component were necessary. [65](#B65-vaccines-10-00548)]. By increasing the number of extractions, the yield was significantly improved to produce gram quantities of LPS for each kg of cell paste. The modified procedure was applicable to all Shigella species with minor changes and has provided large quantities of LPS not only for InvaplexAR studies but for use as a key immunological reagent for vaccine evaluations used by WRAIR and global collaborators. The improved procedure was transitioned to cGMP manufacture and has been successfully used to produce large quantities of S. flexneri 2a LPS. [66](#B66-vaccines-10-00548)]. The early recombinants produced low yields of the polyhistidine-tagged protein, and the purified proteins were often characterized by poor solubility, largely due to their inherent hydrophobicity [ [66](#B66-vaccines-10-00548), [67](#B67-vaccines-10-00548), IpgC [ [68](#B68-vaccines-10-00548)] and maintaining solubility of the purified proteins in mild detergents, working quantities of the proteins were produced, allowing research-scale experimentation on structure and function of the proteins [ [69](#B69-vaccines-10-00548), [70](#B70-vaccines-10-00548), [71](#B71-vaccines-10-00548), [72](#B72-vaccines-10-00548)]. [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-00548-f002)A) with an IpaC:IpaB molar ratio of approximately 5, contained about 1.2 mg LPS/mg protein and had an approximate mass of 1 MDa. The InvaplexAR was soluble, without any added detergent, and was stable frozen or at room temperature ( [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00548-t002)). Mice or guinea pigs immunized with InvaplexAR had superior immune responses to IpaB, IpaC and LPS as compared to InvaplexNAT; InvaplexAR induced solid protection in both animal models [ [53](#B53-vaccines-10-00548)]. This initial research successfully produced InvaplexAR products for S. flexneri 1a, S. flexneri 2a, S. sonnei and S. dysenteriae 1, as well as a construct containing LPS of both S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei. The Invaplex product containing two Shigella 2](#vaccines-10-00548-f002)B). Although the success of the prototype InvaplexAR was very promising, it was clear that significant improvements in production/purification were necessary prior to cGMP manufacture and transition to clinical evaluation. Critical improvements in the systems used to produce the recombinant IpaB and IpaC were necessary. By using recombinant expression systems with higher plasmid copy numbers, antibiotic selection markers compatible with clinical studies and purification strategies that did not depend on affinity-tagged IpaB or IpaC, significantly increased yields of the target proteins became possible. [Table 4](#vaccines-10-00548-t004)), which are the leading target serotypes for a multivalent Shigella vaccine Manufacture 2](#vaccines-10-00548-t002), which compares multiple generations of cGMP Invaplex lots. Noteworthy characteristics include purity (well-defined composition), immunogenicity, protective efficacy and lack of adverse side effects in small animals. 4.3. Clinical Evaluation of S. flexneri 2a InvaplexAR [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00548-t003)). Volunteers were immunized intranasally with four dose amounts of InvaplexAR (10, 50, 250 and 500 \u00b5g) on days 0, 14 and 28 [ [75](#B75-vaccines-10-00548)]. The primary goals related to safety and effective delivery of the vaccine with the VaxINator nasal spray device were achieved. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested, and no AEs met stopping criteria. The most common AEs were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip. The AE rates were with with S. flexneri 2a InvaplexNAT [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548), [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548)] resolved within 72 immunization with 50 \u00b5g of InvaplexAR induced serum IgG and IgA directed to InvaplexNAT and LPS antigens, with no clear dose response and no significant increase in titer after the third immunization. ASC or antibody in lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) assays detected IgA- and IgG-secreting cells specific to InvaplexNAT after immunization with 50 \u00b5g of InvaplexAR. Antibodies to LPS and InvaplexNAT were also detected in fecal and saliva samples in 38% to 67% of the volunteers. Functional bactericidal serum antibodies were detected in 50% of individuals in the 50 \u00b5g and 500 \u00b5g dose cohorts. Overall, the phase 1 trial with InvaplexAR showed a safety profile consistent with that of previous studies with InvaplexNAT and demonstrated improved immunogenicity to key Shigella antigens. Despite these encouraging results, a robust immune response was not present in a high proportion of individuals, suggesting that additional adjustments were necessary. 5. Artificial Detoxified Invaplex (InvaplexAR-Detox) 5.1. Development and Pre-Clinical Testing of InvaplexAR-Detox [76](#B76-vaccines-10-00548)]. Therefore, studies were conducted to evaluate the inflammatory potential of LPS isolated from mutant Shigella strains with single and double deletions of the msbB gene, which is a late acyl transferase. Although LPS from the single msbB mutants were found to be less proinflammatory as compared to fully acylated lipid A, LPS from the double msbB mutant strain (WR30) was utilized for downstream development [ [77](#B77-vaccines-10-00548)]. Furthermore, when pilot batches of InvaplexAR-Detox assembled with S. flexneri 2a LPS from the various msbB Shigella mutants were utilized in monocyte activation experiments, the level of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) released was significantly lower as compared to the cytokines released after monocyte incubation with similar amounts of LPS from the mutated Shigella strains, indicating that complexing the LPS with proteins further reduced the proinflammatory potential of the vaccine [ [78](#B78-vaccines-10-00548)]. 5.2. Pre-Clinical Studies with InvaplexAR-Detox [79](#B79-vaccines-10-00548)], animals immunized with InvaplexAR-Detox were also significantly protected from disease (protective efficacy = 67%; p-value = 0.008). In this experiment, myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations, an indicator of gut inflammation, were determined in stool samples collected pre-challenge and 1, 2 and 3 days post-challenge. High levels of MPO (1500 ng/mL), indicating inflammation in the gut, were detected post-challenge in stool of the saline-treated animals; however, MPO was reduced to negligible levels (250 ng/mL) in the animals vaccinated intramuscularly with InvaplexAR-Detox. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that InvaplexAR-Detox was protective and has the capacity to significantly reduce intestinal inflammation, potentially offering added benefits to children in endemic settings because elevated MPO levels have been considered a marker for increased risk for developing stunting and gut enteropathy [ [80](#B80-vaccines-10-00548)]. The encouraging results from the in vitro and in vivo assessments of S. flexneri 2a InvaplexAR-Detox led to the cGMP manufacture of the product at the WRAIR PBF, which was completed in 2015. A double msbB of wild-type S. flexneri serotype in which both msbB1 and msbB2 were deleted was used in combination with the same cGMP manufactured lots of IpaB and IpaC used to manufacture InvaplexAR (Lot 1835), as described previously [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00548-t002)). 5.3. Clinical Evaluation of InvaplexAR-Detox [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00548-t003)) in which the vaccine was delivered to three cohorts with intramuscular doses of 2.5, 10 and 25 \u00b5g delivered on days 0, 21 and 42. The vaccine was well tolerated, with no SAEs and more than 90% of the recorded AEs scored as mild. AEs were dose-dependent and reduced with frequency of administration. The most frequent AEs were pain and tenderness at the injection site and occurred most frequently after the first injection. All three dose levels of InvaplexAR-Detox were highly immunogenic, inducing strong serum antibody responses to all Shigella antigens (LPS, IpaB and IpaC) contained within the vaccine. The magnitude of the LPS-specific serum IgG responses were comparable to or exceeded antibody levels observed after intranasal immunization with InvaplexNAT [ [42](#B42-vaccines-10-00548), [43](#B43-vaccines-10-00548)] and InvaplexAR [ [75](#B75-vaccines-10-00548)], infection with S. flexneri 2a or after immunization with other vaccine candidates [ [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00548)]. In addition to robust systemic responses, the InvaplexAR-Detox vaccine elicited significant mucosal IgG and IgA responses, with an average of 93% of vaccinated subjects demonstrating a mucosal antibody response across all dose levels [ [78](#B78-vaccines-10-00548)]. The InvaplexAR-Detox vaccine also induced robust serum bactericidal antibodies capable of killing S. flexneri 2a (the targeted organism) that were comparable to or exceeded those induced after infection with wild-type S. flexneri 2a [ [81](#B81-vaccines-10-00548)]. The high level of functional antibodies induced after vaccination were maintained 1.4 years after the primary immunization. More importantly, immunization with InvaplexAR-Detox induced a broad bactericidal antibody response capable of killing other Shigella serotypes that also contribute to global morbidity and mortality (S. flexneri 3a and 6). These findings may be associated with the fact that the InvaplexAR-Detox used in the study was the first parenteral Shigella vaccine that delivered controlled amounts of Ipa proteins, which are broadly conserved and surface-expressed in all Shigella serotypes. InvaplexAR-Detox also induced LPS and Ipa protein-specific immunological memory B cell responses, which are key components of a protective immune response after immunization. 6.
