The stomach lining secretes a fluid that is between a pH of 1 and 3 (highly acidic). This acid, often called hydrochloric acid, breaks down the proteins that make up food and inhibits microorganisms, thereby preventing infection. Some of us don't make enough hydrochloric acid, which can really interrupt proper digestive function. Signs that you might not be making enough stomach acid include: Abdominal Pain Bloating Gas Diarrhea Constipation Undigested Food in Stool Reflux Heartburn Believe it or not, in many cases acid reflux or heartburn is not caused by an excess production of stomach acid but rather the opposite. See me to explore this further. What would cause stomach acid production to be low? Age over 65 Stress Vitamin Deficiency Use of Acid Blocking Medications H.
