Traditional naturopaths favor a holistic approach with natural non toxic and non-invasive treatments and avoid the use of surgery, injections, and prescription drugs. Naturopathic Doctors, N.D., are more medically oriented and use more medical interventions like prescription drugs, injections, and surgery. Naturopathic philosophy is based on a belief in vitalism and self healing. The term \"naturopathy\" comes from the Latin and Greek roots for \"birth\" and \"suffering\" to suggest natural healing. Modern naturopathy evolved from the Natural Cure Movement in Europe. The term was coined in 1895 by John Scheel and popularized by Benedict Lust, the father of U.S. naturopathy. Beginning in the 1970's, there was a revival of interest in the United States and Canada in conjunction with the holistic health movement. Naturopathic practitioners in the United States can be divided into three categories: traditional naturopaths, naturopathic doctors, and other health care providers that provide naturopathic services. Naturopathic Doctors, N.D.s, employ the principles of naturopathy within the context of conventional medical practices. Dr. Vernon Jenkins is not a Naturopathic Doctor (N.D.), but he is a Traditional Naturopathic Practitioner/ Traditional Naturopath and has been practicing naturopathy since 1973.
