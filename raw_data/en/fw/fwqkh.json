As Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, I submit this Annual Report to you for your information and presentation in Parliament. Yours sincerely Allan J Myers AC QC Chancellor MESSAGE FROM THE CHANCELLOR 2 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 31 March 2022 Universities are enduring institutions that exist to serve society. In 2021, as people and communities around the world experienced another challenging, pandemic-affected year, this imperative continued to drive the University of Melbourne to make many significant contributions to the public good. The work of our researchers, teaching academics and industry partners from various disciplines informed the national pandemic response. In addition to many centrally important scientific and technical contributions, our experts contributed to the public discourse, and informed government policy and public responses, while also delivering public education programs. University academics across the full range of disciplines continued to publish their research in some of the most esteemed scholarly publications, locally and internationally. During extended periods of remote working, I was proud of the resilience and commitment to innovation displayed by the University community. We continued to prioritise the learning experience for students and we adapted to make rapid improvements to dual subject delivery, expanding our suite of digital teaching and learning technologies. Throughout the year, we continued to support our international students, many of whom were studying offshore and unable to return to Australia. We also worked to make their future transition to Melbourne easier with the introduction of additional support services and programs, such as the new Melbourne Welcome grants. This Annual Report recounts these and many other achievements by the University of Melbourne in 2021. The Report is organised around the key themes of Place, Community, Education, Discovery and Global, highlighting the ways in which our activities continue to be guided by the ambitions set out in the University's 10-year strategy, Advancing Melbourne .

Image: Peter CasamentoANNUAL REPORT 2021 5CONTRIBUTING TO SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS IN HISTORY 1853 University education Founded by an Act of the Victorian Parliament, the University of Melbourne was established as a centre of learning in 1853. With the laying of the foundation stone, the University assumed its place as an integral part of the small colony's cultural life, growing and evolving to become a provider of education and research excellence, both locally and globally. 1856 The eight-hour day On 21 April, stonemasons building the University of Melbourne stopped work and marched to Parliament House, gathering fellow stonemasons on the way to demand the eight-hour day: eight hours' labour, eight hours' recreation and eight hours' rest. The eight-hour day became the goal of a fledgling labour movement as well as its central celebration. 1862 Scientific and cultural knowledge sharing From its earliest years, the University of Melbourne has housed important scientific and cultural institutions. This included the Melbourne Museum between 1862 and 1899, and the Melbourne Herbarium established in 1926. And in 1854, Sir Redmond Barry, the University of Melbourne's first and longest serving Chancellor, founded the State Library of Victoria. 1881 Higher education for women Asserting that everyone should have equal access to further education, the University of Melbourne admitted women from 1880 and in December 1883, Julia Margaret (Bella) Gu\u00e9rin became the first female graduate of an Australian university, being awarded a Bachelor of Arts and subsequently a Master of Arts in 1885.1914-1918 World War I The University of Melbourne played a critical role in the war effort, shortening medical courses to expedite supply of doctors to the front. Its professors offered expertise to munitions committees that brought advances in manufacturing tolerances and, combining knowledge of chemistry, physics and physiology, developed gas masks to protect soldiers against chlorine and bromine. 1920 Symphony orchestras Bernard Heinze, Ormond Chair of Music, reformed the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, combining it with the University Symphony Orchestra in 1932. The change occurred in time for the establishment of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and provided music for radio as well as local concerts.1939-1945 World War II The Second World War made still greater demands on universities than the first. The University of Melbourne worked with defence authorities as part of 'manpower' controls to supply professional graduates across a range of disciplines. University staff joined defence committees, including famously in the first Australian manufacture of optical glass. 1948 University researchThe University of Melbourne became the first Australian university to offer PhDs in 1948 to Erica Wolff in Arts, and RH Myers in Science. The development of the PhD reflected the increasing importance placed on research in the Academy.As the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic came to a close, the University of Melbourne reflected on its role during other important periods in its history, advancing knowledge for the benefit of society through its long record of cultural and scholarly endeavour. 6 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 1956 Computerisation In 1947 Maston Beard and Trevor Pearcey, a British radar scientist who had emigrated to Australia after World War II, led a research group at the CSIR (after 1949 called CSIRO) to design and build CSIR Mk1, the world's fourth stored-memory electronic computer. In 1955 the computer was transferred to the University of Melbourne. Renamed CSIRAC, it continued to operate until November 1964.1968 Performing arts Emerging from the Union Repertory Theatre, 'the Rep' as it was known since its formation in 1953, evolved to become the University of Melbourne Theatre Company in 1968. Today, the Melbourne Theatre Company is a department of the University of Melbourne. 1990 The internet The first TCP/IP internet connection to Australia, and the system for allocation of all domain names, was developed and managed at the University of Melbourne. The University's pivotal role in the country's early internet was due to Professor Peter Poole and Robert Elz from the University of Melbourne's Department of Computer Science who established a data link to the United States of America enabling Australian researchers to exchange email with the users of overseas networks. Although cumbersome by modern standards, it was nevertheless the forerunner of the modern internet.2008 University curricula In 2008, inspired by leading international centres of higher education, the University of Melbourne developed an innovative teaching model to support and inspire graduates to become great thinkers with the skills to solve the world's great challenges. The model encourages students to pursue their passions and explore studies outside their major through breadth subjects, fostering a broader skill set and complementing their degrees. 2010 Truth telling In concert with universities across the world starting to recognise and acknowledge Indigenous history, knowledge and past wrongs, the University of Melbourne developed its first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Now in its third iteration, the University's RAP commits to using its teaching and learning, research and engagement to make a sustainable contribution to improve health, education and living standards for Indigenous Australians. 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic In response to two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University demonstrated leadership in advancing scientific understanding of the virus and its health impacts, informing public policy and government response, and driving pandemic recovery.

In the face of these ongoing challenges, the University of Melbourne continued to prioritise support for its own community of students and staff. At the same time, the University implemented a range of measures to support pandemic recovery and ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency into the future. The Pandemic Response Team led the University's COVID-19 response, informed by public health advice from state and federal governments, as well as the University's own public health experts. The University's operational response to the pandemic included actions to create a COVID-safe campus environment, extending support measures for students and staff, and introducing a range of programs to support the broader public health response. Throughout the year, the University continued to review, adjust and adapt to the changing situation to ensure utmost care for its community. The year began with eased COVID-19 restrictions and a return to on-campus activity for many students and staff. Some students attended campus for Summer Term subjects and in early February more than 5000 people were attending campus daily. The University community warmly welcomed this vibrant return of staff and students being able to come together again for on-campus collaboration, research, and teaching and learning. When a snap lockdown was announced in mid-February, the University acted with agility to move orientation activities to digital delivery to ensure a positive student experience. The University also welcomed new students through online celebrations including the Melbourne Commencement Ceremonies and orientation programs. Public health restrictions then eased for most of Semester 1, enabling some in-person teaching and learning and further on-campus research. The University continued to offer online study options and student services, including for international students unable to return to Melbourne due to extended border closures. From May and for much of the remainder of the year, further lockdowns meant a return to online study and work for most students, researchers and staff. The student community showed an exceptional commitment to their scholarly endeavour in these challenging circumstances. The University's focus remained firmly on continuing to deliver the highest-quality education experience and upholding the integrity of its academic programs as it supported students studying online, both locally and globally. Throughout 2021, the University continued to invest in online teaching and learning, expanding its suite of digital teaching and learning technologies and supporting teaching staff to adopt these technologies. In addition student services, including Stop 1, libraries, academic skills, and careers and employability, were accessible online. Virtual workshops and drop-in sessions were attended by Melbourne students all over the world. The University also offered a range of health, mental health and wellbeing services for students, including a dedicated COVID-19 hotline, and made testing and vaccination available at the University Health Service. A new counselling service for students outside Australia was also introduced, offering free, confidential support in multiple languages across 80 countries. In Melbourne, more than 150 University staff volunteered to support students through the University's partnership with SecondBite. Through this initiative, more than 6800 students received over 34,000 free meals. The University also provided over 5000 fresh fruit and vegetable boxes to students through its Student Fresh Box program. The University recognised the particular challenges experienced by international students unable to travel to Australia and worked hard to provide additional support. This included establishing study hubs in Shenzhen and Nanjing to provide China-based students with a welcoming place to study and collaborate with other University of Melbourne students and alumni. The University also offered its services to the Victorian Government's Study Melbourne Hubs in Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai, and virtually in India. (See also pages 48, 56-57, 72, 74, 76)With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing in Australia and around the world, support for its community remained a critical priority for the University of Melbourne throughout 2021. ANNUAL REPORT 2021 11 Planning ahead for the recommencement of international travel, the University established the Melbourne Welcome package to support new and current international students on arrival or return to Australia. This one-off $4000 grant was introduced to ease the burden of international travel costs and assist students in getting settled and connected in the local community. The University also expanded its range of scholarships for 2022, providing more opportunities for talented students, wherever they are in the world. (See also page 48)The University also introduced additional support for its graduate researchers, including extended candidature and stipends for those whose work was impacted by the pandemic. From mid-July, the University reintroduced paid COVID-19 leave for eligible graduate researchers experiencing disruption to their studies due to the Victorian lockdown. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the University has supported more than 1140 graduate researchers with $7 million in paid scholarship leave and/or extended scholarships. By the end of 2021, 164 of these candidates had completed their degrees, with another 135 under examination. In April 2021 renowned immunologist and Nobel Prize winner Laureate Professor Peter Doherty AM and leading infectious diseases expert Professor Sharon Lewin AO attended the unveiling of artist Luke Jerram's COVID-19 glass sculpture at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity . Image: Guy Cleeve12 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Throughout the year, University staff demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to their work by maintaining vital connections with students, making repeated pivots to online learning, continuing world-changing research, and keeping the University's operations sustainable in a time of constant change and challenge. In turn, the University continued to support staff working from home with a range of resources including the dedicated COVID-19 response website, enhanced online training with new modules on resilience and wellbeing, and access to counselling and other support services. The University also continued to offer special COVID-19 entitlements for staff who contracted COVID-19 or were otherwise required to isolate under public health orders, including 'quarantine leave' for continuing and fixed-term staff, and a COVID-19 special payment for casual staff. In recognition of the resilience and dedication of staff, in September the University provided continuing and fixed-term employees with five 'recharge days' in addition to existing leave entitlements. This initiative recognised the challenges individuals were facing as a result of the pandemic and gave staff additional time away from work to refresh and recharge. As Melbourne began to emerge from lockdown later in 2021, the University reaffirmed its commitment to leadership in public health, and to providing a safe campus environment for students and staff. In September, the University announced it would make COVID-19 vaccination a requirement for attending campus to minimise the risk of the virus in its own community. Implementation of this aligned with Victoria's Roadmap to Deliver the National Plan and paved the way for the University community to return to on-campus activities once restrictions eased in October and November. The University also supported staff to get vaccinated through flexible working arrangements. Casual staff could access a COVID-19 special payment for the day after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine if they experienced an adverse reaction and could not work their rostered hours. At the same time, the University continued to focus efforts on improving the quality and efficiency of its operations to set the institution up for success into the future. This included managing the financial impact of the pandemic, as work continued under the University's Pandemic Reset Program. Throughout 2020, the University introduced a range of measures to combat the budget shortfall including reduced spending, use of reserves and increasing borrowings. Many of these measures were designed and planned in 2020, and fully implemented in 2021. The program included an extension of the University's existing shared services model for professional services delivery and in 2021, new organisational structures were implemented in Finance, Advancement, University Communications and Marketing, Student Recruitment and Admissions, and Human Resources. These changes were designed to strengthen alignment between University strategy and service delivery, build and deepen professional expertise, and reduce duplication and costs. As a result of the Pandemic Reset Program, a number of staff members left the institution across both 2020 and 2021. The University acknowledges and thanks these employees for their service. In addition to the 210 staff who chose to leave the University through voluntary redundancy, a further 168 left in 2021 via involuntary redundancy. The majority of these positions were professional. A further 45 colleagues retired from the University as a result of the Senior Academic Enhanced Retirement Scheme that offered the same benefits as those who took redundancy. The Pandemic Reset Program concluded in late 2021, with the University continuing its efforts to improve the delivery of professional services across the institution. Despite the challenges of 2021, the University kept its long-term vision firmly in view and pursued initiatives with purpose and energy across the Advancing Melbourne strategic pillars of Place, Community, Education, Discovery and Global. Following the significant periods of remote learning and working over the past two years, the University looks forward to restoring the vibrancy of its campus community in 2022 and continuing to serve and benefit society through the transformative impact of education and research. ANNUAL REPORT 2021 13HELPING COMBAT COVID-19 Throughout 2021 the University continued to demonstrate leadership in advancing research for the greater good through public education, informing public policy and government response, and driving pandemic recovery. As one of the world's leading universities, the University of Melbourne has contributed to global efforts to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic since its onset. Following extensive contributions in 2020, University researchers continued to play a critical role in responding to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic across a range of disciplines, leading scientific discovery, informing and influencing public policy and contributing to public discourse. The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity has a multidisciplinary approach to pandemic response. In 2020, the Institute was the first group to isolate and share the SARS-CoV-2 virus with laboratories around the world. This directly enabled a suite of research and public health activities, including on fundamental immunology and virology, vaccines and therapeutics, diagnostics and surveillance, and clinical care. The Doherty Institute provided modelling to inform development and implementation oft the Federal Government's National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID Response , as well as other policy platforms. (See also page 41) The Institute continues to be at the cutting-edge of COVID-19 developments. For example, the emergence of novel variants like Omicron require innovations in diagnostic and genomic testing, clinical service delivery, epidemiologic models and assessment of vaccines and therapeutics.

Image: Northern Health14 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 University researchers, led by Professor Kirsty Buising from the Doherty Institute, contributed to a world-first study into airflow and movement in a COVID-19 ward, providing insights into virus transmission and ways to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission in healthcare settings. In a separate study, researchers, led by Professor of Paediatric Infectious Diseases Nigel Curtis, are investigating whether it is possible to predict who remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 variants after having had COVID-19 or receiving a vaccine. Exploring the immune response to COVID-19-specific vaccines in Brazilian healthcare workers, the research has received philanthropic funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and is a sub-study of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's assessment of the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine and its efficacy in protecting against COVID-19. As part of the official signing ceremony of the Australian Institute of Infectious Disease's Foundation Partners agreement in December, researchers based at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity demonstrated the work they are currently doing in the lab to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Image: Peter CasamentoANNUAL REPORT 2021 15Researchers are investigating the efficacy of a new nasal spray that repurposes the safe and inexpensive blood thinner, Heparin, to prevent COVID-19 infection and stop its spread in the community. The research is co-led by Director of the University's Lung Health Research Centre Professor Gary Anderson, Professor Paul Monagle from the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences and Murdoch Children's Research Institute, and colleagues from Monash University and Northern Health. It brings together a coalition of researchers, including experts at the Bio21 Institute, Peter Doherty Institute of Infection and Immunity, Oxford University and the CSIRO. In 2021, the IntraNasal HEpaRin Trial (INHERIT) received $4.2 million funding from the Victorian Government to carry out a first-ever human trial in 400 COVID-affected homes. If successful, the six-month trial beginning in February 2022 will provide a safe way to protect highly vulnerable populations including pregnant women, the elderly, those who are immunocompromised or have certain lung diseases, and front-line healthcare providers. It would be used in conjunction with vaccines, and its use could be extended for wider use to help make air travel, football matches, restaurants and entertainment venues safer. Researchers also considered the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wider community. The Melbourne Institute published regular reports about the COVID-19 situation in Australia, using data from the Institute's Taking the Pulse of the Nation survey, and exploring topics ranging from how employees feel about vaccine mandates, through to understanding the financial stress experienced by families. (See also page 41) Director of the International Digital Policy Initiative in the Faculty of Arts, Professor Ingrid Volkmer, co-led a global survey to gain a deeper understanding of how young people get their information about COVID-19, the sources they trust, and their attitudes towards false news. The survey found young people worldwide are relying on multiple platforms, providing valuable insights for how health organisations, governments, media and business can improve health communications to this demographic. The World Health Organization (WHO) is now using the outcomes of the study to inform development of health communication strategies. Director of the Future of Work Lab Professor Leah Ruppanner, together with colleagues in the United States, conducted research about shifting inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic. The research team found that in Australia, changes to working and living situations resulted in more fathers stepping into participatory roles at home. The University exchanged knowledge and insights to strengthen responses to COVID-19 in the region. In July, leaders from Indonesia and Australia discussed managing COVID-19 and post-pandemic challenges at a high-level conference facilitated by the University of Melbourne and Universitas Gadjah Mada. Indonesia saw a surge in COVID-19 cases in 2021, with official figures citing around 50,000 new cases per day in June, putting immense pressure on Indonesia's healthcare system. Speakers covered topics such as the need for greater vaccine supply, access and uptake; a range of policies that could be used to manage the crisis; community-based initiatives to tackle associated challenges; and Australia and Indonesia's health partnership. Researchers also played an important role in sharing expertise and information locally to support understanding and combat misinformation. In September, for example, the University launched its VaxFACTS website, featuring a series of simple videos to answer commonly asked questions about COVID-19 vaccines. VaxFACTS provides clear, concise and easy-to-understand public health messaging to encourage individuals and communities to get vaccinated, and to help people communicate with vaccine-hesitant friends and family members. (See also pages 42-43) Progress continued on the establishment of the Australian Institute of Infectious Disease (AIID), a visionary initiative of the University of Melbourne, the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health. The AIID will drive faster, more effective pandemic detection, prevention and response to help protect Australia and the region. Building on $155 million of funding announced in 2020, the Victorian Government committed a further $245 million investment in May 2021 to establish the AIID. The new facility, to be built in the Melbourne Biomedical Precinct, will bring together a critical mass of scientists, public health professionals and global health practitioners. The AIID will further establish Victoria as a global leader in infectious diseases and public health. The initiative will enhance opportunities for research collaboration, platform and knowledge-sharing, as well as industry engagement.

The University acknowledges and thanks its community of supporters who generously contributed more than $100 million to the Believe Campaign in 2021 alone. Received from donors in 32 countries, these contributions provided enhanced support for students during the second year of the pandemic, as well as enabling critical progress on teaching and research initiatives across the University. After launching publicly in 2013, Believe - the Campaign for the University of Melbourne officially concluded on 31 December 2021, having exceeded its dual goals of raising $1 billion in philanthropic support and engaging 100,000 alumni in the life of the University. Thanks to 73,987 individual gifts from more than 29,000 donors to the University, its colleges and affiliates, this immense fundraising effort enabled the University to invest in a remarkable number of major teaching, research and public benefit initiatives over the past 14 years.The Believe Campaign is more than a philanthropic initiative. It is an extraordinary effort by a global community of donors and volunteers who have contributed their time, expertise and financial support to make a true difference to students, life-saving research, shaping the future of Melbourne and supporting the next generation of leaders. Gifts received through the Campaign have supported research and teaching programs, major infrastructure projects and academic appointments, including funding for 34 Professorial Chairs. Establishing 473 scholarships and award funds, the support provided by the Campaign will continue to deliver positive impact for generations to come. MAJOR GIFTS FROM THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY IN 2021 Martin and Loreto Hosking donated $10 million to establish the Contemplative Studies Centre, the University of Melbourne's entry into the research of mindfulness, meditation and contemplative practice. They also donated a further $3 million to the Werribee Equine Centre. The Estate of Mary Lugton pledged $5.01 million to support scholarship programs across multiple faculties, in addition to its significant bequest of $8.5 million made in 2019. The McCall MacBain Foundation donated $2.35 million to establish the Wattle Fellowship, the University's co-curricula program to foster student leadership on global sustainability through multidisciplinary approaches, transformative leadership and practical skills development. The Paul Ramsay Foundation committed $5.7 million to evaluate the impact of two years of kindergarten on children's outcomes. This donation from Australia's largest philanthropic foundation will support a landmark evaluation of the state-wide roll-out of three-year-old kindergarten in Victoria. The project will be delivered over five years through a partnership with the University of Melbourne and the Front Project, working closely with the Victorian Department of Education and Training.ACKNOWLEDGING THE UNIVERSITY'S GENEROUS COMMUNITY OF SUPPORTERS ANNUAL REPORT 2021 2122 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ADVANCING MELBOURNE In May 2020, the University launched and adopted Advancing Melbourne . The new strategy is guiding the University on its journey towards 2030, reflecting the University's commitment to benefiting society though the transformative impact of education and research. Advancing Melbourne emphasises the University's vision to be a world-leading and globally connected Australian university with students at the heart of everything it does. Embracing five intersecting themes - Place, Community, Education, Discovery and Global - the success of the strategy will be demonstrated according to four key outcomes: Students will be offered a distinctive and outstanding education and experience, preparing them for success as leaders, change agents and global citizens. The University will be recognised locally and globally for leadership on matters of national and global importance, through outstanding research and scholarship and a commitment to collaboration. The University will be empowered by a sense of place and connections with communities. It will take opportunities to advance both the University and the City of Melbourne in close collaboration and synergy. A brilliant, diverse and vibrant University community will be built, with strong connections to those the University serves. The 2021 Annual Report is structured around these five themes, with each chapter outlining examples of how the University is addressing and progressing its ambitions against Advancing Melbourne priorities. More information about Advancing Melbourne can be found at: about.unimelb.edu.au/strategy/advancing-melbourne UNDERSTANDING AND TRACKING PERFORMANCE An ambitious strategy requires a sophisticated approach to understanding and measuring performance. The University of Melbourne is nearing the final stage of development of a new performance framework to capture and showcase the success of Advancing Melbourne . The framework will demonstrate positive impacts by 2030 through an approach that leverages both narrative case studies and quantitative data points. The framework will ensure a transparent demonstration of the University's progress against its strategic priorities for University staff, students, alumni and all stakeholders, and provide a basis for reporting against Advancing Melbourne from 2022 onwards. In 2021, the University measured its performance against the sector and past trends using a number of key data points relating to student admissions, educational performance, research performance, diversity and global benchmarking. The latest results from these data points are provided throughout the report, as aligned with the relevant themes of Advancing Melbourne . A summary table is provided on the following page to articulate progress against Advancing Melbourne priorities. This is an interim measure until the University's new performance framework is introduced in 2022.ANNUAL REPORT 2021 23SUMMARY OF PROGRESS AGAINST ADVANCING MELBOURNE PRIORITIES PRIORITIES 2021

Great universities have a strong presence in the world, beginning with their place of foundation. The University's history of service to the people of Melbourne, Victoria and Australia has shaped the University's past and present, and will influence its future. The University's commitment to place starts with recognition of and relationship to the Traditional Owners of the lands on which its community works and learns. The University is committed to the recognition, curation and activation, within the Academy, of Indigenous knowledges, and deepening engagement and reciprocal learning with Indigenous communities through partnerships in Melbourne, the Goulburn Valley, North East Arnhem Land and throughout Australia. It also recognises the significance of the University's relationships to and within the City of Melbourne, a globally connected knowledge hub in an increasingly networked region. Working in partnership with the City and the other communities it serves, the University aims to attract the most brilliant minds, wherever they may be found, to tackle problems of local and global significance. ANNUAL REPORT 2021 25 Connecting people, place and possibilities, Melbourne Connect brings together the creativity, cross-disciplinary expertise and talent of the University of Melbourne research community and its diverse partners to help drive innovation. Image: Peter Casamento PLACE 2526 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 The University collaborated on key projects for the benefit of the people of Melbourne, formalising its long-standing partnership with the City of Melbourne and signing the Melbourne Partnerships Charter. This signals a joint multi-year commitment to progress initiatives with Aboriginal Melbourne and across sustainability, climate, digital economy, and city rejuvenation and recovery. Melbourne Connect opened its doors in March, bringing together researchers, government, industry, and start ups in a modern innovation and entrepreneurial precinct in the heart of the City's north. Science Gallery Melbourne officially opened in November, providing a unique avenue to connect the community with the University's cultural assets, education and research. Part of a global network, Science Gallery Melbourne provides opportunities for young people to explore new ideas about the intersection of science, art and innovation. Highlights The University partnered with regional communities, using its research and scholarship to support local priorities with the potential for wider application, including the launch of two collaborative projects to strengthen agri-food innovation and help farmers, agricultural businesses and communities become more resilient to the impacts of drought. The University demonstrated its ongoing commitment to education and support for Indigenous priorities and outcomes in the Goulburn Valley region, with work progressing on the Munarra Centre for Regional Excellence in Shepparton and development of a joint education strategy with La Trobe University, GOTAFE and community partners.PLACE 27In 2021, the University of Melbourne embraced its place locally, nationally and globally, making important progress in advancing recognition of Indigenous knowledge, histories and truth. Throughout 2021 the University also continued to contribute to social, economic and cultural prosperity through its place-based partnerships and development of new and future precincts and campuses across Victoria. Central to the University of Melbourne's commitment to place is its relationship to the Traditional Owners of the lands upon which its campuses are located. Acting on its obligation to recognise the history of its sites, in 2021 the University continued work on the Indigenous History of the University of Melbourne project to articulate the contested histories of the University and its relationship with Indigenous Australia. The project is due to be published in book form in 2022 and will situate the University as an institution where Indigenous history is acknowledged, and Indigenous and colonial heritage is embedded across research, teaching and learning. The University will also act on this commitment to truth telling through the Victorian Government's Yoorrok Justice Commission. In 2021 the University advanced its commitment to foster purposeful and meaningful partnerships that contribute to shared social, economic and cultural outcomes through development of its precincts and campuses, and the deepening of its long-standing partnerships in Melbourne, North East Arnhem Land and the Goulburn Valley. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and knowledge systems are celebrated at University of Melbourne campuses during events of significance each year. Image: Paul Burston28 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Strengthening ties with the City of Melbourne The University of Melbourne formalised its long-standing relationship with the City of Melbourne in 2021 with the signing of the Melbourne Partnerships Charter in December. At two Melbourne Partnership Forums this year, the University and City of Melbourne worked together and with other partners and stakeholders, to develop a cohesive vision for the partnership and identify opportunities to align and deliver outcomes for the City. The partnership is built around principles of listening, meaningful collaboration and two-way learning. The partnership projects are focused on four themes, aligned with the City's strategy: Aboriginal Melbourne, Melbourne's unique place and identity, climate and biodiversity emergency, and economy of the future. Projects underway include Power Melbourne, the City of Melbourne's ambitious battery storage and renewable electricity project set to deliver cheaper power for small businesses and residents while reducing emissions and contributing to a more sustainable future, and the City's initiative to create a First Nations Precinct in central Melbourne to celebrate Aboriginal culture and community, with truth telling and reconciliation at its core. The University and City of Melbourne are also working together in the Carlton Collaboration partnership with the Carlton Community Network, with the three organisations signing an MoU this year. The partnership has delivered great outcomes for the local community, including donating repurposed computers and equipment to the Carlton Housing Estate, and will continue to progress local initiatives including providing ongoing support to improve digital literacy.

Image: Peter CasamentoPLACE 29In Melbourne, on Wurundjeri Country and home to the Parkville campus, the University opened its newest innovation precinct, Melbourne Connect. The University worked closely with the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Aboriginal Corporation to recognise and embed the important Aboriginal history of this place especially expressed through the laneways named in Woi Wurrung language that join up in the oculus area - Womin-Dejerring - meaning coming together. The opening celebrations provided opportunities to recognise the site's importance to Indigenous culture and heritage, as well as its historical significance as the former Royal Women's Hospital. Melbourne Connect offers a collaborative place for the University community and its partners, and was a hub for public engagement in 2021, hosting festivals such as Melbourne Knowledge Week, the Digital Innovation Festival and Open House Melbourne. (See also pages 27, 28, 30, 66-67, 104) The University's Cultural Commons (see also pages 31-32) provides access to the extensive collections of its museums, galleries and theatres, and exemplifies the University's efforts to engage with the community in unique ways. Throughout the year, the University's galleries and museums were closed for several periods due to the pandemic, however the team continued to engage with audiences virtually, and in November celebrated the official opening of Science Gallery Melbourne by Her Excellency the Honourable Linda Dessau AC, Governor of Victoria. Also in November Emu Sky, curated by Barkandji woman Zena Cumpston, opened at Old Quad on Parkville campus, illuminating Aboriginal voices and perspectives. The exhibition will run until 30 July 2022.In 2021, the University progressed plans for its engineering and design innovation campus at Fishermans Bend. Important milestones were achieved including receipt of Victorian Government approval for a planning amendment and confirmation of site heritage requirements. Remediation work continued during the year in preparing the site for construction. The University also settled purchase for the 7.2 hectare site, with the first stage of development - the new Engineering and Design Innovation Hub - progressing from concept to schematic design. Supporting the University's position as a regional leader in engineering, climate futures, advanced manufacturing and design, the project will be delivered with a phased opening from 2025. Critical to the University's ambitions to deliver positive outcomes for the community is its enduring relationship with the City of Melbourne. This partnership was formalised in 2021 with the signing of the Melbourne Partnerships Charter, a commitment to ongoing collaboration between the University and the City for the benefit of all Melburnians. The University fostered this same spirit of collaboration in its other placed-based partnerships and, despite ongoing disrupted travel due to the pandemic, strengthened its connection to community in North East Arnhem Land. In association with the Yothu Yindi Foundation, work progressed on the Garma Institute Plan, partnering with Barker College and Studio Schools Australia on this long-term commitment to realising Yolngu-led and co-designed education in the region. Every year the Faculty of Fine Arts and Music acknowledges National Reconciliation Week with Lighting the Wilin, a formal smoking ceremony by Boon Wurrung Elders. In 2021 N'arweet Dr Carolyn Briggs was joined by Bachelor of Fine Arts (Dance) students Gamilaroi woman Amelia O'Leary (left) and Dunghutti-Gomeroi and Wiradjuri woman Zoe Brown (right). Image: Gregory Lorenzutti30 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Illuminating Indigenous perspectives Each year, the University of Melbourne presents two key signature Indigenous events - the Dungala Kaiela Oration and the Narrm Oration. Due to COVID-19 both orations were presented online in 2021, again significantly increasing engagement and pointing to the benefits of hybrid presentations for future orations. The Dungala Kaiela Oration is hosted jointly with the Kaiela Institute in Shepparton and celebrates the cultural identity of the people of the greater Goulburn Murray region, builds bridges to promote Aboriginal social and economic development, and exemplifies what makes the Yorta Yorta of the river country so strong, proud and resilient. In 2021, the Dungala Kaiela orator was Josephine Sukkar AM, Chair of the Australian Sports Commission, co-founder and principal of construction company Buildcorp, president of Australian Women's Rugby. Ms Sukkar's oration emphasised the potential within the infrastructure of sport to harness and channel the passion of the Australian people. She highlighted the willingness and ability within sporting infrastructure to tackle the insidious issue of institutional racism and to be a critical cornerstone in creating a healthy, vibrant nation we can all be proud to contribute to, and one in which we can all be winners. Gillon McLachlan, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Football League delivered the response to the oration. The annual Narrm Oration profiles leading Indigenous peoples from across the world to enrich ideas about possible futures for Indigenous Australia. Following an inspiring oration by Professor Papaarangi Reid from the University of Auckland on the theme of 'Navigating Indigenous Futures' , the Poche Centre for Indigenous Health celebrated its Advancing Indigenous program with a formal dinner at Melbourne Connect. The event brought together the University's largest cohort of Indigenous doctoral graduates with Indigenous Elders and scholars to recognise and celebrate their success. Dr Raelene Nixon and Dr Sharon Atkinson-Briggs reflected on their PhD journeys in dinner presentations. For the 2021 Narrm Oration, Professor Papaarangi Reid from the University of Auckland held the audience spellbound as she delivered her oration on the theme of Navigating Indigenous Futures. This included (left to right) University of Melbourne's Associate Professor Misty Jenkins, Associate Professor Michael Shawn-Fletcher Kirsty Gover. Image: Peter CasamentoPLACE 31Although the University's Master of Teaching students were unable to complete practicum placements in the region due to border closures in 2021, the Melbourne Graduate School of Education supported an Indigenous-led project during the year to create culturally appropriate resources for visitors to the community. Produced in collaboration with senior Yolngu educators, and delivered in language, these videos support students and other visitors to competently enter and collaborate with the community. The project is built on long-standing relationships in North East Arnhem Land and Yuendumu with the Yambirrpa schools and Northern Territory Government. The Goulburn Valley, on Yorta Yorta Country, is home to the University's Dookie campus, the Department of Rural Health, Equine Hospital and the Academy of Sport, Health and Education (ASHE). Over 1000 students engaged in agricultural and rural health courses and projects at Dookie and Shepparton campuses, spending time in and connecting with the Goulburn Valley community. Three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women based in Shepparton were awarded their PhDs. Two are Dungala Kaiela Research Fellows at the University of Melbourne's Poche Centre for Indigenous Health. In July the University launched the Diploma in General Studies (Extended) to support ASHE students to advance to higher education. Kokatha/Wirangu man Chris Warrior commenced as the new Programs and Pathways Officer supported by the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences. In this role, Mr Warrior will work with ASHE to provide mentoring and forge effective pathways to higher learning, ensuring the University's Dookie campus is a culturally safe space for community to enjoy, study and work.The University launched two major joint research initiatives in the Goulburn Valley in 2021, including NorVicFoods, supported by $2.7 million from the Victorian Government's Higher Education State Investment Fund, and the Victorian Drought Resilience Adoption and Innovation Hub, one of eight drought resilience research hubs supported by the Federal Government's Future Drought Fund. Together with La Trobe University and GOTAFE, the University commenced work on a regional education strategy to deliver joint research, and establish pathways and courses to support the Goulburn Valley's priorities for education success. The Melbourne Graduate School of Education is collaborating with La Trobe University and the Victorian Government on the new Greater Shepparton Teaching Academy of Professional Practice to attract and retain teachers in the region and provide local VCE students with support from mentors, including those drawn from the University of Melbourne alumni community. Through its long-standing partnerships with Rumbalara Football Netball Club, Kaiela Institute and Munarra Limited, the University demonstrated an ongoing commitment to education and support for Indigenous priorities and outcomes in the region. In 2021, planning progressed for development of the Munarra Centre for Regional Excellence (MCRE) in Shepparton, and Munarra Ltd was established to oversee operations of MCRE, with University of Melbourne representatives appointed to its inaugural board. This commitment was exemplified by the University's role as Engagement and Learning Partner of the new Shepparton Art Museum, with students and staff actively involved in museum programs. More than 4500 students engaged with Cultural Commons museums and collections through classes in their subjects - some virtual - across disciplines including Architecture, Building and Planning, Arts, Education, Engineering and IT , Fine Arts and Music, Law, Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, and Science. More than 7800 people engaged with Museums and Collections exhibitions across all venues. 84 Learning Experience and Outreach programs were delivered, engaging 1876 students.TRACKING PERFORMANCE32 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Sharing the love of culture through the eyes of students As custodians of a unique and diverse collection of historic and contemporary art and objects, the University of Melbourne not only encourages students to engage with its Cultural Commons as part of their studies, but invites them to share their knowledge and love with the wider community. The University of Melbourne's Cultural Commons comprises over 40 individual collections and more than 15 galleries, archives, museums and theatres. They cover an awe-inspiring range of rare books and manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, photographs, medical and dental implements, scientific apparatus, musical instruments, mineral, plant and animal specimens, and ethnographic and archaeological artefacts. The University has always encouraged the use of its Cultural Commons by students, staff and the wider community - whether for research, teaching and learning, or engagement. In 2021, the University again offered internships employing students and graduates to work on exhibitions and deliver programs as mediators and facilitators. In the process, the internships continued to create pathways for engagement and employment, and opportunities for lifelong learning. After coming to the University from Dubai, Kenen Machado graduated with a Bachelor of Design in 2020, and in 2021 took up two of the internships offered to Melbourne students and graduates. He is now working as a mediator and learning experience facilitator at Science Gallery Melbourne. \"The roles appealed to my strong desire to contribute to and represent the University of Melbourne's aspirational goals for its Cultural Commons and its respectful and compassionate culture, \" said Kenen. \"And they provided a great opportunity for me to interact more directly with young people in the Victorian school system who visited the Science Gallery from various academic, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds. \" The roles are also offered at other Cultural Commons exhibitions and venues, including Emu Sky which opened at the Old Quad in November, and at the Ian Potter Museum where internships are offered to University of Melbourne students undertaking a Master of Curatorship, Arts Management and Conservation. Kenen has always been open to working in design-related fields, with a particular leaning towards education, outreach, arts, and culture. \"There's a lot of opportunity that comes with exploring different avenues, \" said Kenen. \"As an international student here in Melbourne, conscientious and responsible representation has always been incredibly important to me. \"The arts and cultural space here in Melbourne shares these values, so I had a yearning to get involved in any way that I could. \"Kenen believes that being given the opportunity to engage so closely with the University's collections has made his experience at the University richer and more memorable. \"University is all about making lasting connections and being exposed to more than just what you are comfortable with, and I can definitely say I have gained that insight and experience from my role with Science Gallery. \" Vice-Chancellor Professor Duncan Maskell describes Cultural Commons as an inspired, visionary way of bringing to life the unique artistic, archival and cultural wealth inherited by the University from generations of donors, philanthropists and alumni. \"It integrates and embeds more deeply our cultural treasures in the research and learning that takes place across the disciplines, \" said Professor Maskell. \"And provides invaluable opportunities for our students and graduates to further develop the creative and problem-solving skills they need for the 21st century. \" 32 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 33 Kenen Machado Recent Bachelor of Design graduate Kenen Machado came to the University from Dubai, and is now working as an intern at Science Gallery Melbourne to deliver exhibitions and programs.

The University community is both local and global, comprising a diverse scholarly community and a strong global network of alumni and partners. Diversity and inclusiveness are attributes that enrich the University's broad community. The University is, and must always be, a place where knowledge is valued and shared, where truth and ideas can be discussed and debated freely and rigorously, and where innovation flourishes. At the same time it must be a place where the rights of staff and students are respected and celebrated, and where everyone can participate in University life, free from discrimination or vilification. 34 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 35 The University of Melbourne's medical students studying within the Department of Rural Health benefit from placements at the Shepparton Medical Centre and, in the process, bring significant benefits to their patients.

The University continued to implement important initiatives to create an environment where everyone is valued and respected including the launch of its Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2030, and releasing a new Gender Affirmation Policy. Researchers played a vital role as an influential voice in public debate, providing trusted, evidence-based information to answer community concerns and address challenges such as vaccine hesitancy.Highlights The University reinforced its commitment to a respectful environment and to the elimination of sexual misconduct. Together with establishment of a new Respect@Melbourne Committee, and Sexual Misconduct Policy, the University rolled out a leadership development program to its most senior leaders, equipping them to play an active role in eliminating sexual misconduct and creating a safe and respectful work environment. University of Melbourne alumni continued to play a vital role in supporting students and programs, with more than 3700 volunteering their time and expertise. COMMUNITY 37In 2021, the University of Melbourne continued to nurture a vibrant, diverse and inclusive community, reaffirming its commitment to respect and fairness, and taking significant steps to address issues including sexual misconduct. Academic freedom and freedom of expression remain at the core of the University community and, in 2021, the University continued to provide leadership and expertise in matters of national and global importance through its contribution to informed debate on important public issues. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to present challenges for students and staff in 2021 and the University implemented a range of measures to assist and support its community. Staff demonstrated an exceptional dedication to their work and the University, maintaining connections with students, adapting to online learning and teaching, continuing research, and acting quickly to respond to changing public health requirements. In September the University provided continuing and fixed-term staff with five 'recharge days' in addition to existing leave entitlements. Staff, including casual employees rostered to work, were given an extra day off with pay (24 December). Both initiatives recognised the resilience and commitment of staff throughout the uncertainty caused by the pandemic, supporting them with additional time away from work to refresh and recharge. The University provided staff with a range of other wellbeing supports such as the ongoing Employee Assistance Program, the University's confidential personal and professional development resource available for all staff and their immediate family members. Staff were encouraged to use existing flexible work arrangements to get vaccinated during business hours if required. The University also provided casual staff with a COVID-19 special payment equivalent for rostered hours scheduled the day after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine if they experienced an adverse reaction. The University recognised the particular challenges experienced by students, both locally and globally, and extended a number of measures introduced in 2020 to support students and graduate researchers, including its range of online health and wellbeing services. The University also introduced a new counselling service for students outside of Australia, available in English and local languages in 80 countries. (See also pages 10, 46-47) As the COVID-19 pandemic continued into its second year, University of Melbourne researchers including Professor and Director of Doherty Epidemiology Jodie McVernon (pictured), were vital in providing evidence-based information to answer community concerns and address vaccine hesitancy. Image: Peter Casamento38 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Outside of its pandemic response, the University continued to address important issues within its own community. In 2021 the University established the new Respect at Melbourne Committee, to lead a major program of work to eliminate sexual misconduct within the University community and to improve support for victim-survivors. The new Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Policy, launched as part of the Respect program in 2021, champions a 'trauma-informed' approach. The policy outlines relevant processes for raising and addressing concerns and complaints, details support available, and encourages bystander intervention. In 2021 the University rolled out a new leadership development program to equip University leaders to take active roles in eliminating sexual misconduct and creating a safe and respectful work environment.(See also pages 36-37, 40, 89) Addressing another important matter, in September the Vice-Chancellor apologised to academic staff for work practices that resulted in a number of casual employees being underpaid for work they performed. The Vice-Chancellor committed to full remediation of staff affected and the University has directly contacted past and current casual employees identified as being potentially affected by the issues. The University also established a dedicated contact line to receive and address underpayment claims. These matters have the highest level of attention within the University, with a dedicated executive team overseeing identification and implementation of a range of corrective actions to strengthen compliant work practices across the University. In 2022, the University will review its approach to workforce planning to reduce reliance on casual employment, recognising that workforce structures which rely heavily on casual employment are neither desirable nor sustainable. Diversity and inclusion enriches every community and is especially vital in a university. The University's Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2030 , launched in 2021, cements the University's commitment to creating an environment where everyone is valued and respected, has equal access to opportunities, and is supported to fulfil their talents and potential. A Progress and Impact Framework has been developed as a critical companion to the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. This contributes to the strategy's first goal - to build trust through actions that improve accountability and transparency. This framework will enable the University to demonstrate leadership in diversity and inclusion and track progress toward the outcomes that are set out in the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. This complements the Advancing Melbourne Performance Framework which includes a range of performance measures related to staff and student diversity, such as the percentage of staff who self-identify as male, female and gender diverse in senior leadership roles, and the percentage of students in terms of gender, Indigenous, non-English speaking, indicated disability, low SES, regional and remote; in addition to access and completion in the University's diverse undergraduate and postgraduate student groups for Indigenous, low SES, regional and remote, and students with disability. Attracting talented students from diverse backgrounds is an important part of the University's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and in 2021 the University continued to improve opportunities for students currently underrepresented in higher education to study at the University of Melbourne. Access Melbourne is the University's special entry and scholarship scheme for domestic students from a range of social and economic backgrounds, taking personal circumstances into consideration. In 2021, 33 per cent of the University's VTAC offers to domestic undergraduate students in the January round were made to applicants eligible for Access Melbourne entry. In 2022 the University will expand Access Melbourne selection criteria and look beyond the ATAR to support more talented students from diverse backgrounds to study at Melbourne. (See also page 41, 46-47) In 2021 the University of Melbourne earned bronze accreditation in its first submission to the Australian Workplace Equality Index, which recognises support for members of the LGBTIQA+ community. The University published its Gender Affirmation Policy during the year, detailing the University's support for staff and students in affirming their gender identity and building a culture that is safe, inclusive and respectful for all. The University also established a Senior Adviser (Gender Affirmation) role to provide individualised support to people affirming their gender. The University undertook important work to ensure full compliance with Victoria's Gender Equality Act 2020 , which came into effect in March 2021. The workplace gender audit and staff survey conducted in June provided important insights to inform development of the University's first gender equality action plan. The plan requires that gender impact assessments be conducted to support policy development and planning for all major projects and initiatives. In 2020, the University of Melbourne received a SAGE Athena SWAN Bronze Award for its commitment to advancing gender equity and promoting greater inclusion in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM) disciplines. As part of the implementation of its Athena SWAN Action plan, in 2021 the University launched a mentoring program to support women academics applying for promotion to senior academic levels D and E (the levels of the academic workforce where women are typically underrepresented). Other strategic priorities include support for people studying and working with disability. As a further action to advance fairness and inclusion for all within the University community, and in response to needs identified through consultation, the University made disability awareness training available for all staff in 2021, and commenced development of a Disability Inclusion Action Plan (for implementation in 2022). COMMUNITY 39To ensure that its campuses are physically accessible to all, the University undertook an accessibility audit of all campus buildings, and began a program of work to address issues identified in the audit. In 2021 the University's alumni network, made up of more than 450,000 alumni living and working in more than 170 countries, continued to play a vital role in the life and vibrancy of the University community, participating in alumni engagement activities and mentor programs, as well as making generous donations in support of University ambitions. The University engaged more than 21,000 alumni throughout the year, primarily through participation in a wide range of events including public lectures, outreach, career-related events, networking and social activities, and lifelong learning programs. Demonstrating its contribution to discourse on major societal challenges, the University's engagement program continued to connect the alumni community with experts through events such as the Climate Conversations series and the COVID-19 Vaccines - Your Questions Answered public lecture.More than 3700 alumni volunteered their time to support the University in programs across all faculties. This included mentoring students, presenting as guest speakers, and participating in alumni associations and networks. Mentoring continued to generate the highest levels of volunteer engagement, with 3223 mentees connecting with 2847 alumni mentors for career support. The University is committed to ensuring that academic freedom and freedom of expression is respected and celebrated. As part of this commitment, the University's first-year Discovery subjects include a module designed to equip all students with awareness of the rights and obligations associated with freedom of speech in the classroom and within the University community. (See also page 48) The University of Melbourne community is proud to stand together in building and promoting an inclusive culture where diversity of LGBTQIA+ staff and students is affirmed and celebrated. Image: University of Melbourne Imagebank40 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Working to eliminate sexual misconduct The University of Melbourne is committed to eliminating sexual misconduct in all its forms, and to strengthening a trauma-informed, victim-centred approach to the management of incidents as they arise. Giving effect to this commitment has been the focus of a major program of work commenced in 2021, which will continue to receive high priority in 2022. This included development of the new Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Policy, applying to the whole University community and enshrining principles which inform the University's approach to these matters. The policy also consolidates advice for staff and students, and clarifies and strengthens incident reporting and management processes. The University also improved complaint processes to provide greater agency and support for victims of sexual misconduct and to ensure fair, efficient and consistent investigation and decision making. Further, the University increased capability and capacity across the Safer Community Program and Human Resources teams to support these changes. It has also committed to transparent reporting to its community, which will commence in 2022.Changes of this nature require the full commitment of leadership. The University rolled out a leadership development program in a one-and-a-half day workshop to all of its senior leaders in 2021. This will be adapted for delivery to all staff in 2022. A total of 475 staff - including University Executive, senior leaders and members of the Professoriate - completed this program. An email campaign to staff and students was also delivered, encouraging and empowering bystanders to take action if they witness any form of sexual harassment. The University will continue to prioritise work on this issue through its primary prevention framework. This is an evidence-based, best practice approach to preventing, intervening early, and mapping interventions delivered at an individual, group, and whole-of-institution level. The University's overarching and ongoing approach to elimination of sexual misconduct, harassment and assault is led by the new Respect at Melbourne Committee chaired by the Provost, Professor Nicola Phillips. This committee builds on the work of the Respect Taskforce, which developed the University's first Respect Action Plan in 2017 and includes membership from across the University community. The University of Melbourne is committed to eliminating sexual misconduct and improving support to victim-survivors. In a second year of restricted access to campus, the University concentrated efforts on developing its Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response Policy, making clear that sexual misconduct and sexual harassment has no place at the University. Image: suppliedCOMMUNITY 41The University takes seriously its responsibility to sponsor and support public debate and share knowledge and expertise for the public good. In 2021, University of Melbourne researchers played a leading role contributing to public debate by communicating research expertise and key insights through public events, media appearances and engaging with stakeholders across government, industry and the community. On Pursuit , the University's online digest of research and commentary by leading University of Melbourne experts, readership totalled more than 3.3 million sessions, with over half coming from international audiences. Across all media in 2021, the University received 184,877 media mentions with the potential to reach over 1.8 billion people. The University of Melbourne Newsroom website registered over 91,000 page views alone. Through this public engagement, University researchers led the charge in responding to the pandemic and in addressing its multiple challenges. In work led by Professor Anthony Scott, the Melbourne Institute tracked COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across Australia using Taking the Pulse of the Nation data to gauge the effect of the Victorian outbreak on vaccination willingness and to explore ways to increase vaccine uptake. (See also page 15) The Federal Government commissioned the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity to advise on Australia's National COVID-19 Response. Led by the Doherty Institute's Director of Epidemiology Professor Jodie McVernon and mathematical biologist Professor James McCaw, a consortium from 12 Australian institutes and universities provided modelling to inform the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response , and to support implementation of the plan. (See also page 13)University researchers provided important insights for governments considering education policies for children returning to school following long periods of disrupted learning due to bushfires and pandemic restrictions. In November, University of Melbourne researchers hosted a roundtable with policymakers from State and Federal Governments to share expertise from decade-long studies into how communities and students recover from traumatic events such as natural disasters. This engagement was led by disaster resilience expert Professor Lisa Gibbs from the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, in collaboration with Jane Nursey from Phoenix Australia, the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, and Emeritus Professor Helen Cahill and Professor Jim Watterston from the Melbourne Graduate School of Education. The roundtable addressed concerns many Australians were expressing about the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns and interruptions to schooling on the mental health of young people and recommended strategies for educators to support students' return to the classroom. Further engagement opportunities and meetings are scheduled for 2022. The University also continued to make formal submissions to government in 2021 to inform policy making across a range of issues including higher education funding and policy settings, foreign interference, research commercialisation, critical infrastructure and cybersecurity. Leveraging its government relationships and partnerships, the University advocated for the higher education sector and contributed to the recovery of the city, state and nation from the COVID-19 pandemic. Vice-Chancellor Professor Duncan Maskell chaired the Victorian Vice-Chancellor's Committee for a second year, was a Board member of the Group of Eight and Universities Australia, and represented the sector, alongside other industries impacted by the pandemic, as a member of the Victorian Government's Economic Restart and Recovery Steering Committee. 33% of offers to domestic undergraduate students were made through Access Melbourne, the University's special entry and scholarship scheme . 285 Indigenous graduate enrolments. 251 Indigenous undergraduate enrolments. 139 Indigenous staff. 3700 alumni volunteered their time and expertise to support the University.TRACKING PERFORMANCE42 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Helping build vaccine confidence and stopping the spread of misinformation With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing throughout 2021 and with variants of the virus posing new challenges here and across the world, the University of Melbourne marshalled its expertise to combat vaccine hesitancy and help achieve the vaccination targets needed to keep communities safe and to avoid the need for further large-scale lockdowns. Introducing VaxFACTS. As cases of COVID-19 continued to grow throughout 2021 and with Australians in the most populous states of Victoria and New South Wales enduring lengthy lockdowns, the need to reach vaccine targets was critical. Wanting to make a meaningful contribution to address common questions and widely shared misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, the University created the VaxFACTS website, drawing on its research and communications expertise to provide straightforward answers to frequently expressed community fears. The VaxFACTS website features clear, easy-to-understand videos using an evidence-based approach to provide an independent trusted source of information for those unsure about receiving a vaccine. The public face of VaxFACTS is world leader in vaccine uptake research, Associate Professor Margie Danchin, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children's Hospital and Clinician Scientist and Group Leader of Vaccine uptake at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Associate Professor Danchin believes that providing clear and transparent information about the risks and benefits of vaccination is crucial in building confidence and encouraging vaccine uptake. \"Vaccination is one of the most important tools we have to move towards a more normal way of life, \" said Associate Professor Danchin. \"Our research this year has found that people are seeking their COVID-19 vaccine information from trusted medical professionals, scientists and researchers. \" The University uses VaxFACTS to engage with different groups of people to negate the spread of misinformation and reinforce the safety of available COVID-19 vaccines. In the process it is hoped that the evidence-based information provided will help Melbourne and Victoria return to thriving and dynamic communities. The intention was to create a resource that could be easily accessed and shared by multiple audiences including governments, business and the community, as well as individual members of the public. As a first step in promoting the program, in September the University shared VaxFACTS with federal and state members of parliament, and with several government departments. This included the Victorian Department of Health co-branding and sharing the content on its social media channels and with public health services. More broadly, community and business organisations shared the resource through their websites, online channels and internal publications and presentations. This included Coles, Virgin Australia Airlines, City of Melbourne, Australian Football League, Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, Victorian Department of Health, and the Victorian Vaccine Ambassadors including Merri Health and Victorian Council of Social Services. Following the launch, mainstream media coverage and University social channels reached a combined potential audience of around one million people. Videos addressing new concerns have continued to be added to the site, ensuring advice is timely and relevant to emerging questions during the ongoing pandemic. In line with public health recommendations, the University made vaccination a requirement for attending campus to minimise the risk of COVID-19 within its own community. Such activities placed VaxFACTS content directly in the hands of target audiences, resulting in feedback on social media from vaccine-hesitant individuals who booked COVID-19 vaccination appointments after visiting the website or seeing Associate Professor Danchin promoting VaxFACTS in media. \"Enhancing knowledge and sharing expertise for public good is core to the mission of the University, \" said Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor James McCluskey. \"We have always used science and data, backed by rigorous standards and practices, to solve complex challenges. \"Today, the value of this research expertise and reach is crucial, and VaxFACTS is an example of how effective this contribution is in addressing what is an unprecedented test for our generation. \" 42 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 43 Associate Professor Margie Danchin As host of VaxFACTS, Associate Professor Margie Danchin is widely recognised, not only by government and business leaders, but by the general public. This included a vaccine-hesitant 79-year-old who got her first AstraZeneca vaccination the day she was sent the VaxFACTS videos, and another who reported booking in for the vaccine after being reassured by VaxFACTS.

The University introduced new and expanded scholarship programs, making it easier for talented students from diverse backgrounds to start or complete their education at the University of Melbourne. The University expanded the Access Melbourne program to support more domestic students from diverse and disadvantaged backgrounds.Highlights The University expanded its wellbeing services to support students during the pandemic, including the launch of a new offshore counselling service providing access to individual counselling to support students outside Australia. The construction of the New Student Precinct development continued and once complete, it will have a transformative impact on the Parkville campus experience for students. The Student Pavilion is set to open in early 2022 with the full precinct expected to launch in early 2023. EDUCATION 47The University of Melbourne puts students at the heart of everything it does, and in 2021 continued its efforts to deliver an outstanding education and student experience both in Australia and internationally. Responding quickly and thoughtfully to the continuing impact of pandemic restrictions on students, the University harnessed digital technologies to introduce novel forms of teaching and learning, and expanded its scholarship programs and counselling services. In recognition of the many challenges facing students around the world, and based on student feedback, the University significantly expanded its suite of new and existing scholarship and support programs in 2021. The University's Access Melbourne program is a special entry scheme that forms the cornerstone of its equity and access commitment and helps attract capable and committed students from diverse backgrounds and supports them to fulfil their potential. In 2021 the University expanded Access Melbourne to support more students from a broader range of backgrounds than ever before, and in 2022 its selection criteria will again be revised to look beyond the ATAR in assessing the ability and potential of prospective University of Melbourne students.

Image: Gregory Lorenzutti 48 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 The University extended the Melbourne Graduate Scholarships program in 2021 to support the graduate study of current University of Melbourne undergraduate students as well as students coming from other Australian universities. These one-off $5000 scholar ships are available to Australian and international students who wish to continue on to graduate study. The University also made additional scholarships available to high-achieving international students, with merit-based scholarships starting at $10,000 per student at both undergraduate and graduate coursework level. As part of its commitment to delivering an exceptional student experience and supporting students overseas, in 2021 the University established new purpose-designed study hubs in China in Shenzhen and Nanjing. The new study hubs provide students with modern spaces to study, the opportunity to collaborate with other University of Melbourne students and a dedicated space to attend events with alumni. The study hubs provide students with local access to University information, support services and wellbeing programs. (See also pages 10, 56-57, 72, 74, 76) The University strongly encouraged students to prioritise their health and wellbeing throughout the year, launching a new offshore counselling service and conducting broad engagement with staff and students to support development of a new Student Wellbeing and Mental Health Framework (due to be implemented in 2022). The University provided enhanced student connection through the extension of its Student Life program. In addition to Melbourne Commencement Ceremonies, which welcome undergraduate students to the community, in 2021 the University also held a new online welcome for graduate students. The Academic Advising program provided important personalised advice throughout 2021 and helped students to feel connected with the University. The program facilitated one-on-one meetings between individual students and advisers and continued to welcome new students in group sessions. The Melbourne Peer Mentor Program was critical in connecting students with each other in 2021, as shown by increased meeting attendance, groups gaining momentum faster and strong positive feedback.The University's first Discovery subject was launched during Semester 1 for first-year Bachelor of Biomedicine undergraduates to capture and generate students' excitement about their degree, as well as support them to explore their discipline and build key skills. Discovery subjects provide first-year students with the opportunity to explore and research big ideas and real-world problems within their discipline area. They also help students develop the key skills to succeed in their degree, establishing the standards and expectations of the University. This subject proved popular in 2021 and paved the way for rollout of additional Discovery subjects across all undergraduate degrees in 2022. In line with the University's commitment to academic freedom, all Discovery subjects include a module introducing students to the concepts, rights and obligations associated with freedom of speech in the classroom and within the University community. (See also page 39) In 2021 the University delivered the first five Next Generation Capstone subjects, bringing together the conceptual strands of students' study programs to help final-year students master their discipline and prepare for further study, research and the workforce. Capstone subjects vary, and can include work placements, research projects, project-based learning or a coursework subject outlining business best practice. The new Next Generation Capstone subjects enhance the curriculum and function as a bridge between undergraduate study and future career or graduate study pathways. A further nine Next Generation capstones will be delivered in 2022, with further subjects in the pipeline for 2023 and 2024. The Flexible Academic Programming (FlexAP) initiative continued to drive design and delivery of the highest-quality teaching, learning and assessment, and further enhance student experiences of the University's distinctive Melbourne curriculum. In 2021, FlexAP contributed major curriculum enhancements to 37 large subjects, providing students with active, interactive and engaging learning environments. Innovative approaches to assessment were also adopted in the delivery of 80 assessment enhancement projects. Improvements to online and blended learning environments continued, with over 100 projects providing flexibility and choice for students through greater teaching and learning delivery options. The University also continued to create additional inquiry-based learning experiences for students and provide further opportunities for authentic and experiential learning through placements and projects. EDUCATION 49Continuing to introduce technological innovations in a period of rapid transformation, the University delivered further enhancements to its virtual learning environment in 2021, following successful implementation of the Canvas Learning Management System across 2019 and 2020. Canvas provides a central point for students to access teaching, learning and assessment ma terial, and is a stepping-off point to a range of integrated digital applications that allow students to engage deeply with course materials and enhance interaction with peers, tutors and lecturers. The University has committed ongoing funding to sustain teaching and learning technologies that will provide a rich complement to face-to-face learning, supporting flexible conversations and collaboration between timetabled classes, and enabling the University to adapt quickly in changing environments. The University of Melbourne's Dookie campus in regional Victoria has played a key role in the development of agriculture and agricultural teaching and learning in Australia since 1886 and remains a focal point for key research, teaching and technology development, helping to shape the future of agriculture in Australia. Image: Adrian Vittorio50 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 New opportunities for lifelong learning The Melbourne MicroCerts program grew in 2021, offering over 70 industry-aligned courses to professionals wanting to upskill by equipping them with in-demand knowledge and expertise. The program is supported by the Melbourne School of Professional and Continuing Education (MSPACE) and is increasingly being recognised by employers for the role they play in supporting workforce development and enhanced capability. More than two dozen employers have partnered with the University to either formally endorse or co-design Melbourne MicroCerts, with many others supporting their employees to take up the courses on offer. The University prioritised improvements to the students' digital experience, developing new activities in 2021 to enhance the Student Portal (my.unimelb). This centralised hub allows students to easily locate all they need, including targeted and personalised information, services, wellbeing support and co-curricular experiences. The ePortfolio tool, PebblePad, was also introduced in 2021. This platform allows students to develop digital portfolios of academic work and their extra-curriculum experiences, enabling them to gather evidence and reflect on their learning, achievements and skills. In March 2021, the University received findings from the annual Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching (QIL T) Student Experience Survey for the preceding year. Compared to 2019, results showed a drop in student satisfaction in 2020. The quality of entire educational experience among undergraduates was rated 77.6 in 2019 and 52.3 in 2020. Among postgraduates it was rated 77.5 in 2019 and 58.1 in 2020. The University acknowledges that 2020 was an unprecedented year for the entire higher education sector, with many students unable to attend campus and needing to undertake their studies online, and that this was exacerbated for those students who experienced extended periods of lockdown. However, notwithstanding these external factors at play in 2020, the University took these results seriously and re-affirmed its commitment to improving the student experience as one of its most pressing priorities. It used the findings identified in the report to inform new initiatives and to guide further improvements to existing programs and processes. This included creating more interactive and engaging online learning experiences, and improving the use of core technologies to support student learning. In addition, the University conducted regular student surveys to obtain more frequent and timely feedback to inform further improvements throughout the year. EDUCATION 51 Teaching and Learning Major curriculum enhancements to 37 large subjects. 80 assessment reform projects. 103 online and blended learning environment improvement projects converted 150+ subjects to wholly online delivery. Bachelors of Arts, Science and Commerce: most popular undergraduate courses in Victoria.

More than 1650 international students engaged with Melbourne Employability Accelerator program. 1590 students attended 14 events with employers and alumni held in China.TRACKING PERFORMANCEIt was really nice to have someone to talk to about career plans in difficult times like these. I felt more part of the University community, simply by chatting with someone who was once in my position and getting some insight into their life. I enjoyed making new friends and seeing students build connections with each other that will be valuable to them for the rest of their study journey.The best part of the program was that it made me feel cared for by the University. I learned new names and faces and felt comfortable knowing who to ask and where to go if I needed access to certain information. Having my peer mentor as one of the first people I met in my university journey was really nice because she was very supportive and always willing to help. It helped me get a good first impression of the University. Brilliant, extremely useful and insightful...looking forward to maintaining a relationship with my adviser. It was like I found a mentor and a friend! My adviser is a good-spirited person who quelled some of my fears of being lost in my degree. It was a comforting experience! Insightful, great to chat with an academic to get a different perspective on my current situation and future plans.

But for Elissa Abou Eissa, the security and support she received as a Hansen Scholar made the transition to university so much easier. Originally from Damascus, Elissa Abou Eissa came to Australia in 2017 with her mother, father and younger brother after the outbreak of war in Syria. Elissa learned about the Hansen Scholarship while still in high school at St Francis Xavier College in Beaconsfield. Elissa had also been nominated for a Kwong Lee Dow Scholarship, the University of Melbourne's academic enrichment program giving high-achieving Victorian Year 11 and Year 12 students the opportunity to experience university life, and get a head start on their future tertiary studies. So even before starting a Bachelor of Biomedicine at Melbourne in 2020, Elissa was familiar with the Parkville campus and knew she wanted to continue her studies there. The Hansen Scholarship Program is awarded to talented undergraduate students whose financial circumstances present a challenge to accessing a first-class education. Each year 20 exceptional students are chosen based on their academic success, resilience to adversity, and a demonstrated commitment to helping and leading others. Being chosen as one of the 20 Hansen Scholars in 2020 from over 500 applicants is something Elissa is very proud of and grateful for. \"Becoming a Hansen Scholar has meant a lot to me, \" said Elissa. \"It's helped so much in dealing with the challeng es I've faced. \"It's given me the opportunity to have invaluable mentoring and social connections and be a part of a group of future leaders and enthusiasts. \"It has eased the financial stress allowing me to focus on my studies. \"The Hansen Scholarship offers residence at Little Hall during an undergraduate degree, an allowance of $4000 per year for general living expenses, and a further grant of up to $4000 to support programs such as international exchange, access to pastoral care and development programs. It also provides tailored mentoring and connections to leaders in the students' chosen fields, and priority access to graduate accommodation at Little Hall should they undertake graduate studies at the University.Hansen Scholars come from the inner city, the outer suburbs, regional towns and farming communities across Australia, but share a drive to succeed and have achieved academic success in the face of adversity. \"Pursuing a career in medicine has always been what I wanted to do in life, \" Elissa said. \"I've always been fascinated by the human body, how it functions and how it fights disease. \"Seeing people who'd been so badly affected, both physically and mentally, from trauma in Syria has impacted the way I view my place in the world. I believe that the advances we make in medicine today can improve the lives of those that have been changed by war and other traumatic events. \" Even with a single-minded determination and strong will, it hasn't always been plain sailing for Elissa and she admits that the past two years have been difficult. \"I faced so many challenges presented by the pandemic, \" she said. \"As a student whose first language is not English, studying online for the past two years presented additional challenges that might not have been the case for native speakers. \" \"But as I have learnt through many challenges I've experienced, life is not about what happens to us, but rather about how we react to what happens to us. I keep pushing and I have been doing better and better at University every semester. It proves that hard work pays off eventually. \" Benefactors and program patrons Jane Hansen AO and Paul Little AO believe that an individual's life trajectory should be guided by their determination to achieve their ambitions, regardless of any limiting social or economic barriers. \"The vision of the Hansen Little Foundation has been to create a scholarship program that gives more opportunities to young Australians to pursue their dreams and reimagine their futures through access to university, \" said Ms Hansen, who is also Deputy Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. \"I look forward to watching the progress made by these extraordinary young scholars as they embrace new possibilities, and to continuing to support them during this formative stage of their lives. \" 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 55 Elissa Abou Eissa After coming to Australia from Syria, Elissa Eissa was one of 20 talented students awarded a Hansen Scholarship to study at the University of Melbourne and live on campus at Little Hall.

The University of Melbourne's commitment to delivering an exceptional student experience extends beyond Australian shores and its campuses in Melbourne and regional Victoria. Wanting to recreate some of what the on-campus experience has to offer for those undertaking their studies overseas, the University established two specially designed study hubs in China in 2021. Located in Shenzhen and Nanjing, the new University of Melbourne Study Hubs provide a welcoming environment where students can come together to study and connect socially with other students, and with local staff and alumni. Importantly, students can access University support services, advice and wellbeing resources at the hubs. The Shenzhen Study Hub opened at the end of October and proved popular with China-based University of Melbourne students. Located in the Nanshan district, it offers quiet, dedicated study areas alongside group meeting rooms and a lounge space for taking breaks and connecting with other students. The Nanjing Study Hub, open to students since early November, is located on the 11th floor of a modern building in Jianye, a vibrant growing district in the city centre. Like the Shenzhen Study Hub, it is equipped with study areas, meeting rooms and lounge facilities. The University of Melbourne Study Hubs in China were designed to complement the Study Melbourne Hubs - similar spaces established by the Victorian Government, open to students from all Victorian universities, and currently operating in Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City, and virtually in India. Feedback has been wholly positive. For students like Zhuojun (Jasmine) Jiang, the University of Melbourne Study Hubs have provided exactly what the University hoped: a sense of community and connection and somewhere she can meet her peers and University staff, all of whom are University of Melbourne graduates themselves. Jasmine is studying the Master of Teaching (Early Childhood) and in 2021 completed her first year remotely using Zoom. \"To be honest, Unimelb was always my target since I graduated with a bachelors degree in China, \" said Jasmine. \"And I do love the city of Melbourne, it's a liveable city full of literary characteristics and human kindness.\"But unfortunately, I haven't been able to study on campus in Melbourne during the COVID-19 period. \" Soon after hearing about the study hubs on the University of Melbourne WeChat channel, Jasmine took the 40-minute metro ride from where she lives to the study hub, along the way enjoying the paulownia trees that fill and shade the avenues of Nanjing in summer and spread their golden leaves in autumn. \"I found the centre to be a great place to study and socialise, \" said Jasmine. \"It has great facilities, a very quiet and comfortable study environment, and provides free coffee and tea. \"So far I've attended the study hub for three events, the first social event, the first alumni event and one lunch gathering event.\"I feel that the study hub provides an excellent environment for us students to study and socialise and lets us be more connected to the University. \" For Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International) Professor Michael Wesley, the University of Melbourne Study Hubs in China have fulfilled the aims they set out to achieve. \"Coming into the second year of border closures, we were acutely aware that many, if not all, of our international students studying overseas would be feeling disconnected, academically and socially, from their studies and their University community here in Melbourne, \" said Professor Wesley. \"We're very happy that the study hubs we designed and established in Shenzhen and Nanjing have been appreciated by our students who have been unable to travel to Australia. \"We're pleased that we've been able to give our students studying overseas a continued sense of connection, and support greater links between our student and alumni community currently based in China. \" 56 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 57 Zhuojun (Jasmine) Jiang Master of Teaching in Early Childhood student Jasmine Jiang is currently based in China, and has found a sense of community and connection at the University of Melbourne's new study hub in her home town of Nanjing.

Melbourne Law School's Professor Sundhya Pahuja received the prestigious Kathleen Fitzpatrick Australian Laureate Fellowship to examine the challenge to democracy posed by global corporations, investigate the way international law has contributed to the growing power of corporations on the world stage, and what can be done to redress the balance between large corporations and nation states. Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Fellowships recognise the profound contributions of researchers from the humanities, arts and social science disciplines, and to their role in advancing women in research. Working with industry, government and not-for-profit organisations in Australia and internationally, the University's five Melbourne Interdisciplinary Research Institutes promote research linkages and collaboration, as well as playing a leading role in articulating research outcomes to external audiences. The Indigenous Knowledge Institute, the Melbourne Disability Institute, the Melbourne Energy Institute, the Melbourne Social Equity Institute and the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute continued to foster a culture of cross-disciplinary collaboration throughout 2021. In 2021, the Melbourne Social Equity Institute launched the African Research and Engagement in Australia Initiative (AREiA), a new collaboration between the University and key partners in the African Australian community. Facilitating collaborative research to address existing gaps in knowledge, AREiA will provide an interdisciplinary, community-driven and solutions-based approach to the health, cultural, social, economic and political wellbeing of African Australian communities. The Melbourne Energy Institute, together with AusNet Services, Mondo, and the Australian Energy Market Operator, launched Project EDGE, a world-first initiative that brings together relevant stakeholders across the entire electricity value and supply chain. Project EDGE will undertake crucial work to increase understanding of the complexity, interactions and challenges the electricity sector faces globally as it continues to accommodate widespread adoption of distributed energy resources. The project will also inform future electricity market design. The University also launched Melbourne Climate Futures during the year, an initiative bringing together diverse expertise to respond to the challenges of climate change. (See also pages 78-79)Appreciating the significant potential of scholarly research to not only inform and enhance knowledge but to shape society, culture, health and the environment, the University supports its academics to translate their research in multiple ways. This includes contributing to public debate to inform and improve economic, social and public policy, and engaging in the commercialisation of research to positively impact the community. In 2021, Dr Hannah McCann, an early career researcher in the Faculty of Arts, commenced work on the Beyond Skin Deep project to investigate the role that salon workers play in the emotional lives of their clients. The project also looks at how salon workers are in a unique position to help address important social issues such as family violence, mental health, and social isolation. Supported by an Australian Research Discovery Early Career Researcher Grant, Dr McCann worked with HaiR-3Rs, a project of the Eastern Domestic Violence Service in Melbourne, to publish a guide highlighting key lessons for training salon workers on family violence. The 10th annual update on the Roadmap to Close the Gap for Vision showed that significant progress continues to be made in improving eye care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Undertaken by the University of Melbourne's Indigenous Eye Health Unit led by Professor Hugh R Taylor from the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, the report found that, to date, 64 regional stakeholder groups and seven groups at a jurisdictional level were established. Eye examinations increased from 81,713 in 2013-2014 to 104,300 in 2019-2020. Anthropologist and geographer, and University of Melbourne Associate Provost Professor Marcia Langton, is leading a project of researchers and associate investigators from Indigenous corporations and other institutions to improve understandings of and responses to alcohol-related family violence for Aboriginal people. The project, supported by an NHMRC Ideas Grant of $1.3 million over five years, is investigating the associations between alcohol and family violence in urban, regional and remote contexts. The project will use a co-design approach to develop innovative ways to combine participatory anthropological methods with network analytical techniques to address the gravity and complexity of the problem.DISCOVERY 63 Safeguarding the future The Australian Institute for Infectious Disease (AIID) is a new initiative supported by the Victorian Government to enhance research, public health, educational and translational capability in infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and other major global health issues.

Building Better Homes: introducing minimum accessibility standards for housing The Melbourne Disability Institute (MDI) is working in close partnership with the Summer Foundation to secure the inclusion of minimum accessibility standards for all new housing in the National Construction Code. Predicting the very real risk that the benefits of mandatory standards had been underestimated and that the voices of people with disability and their families would not be heard, MDI engaged researchers and economists to advise on the impact of including minimum standards in the codes and conduct surveys of people with disability and their families. Together with the Summer Foundation, MDI also established the Building Better Homes campaign to advocate for the inclusion of minimum standards. As a result of this research and continued advocacy, in April 2021 Building Ministers from across Australia formally committed to the inclusion of mandatory minimum standards in the National Construction Code. This will lead to major improvements in the quality of life for Australians living with disability and facilitate older Australians being supported to age in place. Building Better Homes is continuing to work to ensure all states implement the new code. Also located in Melbourne Connect is the Telstra Creator Space, an accessible fabrication lab where University of Melbourne students learn to use industry-grade equipment to design, build and prototype innovative solutions. The University's partnership with Telstra fosters a shared ambition for technology innovation through workforce development and research collaboration. In 2021, the partnership supported four short-term research projects with PhD students, delivered 17 successful masters student projects with Telstra and awarded five Telstra Technology and Innovation Scholarships to female and/or Indigenous students across graduate and undergraduate levels. (See also pages 25-26, 29, 67, 104) The University continued to nurture its early and mid-career researchers, ensuring a strong cohort now and into the future, with a particular focus on equity and gender. In 2021, the University established the Researcher Development Unit (RDU) to support coordination, delivery and evaluation of programs across all career stages and levels, including early career.

Estimated from 2021 results, confirmation from Higher Education Research Data Collection (HERDC) due June 2022TRACKING PERFORMANCEUsing genomics to combat intractable diseases Recent advancements in genomic technologies have the potential to transform how healthcare can be delivered, promising better patient outcomes and a more efficient health system. They may even help cure cancer. In late 2020, the University of Melbourne partnered with the Victorian Government and global genomics technology company Illumina to establish the new Illumina-University of Melbourne Genomics Hub (since renamed the Advanced Genomics Collaboration). The partnership was supported with a $20 million allocation from the Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund and brought together researchers and industry expertise. The hub is based in the Melbourne Biomedical Precinct, providing the critical mass of co-located research labs, genomics platforms and hospitals needed to pioneer personalised medicine. Personalised medicine helps doctors choose the best treatment for individual patients. It relies on rapid gene sequencing to compile a complete set of genetic information that determines a person's physical makeup, including their susceptibility to some diseases and their response to treatment. \"Our application of genomics is transforming healthcare and research, \" said clinical genomics lead and Director of the University of Melbourne Centre for Cancer Research, Professor Sean Grimmond. \"It's providing systems to support access to whole-genome sequencing for cancer and critical disease patients and the investment needed to secure Victoria's place as a world leader in genomics and cancer research. \" Focusing on genomics-based biomedical research and innovation in the detection and management of diseases such as cancer, the Illumina-University of Melbourne Genomics Hub has established three core platforms in clinical genomics, bioinformatics, and health economics to foster a pipeline of commercially focused genomic innovation projects. \"Access to Illumina's expertise will provide the guidance our researchers need to unlock Victoria's genomics research for global biotechnology development opportunities, through real-world, practical hands-on training and sequencing experience, \" Professor Grimmond said. In 2021, two flagship research projects commenced, led by researchers from the University of Melbourne's Centre for Cancer Research, and the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Led by Professor Grimmond, researchers at the Centre for Cancer Research are developing new genomic tools to improve cancer diagnosis and monitoring by testing whether rapid sequencing of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood can be used to detect and track cancer. \"We've established the methods, collected and sequenced 108 samples from non-invasive liquid biopsies (blood samples) for cancer detection, established a 24-hour turnaround time for analytics, and will be rolling them out for clinical testing in 2022, \" Professor Grimmond said. The research team led by Professor Sammy Bedoui from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity is creating a novel platform, ID Predict, to understand the varied types of disease progression of patients with COVID-19. ID Predict researchers, working with colleagues from WEHI, are looking to understand why people respond differently to SARS-CoV2 and other viruses, and using genomics to study how people with COVID-19 respond to infection and treatment. It is hoped that, together, the Cancer Liquid Biopsy and ID Predict projects will help to identify individualised and efficacious treatments for patients. \"Throughout 2021, we have sequenced over 600 cancer patients, \" said Professor Grimmond, \"and provided clinical genomic information to inform treatment for hundreds of patients and several large cancer patient research cohorts. \" University of Melbourne Vice-Chancellor Professor Duncan Maskell believes that the Illumina-University of Melbourne Genomics Hub will accelerate the translation and commercialisation of biomedical research. \"Our partnership with Illumina is bridging the gap between the genomics industry and research, driving workforce development, research translation and the implementation of genomics into routine clinical care, \" Professor Maskell said. \"The Cancer Liquid Biopsy and ID Predict projects enable rapid translation of research to act quickly and effectively on threats such as cancer and infectious disease. \" 68 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Professor Sean Grimmond Led by Professor Grimmond, researchers at the Centre for Cancer Research are developing new genomic tools to improve cancer diagnosis and monitoring by testing whether rapid sequencing of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood can be used to detect and track cancer.

In December, Martine Letts was appointed Chief Executive Officer at Asialink, a joint initiative established with the Australian Government's Commission for the Future and the Myer Foundation as a prominent centre for creative engagement in Asia. Melbourne School of Design sent a heartfelt message to its international students unable to attend campus due to border closures in 2021. Image: supplied74 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Acknowledging the local and global significance of the Australia-India relationship, the University took part in the India-Australia: Our Shared Future virtual forum in November in collaboration with the Victorian Government's Study Melbourne India Hub. Over 100 participants from the University joined leading experts from across India and Australia to investigate the role universities will play in the rapidly evolving futures of Australia and India. The University also engaged with partners in China, participating in a Sustainable Cities joint dialogue with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The University strengthened its strategic engagement across China, India and Indonesia through the establishment of seed grants to advance projects across academia, government and business, and with cultural and community organisations. Academics from the School of Culture and Communications will engage current Chinese graduates from Art History, Art Curatorship and Arts and Cultural Management programs to expand connection with their University cohort and provide opportunities for international networking. Associate Professor Kate MacNeill from the Faculty of Arts is establishing a forum to connect students in India and Australia to discuss the role of young women and leadership across health, technology, education and sustainability. And a clinical research mentoring program established by Dr Anita Horvath and Dr Nilakshi Waidyatillake from the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences will build research capacity in Indonesia and establish new research engagements transnationally. China-based students, including (left to right) Kandi Li and Jenny Ruan (Bachelor of Arts) and Steven Xu (Bachelor of Science), have provided positive feedback on the new study hub in Nanjing, and how the new modern facilities have helped them feel connected to the University while studying offshore. Image: suppliedGLOBAL 75The University's relationship with Japan as a global leader in research and innovation grew in 2021, with a virtual delegation held in October to help develop long-lasting institutional research partnerships. Led by Deputy Vice- Chancellor (Research) Professor Jim McCluskey and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Graduate and International Research) Professor Justin Zobel, the delegation met over four days to discuss partnership opportunities with a number of Japanese institutes. Collectively, the delegation committed to supporting interdisciplinary research and fostering pathways for graduate and early career researchers across Australia and Japan.In July, the University's Nossal Institute for Global Health announced its partnership with Fiji National University to jointly evaluate UNICEF's Pacific Health and Nutrition Program. The Nossal Institute, led by the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, works to strengthen the quality, affordability and inclusiveness of health systems across Asia and the Pacific. Findings from its evaluation of the UNICEF Pacific Health and Nutrition Program will inform the next Pacific Multi-Country Program to improve quality of care in the Pacific. Melbourne scholars making a mark In 2021, Dr Marlon Perera and Professor Andrew Walter and were named as University of Melbourne Fulbright Scholars. The Fulbright Scholarship Program supports Australian researchers to study in the United States and provides unique opportunities for Australians to build long-term research collaboration and linkages internationally. Dr Perera is a urological surgeon whose research investigates imaging technologies in the treatment of prostate cancer. He will visit Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Professor Walter from the School of Social and Political Sciences in the Faculty of Arts at American University in Washington DC where he explored foreign investment policy in the United States.Professor Adrian Little, Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), believes that the Fulbright scheme provides an outstanding opportunity for scholars at the University of Melbourne to showcase their knowledge on the international stage. \"It also enables the University to bring outstanding scholars to Melbourne, \" said Professor Little, \"thereby enriching the campus environment and contributing to building the community of Fulbright Scholars around the world. \" Five scholars from the United States have also been awarded Fulbright Scholarships and will be hosted at the University of Melbourne in 2022, pending travel restrictions. Urological surgeon Dr Marlon Perera (right) and Professor Andrew Walter were named as University of Melbourne Fulbright Scholars for 2021. Image: supplied76 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Despite ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University remained committed to strengthening its connections with the global community, and in 2021 launched a number of new initiatives to foster relationships with scholars, partners and alumni. The University established dedicated study hubs in China in Nanjing and Shenzhen to provide University of Melbourne students living in these cities with a vibrant and supportive environment to study, socialise and maintain their sense of connection to Melbourne. The University also offered its services to the Victorian Government's Study Melbourne Hubs in Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai, and virtually in India. (See pages 10, 48, 56-57, 72, 74) The University also offered undergraduate students based in China the opportunity to study in-person at the University of Nottingham Ningbo Campus (UNNC) in Semester 2. These places were offered in UNNC faculties of Business, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Science and Engineering on an exchange-basis. More than 40 students took up this opportunity, enjoying an on-campus experience at Ningbo while studying coursework subjects across both institutions. The University found other innovative ways to connect students to campus and celebrate their achievements. For example, the Melbourne School of Design's MSD Illuminated series turned the exterior of its Glyn Davis Building into a temporary digital canvas, projecting works by international students from the Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning. While most international borders remained closed, the University showcased its commitment to fostering global learning opportunities wherever possible, with student exchanges to New Zealand recommencing in Semester 2. The Trans-Tasman Bubble enabled students to undertake placements at the University of Auckland and the University of Otago, with more places made available for up to 150 students. As part of its commitment to ensuring that curriculum is informed by a global range of perspectives, in 2021 the University established eight new international partnerships. This included forging new university- level student exchange agreements with Aalto University in Finland, KU Leuven in Belgium, and the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the United States.

The agreement will provide additional international opportunities for research collaborators and graduate researchers, making it possible for doctoral candidates to conduct a joint PhD with supervisors from one of the four BUA institutions and the University of Melbourne. The first funding round under this agreement will support up to 12 joint PhD projects in global health next year. The Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati also signed joint PhD agreements with the University, becoming the latest partners in, and offering co-funding for joint PhD candidates enrolled through, the Melbourne-India Postgraduate Academy. The University formalised a global research alliance with the University of Toronto, and a trilateral alliance with Toronto and the University of Manchester, creating additional opportunities for collaboration including student exchanges, cross-institutional research, and partnership development. The trilateral alliance will provide global classroom programs to enable students to interact with world-leading teachers and researchers on three continents via lectures, seminars and practical classes.The University also signed a milestone agreement to establish the Partnership in Research Indonesia and Melbourne program. Together with the Indonesian Government and Indonesia's leading universities, the initiative facilitates research and academic cooperation across health, science, engineering, social sciences and health sciences, addressing some of the major global challenges including in primary care, health systems, infectious disease and adolescent health. In November, eight students were selected to represent the University as New Colombo Plan Scholars at institutions across the Indo-Pacific, representing the largest cohort of students chosen from the University of Melbourne since the initiative was launched in 2014. The New Colombo Plan Scholarship Program is a Federal Government funding scheme providing opportunities for Australian undergraduate students to undertake semester-based study and internships or mentorships in 40 participating Indo-Pacific locations. This highly competitive program awards approximately 120 scholarships each year to students from universities around Australia, aiming to strengthen Australia's connections with the region. In line with the University's Reconciliation Action Plan, Professor Adrian Little, Pro Vice-Chancellor (International) led formation of an Indigenous Knowledge Network in the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU). Planning focused on the first face-to-face meeting of the network. This will take place in Chiapas, Mexico in 2022 with representatives from 10 APRU member universities from Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Hawaii, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand/Aotearoa and West Coast United States. TRACKING PERFORMANCE78 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 Taking the lead on climate action As the COP26 conference in late 2021 demonstrated, the world stands at a critical juncture for reducing greenhouse gases and limiting global warming to no more than 1.5\u00b0 C above pre-industrial temperatures. Established in 2021, Melbourne Climate Futures is a multidisciplinary research initiative at the University of Melbourne, bringing together researchers from different academic backgrounds to develop practical outcomes for the challenges ahead. The University recognises that the task of mitigating the effects of climate change over the next 'critical decade' requires accelerated action from all sectors of society and takes seriously the responsibility of using its research and networks to advocate for and lead efforts to address the climate emergency. Melbourne Climate Futures is leading the University's climate action by harnessing multidisciplinary expertise towards a goal of reaching net zero emissions articulated on a University, national and global level and maintaining a safe operating climate for the planet. Working across academic disciplines, government and community institutions and industries, Melbourne Climate Futures advocates for real climate action built on decades of research into all aspects of the global climate challenge, including the impacts of climate change in the Pacific, energy futures, bushfire resilience and sustainable cities, as well as innovative climate policy and legal approaches. Melbourne Climate Futures is led by Professor Jacqueline Peel, a world-leading expert in climate law and climate change litigation. Professor Peel is a lead author for the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Working Group III's contribution to its Sixth Assessment Report. She contributes to public and policy debate on climate and energy transition issues, including through her work with the International Law Association's Committee on Legal Principles on Climate Change and the Australian Panel of Experts in Environmental Law. Professor Peel believes that universities are critical, not only in using research to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, but also in empowering and inspiring the next generation of researchers and students to strive for more. \"Everyone needs to step up, \" said Professor Peel. \"There has never been a more important time to act on climate change. Melbourne Climate Futures was set up to take forward this mission, and with the new targets outlined at COP26, the University of Melbourne is playing its part in finding a positive solution. \"Professor Peel is supported at Melbourne Climate Futures by Deputy Director of Strategic Partnerships and Community Impact, Associate Professor Ben Neville from the Faculty of Business and Economics, and Professor Kathryn Bowen from the Melbourne School of Global and Population Health. Professor Bowen is Melbourne Climate Futures' Deputy Director of Knowledge Translation and Policy Impact, a lead author on the IPCC's Working Group II on impacts and adaptation and an Affiliate Scholar at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam. Throughout 2021, Melbourne Climate Futures worked with University researchers, business and government to guide discussions on climate action. At COP26, the group worked to extend its networks and influence, convening and showcasing opportunities to improve Australia's action on climate change. Working with the University's Sustainability team, Melbourne Climate Futures led the push to elevate the University's own climate action ambitions. In October, University Council endorsed establishment of new, more ambitious emissions targets to achieve carbon neutral by 2025 (as certified under the Federal Government's Climate Active standard) and reach climate-positive status by 2030. In November, the University joined the global Race to Zero campaign to reinforce its willingness to collaborate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to continue to advocate for stronger policies from political and business leaders. Climate change is a key strategic priority in the University's Advancing Melbourne strategy. Rose Hiscock, Director of Museums and Collections at the University, believes that Melbourne Climate Futures builds on the establishment in 2020 of the University's Cultural Strategy to bring together science, art and public advocacy, and tell stories that need to be told. \"While these two initiatives may sound disparate, \" Ms Hiscock says, \"their formation is not coincidental - they are aligned through timing, leadership and appetite for change. \"The cultural sector has earned a great deal of trust over time and combined with science, we can influence positive and long-term change. \" Vice-Chancellor Professor Duncan Maskell agrees. \"It's important that we 'walk the talk' on decarbonisation when it comes to our own operations and stand behind our researchers and students across the higher education sector, to do our part to reduce the impacts of climate change. \" 78 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 79 Professor Jacqueline Peel Director of Melbourne Climate Futures, Professor Jacqueline Peel, makes important contributions to public and policy debate on climate and energy transition issues, including through her work with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Working Group III on mitigation policy, and the Australian Panel of Experts in Environmental Law.

The University applies systems and processes that fulfil the requirements of the Victorian Government Risk Management Framework. It maintains a Risk Management Framework (the Framework) that is consistent with the Australian and New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018) and is reviewed annually. The University Risk Register is reviewed at least annually to give the University a comprehensive understanding of its risk profile. The University Risk Register clearly identifies risk owners and treatment owners who are accountable for managing risks to a satisfactory level. The annual review of the University Risk Register in 2021 involved consultations with responsible owners and stakeholders to ensure all key risks, including those resulting from COVID-19, were appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. To ensure they remain current and reflect best practice, the Framework and risk appetite are usually reviewed annually, however the 2021 review was scheduled for an external review in early 2022. The Council's Audit and Risk Committee provides oversight of risk management and compliance activities throughout the University. At a management level, risks are monitored and managed through the University Executive's Risk Management and Compliance Committee. Risk management is integrated with the University's business planning cycle to support a positive risk culture. Underpinned by the Framework and Risk Management Policy, risk management occurs at all levels - institutional, divisional, local and project; and in all areas including specialised fields across the University. The divisional risks across the University are actively monitored by management in respective divisions, discussed and analysed as part of the business planning process, and considered in the review of the University Risk Register. Where appropriate, the University also identifies any State significant projects and associated risks and works closely with the agency involved to mitigate any shared risks. Resources from Legal and Risk and Strategy, Planning and Performance are dedicated to implement continually a body of work designed to support the development of a positive risk culture, including implementation of a compliance program to help manage compliance risks and ongoing collaboration and engagement with key stakeholders for managing risks. Attestation Consistent with the Victorian Government Risk Management Framework, I, Duncan Maskell, certify that the University of Melbourne has risk management processes in place to enable the University to manage its key risk exposures. The Audit and Risk Committee verifies this assurance, and the risk profile of the University of Melbourne was reviewed within the last 12 months. 3 March 2022 98 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 HEAL TH AND SAFETY The University of Melbourne has a broad health and safety risk profile covering general workplace risks associated with infection control, and specific risks associated with: manual tasks storage handling and use of chemicals and biologicals laboratory and workshop operations travel and field work performance theatres. Supported by the Health and Safety Management Plan 2021-2025 , the Health and Safety Policy requires the University to provide a safe and healthy working and learning environment for all staff, contractors, students and visitors. The plan sets out health and safety goals against four strategic objectives. Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) The University of Melbourne's HSMS was continually reviewed in 2021. All health and safety policies, procedural principles and HSMS requirements were reviewed to meet changes to information technology systems, legislation and other legal requirements.

Change compared to previous calendar yearCOMPLIANCE 99Health and safety resources In 2021, each operating division had health and safety business partners available. Higher-risk divisions had health and safety managers, and moderate and lower-risk divisions had health and safety business partners. The University undertook a health and safety services review during the year, resulting in the successful consolidation of a further six faculty business partnering functions into the University's shared services model. Complementing the divisional business partners, specialist health and safety advisory services continued to be provided through Business Services. In addition, the University commissioned specialist health and safety advice from external consultants where required. The Public Health Network continued to support the implementation and monitoring of COVIDSafe plans throughout the University. The network comprised public health and infection control subject matter experts supported by communications, wellbeing and safety services within the University. Consultative framework Employees continued to be represented by elected employee health and safety representatives. There were 53 elected employee health and safety representatives (HSR) holding office in 2021. Each division has a consultative Health and Safety Committee with membership comprising employer and employee representatives and where applicable, student representatives. Membership of the University-wide Health and Safety Committee (HSC) comprises equal numbers of employer and employee representatives. Students are represented via student observers. The employee representatives are elected from the pool of the University's employee health and safety representatives. The HSC met four times during 2021, with minutes of the meetings published on the University's safety webpages. Engagement with HSRs was planned in accordance with the University's health and safety management plan. The descriptions of designated work groups were revised to improve the access and visibility of HSRs. Training During 2021, the University provided training to address general health and safety responsibilities and specific health and safety hazards. The health and safety training needs of each employee as well as cohorts of graduate research students and coursework students, were assessed in accordance with the University's health and safety training requirements. Over 42,080 health and safety-related training modules were undertaken in 2021, representing an increase of 27 per cent on the previous year. More than 1897 managers/supervisors completed Health and Safety Roles and Responsibilities training in 2021, representing 90 per cent of the leadership cohort.

The reduction in attendees for Health and Safety Roles and Responsibilities for 2021 compared to 2019, is primarily attributable to fewer employees scheduled to complete refresher training in 2021 compared to previous years. Overall completion rates remained consistent with previous years. 3. Training module addressing the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021. Emergency preparedness and response The University's emergency preparedness and response procedures are based on the requirements of Australian Standard (AS) 3745: Planning for Emergencies in Facilities. Throughout 2021, the University continued to maintain and update its campus-wide and local building emergency plans for occupied buildings. Bushfire response plans were also reviewed, updated and activated for the University's rural campuses at Creswick, Dookie and Shepparton. More than 60 building evacuation drills were completed and a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of each evacuation undertaken. Due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, building closures and limited occupancy of remaining buildings, the University established alternative arrangements to support emergency response. Emergency preparedness was reviewed via desktop evacuation drills and emergency readiness reminders were sent to staff remaining onsite. In late 2021, the University undertook a trial of additional competency-based training for chief and deputy chief wardens. As part of the trial, four full-day training sessions were run across the Parkville and Werribee campuses providing valuable skills, knowledge, confidence and 100 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 capability to more than 60 staff in senior warden positions. The findings from this trial, including staff feedback, have been used to inform the approach for emergency training and capability development from 2022 onwards. The University also delivered active threat and shelter-in-place training to key public-facing staff in 2021. Over 100 staff explored all aspects of readiness and response for active threat incidents requiring the activation of shelter-in-place procedures. Critical incident management The University maintains a critical incident management framework for significant and disruptive events which aligns the University's plans with the Australasian Inter-Service Incident Management System (AIIMS) used by emergency services agencies. In 2021, more than 150 staff were engaged across the University to support implementation of the Critical Incident Management plan. In 2021, the University onboarded and trained 75 new staff on its Critical Incident Management Plan. Trainees included subject matter experts in research, student services, human resources and wellbeing. Radiation and chemical management To meet the University's research and teaching needs, 24 variations to the University's radiation management licence were made in 2021. Supported by risk-based review and monitoring, the University continued an internal self-certification program for radiation laboratories, with 98 per cent of radiation laboratories completing the program in 2021. Occupational health surveillance and programs The University coordinates and implements health monitoring and vaccination programs to support the University's compliance obligations, as well as offering voluntary vaccination programs to reduce the incidence of employee illness. During 2021, over 256 health and hazard assessments were reviewed by an occupational health nurse, resulting in screening reviews with employees and students. Services were adjusted to take work and study-from-home directions into account. Occupational health surveillance - services provided or facilitated: 2019-2021 Service provided 2019 2020 2021 Influenza vaccinations 6205 7209 51524 Pathologies and biological screening 31 10 13 Q Fever vaccinations 367 117 81 4. Numbers reduced in 2021 due to the reduced presence of staff on campusWorker's compensation and injury management Throughout 2021 the University's injury management team worked with injured employees and their supervisors to develop and implement return-to-work plans for all compensable lost-time injuries. To ensure successful return-to-work outcomes, support was also provided to injured workers with non-compensable injuries and other health-related conditions. During 2021, the University established a framework to support early intervention of health and safety risk management and non-compliance, focusing on support for staff outside of workers compensation arrangements and to improve staff welfare. Self-insurance approval and workers compensation compliance Following high levels of audit conformance in prior years, WorkSafe classified the University of Melbourne in tier one for self-insurance claims management compliance. Accordingly, the University was made exempt from the annual claims audit in 2021. WorkSafe undertook a review of the University's Claims Management Decision Making during 2021. A 100 per cent conformance rate was recorded against the review criteria, with the University of Melbourne receiving a commendable result - an improvement from 2019. Regulatory activity The University continued to work cooperatively with health and safety regulators. WorkSafe was the most active health and safety regulator at the University during 2021. WorkSafe activity consisted of visits following incident notifications to WorkSafe and in response to requests to WorkSafe by others. Regulatory activity trends 2019-2021 Action 2019 2020 2021 Visits to University's workplaces by WorkSafe 14 6 8 Prohibition notices issued by WorkSafe 0 0 0 Improvement notices issued by WorkSafe 1 0 0 Health and safety convictions 0 0 0COMPLIANCE 101Health and safety incident statistics: 2019-2021 Performance indicator 2019 2020 2021 Reported incidents (including injury and illness)2255 2775 3736 Reported incident incidence rate (per 100 FTE 28.52 39.07 Days lost due to reported injuries416 431 201 Number of worker's compensation claims received 79 31 26 Number of lost time injury claims (L TI)26 13 14 L TI incidence rate (per 100 FTE employees)0.15 0.12 0.15 L TI frequency rate (per one million hours worked)0.81 0.69 0.82 Average cost per claim (including estimate of future costs)$7632 $10,167 $7628 Work-related fatalities 0 0 0 Notifications to WorkSafe: 2019-2021 Performance indicator Event 2019 2020 2021 Serious injury or illness Immediate medical treatment - laceration 16 11 8 Serious injury or illness Immediate medical treatment - temporary loss of bodily function 2 1 0 Serious injury or illness Immediate medical treatment - eye injury 1 0 0 Serious injury or illness Immediate medical treatment - electric shock 1 1 0 Serious injury or illness Admission as an inpatient in a hospital 3 0 1 Serious injury or illness Medical treatment within 48 hours - exposure to substance 1 1 0 Serious injury or illness COVID-19 notification5N/A 2 9 Dangerous occurrence Uncontrolled implosion, explosion or fire 12 1 2 Dangerous occurrence Fall or release from a height of any plant, substance or object 11 2 2 Death at a workplace Non-work-related fatalities 1 0 0 Total All incidents 38 19 22 5. From 28 July 2020, employers are required to notify WorkSafe when an employee or a contractor's employee with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis has attended the workplace up to 14 days prior to the diagnosis or onset of symptoms.Health and safety performance monitoring To assist in monitoring the effectiveness of the health and safety management system, performance reports are provided to consultative, management, executive and governance forums within the University. This includes the Risk Management Advisory Group, Risk Management and Compliance Committee, and Audit and Risk Committee. Local health and safety business partners provide health and safety performance reports to their respective divisions. All significant incidents are reviewed in detail and, where appropriate, action plans put in place to minimise risk of reoccurrence. Incidents requiring notification to WorkSafe The Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic) requires the University to notify WorkSafe Victoria of all serious injuries, dangerous occurrences, and deaths at the workplace. A breakdown of these incidents is outlined in the following table. An investigation of each incident has either commenced or been completed. The University instigated corrective and preventative actions to prevent or reduce the risk of reoccurrence.102 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 External Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) audits The University of Melbourne conforms to the HSMS to the National Self-Insurers Audit Tool (NAT) as a requirement of the University's worker's compensation self-insurance. During 2021, an external surveillance audit was undertaken by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance auditors to support maintenance of the University's external certification of the HSMS to the NAT and AS4801 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. The recertification audit assessed 101 audit-criteria, from a review of 240 samples, across five academic divisions and Chancellery. Two criteria were assessed as non-conformances. Corrective actions have been implemented and the two non-conformances were closed in 2021. The University successfully maintained the NAT and AS4801 certifications until September 2022. Additionally, the HSMS was reviewed at Goulburn Valley Equine Hospital Pty Ltd (Shepparton) over two separate dates. This surveillance audit was conducted over 15 NAT criteria. Three criteria were assessed as non-conformances. Corrective actions have been implemented and non-conformances were closed in 2021. Internal Health and Safety Management System (HSMS) audits The University undertook a program of internal audits against NAT and AS4801 criteria in 2021, with 555 samples assessed across University divisions, departments and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Overall, two per cent of the audit criteria were assessed to be in non-conformance. The University established corrective action plans to address these non-conformances and these will be reviewed as a part of 2022 audit program.COVID-19 response To support periodic formal review of the University's response to COVID-19, the University undertook workplace monitoring - in the form of observational assessments and periodic surveys - to confirm that the primary risk controls were operational as required by local COVIDSafe plans. Observational assessments included review of signage, sanitiser, wipes, mask wearing and physical distancing. In 2021, following over 4000 individual observations undertaken throughout the University's workplaces, corrective action plans were subsequently developed to address adverse findings. A survey of staff, students and contractors who attended the campus was distributed, with 533 responses received. All data from workplace monitoring was utilised to inform and update COVIDSafe plans, alongside government-mandated information.COMPLIANCE 103WORKFORCE DISCLOSURES (DECEMBER 2020-DECEMBER 2021) The University's recruitment, selection and appointment processes are consistent with the requirements of the University of Melbourne 2018 Enterprise Agreement and relevant policies.

These included: Robust measures for scanning the external regulatory environment Engagement strategy for increasing networks of internal compliance stakeholders New technology to improve oversight and monitoring of compliance obligations Uplift of the University's compliance training and awareness program Holistic approach to capture and report on organisation-wide complaints and incidents Review of reporting to governance committees. BUILDINGS AND THE BUILDING ACT The University of Melbourne is committed to compliance with the building and maintenance provisions of the Building Act 1993 (the Act) and designs, builds and renovates all buildings in compliance with the requirements of the Act. To ensure compliance with the current building regulations and codes, all relevant projects are referred to an independent building surveyor for certification. All existing buildings comply with the standards applicable at the time of construction. As part of the University's annual program of capital works, all refurbishment projects are undertaken to current code requirements and, where appropriate, the scope of these works is extended to address new compliance requirements deemed to apply to individual buildings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University re-evaluated requirements and priorities in 2021, including capital expenditure. Accordingly, the 2021 Capital Plan considered business critical and committed works only. Expenditure for property is forecast to be approximately $237.5 million, including funding for major strategic initiatives for the Australian Institute of Infectious Disease, Fishermans Bend, the New Student Precinct and Melbourne Connect. The management of capital works is undertaken in accordance with the University's capital planning principles, procedures and guidelines throughout the project management lifecycle. Building on efforts to date, the University is developing a pathway to asset management maturity and compliance. Significant reforms to Victoria's environmental laws commenced on 1 July. Key changes include new or changed environmental obligations that apply to University operations. To address the new obligations, the University undertook an environmental legal compliance audit at each campus in 2021. The University continues to comply with its obligations regarding management of asbestos within its buildings. In addition to the general Division 5 audits, the University ensures that contractors complete a more detailed Division 6 audit prior to construction commencing. The University completed a detailed audit of the Parkville Campus in 2021 to improve campus mobility in compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 . Accordingly, work commenced in 2021 to rectify non-compliant areas. The University is committed to completing an audit of all other campuses and will address, as a matter of priority, any urgent rectification works identified in these audits. In line with the Victorian Government Statewide Cladding Audit that determines the risks associated with Aluminium Composite Panels (ACP) and Expanded Polystrene (EPS) Cladding, the University has removed ACP/EPS cladding from the six high-risk buildings identified for treatment. For many years the University has been committed to achieving a minimum Five Star Green Star Design & As Built standard for all its new buildings. Currently, the University is aiming to achieve a Six Star Green Star Design & As Built rating. This standard equates to world leadership in sustainable building design and construction. In 2021 the University made a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025. To support this, significant investment has been made in energy reduction works and onsite renewable energy generation projects (including installation of solar PV panels at more than 38 locations across all campuses), and entered into two renewable energy power purchase agreements with wind farms located in western Victoria. This enabled the University to reach its target of zero net emissions from electricity in 2021. COMPLIANCE 105In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the University complied with government requirements to limit operations and provide a safe work and study environment for its students, staff and contractors in 2021. Accordingly, the University closed all non-critical buildings and implemented necessary infrastructure and controls within buildings that were deemed critical to the University's operations. The University's Pandemic Response Group ensured that all faculties and operational areas developed COVID-safe plans and implemented procedures for case identification, incident reporting, contact tracing, communication and notifications. CARERS RECOGNITION ACT The University of Melbourne recognises the important contribution people with carer responsibilities make to the University through all aspects of employment, teaching and learning. The University acknowledges the Carers Recognition Act 2010 and provides support to carers through policies such as flexible work arrangements, recruitment and appointment, appropriate workplace behaviour and enrolment and timetabling, as well as services available through in-house Counselling and Psychological Services and Benestar (Employee Assistance Program services). The adjustments and support introduced in 2020 to address the impact of the pandemic continued in 2021 including recognition of the challenges experienced by working parents of school-aged children. This includes a dedicated COVID-19 response intranet website providing access to support services and guidelines for working from home and managing remote teams. Online training was enhanced in 2021 and included new models on resilience and wellbeing. The University also updated policies for assessing academic performance relative to opportunity in recognition of the additional impacts for people with carer responsibilities, particularly given that the significant shift to working remotely continued in 2021. In addition, in recognition that the extended locked down in Victoria may have impacted on the resilience and wellbeing of staff, the University provided five 'recharge days' for all staff. NATIONAL COMPETITION POLICY AND VICTORIAN COMPETITIVE NEUTRALITY POLICY The University has established a number of policies and supporting processes that support compliance with the National Competition Policy and the requirements of the Competitive Neutrality Policy Victoria. The University is currently on track to be fully compliant by 2024-2025. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION AND PUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURES The University of Melbourne is committed to a culture of integrity and good governance and to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and quality in its research, teaching and administration. University employees are required to comply with all relevant laws, obligations and internal policies and to take all reasonable steps to prevent non-compliance and possible instances of corrupt or improper conduct. Whistleblowers play an important role in identifying and calling out improper conduct and harm to the community. In response to the amended Commonwealth whistleblower protection regime in 2019, the University introduced a new whistleblower protection policy and program (with effect from 1 January 2020) to deal with relevant disclosures in connection with the University under both the Commonwealth regime and the Victorian Public Interest Disclosures Act 2012 - now collectively referred to as 'whistleblower disclosures' . During 2021, the University progressed work to embed the Whistleblower Protection Program within the University and its controlled entities. This work has focused on deploying a secure whistleblower reporting platform to further encourage a speak-up culture. The platform and its associated processes, designed to support compliance with Commonwealth whistleblower laws, ensure that appropriate disclosure handling protocols are employed to protect the confidentiality of reporters at the University. This includes referral to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) for whistleblowers who seek protection under Victorian law (as the University is only authorised to receive and handle disclosures made under Commonwealth whistleblower laws). The University will continue to embed a culture of encouraging whistleblowers to come forward with their concerns and protect them when they do. MODERN SLAVERY ACT COMPLIANCE The University of Melbourne is due to submit its second statement in response to the Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018 by 30 June 2022. Cross-functional work continues in assessing modern slavery risk across the University's operations and supply chains. 106 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 LOCAL JOBS FIRST The Local Jobs First Act 2003 requires departments and public sector bodies to apply the Local Jobs First policy to all projects over $3 million in metropolitan Melbourne or state wide, and $1 million in regional Victoria. The following Victorian Higher Education State Investment Fund (VHESIF) projects include Local Jobs First clauses as a part of its procurement activity and/or head agreement: Bionica - Bionic Devices Development Facility (BDDF) NIF: New frontiers - Plant, molecular and MRI-HIFU imaging Melbourne Connect Visualisation Suite (D-Lab) and Digital Health Validitron NorVicFoods - Agri-food Innovation Cluster Zero Emissions Energy Lab. For Victorian Government grants provided during 2021, including VHESIF grants, the University of Melbourne had a total of at least six interactions with the Industry Capability Network (Victoria) Ltd. where interaction reference numbers were required.

In addition, most operational outputs continued to be lower for 2021 due to partial campus closure. Energy usage continues to track below pre-pandemic levels and the University achieved its target, outlined in the Sustainability Plan 2017-2020 , of zero net emissions from electricity. Further, in 2021 University Council endorsed establishment of new, more ambitious emissions targets to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 (as certified under the Australian Government's Climate Active standard) and reach climate-positive status by 2030. The University's Sustainability Plan 2030 is on track for release in 2022.BIODIVERSITY BASELINE MAPPING Biodiversity baseline data collection for seven metrics across all campuses progressed well in 2021, although the project was delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions preventing onsite auditing. The data collection was almost 50 per cent complete by year's end and is on track to be finalised in 2022. The data will be used to set biodiversity baseline indicators for the University of Melbourne Sustainability Plan 2030 . WASTE REDUCTION Waste to landfill continued to fall from pre-pandemic levels, partly due to campus closures but also as a result of improved reuse services in 2021. The University waste-to-landfill target of 20 kg per person by 2020 was achieved for the second year, remaining similar in 2021 at 13.1 kg per person. However, with disposable item use still high, the University will prioritise reuse in 2022, tackling waste at the retail and procurement source, including at the Student Precinct. The University will focus on supporting resource recovery and developing circular economy principles to meet the ongoing challenge of keeping waste generation low as students and staff return to campus. TOTAL WASTE PER PERSON = 22.2 KG TOTAL WASTE TO LANDFILL PER PERSON = 13.1 KG Waste performance Unit 2018 2019 2020 2021 Waste to landfill (per person)* KG 29.9 28.9 13.2 13.1 Total waste (K) KG 2755 2789 1397 1396 Total recycling (K) KG 885 916 593 572 Recycling rate % 32 33 42.5 41 *Waste remained largely at 2020 levels and well below pre-pandemic levels with a slight decrease in waste diverted for recycling. Furniture and equipment reuse 3090 items were saved from landfill in 2021, equating to 68,594 kg at a value of $1.49 million (in line with 2020 levels). Choose to Reuse plate program Choose to Reuse washed 57,958 items during 2021. Although slightly down from 2020 due to the program being closed for most of the latter part of the year, Choose to Reuse made a significant contribution to the ongoing reduction in waste to landfill. The program will resume in 2022 with the challenge of continuing to keep waste to landfill below pre-pandemic levels. The University offered students a new dedicated Green Impact toolkit, being only the second Australasian institution to do so. The University of Melbourne's virtual sustainability tour won a highly commended award at the 2021 Green Gown Awards Australasia. Biodiversity baseline data mapping continued across all campuses and is due for completion in 2022. Piloted in 2020, and proving popular with students, the new Sustainability Interns program continued in 2021. The University waste-to-landfill target of 20 kg per person by 2020 was achieved for a second year, remaining similar in 2021 at 13.1 kg per person. While this is in part due to campus closures, the University continued to improve its reuse services in 2021.OTHER KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2021 INCLUDED:COMPLIANCE 109ENERGY REDUCTION AND EMISSIONS Energy usage increased from 2020 but remained below pre-pandemic levels.

From 2022, the University plans to implement a formal Environmental Management System (EMS) to meet its environmental compliance obligations. The EMS will be compliant with the requirements of ISO 14001:2015. It will cover all activities and responsibilities that have actual or potential environmental impacts to minimise pollution and other environmental risks. The EMS will also promote a culture of environmental sustainability in all aspects of the University's operations.112 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE DECISION MAKING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM ATTESTATION STATEMENT The University's Academic Freedom of Expression Policy and the Freedom of Speech Policy uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom consistent with the Model Code for the Protection of Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom in Australian Higher Education Providers (the French Model Code). In late 2020, the University received the findings of the Walker Review of Australian university policies on Freedom of Speech and Academic Freedom. The Review assessed universities' policies alignment with the French Model Code on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Speech and determined that the University of Melbourne's Freedom of Speech Policy was 'partially aligned' . Amendments to the Policy were approved by Council in March 2021. Following consideration by the Department of Education, the University's policies were deemed to be 'fully aligned' with the French Model Code. The University believes that the right to freedom of speech, and the promotion and protection of academic freedom, must and can coexist with a culture of respect for the rights of all to participate fully in the life of the University. In September 2021 the University approved 'Guidelines for the Appropriate Exercise of Freedom of Speech' . The Guidelines are based on the University's Freedom of Speech and Appropriate Workplace Behaviour policies and on the French Model Code. They provide staff and students with more detailed advice regarding their responsibilities as well as their rights in the exercise of freedom of speech ( about. unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/322208/GuidelinesAppropriateExerciseFreeSpeech.pdf). Among other things, the Guidelines make clear the University's commitment to the values of academic freedom and freedom of speech, as the foundation on which all universities are able to pursue their academic mission, and its duty to ensure that no staff member or student suffers unfair disadvantage or unfair discrimination by reason of their inherent and protected attributes in this context. The Guidelines indicate that reasonable and proportionate measures will be taken to prevent any person from using lawful speech which is intended, or could reasonably be construed to be intended, to humiliate, insult, or intimidate. The Guidelines are explicit in stating that this does not extend to a duty to protect others from feeling offended or shocked or insulted by lawful speech. The Guidelines also prohibit threatening or intimidating behaviour towards anyone on account of anything they have said in exercising freedom of speech. In 2021, the University also introduced a module on Freedom of Speech in Education and Research to be undertaken by all undergraduates. The module was piloted in the Bachelor of Bioscience in 2021 and will be embedded in all undergraduate degrees from 2022 onwards. One of the aims of this module is to help students new to the University of Melbourne to understand the intellectual environment of the University as a place where students are encouraged to engage with many different viewpoints, and to express their own. Through continued discussion within the University community and exploration of the impacts, opportunities and potential issues relating to freedom of speech, the University seeks to foster an environment where critical thinking and robust debate can flourish, and where the rights of all to a respectful and inclusive environment in which to work and study are protected. COMPLIANCE 113FOREIGN INTERFERENCE, INFLUENCE AND RELATIONS ATTESTATION STATEMENT The University of Melbourne recognises the critical importance of securing Australia's national interests, as well as the University's interests, from foreign interference and foreign influence. As a global institution, the University is alert, pro-active and sophisticated in how it manages potential risk to Australia's knowledge and technological resources and Australia's national security. Across the University, work is advancing to enhance risk management practices, build a stronger information base to guide decisions, and drive cultural change across all its domains. These ongoing efforts are a complex, whole-of-institution project and, where appropriate, are undertaken in consultation with relevant government agencies. Under the auspice of the Foreign Interference Working Group, University departments - including Legal and Risk, Research Innovation and Commercialisation, Information Technology, Human Resources, Chancellery International, Advancement, Chancellery Research and Enterprise - are engaged on workstreams addressing foreign interference and influence risk management. Additionally, a number of working groups and committees, drawing on senior leadership across the University, have been established to ensure that oversight and risk management is comprehensive and responsive. Due diligence and security practices are distributed across University of Melbourne portfolios and academic divisions. The Foreign Interference Working Group seeks to drive greater transparency and oversight of risk-related matters, bringing together various activities to ensure sector-leading compliance with relevant laws and regulations on a University-wide basis. The Working Group has oversight of implementation of the Australian Government's University Foreign Interference Transparency (UFIT) guidelines. The University continues to progress its staged UFIT action and implementation plan. This includes compliance under the Foreign Interference and Transparency Scheme (FITS) and the more recently introduced Foreign Arrangements Scheme (FAS). To date, no activities have been identified that would be registrable under the FITS Act and these are monitored on an ongoing basis to maintain compliance. A number of arrangements have been submitted to the FAS Public Register, with a small subset now appearing on the register. The University also made training modules on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme and the Foreign Arrangements Scheme available to all staff and provided targeted communications about these modules to staff working in high-risk areas.CHILD SAFETY The University of Melbourne continues in its commitment to protect the safety and wellbeing of children under the age of 18, through its robust child safety reporting, staff recruitment and student admission and enrolment processes. The University is seeking to further embed a culture of child safety across all areas of its operations through a program of work sponsored by Child Safe Champion (University Provost) and Child Safe Responsible Officer (Director, Student Services - Student and Scholarly Services). The focus of this work includes education, risk management and enhanced governance and will align with the introduction of the new Child Safe Standards in July 2022.114 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 GENDER EQUALITY The University of Melbourne is one of the defined entities under the new Victorian Gender Equality Act 2020. The Act came into effect on 31 March 2021 and is overseen by Victoria's first Public Sector Gender Equality Commissioner. The Act sets requirements for the Victorian public sector, local councils and universities (defined entities), to take positive action towards gender equality in their policies, programs and services. There are four key compliance activities specified by the Gender Equality Act. To date, the University has been fully compliant with these requirements: 1. Gender Impact Assessments (GIAs) The University established an institution-wide approach to identifying policies, programs and services for GIAs and completed an assessment for introduction of its Gender Affirmation Policy. 2. Workplace Gender Audit The University completed a Workplace Gender Audit as a baseline for monitoring and measuring gender equality. It comprises collection and analysis of outcomes from its Gender Equality Survey and a workforce data report. The University submitted the Workplace Gender Audit data to the Commission for Gender Equality in the Public Sector on 1 December 2021. 3. Gender Equality Action Plan (GEAP) Drawing on outcomes from the Workplace Gender Audit, the University is developing a GEAP to identify strategies, actions and measures to improve gender equality for staff. Two rounds of consultations with governing bodies, the National Tertiary Education Union and University staff are currently underway. The University is on track to submit the GEAP on 31 March 2022. 4. Progress reporting Currently underway, the University is required to report on the progress of the GEAP implementation and GIAs by 31 October 2023. INFORMATION GOVERNANCE CYBERSECURITY The University of Melbourne is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of its data and ensuring the availability and integrity of its systems and digital assets. The evolution of the cyber threats and associated increases in the frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks remains a significant issue for the higher education sector. Coupled with pandemic-driven reliance on connected systems accessible from around the world, the need to defend against cyber threats continues to be a significant organisational priority for the University. During 2021, the University continued to invest in the enhancement of its cybersecurity controls across the organisation with the objective of delivering a more cyber-resilient posture. This included deployment of an industry-leading endpoint security platform, expansion of multi-factor authentication to all University accounts, enhancement of governance and assurance controls including third party assurance, and the creation of active threat models. In addition, the University enhanced the capability and capacity of its internal cybersecurity team, and collaborated with external cybersecurity service providers to ensure situational awareness of threats and timeliness and completeness of response. The University is also committed to ensuring that cybersecurity awareness and education is part of a holistic approach to the enhancement of its cybersecurity responses. As part of this program in 2021, a number of initiatives - including cybersecurity awareness campaigns, webinars, targeted education campaigns, and phishing simulations - were delivered throughout the year. To encourage University projects and initiatives to adopt a 'secure-by-design' philosophy and provide cyber-risk mitigation strategies, the Cybersecurity Advisory Group was bolstered with additional subject matter expertise. In 2022, these programs will continue and new cybersecurity capabilities and technology-related controls will be introduced in collaboration with partners, government and industry.COMPLIANCE 115PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION The University of Melbourne respects the privacy of students, staff and anyone who interacts with the University and is committed to protecting and managing personal and health information fairly and lawfully. The University's central privacy governance model encompasses a multifaceted approach to supporting privacy compliance and best practice across the University. Last year the University released Advancing Melbourne 2030 , its 10-year strategic plan, with the aspiration to be a world-leading and globally connected university. Integral to realising this ambition is the effective and compliant management of personal data, which will become progressively more crucial to its operations. Large and complex organisations with global reach increasingly require a robust privacy management foundation to assure compliance with evolving domestic and international privacy laws. To this end, the privacy team undertook an assessment of the University's privacy management model in 2021, measured against the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner's (OVIC) Privacy Management Framework, released in 2020. The outcomes of the assessment will inform development of a University Privacy Management Framework in 2022 to strengthen the University's existing privacy governance model and further embed a culture of privacy awareness and best practice throughout the organisation. This year OVIC released a report on its examination into the protection of personal information in Victorian universities. The purpose of OVIC's examination was to consider whether Victorian universities have appropriate policies and procedures in place to protect personal information. The University of Melbourne's privacy team submitted evidence in response to the examination throughout the first half of 2021. OVIC released its final report in June 2020 and made six key recommendations. These recommendations will be fully addressed by the University in its Privacy Management Framework (currently in development). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose new privacy challenges, due both to the accelerated move towards digital ways of teaching and working, as well as the increased collection and processing of health information necessary to keep campuses safe. Throughout the year the University's privacy team provided extensive advice on collection and management of personal and health information to support the University's pandemic response activities. This included advice on collection of COVID-19 vaccination information, in compliance with ongoing public health directions and University policy. Other key activities in 2021 included: Providing privacy support across core areas and projects, such as sensitive research data management, CRM projects and online learning delivery Conducting privacy impact assessments for a wide range of initiatives Developing resources and guidance for staff on good privacy practices.RECORDS AND INFORMATION The University of Melbourne is committed to effective and compliant management of University records in relation to research, learning and teaching, engagement and administration. As a public office, the University is subject to the Public Records Act 1973 (Vic) and its published recordkeeping standards. The University's Records Management Policy (MPF1106) aligns with these commitments and is supported by published records management processes. The University's Records and Information team has pioneered and supported a variety of initiatives to achieve the University's objective of managing the records and information of the organisation compliantly. This includes: Ongoing deployment of Records Managed SharePoint and assessment of other line-of-business systems procured by the University, supporting integrations with the enterprise recordkeeping system Content Manager where appropriate Enhancing the University's capability to comply with new legislation such as Australia's Foreign Relations (State and Territory Arrangements) Act 2020 Partnering with Digital Stewardship (Research) on the preservation of University records. This includes an integration of front-end business and preservation systems, and improvements to digital preservation services. The University's Information Governance Services also supported the cross-institutional Australian Research Data Commons' Institutional Underpinnings Program in 2021. The $65,000 grant provided to the University will support improvements to research data retention processes, management of sensitive data and open data initiatives.116 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 FINANCIALS 117 FINANCIALS Financial statement overview Year in review 118 Five-year financial summary 121 Financial statements Income Statement 124 Comprehensive Income Statement 125 Statement of Financial Position 126 Statement of Changes in Equity 127 Statement of Cash Flows 128 Notes to and forming part of the financial statements 1.

This measure reflects the capacity of the University to live within its means, by removing from the net (or accounting) result, items that distort core operating performance such as discretionary investment income and income of a capital nature. This provides a safeguard against unexpected adverse events and ensures no cross subsidisation of operations from investments. When global markets are volatile, relying on investment income for operations is a high-risk strategy. The operating result is calculated by subtracting discretionary investment income, interest expense, philanthropic endowment income and infrastructure grant income from the net (or accounting) result.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OVERVIEW YEAR IN REVIEW UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The 2021 year was again impacted by the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost reduction measures continued and were successful in mitigating the adverse financial impacts of the pandemic. The University achieved an operating result of $147 million, $139 million higher than for 2020. This is an outstanding result and is mainly driven by cost reduction measures, a once-off Federal Government support package and increased student revenue. The net result was $584 million, $406 million higher than the previous year. This increase was primarily due to the significant investment income of $470 million, of which $252 million are unrealised gains resulting from changes to the market value of investments which, under accounting rules, are required to be recognised as income.$147m Operating result Up $139M on FY205.5% Operating margin Up 5.1 percentage points on FY20 $584m Net result Up $406M on FY20ANNUAL REPORT 2021 119Operating income was $2.660 billion, an increase of $234 million or 9.7 per cent on 2020, driven by a once-off Federal Government support package of $111 million and an increase in student revenue. The increase in student revenue in 2021 was primarily due to students taking on more subjects than in FY20. In addition to the Federal Government support package received, the University had another successful year in attracting research income due to continued funding of medical research. Operating expenditure was $2.512 billion, an increase of $95 million. This 3.9 per cent increase on 2020 is lower than the 9.7 per cent increase in operating income. Employee expenditure was in line with the previous year. Salary increases were offset by cost reduction measures. Non-employee expenditure increased by $91 million or 9.9 per cent against the previous year. This was largely to deliver increased teaching and research activity as well as increased infrastructure costs for new projects such as Melbourne Connect.$2.5bn Operating expenditure Up 3.9% on FY20$2.7bn Operating income Up 9.7% on FY20 $1.5bn Employee in with on FY20$2.9bn Total liabilities Up 10.1% on FY20$7.7bn Net assets Up 12.5% on FY20 FINANCIAL POSITION Total assets Increased by $1.1 billion or 11.8 per cent to $10.595 billion. Key movements Over half of the University's assets comprise property, and plant and equipment which enable sustainable operations. In 2021 the property, plant and equipment value increased by $584 million due to a revaluation of land, buildings and construction additions. Additions largely relate to Fishermans Bend, Melbourne Connect and Little Hall. Investments (financial assets) increased by $681 million primarily due to market performance, and endowment income (which is added to the investment portfolio), and changes to the asset allocation from cash to other financial assets. Total liabilities Increase of $262 million or 10.1 per cent to $2.852 billion. Key movements Borrowings increased by $170 million mainly due to the recognition of a lease liability for Melbourne Connect. The debt-to-equity ratio marginally changed from 9.9 per cent in the previous year to 11.0 per cent. The University had a successful year in attracting research funding, in particular medical research which will be spent over multiple years. As a result, refund liabilities (within other financial liabilities) which represent the unspent portion of activity, increased by $70 million. Other than the above, there were no significant changes in the financial position during the year.

'Infrastructure grant income' are grants received for capital projects and are excluded from the operating result due to the mismatch between income recorded and expenditure which inflates the accounting result. Income is recorded in the Income Statement whereas expenditure is capitalised in the Statement of Financial Position. 3. 'Philanthropic endowment income' represents capital donations where the principal is to remain intact for a defined time and income is generated on that principal for utilisation in future years. This also includes donations received where the principal will be used to fund, or partially fund, construction of new buildings.4. 'Gain from sale of assets' comprises the sale of a University property in Sturt Street Southbank in 2017 and has been excluded from the operating result on the basis that it is a large abnormal item. 5. 'Other' comprises the Academic Incentive Pool which is an internal incentive scheme that awards funds to University faculties where financial targets have been exceeded. Expenditure is excluded from the operating result as it is not a measure of financial performance.FINANCIALS 123EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER REPORTING DATE There are no matters or circumstances that have arisen since the end of the financial year that have affected the financial position of the Group. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS Under the Financial Management Act 1994 and associated Financial Reporting Directions, the University is required to provide details of expenditure on consultancies. In 2021, there were 71 consultancies where total fees payable to the consultants were in excess of $10,000. Total expenditure incurred during the year in relation to these consultancies was $18.343 million (excluding GST). There were no consultancies under $10,000.

The principal address of the University is Grattan Street, Parkville, Victoria 3010, Australia. The Group's financial statements are presented in a simplified layout providing information that is more streamlined and relevant to users. Financial statement notes are grouped together where they are similar in nature, with related principal accounting policies, key estimates and judgements included directly below. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 are set out within these financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to each year presented unless otherwise stated. 1.2 Basis of preparation The Group's Tier 1 general purpose financial statements are prepared as follows: Prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and certain classes of property, plant and equipment. Prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the Higher Education Support Act 2003 , Financial Management Act 1994 (Vic) and Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 . The University is a not-for-profit entity and these financial statements have been prepared on that basis. Some of the requirements for not-for-profit entities are inconsistent with IFRS requirements. Prepared on a going-concern basis, which assumes the continuity of normal operations. Presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group's functional and presentation currency. Rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Comparative amounts have been restated, where applicable, to conform with the current period presentation. 1.3 General policies Finance costs Interest expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method. Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency differences from such transactions are recognised in the Income Statement. Foreign currency differences from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement. Foreign currency differences arising from qualifying cash flow hedges are recognised in equity to the extent the hedges are effective. Taxation The University is exempt from income tax pursuant to Part 50.1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 . Income and expenses are recognised net of Goods and Services Tax (GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the expense. Assets are recognised net of GST , except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from or payable to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is included as a current asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position. Cash flows are presented on a net basis with net cash flow payable to, or receivable from, the ATO recorded separately. GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities recoverable from, or payable to the ATO, are presented as operating cash flows. 1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by management and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have financial impact on the Group and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are found in the following notes: NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS130 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D) Estimates Impairment of assets (Note 9) Other financial assets (Note 14) Property, plant and equipment (Note 16) Provisions (Note 20) Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments (Notes 29 and 30) Judgements Revenue and income (Notes 3, 5, and 7) Impairment of assets (Note 9) Property, plant and equipment (Note 16) Borrowings (Note 19) Service concession arrangements (Notes 5, 16 and 21) Subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates (Note 28) 1.5 Prior period adjustments There were no prior period adjustments required in 2021. 1.6 COVID-19 pandemic In March 2020, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic. To slow the spread of the virus, public health measures were imposed across the world and in Australia. The pandemic has had a significant impact on the Higher Education sector with impacts to face-to-face teaching and student numbers as a result of domestic and international travel restrictions. Measures were implemented to reduce costs and activity and were successful in mitigating the financial impacts. Further detail on the performance of the Group is provided in the financial statements summary. COVID-19 Basis of preparation The Group has a strong financial position, and a robust financial management framework. Considering all available information and the potential impacts of COVID-19, the Group has concluded it is appropriate to prepare its financial statements on a going concern basis. The below section outlines the significant financial statement balances impacted due to COVID-19. COVID-19 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions Other financial assets - Investments in managed unit trusts are measured at fair value. The current impact of the pandemic on financial markets is factored into the fair value at reporting date with sensitivity analysis disclosed in Note 29 Financial risk management. Property, plant and equipment - The Group engaged Colliers International to value property, plant and equipment, and the impact of COVID-19 has been taken into consideration in the valuation provided. Trade receivables - Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's receivables shows the collectability of receivables has not deteriorated, even though the Group's customer base has been impacted by domestic and global restrictions. The Group's customer base largely comprises government, fee-paying students and industry partners. Appropriate plans and actions have been put in place by the Group to assist customers and students with payment options if they have been affected by COVID-19. The Group has assessed the credit quality of trade receivables as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and in doing so, reassessed the inputs to the provision matrix used to calculate expected credit losses. The provision matrix includes inputs that reflect the current economic environment and as a result, the known economic impact of COVID-19 has been factored into the calculation. This has resulted in a greater percentage of receivables provided for, however overall a lesser provision, due to a lower trade receivables balance at the reporting date. 1.7 Initial application of the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) Agenda Decisions Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements In April 2021, the IFRS IC published an agenda decision relating to the accounting for configuration and customisation costs incurred related to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangement. As a result, the Group has changed its accounting policy in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements. For the current year, there was no material impact on the application of the IFRS IC Agenda Decision. 1.8 Application of new and revised accounting standards and interpretations New and revised accounting standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the current year In the current year, the Group adopted all new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board effective for the current reporting period. New and revised accounting standards and interpretations to be applied in future reporting periods At the date of this report, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Application is not expected to result in material changes to the Group's future financial reports. FINANCIALS 131HOW WE ARE FUNDED This section outlines the Group's major revenue and income categories. At a glance for 2021 these are: * Australian Government funding is inclusive of higher education loan programs.39% Australian Government*2% State and Local Government1% HECS-HELP student payments33% Fees and charges15% Investment income4% Consultancy and contracts6% Other revenue NOTE 2 DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE AND INCOME The Group monitors its financial performance using two financial measures, the 'operating result' and 'operating margin' . Both measures reflect the capacity of the Group to live within its means, by removing items that distort core operating performance from the accounting result. A description of both measures can be found in the financial summary section of the Annual Report. The measures provide a safeguard against unexpected adverse events, ensure no cross subsidisation of operations from investments and allow management to assess current year performance consistently compared with prior years. Management assesses performance of revenue and income in three categories which broadly align to the University's strategy. These are Teaching and Learning, Research and Other. The table below provides a breakdown of revenue and income reported in the Financial Statements against the three categories.

The table below outlines the circumstances that must exist for consideration to be recognised as revenue from a contract with a customer. Where grants or contracts are recognised over time, the input method of costs incurred-to-date will be used to measure progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation. The nature of the product or service and its satisfaction is directly related to the expert knowledge used to produce the product or provide the service. Costs incurred-to-date mainly comprise employee related expenditure. Accordingly, this is the best measure of the transfer of control over the product or service. Accounting policy Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised products or services to a customer. Specific revenue recognition criteria are set out below. Revenue type Performance obligation Timing of satisfaction Commonwealth Grant Scheme and Higher Education Loan Programs Provision of education services. Over time, as the student receives and consumes the educational services. Education research None On receipt or right to receive payment in accordance with AASB 1058. Where the agreement contains a termination for convenience clause, the unspent funding is recognised as a financial liability in the form of a refund obligation, with income recognised once the related expenditure has been incurred. Capital funding To acquire or construct a non-financial asset. Typically the Group receives capital funding to construct buildings for example, educational facilities.Over time, as the building or facility is constructed. Income is recognised to the extent of costs incurred-to-date because the costs of construction are the best measure of the stage of completion of the building. Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council (included in Other Australian financial assistance)None These contracts contain termination for convenience clauses. On receipt or right to receive payment, the unspent funding is recognised as a financial liability in the form of a refund obligation, with income recognised once the related expenditure has been incurred. Other grants / Australian Government financial assistanceIf the below facts and circumstances exist, these categories meet the criteria to be recognised as a contract with a customer. Otherwise, they are recognised on receipt or right to receive payment. Provision of a final product. For example, a conceptual framework with measures or an evaluation report containing data and recommendations.At the point-in-time when the final product is delivered.Where the customer controls the benefit throughout the agreement term, the revenue will be recognised over time as the service is provided. Provision of a specific number of internships with an industry partner. At the point-in-time when each internship is completed. Transaction price is the amount agreed with the customer for each internship. Delivery of services directly to the public, on behalf of the customer.Over time as the service is delivered. Provision of a non-exclusive licence or IP for the knowledge created by Where the customer controls the benefit throughout the agreement term, the revenue will be recognised over time as the service is provided.If the benefit transfers at a point-in-time the revenue and associated costs will be recognised at that point in time.FINANCIALS 133NOTE 4 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Consolidated 2021 2020 Local Government financial assistance 63,268 56,434 63,268 56,434 Key estimates and judgements State and Local Government financial assistance is measured and recognised in accordance with the policy and judgements set out in the other grants section of Note 3.

The accounting policy below outlines the material performance obligations and, how and when these are satisfied. Accounting policy Course fees and charges revenue is recognised as the course is delivered to the student and is measured as the amount the Group expects to be entitled to. Any fee waivers are recognised as a reduction in the amount of revenue recognised. Where revenue has been received for programs or services to be delivered in the following year, these amounts are deferred as a contract liability. Other non-course fees and charges are recognised as the service is delivered to the student or the public. For example, rent and student accommodation revenue are recognised as the Group provides the accommodation or use of space to the student or the public. Operating leases as lessor When the Group is a lessor, a lease is classified as an operating lease when it does not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. Indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset are considered as part of this assessment. Payments received under operating leases are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and form part of the line item called rent and use of facilities. Student accommodation The Group entered into a number of Service Concession Arrangements with the private sector for the provision of student accommodation with terms between 40 and 42 years. Student accommodation includes revenue recognised in accordance with the grant of right to operate model of Service Concession Arrangements.

The accounting policy below outlines the material performance obligations, how and when these are satisfied. Accounting policy Revenue type Performance obligation Timing of satisfaction Donations and bequests None Recognised on receipt, when there are no sufficiently specific performance obligations or it cannot be identified when the obligation is satisfied. Typically, the stated purpose of the gift is not specific enough for the requirements of the standard. In the rare circumstance where a gift has a sufficiently specific performance obligation, revenue is recognised when or as the obligation is satisfied. Where the agreement contains a terminate for convenience clause, the unspent funding is recognised as a financial liability, with revenue recognised once the related expenditure has been incurred. Non-government grants The accounting policy and judgements are the same as Other grants in Note 3. Commercial sales Provision of theatre productions At a point in time, when the production has been delivered. Provision of fitness services Evenly throughout the period of providing access to the fitness centre, given the inputs are expended evenly throughout the period. The customer receives access to the centre as it is provided. Other revenue Provision of childcare services Evenly throughout the period of providing care to the child, given the inputs are expended evenly throughout the period. The child receives the care as it is provided.136 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 COMPOSITION OF EXPENDITURE This section outlines the Group's major expenditure categories.

NOTE 9 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 (2,727) (3,014) Other impairment losses 3 357 3 Total impairment of assets (2,641) (2,655) (2,724) (2,657)FINANCIALS 137NOTE 9 IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS (CONT'D) Key estimates and judgements The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions that may lead to impairment of assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. The recoverable amount is the greater of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Where there are clear impairment triggers for specific receivables these are recognised in the allowance for doubtful debts for trade receivables. The Group applies the simplified approach to estimate the allowance for doubtful debts for the remainder of trade receivables. The Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date. An expected credit loss (ECL) matrix is prepared incorporating debtor carrying amounts by days past due, with respective historical write-off rates and forward-looking rates. Application of the simplified approach to calculating ECLs requires significant judgement. The Group uses judgement in selecting the inputs to the ECL calculation, based on the Group's past history, existing market conditions and forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period, specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The simplified approach cannot be applied to loans to subsidiaries therefore, the general approach is used.

Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days of the end of the month of invoice. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables are not discounted as the effect of discounting is immaterial. Contract assets A contract asset is the Group's right to consideration, for the performance obligations it has satisfied, when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. The difference between a receivable and contract asset is whether it is conditional or unconditional. Typically, this occurs where the right to consideration is based on an agreed payment schedule. In this case a contract asset is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, however the right to consideration per the payment schedule is in the future. For example, graduation services are delivered in December, however consideration is not due until after the reporting date. The typical timing of receipts or the right to a receivable is in advance of providing the service. Consideration for the provision of educational services, ancillary services, such as fitness, childcare, student accommodation and theatre, is received in advance of providing the service. Additionally, grants and contracts are typically received in instalments with the first instalment due when the contract is signed. Accordingly, a portion of the consideration is received or receivable prior to commencing the service, resulting in a contract liability. 140 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 13 RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT ASSETS (CONT'D) Allowance for impaired receivables and contract assets Refer to Note 9 for details of the Group's impairment policy. Deferred Government contributions for superannuation The Group has a number of employees who are members of the State Employees Retirement Benefits Scheme and the State Superannuation Fund administered by the Government Superannuation Office. These schemes are State super schemes and are not available to future University employees. Funding to meet payments incurred will be provided to the University of Melbourne by the Australian Government. The cost is shared between the State of Victoria and the Australian Government under the States Grants (General Revenue) Amendment Act 1987 . The Group's obligation is limited to what is required to be paid for that year. This is refunded from the Australian Government on an emerging cost basis. At 31 December 2021, the State Superannuation Fund was carrying total liabilities for member benefits greater than the value of the net market value of the plan's assets, based on an actuarial valuation. As a result an unfunded superannuation liability exists and is recognised in the financial statements of the Scheme. The Group recognises a receivable from the Australian Government in respect of unfunded superannuation schemes operated by the State Government, which offsets the deferred Government superannuation present obligation recognised in the financial statements. As at 31 December 2021 the Group's total unfunded superannuation liability determined by the Victorian Government Superannuation Office amounted to $100.133 million (2020: $107.522 million). Refer to Note 20 for the liability recorded. The increase/decrease in the asset and liability are disclosed in the Comprehensive Income Statement. Other receivables Other receivables are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. Other receivables include receivables within the investment portfolio, student debt, tax, accrued income and other receivables. Receivables within the investment portfolio are recognised on trade date and student debtors are recognised on the date the student is assessed. Students are assessed at the earliest of the invoice date, due date, and first payment date. Accrued income is recognised when the good or service has been provided but not yet invoiced for transactions that are not contracts with customers. NOTE 14 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 $'000 7,464 39,450 Non-current Financial assets at profit or loss 3,187,813 2,532,215 3,187,813 2,532,215 Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income 242,566 194,441 94,467 assets 3,442,387 2,770,650 3,309,996 2,664,412 Winding up of shareholding in Education Australia Ltd (EAL) The Group is one of 38 Australian universities with a shareholding in EAL and were collective owners of 40 per cent of the total shares in IDP Education Limited (IDP). The investment in EAL is recognised as a financial asset designated at fair value through other comprehensive income. During the year, EAL restructured its 40 per cent investment in IDP by: making an in-specie distribution of a 25 per cent shareholding in IDP to all of its 38 university shareholders, with those shareholders each becoming the direct owner of 1,831,159 shares in IDP and, divested its remaining 15 per cent in IDP via a market selldown from which it paid all outstanding tax liabilities and paid a franked dividend to its shareholders Dividends received as part of the transaction were recognised through other comprehensive income as the dividends represent a recovery of the cost of investment due to the following reasons: winding up of EAL was approved by ordinary resolution of EAL shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting, Each EAL shareholder must enter into an agreement with The British Council and The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of the University of Cambridge acting by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate undertaking to comply with the restrictions of further divestment of their IDP shares, No further economic benefits are expected to be received from the investment due to its planned wind-up, and The dividend payout in effect is a form of capital distribution rather than a return on investment.FINANCIALS 141NOTE 14 OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS (CONT'D) The transaction has been accounted for as an exchange of financial assets under AASB 9. The contractual rights to cash flows from shares in EAL will expire as the Group received equivalent distributions in various forms to recover the cost of the asset. The corresponding shares in IDP received in exchange are recognised at fair value. Franking credits as a result of dividends Derivative financial assets (held-for-trading) Derivative financial assets (held-for-trading) are comprised primarily of FX forwards to assist with foreign currency risk management. These have not been designated a hedging relationship. Derivatives in a positive position at the end of the reporting period are reported as financial assets. Derivative financial assets (held-for-trading) are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value, with net changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Financial assets at FVTPL consists of the Group's investments in managed unit trusts. These instruments are required to be measured at FVTPL as they are not a basic lending arrangement given the returns are not solely principal and interest. Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at FVTPL are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the Income Statement. Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows expires or are transferred, and the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Upon derecognition the gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement. Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Financial assets designated at FVOCI consists of the Group's investments in other companies. The interests are classified as equity and the Group irrevocably elected to measure these assets at FVOCI, on the basis that they are not held-for-trading. Financial assets designated at FVOCI are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the Comprehensive Income Statement. Gains or losses on these financial assets are never recognised in the Income Statement and are not subject to impairment testing. Dividends are recognised as investment revenue in the Income Statement when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in the Comprehensive Income Statement. Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are carried at fair value. Where a fair value is not readily available, investments are carried at the lower of cost and recoverable amount. There are a number of immaterial subsidiaries that are not consolidated. As such, investments in these entities are not eliminated from the consolidated entity. Refer to Note 28 for further details.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all tangible fixed assets other than land, construction in progress, works of art and other collections, none of which are depreciated. The Group's depreciation rates are: Assets are depreciated from the date of purchase until the shorter of the end of useful life and the date of disposal. Right-of-use assets Judgement is required to assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. Assessment is made when the contract is entered into, and is completed on a lease-by-lease basis. Areas of judgement include determining whether there is an identified asset, whether the Group will obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset, whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset, and whether it is reasonably certain lease extension and termination options will be exercised. Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment costing $10,000 or more is capitalised. Items under $10,000 are expensed, with the exception of works of art and other collections and library. There has been no change to the capitalisation threshold in 2021. Each class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in measuring the fair value of property, plant and equipment are disclosed in Note 30.Revaluation increments and decrements are recognised in the asset revaluation reserve on an asset class basis, except to the extent an increment reverses a revaluation decrement in respect of that class of asset previously recognised as an expense. Revaluation reserves are not transferred to retained earnings on derecognition of the relevant asset but retained within the asset revaluation reserve. Land and buildings Land and buildings are initially recorded at cost, which is considered to equate to fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, land and buildings are recognised at fair value. At the date of revaluation any accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset, which is then restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Annual valuations are performed by independent valuers which include a site inspection every five years. Previously, valuations were only booked following a site inspection, or in a year where there was a material change. From 2020 the valuations are booked every year with the next site inspection due in 2022. A number of the Group's owned assets are subject to an operating lease. The value of land and buildings subject to an operating lease is insignificant compared to the Group's total land and buildings. Works of art and other collections Works of art and other collections are measured at fair value and valued on a six-year cyclical basis. A rolling valuation plan is in place for valuing these collections. Library collection The general library collection, which excludes the rare book collection and electronic publications, is recorded at cost less any accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, any impairment losses. The rare book collection is included as part of other collections and electronic publications are included as intangible assets.Buildings and Service Concession Assets S tructure/shell/building fabric 2% Sit e engineering services/ central plant 3% Fit out 7% T runk reticulated building systems 3% Since 2009, newly constructed buildings are componentised into the above four categories.

Leasehold property Leasehold property is recorded at cost less amortisation and, where applicable, any impairment losses. Leasehold property includes improvements made to leased properties. Construction in progress Construction in progress is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at cost. Capital expenditure relating to the refurbishment of buildings which adds value, rather than maintaining the value of the buildings, is included in construction in progress. When construction projects are completed, the balance within construction in progress is transferred to buildings. Right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets are recognised at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, where the lease term is more than 12 months and the cost of the underlying asset is $10,000 or more. Cost is initially measured at the value of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made before commencement date. Lease liabilities are presented within Note 19 Borrowings. The Group applies this policy equally to concessionary, or peppercorn, leases. This option under AASB 16 was adopted rather than valuing the right-of-use asset at fair value at inception of the lease. The Group has four concessionary leases ranging with terms from 3 to 50 years. None of the concessionary leases relate to the Group's main campuses and as such the Group considers its dependency on these leases to be low. Service concession assets The Group recognises a service concession asset when it controls the asset. Control-of-service concession assets arises when the Group controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the asset, to whom it must provide them, and at what price. The Group must also control through ownership or beneficial entitlement, any significant residual interest in the asset at the end of the term of the arrangement. Service concession assets are initially recognised at current replacement cost in accordance with the cost approach to fair value. When an existing asset is used in a service concession arrangement, it is reclassified as a service concession asset and measured at current replacement cost at the date of reclassification. At the date of reclassification, where there is a difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its current replacement cost, the difference is accounted for as a revaluation of the asset and recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the asset revaluation reserve. After initial recognition or reclassification, service concession assets are carried at fair value less any depreciation and impairment. Service concession assets will be revalued in line with the Group's land and buildings revaluation policy outlined above. Costs in relation to service concession assets under construction are recognised as construction in progress assets. Assets classified as held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if it is highly probably they will be recovered through a sale rather than though continuing use. Once classified as held for sale, assets are no longer depreciated. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Subsequent costs Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group. The costs of servicing property, plant and equipment are expensed in the period they are incurred. Contributions received or paid for buildings Contributions are both received from and made to third parties towards the construction of buildings in exchange for the right to occupy space. Contributions received are treated as joint operations where evidence of joint control exists. Each party only recognises their share of the building. There is no change to the treatment of contributions received from the application of AASB 16. Contributions paid to third parties are accounted for as leases under AASB 16 and classified as right-of-use assets. 148 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 16 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONT'D) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements SaaS arrangements are arrangements in which the Group does not control the underlying software used in the arrangement. Where costs incurred to configure or customise SaaS arrangements result in the creation of a resource which is identifiable, and where the Group has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits, such costs are recognised as a separate intangible software asset and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis. The amortisation period is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and any changes to the amortisation period are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Where costs incurred to configure or customise do not result in the recognition of an intangible software asset, then those costs that provide the Group with a distinct service (in addition to the SaaS access) are recognised as expenses when the supplier provides the services. When such costs incurred do not provide a distinct service, the costs are capitalised as a prepayment and are recognised as expenses over the duration of the SaaS contract. Determining whether cloud computing arrangements contain a software licence intangible asset The Group evaluates cloud computing arrangements to determine if it provides a resource that the Group can control. The Group determines that a software licence intangible asset exists in a cloud computing arrangement when both of the following are met at the inception of the arrangement: The Group has the contractual right to take possession of the software during the hosting period without significant penalty. It is feasible for the Group to run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the supplierto host the software. Capitalisation of configuration and customisation costs in SaaS arrangements Where the Group incurs costs to configure or customise SaaS arrangements and such costs are considered to enhance current on-premise software or provide code that can be used by the Group in other arrangements, the Group applies judgement to assess whether such costs result in the creation of an intangible asset that meets the definition and recognition criteria in AASB 138. For the year ended 31 December 2021, $10.690 million (2020: $13.205 million) of costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements were recognised as intangible assets. 16.a Right-of-use assets by class of asset The Group has leases for a number of different asset categories including land, buildings and equipment. The right-of-use asset column is the combined amounts for all categories. To assist with the understanding of the Group's leases, this table splits the right-of-use assets by category for key balances.

FINANCIALS 149NOTE 16 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONT'D) 16.c Service concession arrangements Application of service concession accounting requires complex and highly judgmental assessments to be made. For the Group, the area of significant judgement involves the assessment of student accommodation to be a public service. The Group deems the provision of student accommodation to be a public service where it complements the University's public service objective of education and where it is not deemed to be commercial in nature. The Group's service concession arrangements relate to several arrangements with the private sector for the provision of student accommodation with terms between 38 and 42 years. Upfront payments are recognised as deferred revenue under the grant of right to operate (GORTO) model and amortised to revenue over the concession period. Student accommodation includes revenue recognised in accordance with the GORTO model. Refer to Note 21 Contract and other liabilities. The following are the two types of arrangements: Student accommodation market transaction: The Group has an arrangement with a private operator for the provision of asset services for three student accommodation buildings for terms between 40 and 42 years. All buildings are in operation. In exchange for an upfront payment from the private operator and the provision of asset services, the private operator has the right to the net student rents collected over the concession term. Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT): There are two student accommodation buildings under BOOT arrangements, whereby a private operator built, owns and operates the student accommodation and will transfer ownership of the building to the University at the end of the concession term. Both buildings are in operation. The Group provides the operator with the right to collect rent from the students for concession terms of between 38 and 42 years.

They are recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis at 25% (2020: 25%).150 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Liabilities are present obligations of the Group, which are expected to result in an outflow of future economic benefits. Equity is the residual interest in the assets of the Group, after deducting all its liabilities. Liabilities and equity held by the Group at the reporting date are: NOTE 18 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 217,765 173,348 Accounting policy Payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the reporting date, which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days from the month following recognition. Accrued expenses relate to expenses incurred but not yet invoiced. NOTE 19 BORROWINGS Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 financial liabilitiesLiabilities EquityFINANCIALS 151NOTE 19 BORROWINGS (CONT'D) Unsecured bank borrowings The Group borrowed $60.000 million which was fully drawn down in 2008. The interest rate is 7.03 per cent fixed for the 15 year term. The amortised cost at 31 December 2021 is $12.038 million (2020: $17.459 million). Unsecured bonds In 2014 the Group issued domestic Australian dollar Medium Term Notes (MTN) to the value of $250.000 million. The MTNs were fully repaid in June 2021. The bond coupon rate was 4.25 per cent fixed for seven years. The amortised cost at 31 December 2021 is nil (2020: $249.712 million). In 2017 the Group issued domestic Australian dollar MTN to the value of $100.000 million. The bond coupon rate is 4.25 per cent fixed for 25 years. The amortised cost at 31 December 2021 is $99.644 million (2020: $99.633 million). In 2021 the Group issued domestic Australian dollar MTN to the value of $150.000 million. The bond coupon rate is 1.97 per cent fixed for 10 years. The amortised cost at 31 December 2021 is $149.880 million (2020: Nil). The Group completed an offering in the US Private Placement market during 2015. This comprised four tranches of senior notes totalling the equivalent of $274.300 million AUD. The first tranche amounting to $41.250 million was issued for 20 years (5.42 per cent fixed interest) with three further tranches issued in 2016. These were made up of $30.000 million AUD for 20 years (5.48 per cent fixed interest), $20.000 million AUD for 25 years (5.49 per cent fixed interest) and $131.000 million USD for 30 years (4.40 per cent fixed interest). The repayment date is at the end of the respective tranche tenures. The amortised cost at 31 December 2021 totals $270.132 million (2020: $259.697 million). Loan covenant Borrowings are not subject to covenants apart from an annual requirement to supply the Group's audited financial statements and budget. Lease liabilities The Group has lease contracts as lessee for various properties and equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods between 1 and 30 years, but may have extension options. There are two leases with a term of 50 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. In respect to leases that commenced prior to 31 December 2021, the Group expects to pay undiscounted contractual cash flows of $26.971 million in less than one year (2020: $13.186 million), $85.539 million between one and five years (2020: $27.265 million), and $1231 million in more than five years (2020: $18.909 million).The committed future cash outflows for leases not yet commenced is $7.676 million (2020: $1.372 billion).Reconciliation of liabilities to cash flows arising from financing activities 2021 2020 Long term 1,694 2,307 Other - - - - (91) (91) Balance at 31 December 537,258 316,597 853,855 633,802 50,305 684,107 152 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 19 BORROWINGS (CONT'D) Key estimates and judgements Judgement is required to assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease, these are outlined in Note 16. Accounting policy BorrowingsBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Using the effective interest rate method, any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs and the redemption amount, is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of borrowings. Borrowings are removed from the Statement of Financial Position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. Lease liabilities Short-term leases and low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease liabilities are recognised as the present value of unpaid lease payments at the commencement date of the lease, where the lease term is more than 12 months and the cost of the underlying asset is $10,000 or more. To calculate the present value, the outstanding lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. Key payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities for the Group include fixed payments, lease incentives, and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, resulting in interest expense being recognised as a borrowing cost in the Income Statement. The lease liability is remeasured when there are changes in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are presented in Note 16 property, plant and equipment.

These issues related to underpayments of wages, mainly in relation to casual staff. Since then, the University has engaged specialised assistance to help rectify this issue which will involve making payments to current and past employees dating back to 2013 where the University's data shows they have been underpaid. Identification of the possible amount of underpayment has required significant estimation. The University has used information within the payroll dataset and compared it against the 2013 and 2018 Enterprise Agreements to identify where possible underpayments could have arisen (via a data analytics estimation exercise), extrapolated this across the affected 8 years and added payroll on-costs (eg payroll tax, superannuation) to determine the amount of the possible underpayment owed to staff as at 31 December 2021. Due to the nature of estimation techniques employed to date in determining the amount of the possible underpayment as at 31 December 2021, once each employee has been evaluated individually and the exact amount identified per staff, the actual liability may differ from the amount of provision recognised. However, based on the underlying information supporting these estimates, the Group does not expect a material change to the amount provided for. The University also made rectification payments in 2020 and 2021 to casual academic employees arising from disputed historical practices relating to sessional marking, lecture attendance and practice sessions - these amounted to $10.375 million. As at 31 December 2021, the University has recognised a provision of $43.247 million in relation to this matter - this is disclosed within 'Other Provisions' below. As at the date of signing this financial report, the detailed remediation calculation exercise is continuing and the University anticipates this to be finalised by the end of 2022 - as such the provision which has been recognised in the financial statements as at 31 December 2021 has been classified as a 'Current' provision (ie requiring payment within 12 months).

An estimate based on past pattern is made for the probability of leave that will be taken within 12 months and after 12 months. Employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs. Employee benefits not expected to be settled within 12 months are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash flows for those benefits. Provisions made are classified as a current liability, unless there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, in which case it is classified as a non-current liability. Long service leave Liabilities for long service leave are discounted to determine the present value of expected future payments to be made for services provided by employees up to the reporting date. The discount rate of 1.35 per cent (2020: 0.6%) is based on average Indicative Mid Rates of Commonwealth Government Securities. Consideration is given to expected future salary levels, the pattern of employee departures and periods of service. Deferred Government superannuation obligation Refer to Note 13 for the accounting policy relating to deferred Government superannuation obligations. Employee contributory superannuation funds managed outside of the University exist to provide benefits for the Group's employees and their dependents on retirement, disability or death of the employee. The contributions made to these funds are recorded in the Income Statement. WorkCover The University is a Self Insurer for Workers' Compensation and WorkCover. A provision is recognised representing an estimate of the total outstanding liability for workers' compensation claims. The value of the provision is based on an actuarial assessment carried out at reporting date. Significant estimates in the actuarial valuation include number of claims and cost per claim, and have been estimated based on an analysis of past experiences. RestructureRestructure provisions are recognised where the costs of restructure are measurable, there is a present obligation, and steps have been taken to implement a detailed plan, including communicating the plan to those affected prior to reporting date. 154 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 21 CONTRACT AND OTHER LIABILITIES Consolidated University 2021 2020 2021 2020 $'000 $'000 $'000 assistance 32,744 30,545 32,620 30,328 Contract liability - grants and contracts Contract liability - student fees 82,236 income - service 27,860 27,860 27,860 27,860 Deferred income 902,368 849,015 897,112 Key estimates, judgements and accounting policy Australian Government unspent financial assistance Australian Government unspent financial assistance are amounts billed in accordance with contracts with the Australian Government, but where the Group has not yet provided the service, and also includes unspent Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) funds. The liability represents the Group's obligation to provide educational services to students or to refund cash to the Australian Government. Contract liabilities Contract liabilities arise from contracts with customers and represent amounts billed in accordance with customer contracts, but where the Group has not yet provided a good or service. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group provides the customer with the good or service. Deferred income - service concession arrangements The Group has a number of arrangements with private sector parties for the provision of student accommodation, as outlined in Note 16.c. The deferred income for service concession arrangements represents the unearned portion of the revenue arising from the exchange of assets between the Group and the operator. The liability is reduced as the revenue is earned, which is evenly over the concession term, from the date of practical completion of construction. The revenue is recorded as student accommodation revenue in Note 5. Judgement was applied in assessing these arrangements to be service concession arrangements and in categorising them as the Grant of Right to Operator Model as defined by AASB 1059.Unsatisfied performance obligations Remaining performance obligations represent goods or services the Group has promised to provide to customers under contracts relating to the transfer of goods or services for the customers' own use. The remaining performance obligations can be categorised as follows: Performance obligation Unsatisfied when Satisfied when To acquire or construct a non-financial asset. Primarily, the Group receives capital funding to construct buildings for example, educational facilities.The non-financial asset has not been constructed, is partially constructed or has not been acquired.As the asset is constructed or when it is acquired. Provision of a final product. The final product has not been delivered. The final product is delivered. Delivery of services on behalf of the customer.The services have not been delivered. As the services are delivered. Provision of a non-exclusive licence or IP . The services have not been delivered. As the services are provided. The transaction price is allocated using the input method of costs incurred-to-date. The nature of the service or product and its satisfaction are directly related to the expert knowledge used to provide the service or produce the product. Costs incurred-to-date mainly comprises salaries, accordingly, costs incurred-to-date is the best measure of the transfer of knowledge, that is, the satisfaction of the performance obligation.FINANCIALS 155NOTE 21 CONTRACT AND OTHER LIABILITIES (CONT'D) 21.a Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers The Group has recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers: Current Non-current - - - 2,140 (2,140) Additional liability - 181,357 - 325 203,938 7,500 Total contract assets and liabilities - 209,035 27,860 325 231,465 27,860 There are no significant changes to contract assets and liabilities. There have been no changes in transaction prices, therefore, there is no revenue recognised in the reporting period from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods.

The CCIRS contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of a highly probable forecast transaction, being the draw down of the USD denominated debt under the USPP on 17 February 2016. 156 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 22 OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (CONT'D) Accounting policy The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated, and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recognised in equity. Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Derivative financial liabilities (held-for-trading) Derivative financial liabilities (held-for-trading) comprise foreign exchange forwards used to assist with the Group's foreign currency risk management and an electricity contract for difference, which the Group uses to manage a portion of its overall electricity price exposure. Neither of these financial derivatives apply hedge accounting. Where the derivative is in a negative position at the end of the reporting period they are reported as financial liabilities. Changes in fair value of the derivatives are recognised in the Income Statement. Further information on how the Group manages its foreign currency and electricity price exposures can be found in Note 29. Refund liability A refund liability exists where the Group has an obligation to pay cash to the funding body or a third party, typically where there are unspent funds at the termination of the agreement. In addition, the Group recognises a refund liability where the contract contains a termination for convenience clause. As the customer can terminate the agreement without cause and require the immediate repayment of any unspent or uncommitted funding, the Group has no practical ability to avoid the grantor or customer exercising the clause. This refund liability is payable on demand should the agreement be terminated. Obligation to pay cash to third parties Obligations to pay cash to third parties mostly arise where the University must administer cash scholarships by paying a stipend to students.

Associates and joint arrangements The Group has a 20 per cent interest in Uniseed Management Pty Limited and a 50% interest in BioCurate Pty Limited, both of which are considered associates. The carrying value of associates as at 31 December 2021 is $11.366 million (2020: $11.533 million). The Group has a 50 per cent interest in the Australian National Academy of Music Limited Group, which is considered a joint venture. The Group received contributions towards the construction of two buildings, the Kenneth Myer Building and the Peter Doherty Institute, which are treated as joint operations. The policy is outlined in Note 16, in the accounting policy section called contributions received or paid for buildings.MANDATORY DISCLOSURESFINANCIALS 161NOTE 28 SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT ARRANGEMENTS AND ASSOCIATES (CONT'D) Accounting policy and judgements Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group assesses whether it has the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee by considering the rights it holds to control decisions, such as the mix between education and research, student fees and target student mix. The financial statements of subsidiaries that materially impact the Group are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. An assessment of subsidiaries for material impact to the consolidated financial statements is performed annually. The assessment includes both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of materiality. Although the Group owns less than 50 per cent of Melbourne Business School Limited Group, the Group has control and concludes no non-controlling interest (NCI) exists on the basis that the NCI has no share in the net assets. Associates and joint arrangements Significant judgement has been applied in assessing the existence of significant influence. Even though the University holds a 50 per cent interest in BioCurate Pty Limited it does not have joint control. Through the shareholder agreement, decisions about the relevant activities do not require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The associates and joint venture are individually immaterial to the Group. The Group's associates and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method the investment is initially recognised at cost and is adjusted annually for the Group's share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture. NOTE 29 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group is exposed to key financial risks including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. University Council has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Council has established the: Finance Committee: meets regularly to monitor and evaluate the University's financial management strategies in the context of the most recent economic conditions and forecasts. Investment Management Committee: monitors and advises the Finance Committee on the University's investments. Audit and Risk Committee: responsible for monitoring the assessment and management of risk across the University. Risk exposures The main risks the Group is exposed to and management's strategy for managing them are: Risk Description Strategy for management and sensitivity analysis Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Group's result or the value of its financial assets and liabilities. The key market risks the Group is exposed to are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and price risk. Interest rate risk The Group's exposure to movements in interest rates primarily relates to the Group's interest-bearing investments and borrowings. The Group manages its interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate profile of these assets and liabilities and taking action to mitigate this risk where necessary. All borrowings are subject to approval by University Council and the Treasurer of Victoria. All University borrowings are at a fixed interest rate, either naturally or synthetically through the overlay of financial derivatives. This eliminates any interest rate cash flow risk to the University on borrowings. Refer to Note 19 for details of borrowings. For interest bearing investments, if interest rates were 1 per cent lower/higher than the reporting date rates, with all other variables held constant, the Group's net result for the year would have been $7.741 million lower/higher, reflecting the lower/higher interest income earned on affected balances (2020: $8.521 million lower/higher).162 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 29 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT'D) Risk Description Strategy for management and sensitivity analysis Foreign currency riskThe Group's main exposure to foreign currency risk arises from overseas equity investments, USD denominated debt, and future revenues and payments in foreign currencies. The Group is mainly exposed to US dollars.The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk exposure within its investment portfolio. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Foreign exchange risk on principal and interest payments on foreign-currency denominated long-term borrowings is managed through the use of cross currency interest rate swaps (fixed to fixed), whereby a foreign currency exposure is converted to a functional currency exposure. These financial instruments are hedge accounted. The Group's hedged position includes AUD equivalent of $183.050 million (2020: $183.050 million) of non-AUD denominated debt exposure being managed at an average hedge rate of $0.72 (2020: $0.72). The impact of the hedging relationship is outlined in Note 22 for the notional amount and carrying amount. Fair value changes of the effective portion of the hedge are outlined in Note 23. There are no ineffective portions of the hedge. The Group entered into forward contracts to hedge USD and CHF foreign exchange exposures during the year, with contracts to buy USD equivalent to AUD 4.706 million at an average foreign exchange rate of $0.75, contracts to sell USD equivalent to AUD 2.657 million at an average foreign exchange rate of $0.78, and contracts to buy CHF equivalent to AUD 0.305 million at an average foreign exchange rate of $0.67 (2020: Nil). These hedges are not hedge accounted and all changes in fair value are taken to the Income Statement. At the reporting date, if the Australian dollar weakened/strengthened by 10 per cent against the relevant foreign currency investments with all other variables held constant, the Group's net result would have been $31.246 million lower/higher (2020: $13.053 million lower/higher), due to changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. Price risk The Group has a significant investment in marketable securities included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, which exposes the Group to price risk. To manage this risk, the Group has invested its funds with Fund Managers and maintained a diversified investment portfolio. The majority of the equity investments are of a high quality, are publicly traded on equity exchanges and are mainly included in the S&P/ASX 200 Index. At the reporting date, if the value of marketable securities was 10% lower/higher with all other variables held constant, the Group's net result would have been $318.781 million. lower/higher (2020: $250.184 million lower/higher), due to changes in fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. The Group has a significant exposure to electricity price risk, given the significant amount of expenditure incurred for utilities.To help manage this risk the Group has contracted substantially all of its forecast electricity load for the next 10-years via two Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). These PPAs are: The Melbourne R enewable Energy Project, a PPA executed directly with the Crowlands Wind Farm as part of a consortium of significant energy consumers coordinated by the City of Melbourne. This has been classified as a derivative, refer to Note 22; and The Murr a Warra Wind Farm where the Group executed a PPA directly with the wind farm. This has been classified as a lease. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises from financial investments, derivative counterparties and the Group's receivables from customers.Financial investments and derivative counterparties are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists. The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored. The Group does not have any material credit risk exposure to any single receivable or group of trade receivables. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by characteristics of each customer. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group has established an allowance for impaired receivables that represents their estimate of expected losses in respect of receivables. An analysis of the ageing of the Group's receivables at the reporting date has been provided in Note 13. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.Liquidity risk is managed by University management and overseen by the Finance Committee through maintenance of sufficient liquid assets and borrowing facilities, and active monitoring of cash flow forecasts.

The aggregate fair value of borrowings at reporting date is $540.639 million (2020: $639.264 million). Refer to Note 19 for the carrying amount of borrowings. Key estimates and judgements Note 30(c) outlines the key estimates and judgements used by the Group in measuring the fair value of financial assets and liabilities. Accounting policy The Group categorises assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a hierarchy based on the level of inputs used in measurement. L evel 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. L evel 2: inputs other than quoted prices within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. L evel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). The level in the hierarchy is determined by the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Fair value measurement of non-financial assets is based on the highest and best use of the asset. The Group considers market participants' use of, or purchase price of the asset, to use it in a manner that would be highest and best use.164 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 30 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONT'D) (b) Fair value hierarchy 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Consolidated $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Recurring fair value measurements at 31 December 2021 Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 3,187,813 1,694,389 1,493,424 - Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income 242,566 211,836 - 30,730 Investments in subsidiaries * 4,544 - - 4,544 Derivative financial assets (held-for-trading) 7,464 - Total financial assets 3,442,387 1,906,225 1,500,888 35,274 Non-financial assets Property, plant and equipment ** 5,568,104 - 1,189,139 4,378,965 Assets held for sale 42,082 - - 42,082 Total non-financial assets 5,610,186 - 1,189,139 4,421,047 Financial liabilities Borrowings *** 540,639 - 540,639 - Cross currency interest rate swap 6,833 - 6,833 - Derivative financial liability (held-for-trading) 24,769 - 23,451 1,318 Obligation to pay cash to third parties 39,832 - - 39,832 Refund liability 335,882 - - 335,882 Total liabilities 947,955 - 570,923 377,032 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Recurring fair value measurements at 31 December 2020 Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 2,532,215 1,434,289 1,097,926 - Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income 194,441 122,239 - 72,202 Investments in subsidiaries * 4,544 - - 4,544 Derivative financial assets (held-for-trading) 39,450 - Total financial assets 2,770,650 1,556,528 1,137,376 76,746 Non-financial assets Property, plant and equipment ** 5,180,352 - 1,063,029 4,117,323 Assets held for sale 40,109 - - 40,109 Total non-financial assets 5,220,461 - 1,063,029 4,157,432 Financial liabilities Borrowings 639,264 - 639,264 - Cross currency interest rate swap 40,737 - 40,737 - Derivative financial liability (held-for-trading) 11,676 - 9,349 2,327 Obligation to pay cash to third parties 28,091 - - 28,091 Refund liability 265,677 - - 265,677 Total liabilities 985,445 - 689,350 296,095 * There are several immaterial subsidiaries that are not consolidated, as such investment in these entities are not eliminated from the Group.

(c) Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 and Level 3 fair values Land and buildings (Levels 2 and 3) The fair value of land and buildings was determined by independent property valuers, Colliers International Consultancy and Valuation Pty Limited, who have appropriately recognised qualifications and experience.Given the nature and use of the education-related buildings together with limited comparable sales on a going-concern basis, it is an accepted valuation methodology to carry out a current replacement cost analysis of the buildings to which the market value of the land is added, based on its existing use. Transport, services, zoning, heritage registration, environmental issues and condition and repair were considered in valuing the buildings. The cost approach adopted for the building component is considered to utilise Level 3 inputs. The direct comparison approach is used to value a number of buildings located outside of the University's campus. The direct comparison approach in this process is considered to utilise Level 2 inputs. Land with a community service obligation of greater than 10 per cent is considered to use Level 3 inputs as the unobservable input is considered significant. Valuation for the other remaining land properties is categorised as Level 2, based on the inputs to the valuation, using the market approach.Works of art and other collections (Level 3) The fair value of works of art and other collections was determined by independent valuers, Simon Storey Valuers, having appropriately recognised qualifications and experience. Random statistical sampling is used to value the larger collections. The sample valuations are projected to estimate total value using the number raised estimation methodology. Due to the unique nature and use of the collections there are limited comparable sales therefore, the valuation is considered to utilise Level 3 inputs. Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (Levels 2 and 3) The fair value of financial assets that are not traded in active markets is determined using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data, where it is available, and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 166 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 NOTE 30 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONT'D) (d) Fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) The following table is a reconciliation of Level 3 items for the periods ended 31 December 2020 and 2021: Land BuildingsWorks of art and other collectionsService concession assetsAssets classified as held for January 813,782 2,664,057 Transfer from construction in progress - 51,334 - - - - - 51,334 Depreciation - (67,960) - (14) - - - - - (14) Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 - (11,643) - - - - - (11,643) Assets classified as held for sale (38,930) (1,179) - - 1,179 - - Additions - 20,934 165 - - 3,364 (81,946) (57,483) Transfer from construction in progress - 21,920 - 190,916 - - - 212,836 Disposals - (18) - - - (81,783) - (81,801) Depreciation - (69,862) 3 to Level 2 - (4,885) - - - - - (4,885) Transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 - 1,020 - - - - - 1,020 Balance (377,032) 4,079,289 Quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements are summarised in the table below.

Professor Duncan Maskell Ka terina Kapobassis Vice-Chancellor Chief Financial Officer 26 May 2022 26 May 2022STATEMENT BY THE VICE-CHANCELLOR AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FINANCIALS 175 Independent Auditor's Report To the Council of The University of Melbourne Opinion I have audited the financial report of The University of Melbourne (the university ) and its controlled entities (together the consolidated entity) which co mprises the: consolidated entity and university statements of financial position as at 31 December 2021 consolidated entity and university income statements for the year then ended consolidate d entity and university comprehensive income statements for the year then ended consolidated entity and university statements of changes in equity for the year then ended consolidated entity and university statements of cash flows for the year the n ended notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies statement by the Vice Chancellor and Chief Finance Officer. In my opinion the financial report is in accordance with Part 7 of the Financial Management Act 1994 and Division 60 of the Australian Charities and Not-for- profits Commission Act 2012, including: giving a true and fair view of the financial position of the university as at 31 December 2021 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended complying with Australian Accounting Standards and Division 60 of the Australian Charities and Not -for- profits Commission Regulations 2013. Basis for Opinion I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Audit Act 1994 which incorporates the Australian Auditing Standards. I further describe my responsibilities under that Act and those standards in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of my report. My independence is established by the Constitution Act 1975 . My staff and I are independent of the university in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) that are relevant to my audit of the financial report in Victoria. My staff and I have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 176 ANNUAL REPORT 2021 2 Council's responsibilities for the financial report The Council of the un iversity is responsible for the preparation of a financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards , the Financial Management Act 1994 and the Australian Charities and Not-for- profits Commission Act 2012 , and for such internal control as the Council determine s is necessary to enable the preparation of a financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial report, the Council is responsible for assessing the university 's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so. Other information The Council are responsible for the Other Information, which comprises the information in the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2021 , but does not include the financial report and my auditor's report thereon. My opinion on the financial report does not cover the Other Information and accordingly, I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on the Other Information. However, in connection with my audit of the financial report, my responsibility is to read the Other Information and in doing so, consider whether it is materially inconsistent with the financial report or the knowledge I obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work I have performed, I conclude there is a material misstatement of the Other Information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report As required by the Audit Act 1994 , my responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on the audit. My objectives for the audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can ar ise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the university's internal control evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Council FINANCIALS 177 3 Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report (continued) conclude on the appropriateness of the Council's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the university's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's repor t to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the university to cease to continue as a going concern evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the university and the consolidated entity to express an opinion on the financial report. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the university and the consolidated entity. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion. I communicate with the Council regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. I also provide the Council with a statement that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on my independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
