This requirement establishes the basis for long -term development of professional behaviors and ethical reasoning with regard to client care. Nurses are expected as professionals to provide eth ically sound care to all clients regardless of circumstance. Ethics is an integral part of the foundation of nursing. Nursing has a distinguished history of concern for the welfare of the sick, injured, and vulnerable and for social justice. This concern is embodied in the provision of nursing care to individuals and the community. Nursing encompasses the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the protection, promotion, and restoration of health in the care of individuals, families, group s, and communities. Nurses act to change those aspects of social structures that detract from health and well - being. Individuals who become nurses are expected not only to adhere to the ideals and moral norms of the profession but also to embrace them as a part of what it means to be a nurse. The ethical tradition of nursing is self -reflective, enduring, and distinctive. A code of ethics makes explicit the primary goals, values, and obligations of the profession. The Code of Ethics for Nurses served the f ollowing purposes: It is a clear, concise statement of the ethical obligations and duties of every individual who enters the nursing profession. It is the professional's nonnegotiable ethical standard It is an expression of nursing's own understanding of its commitment to society. PROCEDURE: Nursing students of Missoula College UM are expected to follow the following Nursing Code of Ethics. These are documented in each course syllabi as professional behavior and included as part of the final course grade.

Provision 7 The nurse, in all roles and settings, advances the profession through research and scholarly inquiry, professional standards development, and the generation of both nursing and health policy. Provision 8 The nurse collaborates with other health professionals and the public to protect human rights, promote health diplomacy, and reduce health dispa rities. Provision 9 The profession of nursing, collectively through its professional organizations , must articulate nursing values, maintain the integrity of the profession, and integrate principles of social justice into nursing and health policy.

Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 86 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Communicable Disease Policy Number: S27 Effective Date: Nursing REVIEWED/APPROVED BY: Level I: Nursing Faculty ( December 2015) Level II: Administrative Council (Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: Communicable Disease policy of preventive practices in clinical Rationale: Nursing program students are required to adhere to Nursing program policies on health screening tests, immunizations, and preventive practices described below as well as those for clinical agencies which may have additional requirements. Program Director a nd faculty will inform students of agency policies which differ substantially from the Nursing program. Students are expected to provide evidence of immunizations at each registration period. Students without valid documentation of appropriate immunization s will be denied access to the clinical setting . Students who cannot meet the requirements listed in this policy for medical reasons should provide documentation with rationale from their health care provider. The Nursing Program Director must receive any exception request in advance of clinical coursework placement. Procedure: I. TUBERCULOSIS POLICY: All nursing students must be screened annually for tuberculosis (TB). Initially, a two-step skin test or Quantiferon blood test must be done to provide a baseline. Each student is responsible for providing evidence of screening for TB. RATIONALE : TB can be rendered non -communicable with appropriate treatment for those individuals who have a positive test. The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the Quantiferon blood test are both used to detect tuberculosis. PROCEDURE (TB): 1. Students are required to present evidence of negative results of the ir initial TST skin test or Quantiferon blood test prior to entering the program . 2. Students with a positive test will be referred to their health care provider for assessment of risk and will be required to provide written clearance from their health care provider to provide patient care. II. MEASLES , MUMPS, RUBELLA (MMR) POLICY : All nursing students must provide evidence of adequate immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. RATIONALE (MMR) : Measles, mumps, and rubella can be prevented through routine vaccination. Vaccination is indicated for individuals who do not have adequate documentation of immunity. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 87 PROCEDURE (MMR) : 1. Students are required to provide documentation of measles, mumps, and rubella immunity prior to entering clinical nursing courses. Persons born later than 1957 may be considered immune with documented physi cian diagnosis, lab evidence of immunity or appropriate documentation of immunization. This includes vaccination against MMR, specifically on or after the first birthday of two doses of live measles vaccine separated by>28 days, one dose of mumps vaccine and at least one dose of live rubella vaccine. Serologic testing is not necessary for persons who have adequate immunization documentation. III. HEPATITIS B POLICY : Prior to entering undergraduate or graduate clinical nursing courses, students are requi red to present documentation of serologic evidence of immunity by positive titer. RATIONALE (HepB) : The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states \"all health -care providers and students should receive hepatitis B vaccine according to current CDC recommendations ( 37,45,63). Vaccination ( 2-or 3-dose s eries) should be followed by assessment of hepatitis B surface antibody to determine vaccination immunogenicity and, if necessary, revaccination. Health -care providers who do not have protective concentration of anti -HBs (>10 mIU/ml) after revaccination (i .e., after receiving a total of 6 doses) should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc to determine their infection status ( 37).\" http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6103a1.htm . Many clinical agencies used for clinical nursing courses require HBV immunizations for students and faculty. PROCEDURE (HepB) : 1. Students are informed that documentation of HBV immunity is required prior to beginning clinical coursework. 2. Undergraduate and graduate students will be required to show proof of a positive titer prior to entering clinical coursework. 3. Students who do not respond to the primary vaccine series should complete a second three - dose vaccine series or be evaluated to d etermine if they are HBsAg -positive. Revaccinated persons must be retested at the completion of the second vaccine series. Persons who prove to be HBsAg -positive should be counseled accordingly. Primary non -responders to vaccination who are HBsAg -negative should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled regarding precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or probable parenteral exposure to HBsAg -positive blood. (See TABLE 3, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, December 26, 1997, Vol. 46, No. RR -18, pg. 23.) 4. Effective Fall, 1993, students are required to present, prior to entering clinical nursing courses: a. Documentation of serologic immunity [Responder is defined as a person with ad equate levels of serum antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (i.e., anti -HBs >10 mIU/mL); inadequate response to vaccination defined as serum Anti -HBs < 10 mIU/mL.] OR b. Documentation of immunization series with plan for final titer and revaccination or booster as indicted (see #3) OR c. Documentation of completed review by the appropriate Associate Dean with statement of exemption from immunization requirement and waiver f orm signed by student. IV. VARICELLA: All nursing students entering clinical nursing courses must provide evidence of adequate immunity to varicella by titer or documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine. RATIONALE (Varicella) : Varicella immunity is provided by previous infection or by vaccination. Vaccination is indicated for individuals who do not have a positive titer. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 88 PROCEDURE (Varicella) : 1. Students are required to provide documentation of adequate immunity through documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine or a positive varicella titer prior to entering clinical nursing courses. 2. If a student's varicella titer level is negative, the stu dent must receive 2 doses of vaccine at an interval of 4 -8 weeks between doses. Post vaccination titer after 2 doses of vaccine is not necessary or recommended. V. TETANUS, DIPTHERIA, ACELLULAR PERTUSSIS (Tdap): All nursing students must provide evidence of Tdap vaccination per procedure. RATIONALE (Tdap) : Reduce the incidence of pertussis in the U.S. population especially infants who have the highest risk of complications. PROCEDURE (Tdap) : Prior to entering clinical nursing courses, students must re ceive a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible if they have not previously received Tdap. Although Td booster doses are routinely recommended at an interval of 10 years, an interval as short as 2 years from the prior dose of Td is recommended for the Tdap dose among HCW. Tdap is not licensed for multiple administrations. After receipt of Tdap, HCW should receive Td or TT for booster immunization against tetanus and diphtheria according to previously published guidelines. ( MMWR , December 15, 2006). VI. INFLUENZA : Annual influenza immunization of health care workers (HCWs) is recommended to prevent the transmission of the virus to persons at high risk for influenza -related complications and severe disease ( MMWR 6/06) VII. SMALLPOX POLICY: In the event a student is required to receive smallpox vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for site care will be followed. RATIONALE (Small Pox) : After vaccination, this live virus is present at the vac cine site and can be spread through contact. To avoid this, the vaccination site must be cared for carefully until the scab that forms after vaccination falls off on its own (in 2 to 3 weeks). PROCEDURE (Small Pox) : Until the scab falls off on its own, students will not be allowed to participate in clinical lab. VIII. STANDARD PRECAUTION POLICY: Students are expected to follow Standard Precautions in order to prevent contact with HIV, HBV, and other blood -borne pathogens. RATIONALE (Standard Precaution) : Since medical history and physical examination cannot reliably identify all patients who are infective, all body fluids shall be considered potentially infectious materials. According to the concept of Standard Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, HCV and other blood -borne pathogens. PROCEDURE (Standard Precaution) : 1. \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens; Needle sticks and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule\" Federal Register. January 18, 2011; Vol. 66, No. 12, pgs. 5318 -5325 or most current guidelines will be f ollowed as the reference sources. 2. Students will have access to the current guidelines at each campus. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 89 3. Examples of general guidelines are listed. Students should also follow agency guidelines in clinical practice. 4. All students will attend an annual prese ntation on Standard Precautions or pass the Standard Precautions - Human Blood borne Pathogens (BBP) Training Exam provided by the University of Montana Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). University of Montana's Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Cont rol Plan can be found at: http://www.umt.edu/research/compliance/IBC/bbp.php . GUIDELINES (Standard Precaution) : All health care workers should routinely use appropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and mucous membrane exposure when contact with blood and other body fluids of any patient/ client is anticipated. Gloves : Gloves must be worn when it can be reasonably anticipated that there may be hand contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes or non -intact skin. Gloves must be changed after contact with each patient. Hand Washing : Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Hands should be washed immediately when gloves are removed. Gowns : Gowns or aprons must be worn when in direct contact with the patient if there is likelihood that your clothing may be soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials. Masks, Eye Protection and Face Shields : Masks, in combination with eye protection devices or chin length face shields will be worn whenever spla shes, spray, spatter or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated. Sharps : Contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps (scalpels, broken glass, a nd wire) shall not be bent, broken, recapped or removed. Contaminated sharps are discarded immediately or as soon as feasible in closeable, puncture resistant, leak proof, labeled containers. Specimens : Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials must be placed in a container which prevents leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage or transport. Resuscitation Equipment : When in a clinical setting, the student should assu re that a resuscitation bag, pocket mask and oral airway or other ventilation devices are readily available for emergency use. To minimize the need for emergency mouth -to-mouth resuscitation, mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices sho uld be available for use in areas in which the need for resuscitation is predictable. Cleaning Spills of Blood and Other Body Fluids : 1. Wear gloves. Initially clean area using disposable towels. 2. Decontaminate area with an appropriate germicide or a 1:100 solution of household bleach. Cleaning equipment should be disposed of as infective waste. 3. Wash hands following removal of gloves. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 90 Linens : Handle as little as possible with minimal agitation to prevent contamination to air or persons handling linen. All soiled linen should be bagged at location where it is used. Linen soiled with blood should be placed and transported in bags that prevent le akage. Disposal of Hazardous Wastes : Materials from skills labs or clinical experiences involving contaminated materials (i.e. needles, lancets or other equipment contaminated with blood) need to be disposed of properly. Each campus should make arrangeme nts to have these materials disposed of in accordance with CDC regulations. Additional Precautions : 1. Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm and handling contact lenses are prohibited in areas where there is a reasonable likelihood of oc cupational exposure. 2. Food and drink must not be kept in refrigerators, freezers, shelves, cabinets or on countertops or bench tops where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present. 3. Students/health care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis should refrain from all direct patient care and from handling patient -care equipment until the condition resolves. Pregnant students/health care workers are not known to be at greater risk of contracting HIV infection than health ca re workers who are not pregnant; however, if a health care worker develops HIV infection during pregnancy, the infant is at risk of infection resulting from perinatal transmission. Because of this risk, pregnant health care workers should be especially fam iliar with and strictly adhere to precautions to minimize the risk of HIV transmission. IX. HIV TESTING POLICY: Nursing students who believe they may be at risk for HIV antibody have an obligation to be tested. While the testing decision should be voluntary for the individual, there may be instances in which testing could be required. Education, training and confidentiality safeguards will be used to encourage those who believe they might be at risk to be tested. Nursing students are encouraged to b e screened for HIV as part of their routine medical care as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RATIONALE (HIV) : An HIV antibody positive nursing student may require modification/accommodation of clinical education to limit add itional risks to the personal health of the student and to limit performance of \"exposure prone\" procedures with clients. (Position Statement, March, 1992, AACN; Position Statement on HIV infection and nursing students, February, 1992. ANA; MMWR 1989; 38 [ S-6:15]; Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 [P.L. 101 -336].) PROCEDURE (HIV): 1. Inquiry into HIV status is not part of student application processes. 2. Qualified individuals cannot/will not be denied admission to nursing program on the basis of H IV status. 3. Nursing program informs students of potential infectious hazards inherent in nursing education programs including those that might pose additional risks to the personal health of HIV positive persons. 4. Students who are HIV positive or who have AIDS may not pose a health risk to other students in an academic or residential setting. In a college lab or clinical setting the CDC guidelines and Standard Precautions must be followed. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 91 5. Clinical settings that pose additional risk to the personal health of HIV positive students should be identified, and such persons should be advised of these risks and urged to consult their health care provider to assess the significance of risks to their own health. 6. Students who know they are infected should be urged t o voluntarily inform a designated official in the Nursing Program who will provide information and referral on health care and counseling and begin a process to assess the need for necessary accommodations prior to beginning clinical coursework. Such accom modations will be crafted on a \"case by case\" basis by a group designated for that purpose. 7. Any accommodations in clinical experience for HIV positive students should take into account the nature of the clinical activity, the technical expertise of the infected person, the risks posed by HIV carriage, functional disabilities and the transmissibil ity of simultaneously carried infectious agents. 8. HIV status records will be kept separately from academic files and will be accessible only on a need -to-know basis with the individual student's written consent. Regulations and statutes related to confiden tiality apply to these records. Release of this data without authorization will be treated as a breach of confidentiality. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 92 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Pregnancy Policy Number: S28 Effective Date: 11/2007 Revised Nursing REVIEWED/APPROVED BY: Level I: Nursing Faculty ( December 2015) Level II: Administrative Council ( Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: A student who is pregnant may continue in clinical practice as long as her health status is satisfactory and she is able to complete her clinical assignment without undue risk to herself or the fetus. Rationale: Women in developed countries are increasingly exposed to environmental, chemical and biological toxins, chemical compounds and pollutants that may have an adverse effect on a women's reproductive and general health and the health of their children and unborn children accordi ng to Davidson, London and Ladewig, (2008). Students at the Missoula College UM nursing program are requested to carefully consider exposure and to limit exposure to the following occupational hazards during all stages of pregnancy based on recommendation s of Davidson, London and Ladewig (2008). Exposure to toxoplasmosis Exposure to rubella Exposure to cytomegalovirus Exposure to herpes simplex Exposure to hepatitis B, C Exposure to HIV Exposure to radioisotopes and X -Ray therapy Procedure: 1. Students w ho are aware they are pregnant are asked to notify the Program Director or nursing faculty as soon as possible. 2. Students are asked to adhere to recommendations of limited exposure to the above listed concerns; however, no guarantees can be made. 3. Student s may be asked to present documentation from health care provider allowing students to participate in clinical experiences if students and/or faculty are concerned regarding exposures or if students are required to be on bed rest. 4. Incompletes and withdra wals will only be considered based on program policies. Reference: Davidson, M., London, M., & Ladewig, P. (2008).

Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 93 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Student Clinical Placement /Schedules ) Administrative ( Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: Clinical Placement of S tudents Rationale: Clinical experiences are intended to foster student growth in self -awareness, understanding of others, sensitivity to cultural, moral, ethical, and legal issues, the application of critical thinking/judgment, and the technical and interpersonal skills fundamental to the practice o f nursing. At the Missoula College UM Nursing Program, the faculty emulates this nursing philosophy by assisting students in the clinical setting to advance in knowledge, responsibility and accountability through structured guidance in order to develop int o increasingly competent, independent members of the health care team. The clinical setting promotes students to venture out of the classroom and laboratory setting and develop skills of nursing practice and socialization into the nursing profession. Students are placed in clinical facilities that meet Missoula College criteria for students such as: Clinical facility and Missoula College UM have signed an agreed upon Affiliate Agreement The institutions/agencies are reasonably accessible geographically. o Rural sites may be used for clinical rotations. The institutions/agencies hold the licenses required by the State of Montana and are fully accredited by the appropriate bodies. The nursing philosophy of the institution/agency is consistent with the philo sophy of the Missoula College Nursing Programs. The administration and nursing staff are supportive of practical and registered nursing at the associate degree level and there is an interest and a willingness to cooperate in providing a climate for student learning. The nursing staff at agencies and clinical facilities is comprised of sufficient professional nurses who demonstrate quality nursing care and who serve as effective role models for student learning. The resources utilized for learning experience s include the quantity, quality, and variety of clients needed to meet the clinical objectives. The institution/agency cooperates with the Missoula College Nursing Programs to assure that faculty is oriented properly. Current policy/procedure manuals are a vailable for use with access to information on computers within the facility. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 94 Procedure: ASN -RN Student Clinical Placement 1. Students in the f irst semester are exp ected to use critical judgment and assessment skills in the Foundations Lab and Pharmacology Lab to meet program outcomes of application and ability to demonstrate safe and competent care. Students unable to perform at a safe level in the skills lab will have a plan of action initiated by the lab instructor with input from the st udent to promote student success. 2. In the second and third semesters, students are expected to advance nursing skills, critical judgment and professional behaviors consistent with the novice professional nurse under the supervision of the clinical instructo r, clinical preceptor, or staff nurse . Ratios of student to faculty do not exceed 10:1. 3. Students in the fourth semester will be placed in a preceptor learning environment in Managing Client Care Clinical. Students enrolled in this course will be paired with a Charge Nurs e, Manager, Supervisor, or Director to learn the basic principles related to the supervision of nursing practice and management of resources. 4. Students in each semester are expected to achieve program outcomes and performance criteria cons istent with the objectives ou tlined by the course instructor on the student clinical evaluation form. All criteria on the student clinical evaluation form need to be met at the \"Developing\" or \"Satisfactory\" level by the end of each clinical rotation. Any student performing at the \"Needs Improvement\" or \"Unsatisfactory\" level at the end of the clinical rotati on will receive a failing grade in that clinical course. 5. Students at t he conclusion of the program are expected to achieve levels of behaviors and skil ls consistent with analyzing data, integrating nursing practice in the clinical setting , and setting priorities to formulate and provide effective nursing care at the level of the advance beginner professional nurse. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 95 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Acceptable Clinical Performance in Nursing Policy Number: S30 11/2007 Level I: Nursing Faculty ( December 2015) Level II: Administrative Council ( Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: Acceptable Clinical Performance in Nursing Rationale: Unsatisfactory completion of clinical in nursing courses indicates that academic performance is not at the level required for successful completion of course objectives and learning activities. Additionally, clinical learning opportunities must be allocated to students who successfully demonstra te satisfactory achievement of course objectives and learning activities since clinical resources are finite in that: the number of opportunities for student experience in the clinical setting are controlled to maintain quality patient care and student/fa culty ratios are regulated to provide adequate supervision of all students. Clinical are those courses in which the majority of the experience requires direct patient/client care or interaction. Procedure: 1. A non-passing grade in a clinical course prohibi ts continuation in the nursing curriculum. 2. Unsatisfactory completion of the course results in removal from the nursing program. 3. Students receiving a non -passing grade in any nursing courses will receive a program withdraw a. Students can then reapply at a l ater time or b. Depending o n ability of class size and other class considerations to accommodate may be able to retake next semester per faculty and Nursing Program Director discretion . 4. No nursing program course may be repeated more than twice. If a course is not completed with a passing grade with the second attempt, the student is no longer eligible to reapply to the nursing program. 5. Exceptions can be made for emergent circumstances (which subsequently resolve) as determined by the Program D irector and faculty. 6. Reasons for unsatisfactory completion grade in clinical results from, but not limited to, Lack of performance with HIPA A & Patient Confidentiality regulations Patient safety Unacceptable professional behavior Request of the clinical facility Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 96 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Student Refusal of Clinical Assignment Policy Number: I: Nursing Faculty ( December 2015) Level II: Administrative Council ( Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: Student Refusal of Clinical Assignment - A student is expected to provide nursing care to any assigned client for whom the student has been taught the content and skills to provide safe care. If a student refuses to care for such an assigned client, the fo llowing procedure will be used. Rationale: The primary aim of the Nursing Program is the education of persons for professional nursing practice. Students must know and follow established guidelines for professional practice consistent with the American N urses' Association Code of Ethics (2015 ), and provide care for all patients assigned unless previous arrangements made with the nursing faculty. It is expected that in the course of clinical teaching, negotiations about assignments to meet course objectives will typically occur when there are special circumstances such as pregnancy, student health problems, etc. The following procedure will be used in situations which are exceptions to the above when an adequately prepared student refuses to provid e nursing care to an assigned client. Procedure: The following procedure applies to refusals over the entire program, not just in a single clinical course. 1. The first time a student refuses to provide nursing care to a client: a) She/he will have a conference with the faculty making the assignment. Discus sion will include the reasons for refusal and a plan to deal with similar patient assignments in the future. The discussion will include current clinical information and support to the student if such, depending on the situation, might dispel fears or prob lems that the student has about the assignment. The discussion will include information about Codes of Ethics, the NLN Essentials Document and the role of the professional nursing student. b) If possible, a comparable assignment to meet course objectives wil l be given for that clinical day. A note summarizing the refusal and conference will be placed in the student's academic record by course instructor. The Program Director will be informed of the refusal. 2. The second time in the program that such a refusal occurs, the student will: a) Have a conference with the faculty member. b) Be sent home with a clinical absence for the day and Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 97 c) Be asked to schedule a conference with the Program Director and the teacher making the assignment. The discussion will include information as above (1.a). For those unable to resolve the reasons for refusal, reevaluation of career objectives should be part of the discussion. d) A note summarizing the refusal and conference will be placed in the student' academic record. 3. The third time in the program that a nursing student refuses to provide nursing care to an assigned client: a) The faculty members an d Program Director, in consultation with the Health Professions Chair and/or Associate Dean, may remove the student from all clinical settings. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 98 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: Removal of Students From Clinical Setti ngs (Denial of Access to Clients) Policy Number: S32 Effective Date: 04/2008 I: Nursing Faculty ( December 2015) Level II: Administrative Council ( Fall 2013 ; Summer 2017 ) Policy Description: Removal of Students fr om Clinical Settings (Denial of Access to C lients) Rationale: A faculty member has the authority to remove a student from the clinical setting when a student fails to conform to reasonable standards of performance or behavior or when, in the judgment of the faculty member, reasonable supervision is inadequate to insu re patient welfare. Reasonable standards of performance are defined in the Student Handbook and in the Student Conduct Code http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/student_conduct.php Removal of a student from a clinical setting is a very serious matter. Each student must be provided an opportunity to achieve clinical course objectives and given an opportunity to learn from an error unless the behavior is so egregious that a patient may be at risk even with clinical supervision by the faculty member. While the decision to remove a student for a single assignment period can be made independently before notifying the Nursing Program Director, decisions to remove a student for the remainder of the course or from all clinical settings are made in consultation with the Program Director, the Health Professions Chair and /or the Associate Dean. Procedure: A student may be denied access to patients in the following ci rcumstances. The procedure differs in each instance. A procedure for each type of denial of access to patients is given below. I. A single clinical assignment period II. The remainder of the course; III. All current and remaining clinical courses. I. Procedure for Removing a Student from the Clinical Setting or Denial of Access to Patients for a Single Assignment Period . A. When a faculty member determines that a student cannot proceed safely in the clinical setting during a specific clinical assignment period , the faculty member does the following: 1. Informs the student of the reason the student must leave (e.g., not prepared to provide safe care, symptoms of an illness that place the client at risk, evidence of use of and/or impairment from drugs/al cohol, unethical c onduct, etc.); 2. Ensures that the student safely leaves the clinical area (e.g. by calling agency security; arranging for the student to be transported home safel y by a cab or a family member); Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 99 3. Informs the Program Director , if necessary , verbally and in writing (student contract ), of the above action; and 4. Provides follow -up guidance to the student. II. Procedure for Removing a Student from the Clinical Setting or Denial of Access to Patients for the Remainder of a Course . A.

Reviews the recorded documentation of the relevant incident(s), 2. Informs the student in a conference of the observed behaviors and of the faculty member's concerns about th e student's well -being and/or client safety, and 3. Discusses with the Program Director the observed behaviors and/or learning problems identified, the guidance/teaching strategies employed (and their outcomes) , and the rationale for a recommendation to remo ve the student from the clinical setting. B. The Program Director examines the situation and discusses it with the Health Professions Chairs and/or Associate Dean. 1. The faculty member meets with the Program Director and provides a written decision with rationale and conditions for reinstatement in the clinical setting for the specific course (if appropriate). 2. The Program Director may need to talk with faculty members teaching concurrent clinical courses and with the student before coming to an understanding of the situation. 3. The Program Director makes a determination of whether or not the faculty member's rationale for a recommendation to remove the student from the clinical setting is soundly based. 4. The Program Director meets with the faculty member and discusses the recommendation of the faculty member as a result of the fact finding. 5. The faculty member then informs the student of the decision, rationale and condi tions in a student conference. C. The student may continue non -clinical work in the course (attend class, etc.) but will receive a non -passing grade for the course. D. Coursework is unaffected in other courses in which the student is enrolled. Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 100 IV.

Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 101 Missoula College University of Montana Nursing Program Policy Title: At-Risk Student Policy Number: S33 Effective Date: 07/2023 BY: Nursing Faculty ( July 2023 ) Level II: Administrative Council Policy Description: Students who are at risk for failing a course or courses in the nursing program due to academic, behavioral and/or personal issues will be identified as soon as possible to allow for remediation. If a student is determined to be at ri sk, a plan for remediation is initiated. Remediation may be considered when a nursing student: Does not meet the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) as identified on clinical and/or lecture course outcomes Needs additional time and/or support before completin g a course Does not demonstrate the skills and/or personal attributes necessary to succeed as a nurse Rationale: Nursing students must develop professional, ethical and behavioral skills to successfully practice nursing. Part of the faculty's job is to h elp guide and mentor for the development of these skills. Ultimately, it is up to the student to follow through with faculty recommendations, remediation plans, behavioral contracts and referrals to support services. Our At -Risk Student Policy allows the s tudent to participate in the Remediation and Intervention processes. Procedure: I An At -Risk Student will be identified II A Remediation Plan will be developed III A Warning to the Student of Potential Failure may be issued IV If Remediation is unsuccessful, the student may fail the course and/or the nursing program I Definitions of an At -Risk Student: 1) A student who has missed deadlines for required documentation (TB, CPR, vaccines, etc.), or other required orientation materials. 2) A student with excessive absences (see Professionalism Rubric) in at least one nursing course per semester. 3) A student who is repeating a nursing course or who has been reinstated into the nursing program for any reason. 4) A student who is borderline failing (< 80%) in one or more nursing courses. 5) A student who has been identified by a clinical instructor as unsafe or unprofessional. 6) A student who has demonstrated at least one unprofessional and/or unethical behavior while in the nursing program. This applies to the classroom, lab, and clinical settings. 7) A student with communication difficulties, whether due to a language barrier, lack of communication with instructors, a lack of socialization/interaction with peers, poor Missoula College UM Nursing Program Policy and Procedures Manual (rev. 08/2023 ) Page 102 communication with clinical site staff, an d/or a lack of engagement in the educational process. 8) A student who has extenuating circumstances outside of the nursing program that cause additional stress, such as severe financial stressors, prolonged illness or other health issues, legal issues, death of a loved one, work schedule conflicts, etc. 9) A student whose performance and/or behaviors have caused other faculty and/or students to come forward and report their concerns. II Develop a Remediation Plan 1) Once an at -risk student has been identified, the course instructor will complete the \"Nursing Student Remediation Plan\" document and will review it with the student. See Appendix A 2) Since knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes are learned over time and must be reinforced, at the end of each semester, faculty who have identified an at -risk student must present their documentation (a copy of their completed \"Nursing Student Remediation Plan\", and/or \"Warning to the Student of Potential Failure\", and/or any other relevant documentati on) to the faculty who will be teaching that student the foll owing semester. This will ensure continuity for the student and the faculty. 3) Students who have displayed unprofessional, unethical and/or behaviors that are inappropriate will receive a remediat ion plan that includes an explanation of the behaviors, and may be required to complete additional assignments and/or be required to sign a contract that will extend the duration of the nursing program. Students will be warned in writing if further behavio rs could result in dismissal from the program. 4) Students who have verbalized and/or appear to be struggling with personal issues will be provided with resources to improve their chances of success. These resources may include a referral to the Curry Health Center Counseling services , information regarding local support groups, a list of outpatient mental health providers, education about scholarships and opportunities, crisis hotline phone number, Office for Disability Equity, etc. III A Warning to the Student of Potential Failure may be issued at the same time as the Remediation Plan. See Appendix B. IV If Remediation is unsuccessful, the student may fail the course and/or the nursing program.

The process is not intended to replace course curriculum or course requirements but to supplement the student's learning. The remediation process is initiated to address the following situations: academic jeopardy (i.e., low quiz/exam scores), lack of clinical competency (i .e., failing a clinical or lab competency , unsafe behavior in the clinical environment, medication errors), and/or lapses in professional judgment (i.e., tardiness, absenteeism, unprofessional behavior). If a student is struggling in multiple areas, se parate remediation plans are established for each at -risk behavior. The remediation process is initiated by faculty as soon as an atrisk student is identified. The faculty member is responsible for meeting with the student to discuss the identified co ncerns and develop an individualized remediation plan. The remediation plan must be documented on the form \"Nursing Student Remediation Agreement\" (see attached) and meet the following guidelines: The Remediation Plan must clearly describe the area( s) of deficiency. Remediation outcomes must identify specific, measurable goals the student must attain or perform to demonstrate success. Remediation activities must be individualized to the student's area of weakness. They may include, but are not limited to, completion of suggested computerbased practice tests, written review materials, practice questions, instructordeveloped materials, handson laboratory skill practice, or any other materials/methods suggested by the faculty. A time fram e for completion must be agreed upon and documented in the remediation plan. The remediation form must be signed by faculty and student.
