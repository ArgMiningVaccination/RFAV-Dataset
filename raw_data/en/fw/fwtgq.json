The practice of Reiki involves the use of energy to balance and harmonize the mind, body, and spirit. It is a gentle, non-invasive therapy that can be used to help alleviate physical, emotional, and spiritual issues. Below are some of the many benefits of Reiki. 1. Reduces Stress and Anxiety One of the primary benefits of Reiki is its ability to reduce stress and anxiety.
