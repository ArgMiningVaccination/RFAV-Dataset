It is a hands-on treatment that is delivered through clothing, so there is no need to remove any clothing for this treatment. We all have energy centres located in the body called Chakras which can become misaligned and out of balance with day-to-day stresses and experiences. This gentle yet effective energy healing system aims to restore and rebalance the chakras and energy pathways, called meridians, to facilitate the body's own natural inclination to heal itself. Through the non-invasive placement of hands on the body at particular point on the body, the intelligence of the energy flows to the places in which healing is needed the most. Quite often, through the communication of the energy with the therapist, the therapist can 'pick up' areas on the body that have suffered trauma, or surgery which the therapist will discuss with you at the end of the session. Sekhem Sekhem, much like Reiki, is a hands-on healing therapy, using energy to facilitate the body's own natural healing responses. Unlike Reiki, Sekhem is an ancient Egyptian system, believed to be taught by the priesthood in the temples of ancient Egypt. Sekhem is believed to be more powerful than Reiki, working on the 5 Energy Bodies simultaneously. This results in the avoidance of any prolonged healing difficulties and is a great aid in spiritual development. Whereas in Reiki, the therapist starts at the head, using Sekhem, the therapist starts at the feet as Sekhem draws on the grounding energy coming up from the earth. Both therapies are given through clothing and are non-invasive treatments. Why not book yourself a relaxing Reiki or Sekhem appointment to relax, restore and rebalance. Start Living Your Best Life "}
