There are a number of non-chemical solutions that are just as effective when it comes to preventing and eliminating unwanted pests in commercial facilities. Our pest management experts have developed and currently deploy a wide variety of natural alternatives. Clark's Chemical-free Pest Control Options: - Pest Exclusion is the cornerstone of an effective integrated pest management (IPM) program since it works by denying pests access to your commercial facility. Our experts perform a top-to-bottom inspection of your facility to identify potential entry points, and then recommend corrective actions to secure them. - Cultural practices include maintaining good sanitation habits, regularly rotating products and providing up-to-date employee training; these go a long way towards avoiding pests. - Vacuum pest control physically removes pests from your facility and is often the most efficient way to reduce the pest population. - Heat extermination uses both volumetric heat and the direct application of hot vapors to eliminate pests. Volumetric heat penetrates and treats targeted areas of your facility by raising controlled temperatures to a lethal level. We also apply direct hot vapor applications to enable dry steam to raise the temperature of an immediate area (spot treatment) to a lethal level. - Removal and repair of door and window frames, HVAC vents, openings in the foundation, or furniture - which is either allowing access to pests or has been infested - to immediately stop the infestation and prevent future incidents. - Pheromone-Baited Traps are highly targeted and extremely effective pest deterrents for most stored-product pest species. They can detect specific pests, and work well for stored products in restaurants, grocery stores, pet stores and large and small food-processing plants and warehouses. These insect-emitted, naturally occurring chemicals are used to attract other like insects or keep them away.
