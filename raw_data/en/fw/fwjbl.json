This effort requires wide participation and collaboration of private healthcare providers to reach children who might not otherwise receive vaccine because of financial barriers or who might receive vaccines late because they would be referred to another setting for free vaccines. This federally funded program supplies vaccine free of charge to participating providers. The vaccine may then be made available to children up to 19 years of age who are: - Medicaid Enrolled - Uninsured (child has no health insurance coverage) - Underinsured (seen in a Federally Qualified Health Center or Rural Health Center) - American Indian or Alaska Native Georgia Gateway Your practice may also see children enrolled in the [PeachCare for Kids Program](http://dfcs.georgia.gov/peachcare-kids), which is administered by the Department of Family and Children Services (DFCS). While a child enrolled in the PeachCare for Kids Program is fully insured, your office will use state-supplied vaccine for these children. All claims for vaccines administered to PeachCare for Kids participants will be filed and reimbursed through either DCH or its contracted Care Management Organizations (CMOs). The VFC Program allows providers to immunize eligible children for a nominal administration fee. The maximum administration fee a provider may charge is $21.93 per injection. Providers may also charge an office visit fee. Annual Training Requirements All staff responsible for managing state supplied vaccine are required to complete 2 online training modules annually. If you are a primary or secondary contact and you have not completed the course, please do so. Once complete, keep a copy of your completion certificate and be sure to include your VFC PIN# on the certificate to receive credit for completion of the course.
