The repeated falls, the endless skids, mud coatings all over the bike and the rider \u2014 they lend a weird sense of satisfaction. It's a strange and fulfilling fetish. But it can also be dangerous. \"GO, GO, GO...\" It's been nine years but I still remember shouting crazily to my friend ahead. We were filled with dread, piercing focus, and the regret that we'd not even be able to leave a loving note for our families if we got consumed by the landslide. With the throttle maxed out, we rode relentlessly for a couple of kilometres before coming to an equally rapid stop with the rears sliding, and reflected on the horror that we'd escaped \u2014 only just. The slush was unimaginable \u2014 the worst I'd seen in years. It was near Marhi en-route Rohtang Pass that the roads were non-existent and the monsoon had wrecked havoc with incessant downpour for a couple of nights in the entire region. We trundled along; carefully negotiating the waterfalls that got formed out of nowhere, surging down in anger on the already perilous road. Barely a few metres after yet another fording, a rock the size of a tennis ball hit my helmet and I almost lost balance on the bike and suggested we stop to measure the damage to my fancy headgear. But we both knew deep inside that it wasn't for that; it was to stop and breathe, ease up the chill in the spine and gather our senses. Once my legs had stopped shaking, we carried on. There was something about that stretch \u2014 both of us felt uneasy riding it. We'd stopped once again due to exhaustion, and just then we could feel the layer of ground under our feet shake. We knew instinctively that we'd meet our maker if we didn't get out of that place immediately . Suddenly , bodily exhaustion seemed to have been drowned by the sudden rush of intense energy and determination. As I thumbed the bike's engine to life, its vibration caused a part of the ground to slide off. We simply got on the gas and went hell for leather. In the rear view mirror I could see a part of the mountain going down. Once the noise had faded and the surface felt firm, we stopped to take stock of what had happened. We'd managed to escape a serious landslide; we'd managed to escape death. And that's when we laughed, cursed and were overcome with myriad emotions. We felt, weirdly , more alive than ever. The ride from then on was totally epic! The stories from our contributors that you'll read elsewhere in this monsoon special issue made me remember this ride from several years ago. Tell us if they made you recount some crazy monsoon adventures, too. Drop in digital letters or tag us on your posts on social media. It'll be awesome to read your stories.

In 1890, Dr brookes invited baron p ierre de Coubertin where the two discussed brookes' dream of an Olympic revival to be staged in athens.

Having ample experience in understanding the need gaps and the challenges that existed for women, she explored existing young businesses in the women's health space that she could invest time and money in. However, with a few investors, she decided to create original solutions in this space. The thought for The Woman's Company (TWC) germinated in Anika's mind when her daughter was hitting puberty. She wondered if there were certifiably biodegradable, organic, soft, and rash-free products which would enable her daughter to continue her level of normal activity even while she was menstruating? This question birthed TWC. The Woman's Company was launched on 8 March 2020 \u2014 International Woman's Day \u2014 and faced its first setback barely a few days into operation as the lockdown was announced. Being a primarily D2C brand, TWC found customers repeating their purchases and believing more in the brand with their loyalty. Anika believes Anik A PArAshA r Founder and CEO, The Woman's Company (TWC)that consumer spending will be far more cautious in terms of casual purchases and also with making more educated and well thought out choices. We feel more and more confident that The Woman's Company products are seen as valuable choices to make. The Women's Company (TWC) entered the women's intimate and hygiene space with six products \u2014 Sanitary Pads, Panty Liners, Tampons, Menstrual Cup, Bamboo Razor and Urination Device. Different women of different ages need different products and services. TWC has consciously designed the products with industry differentiators in order to offer the best experience to its users. For example, the sanitary napkins and panty liners are ergonomically designed to fit the Asian-sized body type and comfortably sit under the body curves of Indian women. The pads are free from the very harmful dioxins which are mostly found in all available products of personal hygiene. The urination device are plastic- free, foldable and easy to carry. The tampons are made of 100% organic cotton and have cardboard applicators while the menstrual cups are made up of medical grade silicon. TWC even offers specially designed Teenage Pad for young girls. An Intimate Affair A brand by women; for women. The Woman's Company was born out of the desire to provide the best personal hygiene solution to women across age brackets TWC invested nine months in the initial phase of R&D and to identify the right ingredients that would go into making the various products. Its manufacturing base is in India and abroad but the packaging is done domestically and the company has ensured affordable pricing for its users. All its products pass through multiple quality checks before reaching the hands of women.

The Woman's Company was launched on 8 March 2020 \u2014 International Woman's Day \u2014 and faced its first setback barely a few days into operation as the lockdown was announced. Being a primarily D2C brand, TWC found customers repeating their purchases and believing more in the brand with their loyalty. Anika believes Anik A PArAshA r Founder and CEO, The Woman's Company (TWC)that consumer spending will be far more cautious in terms of casual purchases and also with making more educated and well thought out choices. We feel more and more confident that The Woman's Company products are seen as valuable choices to make. The Women's Company (TWC) entered the women's intimate and hygiene space with six products \u2014 Sanitary Pads, Panty Liners, Tampons, Menstrual Cup, Bamboo Razor and Urination Device. Different women of different ages need different products and services. TWC has consciously designed the products with industry differentiators in order to offer the best experience to its users. For example, the sanitary napkins and panty liners are ergonomically designed to fit the Asian-sized body type and comfortably sit under the body curves of Indian women. The pads are free from the very harmful dioxins which are mostly found in all available products of personal hygiene. The urination device are plastic- free, foldable and easy to carry. The tampons are made of 100% organic cotton and have cardboard applicators while the menstrual cups are made up of medical grade silicon. TWC even offers specially designed Teenage Pad for young girls. An Intimate Affair A brand by women; for women. The Woman's Company was born out of the desire to provide the best personal hygiene solution to women across age brackets TWC invested nine months in the initial phase of R&D and to identify the right ingredients that would go into making the various products. Its manufacturing base is in India and abroad but the packaging is done domestically and the company has ensured affordable pricing for its users. All its products pass through multiple quality checks before reaching the hands of women.

Ira Trivedi shares what she integrates into her routine as soon as the monsoon arrives to help her well-being during the season and into the seasons that followThe magic of monsoon there is always something about monsoon and petrichor that invokes mystique. After a blazing summer, when the clouds burst, it is as if the Gods have blessed us with more than just water \u2014 it feels as if they have blessed us with a new lease of life. For me the monsoon brings with it a renewed sense of well-being. I can finally turn off the drying AC and be outside without feeling as if I'm about to get a heat-stroke. This simple change can make a marked difference in personal yoga practice. But there are a few pit-falls that the monsoon brings with it as well. As per Ayuveda, this is the season to watch out for \u2014 it when infection thrives, and Ayurveda encourages us to pay special attention to self-care. In fact, Ayurveda prescribes monsoon as the best time for undergoing their signature \"Panchakarma\" treatment, where the body goes through an intense detox. Here are a few things that I integrate into my routine as soon as the monsoon arrives, and over the years I have seen that these help my well-being during the monsoon and into the seasons that follow. Let's begin with my nightly ritual. I make my own massage oil by combining organic sesame oil with my favourite essential oils \u2014 at the moment this is lavender, which is also great for sound sleep. I rub this oil over my body for five minutes making sure to massage the joints \u2014 the area behind my neck, behind my knees, my ankles and my wrists. Hair care can be a nightmare during the monsoon \u2014 with frizz and hair fall \u2014 so taking care of the hair is important. Firstly , I keep my hair shorter during the monsoon than any other season, and make sure to get monthly trims. I also oil or pre-condition my hair before I wash it. This doesn't need to take more than a few minutes. I oil my scalp before I brush my teeth and wash my face, yoga during this season is helpful outlooK traveller 23 yOg a radar and then I wash off the oil in the shower. A point to note \u2014 to fend off infection and negative energy , during my shower, I splash some water with pink salt dissolved in it on my body . This makes all the difference. A lot of people experience breakouts in this season because of excess sebum production, so the skin does require a bit more care than usual. I do this by using a face mask once or twice a week. For me, clay masks work really well during monsoons. To make this process a bit more convenient, I apply a mask before shower. Sometimes during a short work-from-home break, I refresh by applying a face mask and taking a 20 minute power nap. Make sure to wash the face frequently using a gentle face wash. A little tip here \u2014 I like to use aloe-vera gel based in the monsoon. If you want to do the same, make sure to invest in an organic product, or better yet, grow your own aloe-vera plant. Now, about the asanas. Though a downpour makes me want to practice invigorating and intense postures; I have understood over the years that the monsoon is a time to slow down, and not to speed up. Downpours are nature's way of asking us to remain indoors (plus the pandemic, of course) and to curtail movement. It is important to maintain a daily practice of yoga, but also to do a gentler practice \u2014 longer holds, calmer postures focussing on restoration and renewal. It is also crucial to make a few dietary changes. If you're non-vegetarian, cutting down on meat is advisable, including (especially) sea-food. It is also important to cut down on dairy products, and instead eat more vegetables (not raw, but gently steamed or cooked). I tend to drink warming soups in this weather and include a lot of khichri, our very own Indian super food, in my diet as much as possible. The spices that we cook our khichri with \u2014 turmeric, black pepper, cumin \u2014 are wonderful for our immune system. It is tempting to have many cups of steaming chai in this weather, but a better beverage is hot ginger water (boiled with cinnamon for 20 minutes gives it an extra zing) and plenty of herbal, non-caffeinated, non dairy teas. Try my favoruite Ayurvedic super beverage \u2014 CCF, which is cumin, coriander and fennel seeds mixed in equal proportions and boiled with water. Last tip for this monsoon season is to try and include a few minutes of meditation in your daily routine \u2014 even five minutes can be enough. The monsoons are truly a meditative time that encourages all of us to move inwards. Meditation can be more powerful during this time than any other time of the year and yogis have always used the monsoon to retreat to their caves for sadahana. The pandemic has given us good reasons to take our self-care routines seriously , and there is no better time to start than during the lively monsoons.

Writers have been savouring the monsoon for millennia. Its rains are life-giving and life-affirming, as Kalidasa's lovely lines about the monsoon attest \u2014 \"a source of fascination to amorous women, the constant friend to trees, shrubs and creepers, the very life and breath of all living beings, this season of rains\" . More than a quarter of a century ago, the Scottish writer Alexander Frater travelled to Kerala to witness the beginning of the monsoon, and then travelled north, tracing its path across the length and breadth of India. His Chasing the Monsoon remains a classic and his monsoon route well worth emulating by the intrepid traveller. Of course, Kerala does not have the wettest place on earth - that's in Assam - or even host the wettest place in south India (which is in Karnataka), but it offers the earliest, and arguably the most intense, onset of the monsoon. It also receives a great deal of rain, with spectacular floods causing major devastation in 1924, 2018, and 2019.Why is the monsoon so special? As V lmki put it in the Ramayana: \"For nine months, the sky drank the ocean's water, sucking it up through the sun's rays, and now gives birth to a liquid offspring, the elixir of life. \" That sense of release makes the monsoon the most anticipated season. The monsoon means the resumption of life, as nature, in the poet Arundhati Subramanian's phrase, turns fluid and magical and green. One poem tells us that the rain brings with it a shining resurrection, a world freshly washed. Another lyrically describes the sprouting grass \"pushing up earthen umbrellas\" . Kerala, the place of the monsoon's arrival, looks forward to it with anticipation each year, since time immemorial. Chandrotsavam, a 14th century epic poem in Malayalam, rhapsodises about how the monsoon rain flies across the ocean to nurture Kerala, \"like a mother to her child\" . The rhythms of Malayalam poetry are influenced by steady drumbeat of the pouring rains. As a Sanskrit verse puts it, \"the rain falls, keeping the beat, like vee s in a concert. \" Ancient Indian literature is redolent The monsoon shashi tharoor pHOTOGRapHS: SHUTTERSTOCKoutlooK traveller 25 radar with the monsoon. Sanskrit poems imagined the earth heaving to receive her lover, the rains. An ancient Tamil poem contains the brilliantly evocative image: \"In love our hearts have mingled like red earth and pouring rain\" . There are references to the first uneven drops that herald an approaching storm, the great blowing wind that precedes the oncoming rain. The immortal Kalidasa, in his Meghadhutam, writes that \"the vault of heaven is overly impregnated with massive clouds... they glisten like the blackened nipples of bosoms of pregnant women, ready to rain the elixir of life on the lips of her offspring\" . Poets refer to its petrichor, the smell that the earth gives off just after rain, and also to the softness of the wind after a rainstorm. The M cchakaika of udraka has an equally effective description: \"the world closed; the sky by Indra's thunderbolt, seems to be pouring down; the lightning is the slippery gold chain on Indra's elephant. \" The monsoon also affects how people conduct their lives. As torrential rain lashes Kerala during the month known as Karkidaka maasam (usually mid-July to mid-August), most Hindu families mark it by prayer and devotion. Elders call the month Ramayanam maasam, a month to read the epic daily . For the monsoon is also a time for readers, an opportunity for quiet, for calm introspection, for the contemplation of words.

It could hardly have been on account of the weather. The winters are a long haul of misery with sometimes as little as six hours of light \u2014 not sunlight but a weak diffused greyish idea of light. Summer offers much longer days but that often translates into a curtailed sleep, for the sharp sunlight penetrates through thick curtains, however hard you try to block it. In my short work trips to Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway , I couldn't fathom the cause of this happiness. Is it a pretence, I wondered? It was only after I moved to Scandinavia in 2009 that I began to peel layer after layer of what makes these societies happier than most. These are factors which are so interwoven in the social fabric that many first-time visitors tend to miss noticing them \u2014 as did I. One of the major contributors to this happiness factor is the work-life balance. Rarely have I seen my colleagues work over the weekends, or late on weekdays. Moreover, the concept of summer vacation, which in India seemed to me like a relic from the good old school days, is well alive and kicking here. Almost everyone takes anywhere between three to four weeks off in the peak of the summer months of July and August. The summer days are spent relaxing on the beach or walking the woods, but never too far away from home. The idea of travelling far off to another country during these vacations is a rarity . Instead, Scandinavians prefer to go to their summer house, which could be as close as within 20 kilometres of where they live. Again, I was surprised with this arrangement for I thought the idea of vacationing was always to travel to exotic locations and not retire to a wooden house with basic necessities. \"Well, distance is irrelevant. It is important to disassociate from your daily environment completely and relax in entirety , \" said a good friend, Lars, when I asked him about this arrangement. Yet another important factor contributing to better work-life balance is the gender equality that's a given in society . The women do not have to shoulder the burden all alone. For instance, a new mother gets more than a year off on maternity leave. Six months of paternity leave for new fathers is also pretty common. Scandinavians are far more independent and do not necessarily have their parents come over for longer durations to take care of their newborns.Apart from the work-life balance, another reason why Scandinavians thrive is the social structure that provides security . A case in point is the strong pension system that ensures that people don't have to actively plan for their future but instead the government takes care of this need. The robust pension system is fuelled by the taxes which are quite high \u2014 as much as 60% of the monthly income. However, the peace-of-mind that comes with it makes this tax pinch worth it. The taxes also fuel the healthcare system, which in turn ensures that everyone has access to basic healthcare for free. The whole idea of stepping into a hospital, getting a timely checkup and getting out without paying anything was bewildering at first. I couldn't quite believe it. But that's the beauty of the Scandinavian model. There are several factors that go into making a happy society . Size is another one. All these countries have small populations which makes the management of complex schemes (healthcare, pension) easy . Research has shown that people living in close harmony with nature are generally happier, and that's another thing that's true for Scandinavians. The more years I spend in Scandinavia, the more I am learning about what makes these societies happier than the rest. While the concept of happiness is subjective, I have come to learn that it's about security , fairness and long-term thinking. Finally , some of my initial bewilderment is melting away and after spending so many years here, I am perhaps also becoming a happier version of myself. T a typical scandinavian town square IllUSTRaTIOn: nITIn CHaUDHaRy nitin chaudhary Happiest in the worldauG ust 2021 28 radarwheelinG solo 28 i have sPent a siGnificant Part of the past few years travelling solo, riding through some of the most interesting routes in India, Nepal and Tibet. As I was on a motorcycle, I expected that the question I would be asked the most was \"kitna deti hai? (How much mileage do you get?), which could well be the most favourite question Indians like to ask. But many people I met along the way were more surprised by the fact that I was travelling alone. While some were curious about it, most came at it from a pre-conceived notion that it didn't make sense\u2014even though they had never tried it. I have, in fact, met several people, in big cities and small towns alike, who strongly believe that the entire purpose of travel is defeated if you don't have company . After all, how can you have fun or be happy if you are all by yourself? I think about it differently , of course, and here is why it works for me. I like to travel by myself because it lets me remain fluid. I get to choose when I go, where I go and, most importantly , the pace at which I go. It lets me prioritise my preferences without affecting another person's experience. It allows me the freedom to have my fill of a place (a town, a monument, a view or a particularly scenic road) before I decide to move forward, and also leaves me the option to blitz through places without even turning to look whenever I may choose to do so. I have enjoyed travelling all by myself because it is phenomenally convenient. I have also discovered that travelling solo can often be more \"social\" than travelling in a group. Rather than something I do alone, I look at it as a trip that anyone can be a part of (axe murderers and the like excluded, of course). It leaves me open to meet and interact with more people than I ever would have if I were travelling with companions. When I travel with a group, most activities and interactions are restricted to the people within the group. But, as a solo traveller, I am more likely to find new people to speak to wherever I go. In fact, I have noticed that more people feel comfortable striking up a conversation with me when I am alone. It's not a familiar conversation like one would have with a friend, but it is informative, relevant and, quite often, enjoyable. This sense of approachability has often led to meeting many new and interesting people, who have helped me in different ways\u2014some of whom have even gone on to become dear friends. I travel solo because this way I actually get to travel. There have been countless occasions when I have not ended up doing something simply because the schedules of my desired travel companion(s) didn't match. This way , at least, I do go. It may not be the same as it would have been with those other people, but it's also not the same as not going anywhere at all. Overcoming the hesitation (or fear?) of doing this alone opened up many more opportunities and possibilities for me. There is no denying that there are periods (some long, some short) when you do things all by yourself and it can sometimes get lonely . I use these times to collect my thoughts and digest my experiences. I know I would seek out this time for myself even if I had company . I realise this is probably the part that does it in for most people. What's important to know and remember, though, is that while you might sometimes feel lonely , you don't ever actually have to be alone. How you travel or who you travel with is a matter of personal preference. I certainly do not believe there is any one better way to go about it. I do, however, believe that developing an ability to do things by yourself can be hugely empowering. And my solo travel expeditions have been crucial learning experiences that have enabled me to develop a sense of independence in thought and action that reflects in many other aspects of my life too.

From the crowd that is. But calls of the hiking boots swelled like the monsoon clouds, waiting impatiently to dunk all below. By autumn 2020, it was impossible for me and my girlfriend, Mallika, to not heed the call \u2014 of the mountains or the jungle or someplace other than Delhi. The long lockdown had ended, Covid cases were declining, and Uttarakhand offered a window. We knew we had to go. Now, Covid hasn't entirely gone away and the protocols such as social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces were very much there. Our travel plan must agree with the rules and so we cottoned onto the idea of going deep into the Himalayas and giving our pins their long-pined-for exercise. Of all the options, trekking ticked the most boxes. And why not? A solitary walk in the woods is perhaps the perfect pandemic activity , tailor-made for social distancing. Even a guided trekking tour on popular trails up there is a lot safer than travelling in a city . Besides, it brings much-needed money to remote communities dependent on tourism, which is ravaged by the pandemic. There couldn't have been a better time to explore and enjoy solitude. This year, after the second wave of Covid and when the Himalayas open up again, the post- monsoon season will hopefully offer an incredible opportunity for trekkers. Last October, Mallika and I visited Gangotri for two separate three-day treks. The first took us to Gomukh, a source of the Ganga at the yawning mouth of the Gangotri glacier, and then to the stunning Tapovan meadow. Returning to town, we set off for the second hike to the awe-inspiring *you can trek to nundkol Lake and gangabal Lake via Koulsar Lake, which lies at the base of the sacred harmukh peak, one of the highest in the valleythe following days, we trekked through lush meadows of satsar and gadsar v alley, crossed Zajbal p ass, visited the bakerwal house made of mud and logs, and saw shepherds lazily grazing their flock of sheep a tent in the Gangotri national sanctuary against the Bhagirath peaks auG ust 2021 42outlooK traveller 43 gangOtRI eXpLore lake of Kedartal.

A trekker can drive on a paved road to Gangotri, at 3,100m, and hike in a single day to the foot of the mountains above 6,000m. Few places in the world offer such powerful mountains so accessibly . The mountains of Gangotri have a deep- seated spirituality . the r oad to gangotri Mallika and I got our PCR tests and hopped on a flight from Delhi to Dehradun. A taxi took us up the long, spectacular route into the Himalayas, through Uttarkashi to Gangotri. The unending ridges were hypnotic, full of hill villages and terraced fields. We bought fresh local fruits and vegetables as snacks. By the time we reached Gangotri, darkness and cold had enveloped the land. Dawn revealed Gangotri as a stunning town squeezed between vertically forested ridges, above the glacial Bhagirathi river. We finalised our permits, hired local guide Rakesh Rao and hit the trail on our first hike to Gomukh. hiKe1: t o GomuK h and tapovan The trail climbed into a picturesque valley bursting in all pigments of colour. Autumn has touched the land, painting the leaves orange and gold. The Bhagirathi raged milky-blue through chaotically strewn boulders, below textured granite slopes. Rugged wooden bridges lay high across streams. When the stunning pyramid of Bhagirathi peak appeared in the afternoon, we used its snowy promises to pull us forward as the challenge of altitude increased. We planned to sleep at the 3,775m Bhojwasa camp, but had not yet acclimatised. Our packs felt like lead. Only a herd of wild Bharal, Himalayan Blue Sheep, provided some relief from the uphill grind. Finally , we crested a ridge to a view beyond belief: the whole Bhagirathi mountain in front of us, immense yet graceful, catching the orange glow of the setting sun on its snowy summit. Before dawn, we were hanging in a welded metal a bridge enroute Gomukhbox on a cable above the roaring Bhagirathi. We were the first to cross that morning. The trail continued up the widening valley , arriving in a tremendous boulder-field. This brutal no man's land, left behind by the glacier retreating at 25m a year, made for a surreal hike. taPovan and the Mouni Baba The glacier's famous mouth loomed ahead at Gomukh. Instead of visiting it right away , we scrambled up a rocky slope to the high meadow called Tapovan. It lies far above the great buckling form of the glacier, right at the foot of stupendous summits. We pulled ourselves over the last boulders onto Tapovan and saw a full panorama of rock and ice. The beauty of Mount Shivling smacked us in the face as its perfectly proportioned ridges sliced into the sky above 6,500m. We continued to the small, rock-built ashram that houses Tapovan's lone hermit\u2014 Mouni Baba, the quiet one, because he took a decade-long vow of silence. He has lived alone in this remote abode for 14 years. He is proof of willpower, enduring through the winters at such an altitude. Luckily , Mouni Baba has opened up to the world. He was happy to receive us, and we found him surprisingly young, witty , and urbane. His voice was barely audible, but the glint in his eye exuded warmth. When Mallika told him that she had grown up in Bombay but now lived in Delhi, he joked about the idiocy of such a manoeuvre. He was happy to hear an Situated amidst the diverse religious tapestry of temples, mosques, gurudwaras, and monasteries in the northwestern Indian hills, Gangotri holds a special place as the Ganga's fount. mICHaEl HEnRyauG ust 2021 44gangOtRI eXpLore unending flow of town gossip from Rakesh.

The cave lived up to its name, looking like a yawning mouth dropping chunks of ice the size of tennis balls. Mallika scooped up some sacred water to bring back to her grandparents. It is fascinating to realise that the Ganga, central to the lives of so many people, begins right here. The walk back down to Gangotri town the next day felt like a victory lap. The October weather delivered, and we cruised under deep blue skies. We were much more used to the altitude than the groups coming up the trail towards us. Some were geared-up trekkers, but others were families in jeans and with walking sticks. It was inspiring to see people of different ages and fitness levels pushing themselves higher and higher. Each minute of the hike demonstrated why we go through the efforts of permits, transport, and planning to reach such heights: a glorious combination of natural beauty , physical health, and the satisfaction of a goal well achieved. After so many months indoors in Delhi, this was utter bliss. We coasted into town with sore feet and high spirits. hiKe2: t o Kedartal Lake The next hike promised different challenges than the route up to Gomukh and Tapovan. The goal was a legendary lake called Kedartal, in a steep, narrow, and wild valley above Gangotri town. There are no pilgrims or lodges, and only a few places flat enough even to pitch a tent. The route started aggressively , switchbacking up a near-vertical pine forest. We were well- acclimatised from the first hike, though, and churned uphill easily . With the steepest part behind us, we fell into a smooth rhythm through stunning, healthy forests and waterfalls. The wild aspect of this trail unfolded with scrambles across rocky slopes.

That improved lives. He said people now keep their cows in buildings better than their own houses in 1991. By late afternoon, we broke through the last trees into a sloping scrubland above 13,000 feet. The autumn's paintbrush on grasses and flowers made every patch of ground complex and beautiful. The massive form of Mount Thalay Sagar muscled into view. The highest mountain of the trip at 6,904m, its conical form and snow-capped snout made it look like a massive spaceship ready to take off. Walking right towards the spaceship, with clouds swirling around it like exhaust fumes, it felt like humanity had selected us for a mission to the stars. We were taking our final walk on our native Earth. And what a walk it was: the valley ridges were topped with sharp spires, the glacial river rushed far below, and green life strived through every crack in the rock. We reached camp dog tired from the heavy packs and relentless uphill. Camp was a small platform on a steep hill, utterly exposed, but with spectacular mountain views in every direction.

Progress was slow but we strained forward to the dream of Kedartal. We crested a final ridge and there it was. Even among the long list of impressive mountain lakes, Kedartal stands alone. It is marvelously deep blue, and sits right at the base of sheer cliffs that top out 2,000m above. The lake's soft curves provide a stunning contrast to the harsh rock and ice all around. Seeing this with our own eyes made the whole trip easily worth it. Perfect afternoon lighting highlighted the complexity of the Himalayan landscape, with deep ridges and fissures spreading through the rocks like braided rivers through sand. down to the Lowlands We made it back to camp in time for a dazzling sunset on the immense form of Thalay Sagar. The snow peak turned gold, then pink, then a deep purple. We marvelled at it endlessly as the air chilled and cleared, seeming to bring the mountain closer and closer. Far better entertainment than any TV show can provide. The last day on the trail flew by , all downhill. Lower altitude, and the fragrant pine and birch forests, brought a feeling of easy contentment. We reached Gangotri, and said goodbye to the gorgeous pilgrimage town with its shops full of brass urns for Gomukh water. The local autumn rhythms entertained us on the long drive down. At Dharali village, famous for its orchards, succulent apples overflowed the tables of street-side markets. Past Harsil, a rowdy flock of sheep flowed like a river down the road, making their yearly migration downhill. We reached Uttarkashi in the dark and saw the lights of at least seven different weddings strung out across the hills. Dusshera had coincided with the relaxing of Covid restrictions to allow these joyous gatherings. After a week in the wild, it was deeply comforting to return to a panorama of human happiness, strung out in flashing bulbs and blasting music down the valley . It was clear that the pandemic had not wiped out the hill country's unique charms. The trek had proved good medicine for our lockdown blues, and we vowed to hit a new trail every single year.

Vrooming through all that slush, feeling the pierce of the water pellets on your chest, the engine falling in step to the rhythm of the rain. And in any case when has logic or reason ever come in the way of a great adventure? So in September 2020, when a few friends invited me to join them on a week-long motorcycle trip in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, I readily agreed. Santosh, Abi and Adi are seasoned travellers and the most passionate motorcyclists that I've met yet. They are also the brains, sweat and muscle behind The Great Indian Trail \u2014 a carefully curated and mapped route across the whole of India that uses village roads and trails instead of highways to enable a more immersive and scenic travel experience. When they offered to show me some of their favourite routes of the Great Indian Trail near Bisle and Chikkamagaluru, deep in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, I didn't have to think twice before saying yes. Like everyone else, my brain too had been slow cooking for months thanks to the lockdowns and movement restrictions. The chance of being back on two wheels, seeing new places and hanging out with good friends was just the change I needed. We scheduled this ride for October, on the assumption that the South-Westerly Monsoon would have run its course by then and left behind a beautiful and blindingly green landscape. Mother Nature, however, had different plans for us. stayinG dry is wishful thinK inG The day before I set off from Chennai to join the gang in Bengaluru, I got a message that read \" ... we might have some rain along the way . Carry your rain gear. \" Sure enough, I was welcomed into Bengaluru by cloudy skies, and by the time we started riding out of the city the next morning, we were in the midst of a full-blown downpour. Over the week that followed, the rain was a constant companion irrespective of where we went. It would let up for a few hours, we would begin to wonder if we had seen the worst of the weather, only to come down pelting more fiercely to shatter any ray of hope (or sunlight). This was not my first time riding in the monsoon, and I had arrived at the scene well prepared \u2014 waterproof liners, waterproof boots and fully-waterproof luggage too. Throughout day 1, I took the trouble to make sure that every layer was worn properly and every flap, zip, clip and buckle was secured correctly so as to form the necessary weather seals. But a couple of days into the ride, my priorities changed. I realised that trying to keep dry on the motorcycle was a losing battle and went against one of the things that I love the most about being on a bike \u2014 the direct exposure to the elements. Since the Western Ghats offer a tropical climate, I could afford to get wet without the risk of completely freezing. And so, by day 3, my rain jacket and waterproof gloves were tucked away and forgotten deep inside one of my bags. Now, this did mean that I almost always had to go through the painful task of wearing wet and cold gear every morning \u2014 the wet gloves and boots were particularly irksome. But once we got moving that initial misery was easily forgotten and replaced with a childish excitement, reminiscent of times spent splashing through puddles as kids. The real thrill of a monsoon cannot be experienced without getting wet \u2014 if you go out to play in the rain, why would you want to come back dry , right? The sooner you make peace with it, the more fun it is. But this approach only worked because I made sure to always have dry and cleanish clothes to change into at the end of the day .

The good news was that my Hero Xpulse 200 with it's mixed-use tyres seemed quite adept at this and made riding on tarmac easy and steady even when it was raining heavily . The real fun, however, began when we decided to go trail-hunting. We met a friend's friend who knew the trails around the hills near Kudremukh (meaning 'horse-face' in Kannada) very well and we decided to ride up a nearly 15-kilometre long route that he promised would take us higher up the hills and into complete solitude. When we started the ascent around 8 in the morning, the sun was out and the day held some promise of being relatively dry . The terrain and climb were not easy to tackle, but fortunately we had shown up with the right kind of motorcycles, and company for the task. Riding up a route like this alone may not have been possible, but by working together, we were able to reach the top a few hours later. What awaited us was simply out of this world. Really , it was heaven up there. There was not a soul around and wherever you looked nature had painted the most spectacular scenes. Every hill, as far as the eyes could see, was covered in a fresh coat of lush greenery . A silence fell upon us, we quietly took in the mesmerizing views, with a clear intention of staying there for as long as possible. By the time we were done napping, snacking and chilling a few rounds of rain had come and gone. The path we had ridden to the top had now effectively become a slide. Just the kind of thing that gets your adrenaline pumping. Every single one of us ended up dropping our motorcycles at some point or the other on the way back down, some in such a spectacular fashion that it would make everyone behind burst out in laughter. My heart was in my mouth on several occasions, but underneath my helmet I was beaming and having the time of my life. Riding this trail would have probably been easier in dry weather, but we would not have been able to witness the natural beauty and splendour of the Western Ghats in the rains. The richness of the monsoon, in terms of colour and life-affirming quality , is something that cannot be matched.

It is not just about taste, but also the sense of comfort and satisfaction that comes with it. it can Be a Bloody affair Having sufficiently romanticised the idea of riding a motorcycle in the rains, I must also speak about some of the harsh realities of this kind of travel. The first involves the infamous leeches of the Western Ghats. I'd heard many horror stories about the monsoon menace of leeches in the Western Ghats but hadn't experienced it on previous journeys in the region.

One of the unexpected highlights of this entire trip was the food that we found along the way . My personal favourites were the traditional home-cooked Kodagu-style meals at our homestay near Bisle, the piping hot Mangaluru buns at a shop on the route to Chikkamagaluru and a delicious fish thali at a restaurant in Kalasa. Many of these meals were phenomenal in their own right. But the frequency with which food seemed to achieve this lofty standard led me to believe that there may have been something more at play . It took me some time, but I eventually joined ROHITH aSHOKoutlooK traveller 55 KaRnataKa eXpLore the leeches seemed keen to make up for all the lost opportunities. Even though we were a group of 5 people, I seemed to be the primary (and often the only) target of the leeches. Every time we stopped, I would need to find and extract leeches of various sizes from different parts of my body \u2014 I even found one buried into my moustache! Despite all my efforts to avoid them, I would often have 20 or more blood-thirsty hitchhikers tagging along for the ride. I'm just glad that we ditched all plans to do any outdoor camping, these slimy creatures may have sucked all the blood out of me. The other draw-back was the clouds would often limit or completely cut out the scenic views. There were a few times when we rode to the top of a hill hoping to find a view point, but instead ended up being engulfed by the clouds leaving only a few metres of visibility . The excitement of being in the clouds wears out quickly , especially when you know that you're missing out on a majestic view. But the silver lining was the dramatic dance of the monsoon clouds as they moved across the sky . The way they change shape and colour depending on the time of day , dark black ones suddenly turning a purple hue when they catch a few sunrays. It takes some patience, and luck, but if you're fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time you could be in for a pretty spectacular show. would i do it again? The short answer is a resounding yes. As I said, this was not my first experience of riding in the Western Ghats in the monsoon and it definitely won't be my last. I enjoy the slower pace of travel and the unpredictable weather. I'm more likely to find quiet places because most other people are at home, hiding from the rain. I can't wait to go back to see more of the lush landscapes and to find new routes to explore. Having tackled many of my fears and hesitations of riding in the rain, I feel more in sync with the sense of freedom many of us associate with motorcycle journeys. I can't say that this kind of travel experience will be easy , safe or even pleasant to all, but for me it was enriching and deeply satisfying. The call of the rains will always beckon me.

One cherished memory is of my numerous journeys on the incredible, century- old railway route that connected Silchar to Guwahati. It was an engineering marvel. The train passed through numerous tunnels, long and high bridges, climbed steep inclines and dove into long drops. I would sit by the window and watch the lush green jungles, the blue mountains yonder, deep valleys shrouded in white clouds, cascading waterfalls and dimly-lit, small stations that looked very old England. My absolute favourites were the 37 dark tunnels and one particularly long, curved bridge along the route. I would wait to catch a glimpse of the whole train on that curve of the bridge and the two steam engines spewing smoke into the blue sky\u2014one to pull, and one to push the meter gauge train as it chugged its way up the steep incline. In September 2014, the 05697 Hill Queen Express pulled out of the Lower Halflong railway station for the last time, thus bringing the curtains down on this historic, century-old railway line. The broad gauge follows a slightly different route...the old tunnels, bridges and stations lie forgotten. I have been meaning to visit Halflong, the only hill station of Assam, and the adjoining areas, for a while now\u2014possibly just to see some of the old tunnels! So, when my friend Pranjal Baruah suggested we do a short motorcycle trip to Halflong during the receding monsoon last year, I jumped in. The monsoon lasted rather long last year. It poured heavily for a fair bit of the way when I rode down to the tea town of Jorhat in late October to join Pranjal and his three riding buddies, Gaurav Bhagawati, Monuj Hazarika and Uttam Saikia for the the district headquarters of the Dima Hasao district\u2014formerly known as NC Hills or the North Cachar Hills. Though many breathtakingly scenic places are nestled in the NC Hills, the area sees very little tourist traffic (not that I am complaining!). Perhaps for that reason, it is still relatively unspoilt. pHOTOGRapH: pRanjal baRUaHauG ust 2021 58aSS aM eXpLore Start early , finish early: This has been my motto in all these years of riding long distances; the mantra has served me well. We started out at 6 am; the destination for the day was Umrangso, the second biggest town in Assam's Dima Hasao district. After a couple of hours of riding on good open roads, the rain gods decided to open the floodgates\u2014very , very wide. The rain forced us to stop a number of times and it was a little past midday when we reached Panimur Falls on the border of Nagaon and Dima Hasao districts. The rains swelled the Panimur Falls enormously\u2014I wonder if anyone has ever bothered doing the gallons per minute calculation of the water cascading down its craggy edge. In the dry season, the water of the Panimur Falls is clear and blue, but the monsoon muddied the water, besides adding to the volume. The forests beyond the falls grow rapidly during the rains and by now had a rich, gleaming hue of greens. The raw beauty of the Panimur Falls in its untamed state had a captivating effect on us, and we spent a couple of hours there. However, angry , lowering clouds presaged a furious downpour and prevented a longer stay . At Umrangso, our final stop for the day , we stayed at a cozy little place called Sneha Lodge. NEEPCO (North East Electric Power Corporation) has a major presence at Umrangso. The corporation has built a dam across the Kopili River to generate electricity and in the process has created the picturesque Umrangso lake. The large lake and its surrounding forests attract the migrating Amur Falcons\u2014a midway stop ontheir long journey from Siberia to South Africa. We woke up to the constant drumming of rain; when it stopped we made our way to the Kopili Dam. The rains filled up the reservoir and they had to open the sluice gates to let the water out. The gushing water, frothy and foamy , is a sight to behold. A young man, brimming with information, led us to the lake and as we sat and sipped black tea, we saw a few Amur Falcons. \"The first batch came in, stayed for some days and left, \" he said. The next batch was due in early November. The greenery on the banks grew luxuriantly , and it seemed to be a favourite place for the Falcons to roost. Halflong was a long way off and the intermittent rains slowed us down a bit. It was a little after sundown that we reached our destination\u2014Nohshiring Guest House. Its owner, Mr. Balabhadra Hagjer, welcomed us with a bottle of Judima, the traditional drink of the Dimasa people. Halflong has changed a lot over the years. Good roads, nice markets, better hotels, nicely kept parks...but it has still retained the character of a small hill town, and that's what I love. It has been 30 years or so since I spent some time at Halflong, but I am glad that it has preserved its laidback style. Unfortunately , the Lower Halflong train station has changed irrevocably , and has completely lost its quaint, old-world character. It's clean, but very cold and uninviting. The warmth is missing and not wanting to further dilute its old image in my memory , I left in a very short time. Close to Halflong, Jatinga lies along the old railway line. Jatinga was in the news some years back about a rather strange phenomenon in some of its villages\u2014Amur Falcons used to die there mysteriously . Towards the end of the year, when the Falcons start coming in, there are pockets that are covered by a thick blanket of mist. According to experts, the Falcons get disoriented by the thick mist and fly towards any light that shines through it. As they dive towards the sources of light, they hit electric poles, houses and whatever is near them. The villagers also contributed toward the death of the Falcons. Now, different NGOs and the forest department have been working with the villagers towards protecting the Falcons. It has yielded very positive results. To understand the Falcon mystery a little better, we were told to go to Gorkhali village that sprawls on the top of the hill and talk to the headman. Reaching the village is an adventure in itself. In the days of yore, the rains swelled the p animur falls enormously\u2014i wonder if anyone has ever bothered doing the gallons per minute calculation of the water cascading down its craggy edge spotting a rhinoceros in Kaziranga the forest flower drenched after fresh spells the amur falcon in its element pHOTOGRapHS: SHUTTERSTOCKoutlooK traveller 59 aSS aM eXpLore a rail track leading to a tunnel in haflongauG ust 2021 60aSS aM eXpLore the expansive Barail r ange in jatingaoutlooK traveller 61 aSS aM eXpLore pHOTOGRapH: SHUTTERSTOCKauG ust 2021 62aSS aM eXpLore locals from a Gorkhali village there weren't any motorable roads to the village. People used to walk up from the old Jatinga railway station. The station is gone and so are the tracks that ran alongside. Once it fell into disuse, the jungle reclaimed a large portion of the tracks. We rode our bike on the very track, into the longest tunnel through which the iconic Hill Queen Express ran not many years back. I could have never imagined that I would be riding a motorcycle through the very railway tunnel that I crossed many times in my youth! Water still seeps through the walls of the tunnel, its moist contours flashing by as the headlight beams lit it up. On the bend, it also threw up some eerie shadows! A century after it was built, the tunnel stands strong and proud. There are many legends about these tunnels and bridges, but that is another story! The headman, Bijoy Kumar, a retired army man, filled us with information. The village had seen precious few visitors over the years and none on bikes! As evening fell, another round of Judima was drunk, to the accompaniment of more stories from Mr Hagjer at the guest house. The skies held firm in the morning and we headed out to Kaziranga\u2014a rather long way , but the roads were good. Along the way , we stopped at Maibong. I had stayed at Maibong in the early '80s with my father. I remember it as a place with lots of forests infested with leopards.

We went to see an archaeological site that has a house carved out of a huge stone. There are different legends, with minor variations, about this stone house, but all of them say it was carved out in a single night! There were few interruptions along the way and we reached Kaziranga rather late. Last year, the authorities had decided to open the Kaziranga National Park almost a month ahead of its scheduled opening date of November 1. It didn't serve the purpose, I guess. The rains didn't stop and the flood waters didn't recede completely , which meant that only a small portion of the park was open for the safari. But we could still see rhinos and elephants, and a few exotic birds as well. We went on our separate ways from Kaziranga\u2014I took another five hours or so to reach Guwahati, while Pranjal and his friends reached home much earlier. Sure, riding becomes a little difficult, uncomfortable and dangerous in the rains but the overflowing waterfalls, the lush greenery and the freshness of it all compensates for all the teething troubles\u2014 well, almost. Riding long hours in a wet undergarment remains a pain!

It is an absolute classic which I tried reluctantly back in my youth when emptying the gut on the sidewalks was routine. but that reluctance turned into enthusiasm. I never liked vodka much, and most certainly wasn't suave enough to carry off wine in style. So, I kept to my beers and whiskeys of the blended, and on the rare occasions, single-malt kind. That was when we were a bunch of binge-drinking idiots in college and didn't care for the complexities or the chemistries of whatever spirits we consumed. but as maturity settled in and curiosity for alcohol started poking my brain cells, I read literature on the different spirits. Of them, gin fascinated me. It is made from 96 percent abv (alcohol by volume) neutral grain spirit \u2014 like vodka \u2014 but the magic is done by juniper, specifically the fully grown but unripe cones. you could go on and experiment with any botanical for added layers of flavour; but to be classified as gin, the spirit must be infused with juniper. I always wondered why gin was called a 'dry' drink, and that's technically because it does not contain any artificial flavours. but if you've ever tasted juniper in isolation, you'd have felt your tongue drying out and that was always the reason in my head about gin being called a dry drink. In India, the excitement around alcoholic beverages has seen stages. There was (still is?) a time when beer simply exploded in popularity, and now it's gin that is taking the centrestage. Several folks out there are trying to create special flavours of gin and there's one Indian brand that stands out on the global stage \u2014 Hapusa. a product of nao Spirits, Hapusa won gold at the International Wines & Spirits Competition (IWSC) 2021. Its founder, anand viramani, explained that while it is a contemporary gin, it is the botanicals like raw mango, turmeric and Gondhoraj that lend the Hapusa a unique Indian texture. been a while since I sipped gin, so this comes in as a perfect primer to pour some and settle down with earthy music in the background. \u2014 ashish jha pHOTOGRapH: SHUTTERSTOCKauG ust 2021 66reGulars 66 and culture.

It is also the kind of food that uses simple ingredients that are readily available. how did the idea of house of anglo come about? It started in August 2020, when I couldn't go out and eat. I began to cherish home food and also realised that Anglo-Indian food was not easily available in Bangalore.

The day starts as early as 6:00 am. It begins with us procuring the fresh ingredients from our local farmers and our fresh meat/fish gets delivered from our suppliers. We don't believe in using frozen or bottled ingredients hence preparation takes up the morning. We also ensure an almost farm to table concept. In the case of roasts, steaks, chops and bread, our marination and kneading begins well before serving time. After the prep, the order list is rechecked and the cooking begins. Most of our sauces for the roasts and even sandwiches are made the night before because we believe in the marination time and development of flavours with time. Our day usually ends at 7:30 pm with our last dinner order being sent out. chicken dishes so my menu is mostly filled with a whole lot of non-vegetarian dishes. I designed my menu based on how I would eat at home and also got ideas from stories about how my great great grandmother would eat, which was described as more meat-oriented and vegetarian food as a side dish. The Anglo-Indian community is a meat loving one and at the table there is always more meat than vegetarian food.

While some prefer it deep fried like malpua, many actually prefer to make it in a crepe-like style pan fried with ghee. The idea of eating deep-fried or pan-fried food when it rains finds its logic in making up for the loss of serotonin levels that is caused in this weather and to adjust to this our body craves carbohydrates and the deep fried carbs do that job fairly well.

I read about the Ahom period, which began in 1228 when Sukapha, a chieftain from Mong Mao (somewhere around the present day boundaries of Assam, Myanmar, China's Yunnan region, and Arunachal Pradesh) crossed the Patkai mountains with several thousand soldiers and settled in upper Assam. He and his successors would rule Assam for six hundred years, influencing and being influenced by the tribes who already lived in the fertile Brahmaputra valley . One of the later Ahom kings, Gadadhar Singha, decided to take a group of his subjects in hand; these were the dhuds, or lazy men. (They were probably also opium smokers.) The king decided that the dhuds would build a road from Golaghat to Joypur in upper Assam. The road was built, but very slowly . I was writing, reading, and travelling while working on the novel that would turn into Keeping in Touch. A road trip up Dhudor Ali seemed like a great idea. My friend Veda came from Calcutta; we hired a car, and set off one summer morning towards upper Assam. The journey towards Golaghat was largely uneventful. We stopped somewhere for pokori, and at one point I roused from a doze to realise Veda was so bored on the straight highway that she was playing chicken with oncoming lorries while overtaking other cars. After night fell, we passed the Numaligarh refinery , and an award-winning author, anjali joseph, reflects on a unique experience she had in assam which later found space in her most recent novelRoad to Nowhere pHOTOGRapHS: SHUTTERSTOCKoutlooK traveller 75 BOOK RevIew S bacK about the book: anjali joseph is an award-winning writer.

Our hotel in Golaghat was bright and cheerful and, unexpectedly , overlooked a new cricket stadium. The next morning we got onto Dhudor Ali, and headed for Sibsagar, the old capital of Assam. Driving on the old road was slow in a literal sense; the surface was a series of potholes somehow strung together, but more than that, as Veda managed to keep the car struggling forward in first or second gear, there was a strange sense of being out of time, or in some special, slow, marginal period of time. Dhudor Ali saw only a little traffic: few cars, some cyclists, a few roadside stalls. We passed tea estates, and a forest reserve where two an elephant, ridden by two small boys, emerged from the trees onto the road. The elephant, with a ponderous, well-practiced charm, lumbered to a halt on one side of the car. I offered up a banana, but the pachyderm could smell something more interesting: Veda's bar of Cadbury's. The long, hairy trunk shot through the window, and, like the hose of a vacuum cleaner, frisked my person, while the boys nearly died laughing. We carried on, and eventually , after what seemed like days or perhaps years, turned off Dhudor Ali to arrive at Sivasagar and the jewel-box-like, rosy stone buildings of the Rang Ghar and Karenghar. A year or more later, when I was in England writing about Dhudor Ali in Keeping in Touch, what remained most clearly from the whole experience was the very slowness of the road, the syrupy nature of time as the car slowly moved forward on the uneven surface, the inescapable sense of being contentedly at the margins of activity . These, the legacy of the trip, might also be the legacy of the Dhuds, at least in this writer's imagined encounter with their realm.

In 2021 I went back to Mt. Everest where I started my first journey but this time only to scale it without oxygen. Unfortunately , I had to return from the camp due to a back injury . But the clock has been reset and I have already started training and looking forward to completing my oxygen less climb on Mt. Everest next year. In the mean while in September I will be attempting Mt. Dhaulagiri which is world's seventh highest mountain. One of the major difficulties I faced while climbing Mt. Everest was taking all the permissions, doing all the logistic in the time of lockdown, procuring all the equipment's as there are many equipment's which you cannot buy in India. It struck \"Success is a beautiful thing, but Mt. Makalu taught me how to deal with my failures.\" Lachmi Deb Roy INTERVIEWS Arjun Vajpai from Nida has been climbing 8000 plus meter mountains for the past 11 years. In 2010, he became the youngest person in the world to climb Mt. Everest at the age of 16. He has done over 13 expeditions to the mountains. Vajpai took mountaineering as a profession so that he could climb the mountains within himself. He believes mountaineering teaches one to cross all hurdles in life no matter how big it is. Every time he goes for a climb, he comes back learning a new lesson which makes him strong and look at look at things with a different perspective. Excerpts:fellow traveller 78outlooK traveller FeLLO w tRaveLLeR bacK 79 us the most at base camp as half of our team Sherpas tested positive. There were set protocols, but I would say COVID got the better of us. At base camp we could everyday see around four to five helicopters just coming into to take away the corona positive people. There were multiple cases of corona positive climbers and even with light symptoms it was getting difficult for them at that altitude. \u00bb near to death experience... It was during my climb to Mt. Cho Oyu in 2012. The experience just made me more determined and made me believe that being a mountaineer I just need to have belief in myself. I remember the winds at Mt. Cho Oyu were hostile and the temperature was 60 degrees! On the second day at the camp, I woke up with my left side paralyzed. The two Sherpas who were with me, couldn't carry me down, so they left me in the tent to summon help. I crawled for 17 hours coming down but I only remembered four hours of that journey . Luckily , I was immediately shifted to a hospital and after recovering fully , I could successfully climb Mt. Cho Oyu. \u00bb mountain v s sea... I find mountains and seas both equally wonderful and beautiful. I have related to both of them in many ways over a period of time. If it is about adventure, then there is no question for me, it will always be mountains first because it is a more \"it's a feeling of achievement and calm when you reach the top. it brings out the best version of yourself. my dream is to have a climbing wall in every school in india \"auG ust 2021 80FeLLO w tRaveLLeR bacK familiar territory and I can experiment and move around more comfortably . \u00bb what were the precautions one must take in travelling to the mountains during covid times? The most important thing before stepping out is to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. One must also be on a good healthy diet every single day regardless of where you are and not just during COVID times. Take precautions even if you are vaccinated, especially when you are travelling abroad or using a public transport as it might not be fatal for you, but we could be carriers and affect other people. This year while we were climbing Mt. Everest, COVID struck us, there were a lot of Sherpas in our team who tested COVID positive. Due to this the manpower was down and it did affect our expeditions a bit. One must take care and be extremely careful when planning any expedition during these tough times. \u00bb your favourite mountaineering experience... My favourite mountaineering experience would definitely be Mt. Kanghchenjunga and Mt. Makalu, these are the two technically challenging mountains to climb. There aren't a lot of climbers who attempt these mountains every season, I have been on these mountains with six to seven members. There have been years when across the world there were just six climbers who were attempting to scale these mountains. Being out there with \"after several attempts i was able to climb both the mountains, mt makalu and mt. Kanghchenjunga. mt. makalu made me into the person, i am today and designed me into the mountaineer\" climb both the mountains. Mt. Makalu made me into the person, I am today and designed me into the mountaineer. I never went to college, but that is the university which I went to because we were stuck on that mountain for four years. My first attempt on this mountain was in 2013, second attempt was in 2014, minimalistic manpower you do feel very tiny and humble in front of nature. Mt Makalu is the fifth highest mountain in the world and Mt. Kanghchenjunga is the world's third highest and India's highest mountain. After several attempts I was able to outlooK traveller 81 FeLLO w tRaveLLeR bacK you a feeling of achievement. Being a mountaineer takes out the best version of yourself. I would want more and more youngsters to feel this wonderful experience. Hence, we are running our adventure program in various schools. Through our company 'Climb Up' , we are trying to increase the number of climbing walls in India. My dream is to have a climbing wall in every school and institute in India. \u00bb precautions one should taking when travelling to the mountains during monsoon... During monsoon there is a very big chance of landslide, so make sure you are chalking out the route well. Make sure when you are travelling in the mountains during monsoon you have alternative routes which you can take. Do your research before the expedition and carry a map with you. Mountains have changing environment everyday so one must always stay up to date with what is happening around them. Lastly wear proper hiking shoes which will protect your ankles and carry good rain jackets.T\u00bb what is the feeling like when you reach the mountain top? It's a feeling of achievement and calm when you reach the mountain top. Every time I am out there, every time I am carving my way through the waist deep snow and every time I am chartering new places, it gives third attempt was in 2015 and finally in our fourth attempt in 2017, I was able to make it to the top. It was a very emotional four-year-long journey for me. Success is a beautiful thing, but Makalu taught me how to deal with my failures. Mt. Makalu taught me that importance of failure. tIMe tRaveLLeR bacK At a time when the world is adhering to a fad of going dairy free, there comes a long lasting nostalgic feeling with milk in Indian households. Whether it's the early morning wake me up chai or the subtle put me to sleep warm cup at night, a day in Indian households seems to begin and end with milk. Milk's long standing association with India is not only due to its culinary significance but also cultural and religious. Many mythological tales involve an active mention of the drink. Coming back to its household usage, the consumption of milk might be an adult's preference, but it sure had its fair share of struggles with the younger ones. And the only way out for that calcium dosage was a malt flavoured milk. Ringing a familiar bell is Horlick's malted milk. Developed originally as an infant formula, it soon appealed to the taste buds of all age groups alike and gradually became a hot favourite. Whether a hot cuppa or a dewy , cold milkshake, Horlick's seemed to be the flavour all year round. And since then there has been no looking back. This calendar from 1928 just reinforces and reiterates a culinary and cultural belief system revolving around milk in the country . \u2014 simrran giLL London 1928 auG ust 2021 82 Always at your Services True companion of your pleasant Journey Every journey to be unbelievableAlways at your Services True companion of your pleasant Journey Every journey to be unbelievable "}
