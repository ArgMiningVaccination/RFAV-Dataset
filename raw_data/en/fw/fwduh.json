What Recent Customers Say About Balance + Restore: \"In just about a week, I felt a major difference in my mood and how alert I feel :) I can't imagine NOT taking it every morning now.\" - Shaelyn \"Balance & Restore has helped me feel like myself again! My energy is coming back and my intense mood swings have vanished. The feeling of being in control of my body again, has led to so many other positive changes. I am exercising again, learning Yoga/Pilates for the first time, and loving it! Thank you for all your guidance Dr. Shah.\"- Jennifer\"I have always been so confused about what supplements to take! I am so thankful to you for introducing me to Balance and Restore! I am taking your vitamins for the last few weeks and am feeling great! I take it immediately after waking up with a big glass of water. If I fall out of this routine- I feel a big difference! I will be more irritable, less focused and sluggish, no matter how much coffee I gulp! I feel so much more alert and have more energy when I take them!\"- Mital Since I started taking Balance and Restore, I have experienced positive results. I was hesitant on starting anything that would have an effect on my hormones and adaptogens since I have tried other products in the past which resulted in negative reactions. However, since taking this product I have noticed huge improvements in my energy levels, as they have been more consistent throughout the day. I noticed my hunger and cravings for sugar and salty foods have subsided as I tend to stress eat. This also came at a time in which I was safely reducing my caloric intake in an effort to lose weight and in the past, I have not been able to stay as strict with my food habits for such a period of time. I am also able to have more intense workouts without being physically and mentally drained for the rest of the day. Balance and restore is now part of my daily routine while being able to reduce other supplements.\u2014 TRB male age 32 Legal Disclaimer: Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. Customer Reviews [Write a review](#) I absolutely love this supplement. I wake up feeling great and have zero bloating. I will forever use this. Used it two days in a row and had horrible stomach aches. Taking these vitamins has been a game changer in my life, I feel so much better and more like me, I love how they're not hormones but vitamins that support our hormones, as a women to have vitamins that are designed specifically for us really makes a difference. I took these 3 months consistently and then got off them and noticed a difference, then I got back on them. With all the changes we go through as women these definitely help support through those changes, I've felt a difference In my period as well, less cramping, and better mood, this is the only thing ive changed so I believe the correlation is definitely related. Thank you Dr. Amy for making these vitamins I have been anxiously awaiting the blessing of menopause... until I experienced the awful side effects! I have tried a few other natural remedies (Estroven and Hormone Harmony), neither gave me the results that Balance and Restore has given me! I feel whole again... hot flashes/night sweats, insomnia and brain fog are under control. I shared this link with a FB group I'm in for natural remedies because it has helped me so much! Thank you!
