PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES Florida's current 1115 demonstration allows the state to operate a capitated Medicaid managed care program. Under the demonstration, most Medicaid -eligibles are required to enroll in managed care through either a managed care organization (MCO) or a provi der service network (PSN). Several populations may also voluntarily enroll in managed care through the MMA program. Currently, individuals are given the opportunity to select a managed care plan prior to Florida Med icaid eligibility determination. I f they do not choose a plan, they are auto-assigned into a managed care plan upon eligibility determination and then provided with information about their choice of plans with the auto -assignment. Managed care plans are able to provide customized benefits to t heir members that differ, but are not less than, the state plan benefit \u2014and participating Medicaid -eligibles have access to Healthy Behaviors Programs that provide incentives for healthy behaviors. The demonstration also establishes a Low Income Pool (LIP ) to ensure continuing support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care to the Medicaid, uninsured, and underinsured populations. On October 12, 2016 , CMS approved three amendments which modified the demonstration to: (a) allow Florida flexibility to contract with one to three vendors under the hemophilia program; (b) include payments for nursing facility (NF) services in MMA capitation rates for recip ients under the age of 18 years; and (c) allow flexibility for specialty plans to conduct Performance Improvement Projects (PIP) on topics that have more specific impacts to their enrollees, with Florida approval.1 Under the demonstration , Florida seeks t o continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve care for Medicaid beneficiaries by prov iding care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality o f care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as HEDIS scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care except those specifically exempted due to short -term eligibility, limited service eligibility, or institutional placement (other than nursing home care). 1 For the \"Comprehensive Program Description and Objectives,\" see Attachment B.

(These individuals are inmates not eligible for covered services under the state plan, except as inpatients in a medical institution) . V. ENROLLMENT This section describes enrollment provisions that are applicable to Medicaid -eligible individuals living in Florida counties in which the MMA program demonstration has been implemented. 21. New Enrollees. At the time of their application for Medicaid , individuals who would be mandated to enroll in managed care under MMA must receive information about managed care plan choices in their area. They must be informed of their options in selecting an authorized managed care plan. Individuals must be provided the opportunity to meet or speak with a choice counselor to obtain additional information in making a choice , and to indicate a plan choice selection if they are prepared to do so . Eligible individuals will be enrolled in a managed care plan upon eligibility determination. If the individual has not select ed a plan at the time of the approval of eligibility , the state may auto-assign the individual into a managed care plan . Individuals who have been auto - assigned at enrollment will receive both their managed care plan assignment and information about c hoice of plans in their area. Such i ndividuals then may actively select a plan during a 120-day change /disenrollment -period without cause post-enrollment. All individuals will be provided with information regarding their rights to change plans . Once the plan selection is registered and takes effect, the plan must communicate to the enrollee, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.10, the benefits covered under the plan , including dental benefits, and how to access those benefits. In accordance with STC s 2 and 3 , the state must ensure that the enrollment and other managed care practices are brought into compliance with future final CMS Medicaid managed care regulations within the timeframe to b e specified in that final rule (see as reference, proposed rule at 80 FR 104, June 1, 2015) . 22. Auto -Enrollment Criteria. Each enrollee must have an opportunity to select a managed care plan before or upon being determined eligible for Medicaid . Individuals must be provide d information to encourage an active selection electronically or in print . Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 14 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 Enrollees who fail to choose a plan by the time their eligibility is determined will be auto - assigned to a managed care plan. At a minimum, the state must use the criteria listed below when assigning an enrollee to a managed care plan. When more than one managed care plan meets the assignment criteria, the state will make enrollee assignments consecutively by family unit. The criteria include but are not limited to: a. Whether the plan has sufficient provider network capacity , including dental network capacity, to meet the needs of the enrollee ; b. Whether t he recipient has previously received services from one of the plan's primary care providers ; c. Whether primary care providers in one plan are more geographically accessible to the recipient's residence than those in other plans . 23. Auto Enrollment for Special Populations. For an enrollee who is also a recipient of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), prior to assigning the SSI beneficiary to a managed care plan, the state must determine whether the SSI beneficiary has an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed care p lan; and if so, the state must assign the SSI recipient to that managed care plan whenever feasible. Those SSI recipients who do not have such a provider relationship must be assigned to a managed care plan using the assignment criteria previously outline d. In addition, the state must use the following parameters when assigning a recipient to a plan. a. To promote alignment between Medicaid and Medicare, each beneficiary who is enrolled with a Medicare Advantage Organization, must first be assigned to any MMA plan in the beneficiary's region that is operated by the same parent organization as the beneficiary's Medicare Advantage Organization. If there is no match of parent organization or appropriate plan within the organization, then the beneficiary should be assigned as in subparagraphs 22(a) - (c) above. b. If an applicable specialty plan is available, the recipient should be assigned to the specialty plan. c. If, in the first year of the first contract term only, a recipient was previously enrolled in a plan that is still available in the region, the recipient should be assigned to that plan. d. Newborns of eligible mothers enrolled in a plan at the time of the c hild's birth will be automatically enrolled in that plan; however, the mother may choose another plan for the newborn within 120 days after the child's birth. e. Foster care children will be assigned/re -assigned to the same plan/PCP to which the child was most recently assigned in the last 12 months , if applicable . Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 15 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 24. Lock -In/Disenrollment . Once a mandatory enrollee has selected or been assigned a n MMA plan, the enrollee shall be enrolled for a total of 12 months, until the next open enrollment period, unless the individual is determined ineligible for Medicaid. The 12 month period includes a 120-day period upon initial eligibility or re -eligibility determination to change or voluntarily disenroll from a plan without cause and select another plan. If an indiv idual chooses to remain in a plan past 120 days, the individual will be permitted no further changes in enrollment until the next open enrollment period, except for cause. Good cause reasons for disenrollment from a plan are defined in Rule 59-G-8.600, Fl orida Administrative Code . Voluntary enrollees may disenroll from the plan at any time. The choice counselor or state will record the plan change/disenrollment reason for all recipients who request such a change. The state or the state's designee will be responsible for processing all enrollments and disenrollments. 25. Re-enrollment. In instances of a temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility, which the state is defining as 6 months or less, the state will re -enroll demonstration enrollees in the same capitated managed care plan or FFS PSN they were enrolled in prior to the temporary loss of eligibility unless enrollment into the entity has been suspended . The individual will have the same change/disenrollment period without cause as upon initial enrollment. VI. BENEFIT PACKAGES AND PLANS IN THE MMA PROGRAM 26. Customized Benefit Packages . MMA plans have the flexibility to provide customized benefit packages for demonstration enrollees as long as the benefit package meets certain minimum standards described in this STC, and actuarial benefit equivalency requirements and benefit sufficiency requirements described in paragraphs 26 -32. For other plans, customized benefit packages must incl ude all state plan services otherwise available under the state plan for pregnant women and children including all EPSDT services for children under age 21. The customized benefit packages must include all mandatory services specified in the state plan fo r all populations. The amount, duration and scope of optional services, may vary to reflect the needs of the plan's target population and plans can offer additional services and benefits not available under the state plan. The plans contracted with the state shall not have service limits more restrictive than authorized in the state plan for children under the age of 21, pregnant women, and emergency services. Policies for determining medical necessity for children covered under the EPSDT benefit must be consistent with Federal statute at \u00a71905(r) of the Social Security Act ( \"the Act \") in authorizing vision, dental, hearing services, and other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures described in \u00a71905(a) of the Act to c orrect or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, whether or not such services are covered in the state plan. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 16 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 27. Overall Standards for Customized Benefit Packages. All benefit packages must be prior-approved by the state and CMS and must be at least actuarially equivalent to the services provided to the target population under the current state plan benefit package. In addition , the plan's customized benefit package must meet a sufficiency test t o ensure that it is sufficient to meet the medical needs of the target population. Customized benefit packages, as analyzed through the Plan Evaluation Tool (PET) discussed below, must be submitted to CMS for approval as part of the standard CMS contract review process. 28. Plan Evaluation Tool. The state will utilize a PET to determine if a plan that is applying for, or has been awarded , an MMA plan contract meets state requirements. The PET measur es for actuarial equivalency and sufficiency. Specifically, the PET: (1) compares the value of the level of benefits (actuarial equivalency) in the proposed package to the value of the current state plan package for the average member of the population ; and (2) ensures that the overall level (sufficiency) of certain benefits is adequate to cover the vast majority of enrollees. The state will evaluate service utilization on an annual basis and use this information to update the PET to ensure that actuarial equivalence calculations and sufficiency thresholds reflect current utilization levels. 29. Plan Evaluation Tool: Actuarial Equivalency. Actuarial equivalence is evaluated at the target -population level and is measured based on that population's historical utilization of services for current Medicaid state plan services. This process ensures that the expected claim cost levels of all managed care plans are equal (using a common benchmark reimbursement structure) to the level of the historic FFS plan for the target population and its historic levels of utilization. The state uses this as the first threshold to evaluate the customized benefit package submitted by a plan to ensure that the package earns the premium established by the state. In as sessing actuarial equivalency, the PET considers the following components of the benefit package: services covered; cost- sharing ; and additional benefits offered, if any. Additional services offered by the plan will be considered a component of the plan's customized benefits and not a component of the Enhanced Benefit Plan. 30. Plan Evaluation Tool: Sufficiency . In addition to meeting the actuarial equivalence test, each health plan's proposed customized benefit package must meet or exceed, and maintain, a m inimum threshold of 98.5 percent for benefits identified as sufficiency - tested benefits. The sufficiency test provides a safeguard when plans elect to vary the amount, duration and scope of certain services. This standard is based on the target - populatio n's historic use of the applicable Medicaid state plan services (e.g. outpatient hospital services, outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) identified by the state as sufficiency -tested benefits. Each proposed benefit plan must be evaluated against the suffici ency standard to ensure that the proposed benefits are adequate to cover the vast majority of enrollees. The sufficiency standard for a service may be based on the proportion of the historical utilization for the target population that is expected to exce ed the plan's proposed benefit level. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 17 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 31. Evaluation of Plan Benefits. The state will review and update the PET for assessing a plan's benefit structure to ensure actuarial equivalence and that services are sufficient to meet the needs of enrollees in the demonstration area. At a minimum, the state must conduct the review and update on an annual basis. The state will provide CMS with 60 - days advance notice and a copy of any proposed changes to the PET. VII. COST -SHARING 32. Premiums and Co -Payments. The state must pre -approve all cost-sharing allowed by MMA plans. Cost-sharing must be consistent with the state plan except that managed care plans may elect to assess cost-sharing that is less than what is allowed under the state plan. VIII. MANAGED MEDIC AID ASSISTANCE (MMA) PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 33. MMA Program Implementation Requirements. The state will continue with the implement ation of the MMA program in a region if it meets the following implementation requirements for that region (subject to CMS review and approval) . a.

In Demonstration Year 10, t he LIP provides transitional government support for the safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care to the Medicaid, underinsured and uninsured populations. In Demonstration Year 11 (SFY 2016 -2017) the LIP provides government support for safety net providers for the costs of uncompensated charity care for low -income individuals that are uninsured . Uncompensat ed care includes charity care for the uninsured but does not include uncompensated care for insured individuals, \"bad debt ,\" or Medicaid and CHIP shortfall. The definition also excludes the estimated impact on uncompensated care that would result from Medicaid expansion , or that has resulted from Marketplace coverage , under the Affordable Care Act. This is reflected in the total computable dollar limit discussed in STC 65. 65. Availability of Low Income Pool Funds. The following paragraph presents the total computable dollar limit for LIP spending in DY s 10 and 11 , subject to assurances . a. Total LIP Amount. The total computable dollar limit for LIP expenditures in DY 10 will be $1 billion. The total computable dollar limit for LIP expenditures in DY 11 will be $60 7,825,452 million. b. Assurance. As reflected in the LIP participation requirements in STC 74, in DY 11, the state and participating providers who plan to participate in LIP for DY11 will provide assurance that LIP claims include only costs associated with uncompensated care that is furnished through a charity care program for individuals with incomes up to at least 200 percent of the federal poverty level that adheres to the principle s of the Healthcare Financial Management Association operated by the provider . Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 30 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 66. Capped A nnual Allotments . All annual LIP funds must be expended by July 31 following each authorized demonstration year. Any amount not expended does not roll over. Capped annual allotment amounts that are not distributed because of penalties, recoupment due to paymen ts exceeding uncompensated care cost, or are otherwise due to violating the terms of the approved STCs cannot be rolled over to another DY and are not recoverable. LIP dollars that are lost as a result of penalties or recoupment are surrendered by the stat e and not recoverable. 67. LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology. The Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document (RFMD) is prepared by the state and documents LIP permissible expenditures , including the non -federal share and the total computable expenditure s. The RFMD provides that total computable LIP payments to providers for uncompensated care costs must be supported by uncompensated care costs incurred and reported by providers as charity care on the provider's financial records . Through th e RFMD, the state must demonstrate that it has reconcile d LIP payments to auditable costs. LIP provider payments for uncompensated care as charity care are limited to the uncompensated portion of providers' allowable costs and , in the aggregate, the autho rized LIP pool amount for the demonstration year. a. Prior to November 30 , 2015, t he state must submit a draft of DYs 10 and 11 (2016 - 2017) RFMDs to CMS for approval and CMS will work with Florida towards approval by January 31, 2016 . However, Florida may not claim federal financial participation for LIP payments in DY 11 until after a revised RFMD is approved by CMS. b. For each DY, the state must r econcile LIP payments made to providers to ensure that they do not exceed allowed uncompensated care costs, using the CMS approved RFMD cost review protocol. The state must submit a LIP Cost Reconciliation report to CMS within two years after the end of each DY showing cost reconciliation results by provider. CMS will review the state 's reconciliation and share any findings with the state. To the extent th at payments are found to exceed allowed uncompensated care costs, the federal portion of any excess payment must be returned to CMS by submitting a decreasing expenditure adjustment (Line 10B) . If the state has not submitted its LIP Cost Reconciliation Report for a DY within the timeframe described above, CMS may issue a deferral or disallowance for an amount not to exceed the total of the state's submitted LIP expenditures for that DY. c. A provider may at any time during a demonstration year disclose to the state that LIP payments to that provider exceeded allowed uncompensated care costs . The state must report that overpayment on the CMS -64 by submitting a decreasing expenditure adjustment (Line 10B) by the next quarter and no later than one year from the date of disclosure . d. Payments from LIP to hospitals are to be considered Medicaid hospital revenue for the purpose of determining the hospital -specific DSH limits defined in section 1923(g) of the Act. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 31 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 e. For the purposes of this paragraph, allowed uncompensated care cost follows the definition s described in paragraph 67. 68. Low Income Pool Permissible Expenditures.

These health care costs may also include costs for Medicai d services that exceed Medicaid payments (after all other title XIX payments are made, including disproportionate share hospital payments). b. In Demonstration Year 11 (SFY 2016 -2017) , these health care costs may be incurred by the state or by providers to furnish uncompensated medical care as charity care for low-income individuals that are uninsured. The costs must be incurred pursuant to a charity care program that adheres to the principle s of the Healthcare Financial Management Association . i. Providers may be categorized in up to two groups : hospitals and Medical School Physician Practices. Each group may be divided into up to four tiered subgroups, based on subdividing a list of the providers ranked by their amount of uncompensated charity care cost or charges (defined as in (b) above) as a percentage of their privately insured patient care cost or charges \u2014that ratio is the sole basis on which tiered groups may be defined . ii. All providers in either group that meet LIP provider participation requirements and that furnished uncompensated charity care must receive some amount of payment with the amounts paid being proportional to the ratio defined in (i) above (i.e. subgroup members that provide greater proportions of uncompensated charity care will fall into tiers with higher percentages of uncompensated care payments) . iii. All providers that must receive some amount of payment (following (ii) above) must be paid the same percentage of their charity care cost within each group (or within each tiered subgroup) . iv. Determination of ( i) through (iii) may be effectuated using contemporaneous uncompensated care data, or equivalent data from a prior year not more than three years prior to the DY. 69. Low Income Pool Permissible Expenditures 10 percent S ub Cap . For DY 10, u p to $100 million of the capped annual allotment of the LIP funds may be used for hospital Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 32 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 expenditures other than payments to providers for the provision of health care services to an uninsured or underinsured individual. Payments fr om this sub -cap may be used for the improvement or continuation of specialty health care services that benefit the uninsured and underinsured, such as capacity building and infrastructure, hospital trauma services, hospital neonatal services, rural hospita l services, pediatric hospital services, teaching or specialty hospital services, or safety net providers. Hospital costs funded by these payments cannot be included as allowable costs for purposes of any federally - supported program. The reimbursement methodologies for these expenditures and the non-federal share of funding for such expenditures will be defined in the Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document as discussed in paragraph 67. 70. Low Income Pool Permissible Hospital Expenditures. Hospital cost expenditures from the LIP will be paid up to cost and are further defined in the Reimbursement and Funding Methodology docum ent utilizing methodologies from the CMS -2552 cost report plus mutually agreed upon additional costs . The state agrees that it shall not receive FFP for Medicaid and LIP payments to hospital s in excess of cost. 71. Low Income Pool Permissible Non-Hospital Based Expe nditures. To ensure services are paid up to or at cost, the Reimbursement and Funding Methodology document defines the cost reporting strategies required to support non -hospital based LIP expenditures. 72. Permissible Sources of Funding Criteria . Sources of non -Federal funding must be compliant with s ection 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations . Federal funds received from other federal programs (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for matching purposes) shall be impermissible. XV. LOW INCOME POOL PROVIDER PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES 73. Aggregate LIP Funding. In DY 10, up to $ 1 billion in LIP funds will be available to the state and in DY 11, up to $607,825,452 million in LIP funds will be available to the state . This amount will be limited by any penalties that are assessed by CMS pursuant to STC 75 and/or reconciliation overpayments as discussed in STC 67. Provider Participation requirements, described in STC 74 must be met for the state and facilities to have access to 100 percent of the annual LIP funds. 74. LIP Provider Participation Requirements. Hospitals and Medical School Physician Practices who receive LIP funds have certain participation requirements. If they do not meet the participation requirements, they cannot receive LIP fund s. The state may grant an exemption to a hospital of the requirement in (a) (ii) upon finding that the hospital has demonstrated that it was refused a contract despite a good faith negotiation with a Specialty Plan. A letter of denial, or some other comparable evidence, will be required to make such a finding. a. Hospitals.

The state must provide quarterly expenditure reports using Form CMS -64 to report total expenditures for services provided through th is demonstration under section 1115 authority that are subject to budget neutrality . This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstration period. CMS shall provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the costs incurred as specified in Section XIV. 84. Reporting Expenditures Under the Demonstration: CMS -64. All expenditures for health care services for demonstration participants and categories, as described in section (d), are subject to the budget neutrality agreement. The following describes the reporting of expenditures subject to the budget agreement : Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 39 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 a. Tracking Expenditures. In order to track expenditures , the state must report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in Section 2500 of the state Medicaid Manual. All demonstration expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditu re limit must be reported each quarter on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number (11-W-00206/4) assigned by CMS , including the project number extension which indicates the demonstration year (DY) in which service s were rendered or for whic h capitation payments were paid . The state will work with CMS to develop a method of reporting spending on dental care through the health plans. b. Cost Settlements. For monitoring purposes, cost settlements attr ibutable to the demonstration must be recorded on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (Form CMS -64.9P Waiver) for the Summary Sheet Line 10B, in lieu of Lines 9 and 10C, as instructed in the State Medicaid Manual . For any cost settlement not attributable to this demonstration , the adjustments should be reported as otherwise instructed in the state Medicaid Manual. c. Pharmacy Rebates. The state may propose a methodology for assigning a portion of pharmacy rebates to the demonstration in a way that reasonably reflects the actual rebate -eligible pharmacy utilization of the demonstration population, and which reasonably identifies pharmacy rebate a mounts with DYs. Use of the methodology is subject to the approval in advance by the CMS Regional Office, and changes to the methodology must also be approved in advance by the Regional Office. The portion of pharmacy rebates assigned to the demonstration using the approved methodology will be reported on the appropriate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver for the demonstration and not on any other CMS -64.9 form (to avoid double counting). Each rebate amount must be distributed as state and F ederal revenue consistent w ith the federal matching rates under which the claim was paid. d. Use of Waiver Forms . For each DY, a waiver Form CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver must be submitted each quarter, reporting expenditures for the demonstration populations by eligibility group . Payments made to provide health care services to the eligibility groups listed below are expenditures subject to the budget neutrality limit. The waiver names designate the waiver form s in the MBES/CBES system to report Title XIX expenditures associated with the demonstration . i. The CMS -64 will reflect the expenditures for statewide MMA populations, including those attributable to MMA mandatory and voluntary populations. The following names and definitions will be utilized for the CMS -64 reporting purposes: A. MEG 1: Demonstration Population 1 - (Aged/Disabled): Aged and disabled demonstration enrollees. Waiver Name: \"Aged/Disabled \" Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 40 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 B. MEG 2: Demonstration Population 2 - (TANF & Related Group ): TANF demonstration enrollees. Waiver Name: \"TANF & Related Group\" C. MEG 3: Low Income Pool ii. Progress Reports. The state must submit quarterly progress reports on its progress in developing new programming logic to accommodate the necessary CMS -64 reporting system changes. e. Excluded Services. The following services are excluded from the demonstration : i. Home and Community Based Service Waiver Services (Adult Cystic Fibrosis, Model Waiver ((formerly Katie Beckett Model Waiver Services)) , Project AIDS Care, Familial Dysautonomia, Development Disabilities Individual Budgeting, Traumatic Brain Injury and Spinal Cord Injury); ii. Long Term Care Waiver; iii. ICF/IID Institutional Services; iv. School Based Administrative Claiming; v.

Redirections Services; x. State Mental Health Hospital services for recipients age 65 and older; xi. Certain physician -injectable procedures; xii. Vaccines for Children program for MediKids; and xiii. Early Intervent ion Services. f. Mandated Increase in Physician Payment Rates in 2013 and 2014 . Section 1202 of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. Law 110 -152) requires state Medicaid programs to pay physicians for primary care services at rate s that are no less than what Medicare pays, for services furnished in 2013 and 2014. The federal government provides a federal medical assistance of 100 percent for claimed the amount by which the minimum payment exceeds the rates paid for those services as of July 1, 2009. The state may (at its option) exclude from the budget neutrality test for this demonstration the portion of the increase for which the federal government pays 100 percent. Should the state elect this, these amounts must be repor ted on the base forms CMS -64.9 and not on any waiver form . g. Cost-Sharing Adjustments. Applicable cost -sharing contributions from enrollees that are collected by the state from enrollees under the demonstration must be reported to CMS each quarter on Form CMS -64 Summary Sheet line 9D, columns A and B. In order to assure that these collections are properly credited to the demonstration , premium and cost -sharing collections (both total computable and federal share) Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 41 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 should also be reported separately by DY on Form C MS-64 Narrative. In the calculation of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit, premium collections applicable to demonstration populations will be offset against expenditures. These section 1115 premium collections will be includ ed as a manual adjustment (decrease) to the demonstration 's actual expenditures on a quarterly basis. h. Administrative Costs. Administrative costs will not be included in the budget neutrality agreement, but the state must separately track and report addit ional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration . All administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS -64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver with the waiver name \"ADM\" . i. Claiming Period. All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures . Furthermore, all claims for services during the demons tration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration . During the latter 2 -year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of serv ice during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. j. Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Limits. The following types of expenditures are subject to the budget neutrality limits for th is demonstration. i. All medical assistance expenditures for Medicaid beneficiaries in the categories listed in paragraph 20(a), (b), or (c) (regardless of their managed care enrollment status), other than exp enditures for services listed in paragraph 92(d), ii. All expenditures made under section 1115(a)(2) expenditure authority, including all payments made under LIP , through June 30, 2017 . 85. Reporting Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months for demonstration populations . a. For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality expenditure limit and for other purposes, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the Quarterly Report required under paragraph 80, the actual number of eligible member months for the three MEGs described in paragraph 96 the state must provide CMS, upon request, eligible member months by population as defined in paragraph 84(d). The state must submit a statement accompanying the Quarterly Report , which certifies the accuracy of this information. To permit full recognition of \"in-process\" eligibility, reported counts of member mo nths may be subject to revision. b. The term \"eligible member/months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for 3 months Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 42 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 contributes 3 eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for 2 months each contribute 2 eligible member months to the total, for a total of 4 eligible member/months. c. Starting January 1, 2014, the state must begin reporting sep arate member month totals for mandatory and voluntary individuals enrolled in MMA that are not already represented in the member month reporting in place prior to that date. The member months must be subtotaled according to the MEGs defined in subparagraph (d)(i) above. 86. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration . The state must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each federal fiscal year (FFY) on the Form CMS -37 (narrative section) for both the Medical Assistance P ayments (MAP) and state and L ocal Administrative Costs (ADM). CMS will make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Med icaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to t he state. 87. Extent of FFP. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non -federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rates for the following , subject to the limits described in Section X VI: a. Administrative costs associated with the administration of the demonstration ; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments , made under approved Expenditure Authorities granted thr ough section 1115(a)(2) of the A ct, with dates of service during the operat ion of the demonstration ; c. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments for MMA Plan premiums paid to managed care entities and fee for service coverage options; d. Net Expenditures associated with the L IP, as described in Section X III; and, Pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is excluded for payments with respect to care or services for any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution) pursuant to the payment exclusion in par agraph (A) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act. In addition, pursuant to standard Medicaid financing rules, FFP is excluded for payments with respect to care or services for any individual who has not attained 65 year of age and who is a patient in an institution for mental diseases pursuant to the payment exclusion in paragraph (B) following section 1905(a)(29) of the Act, except as provided in section 1905(a)(16) for inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 43 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 88. Sources of Non -Fede ral Share. The state certifies that the matching non -federal share of funds for the demonstration are state/local monies , and that local funding is derived from state or local tax revenues . The state further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the non-federal share for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non -federal funding must be compliant with Title XIX the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non -federal share of fu nding are subject to CMS approval. a. CMS may review at any time the sources of the non -federal share of funding for the demonstration . The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CM S. b. The state shall provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non -federal share of funding for any amendments that impact the financial status of the program . c. The state assures that all health care related taxes comport with section 1903(w) of the Act and all other applicable federal statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the approved Medicaid state plan. 89. State Certification of Funding Conditions . The state must certify that th e following conditions for non -federal share of the demonstration expenditures are met: a. Units of government, including governmentally -operated health care providers, may certify that state or local tax dollars have been expended as the non -federal share of funds under the demonstration ; b. To the extent the state utilizes certified public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for Title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CM S must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under Title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying public expenditures; c. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim federal match for payments under the demonstration , governmental entities to which general revenue funds are appropriated must certify to the state the amount of such tax revenue ( state or local) used to satisfy demonstration expenditures. The entities that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for federal match; d. The state may use intergovernmental tra nsfers to the extent that such funds are derived from state or local tax revenues and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally -operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non -federal share of Title XIX payments; and, e. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 44 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or other wise) may exist between the health care providers and the state government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal ope rating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes, including health care provider -related taxes, fees, and business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid paymen ts) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 90. MSIS Data Submission. The state shall submit its MSIS data electronically to CMS in accordance with CMS requirements and timeliness standards, including the required transition to T-MSIS. 91. Monitoring the Demonstration . The state must provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration , upon request, in a reasonable timeframe. 92. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration . XVIII. MONITORING BUDGET NE UTRALITY The following describes the method by which budget neutrality will be assured under the demonstration . The demonstration will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the demonstration period. Paragraphs 93 and 94 specify the two independent financial caps on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on expenditures subject to the budget neutrality limit as defined in paragraph 84. Federal financial payments for the MMA aspects of the demonstration are limited by a P er Member Per Month (PMPM) method cap and the payments for the LIP aspects are limited by an aggregate cap. 93. Budget Neutrality Li mit for the LIP . The L IP amount is capped at $1 billion total computable for DY 10 and $607,8 25,452 million for DY 11 . Funds not distributed in a DY may be rolled over to the next DY . The federal share of the total computable is the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive during the extension period for the types of Medicaid expenditures for the LIP. For each DY, the federal share will be calculated using the FMAP rate(s) applicable to that year. 94. Limit on PMPM Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on the Medic aid and demonstration expenditures identi fied in paragraph 84 during the approval period of the demonstration . The limit is determined using a PMPM method. The budget neutrality targets are set on a yearly basis with a cumulative budget neutrality limi t for the length of the entire demonstration . All data supplied by the state to CMS is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality limit. CMS' assessment of the state's compliance with these limi ts will be done using the CMS - 64 Report fr om the MBES/CBES System. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 45 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 95. Risk. The state shall be at risk for the per capita cost of demonstration enrollees under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration enrollees. By providing FFP for all demonstration enrollees, the state will not be at risk for changing economic conditions which impact enrollment levels . However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration enrollees , CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration . 96. Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. The following describes the method for calculating the budget neutrality expenditure limit for the demonstration . Demonstration expenditures are defined under the following Medicaid Eligibility Groups (MEGs) as referenced in paragraph 84(d): a. MEG 1: MEG 2: TANF & Related Grp c. MEG 3 : Low Income Pool For the purpose of calculating the overall PMPM expenditure limit for the demonstration , separate budget estimates will be calculated for each year on a demonstration year (DY) basis. The annual estimates will then be added together to obtain an expenditure estimate for the entire demonstration period. The federal share of this estimate wil l represent the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive during the extension period for the types of Medicaid expenditures for the Aged/Disabled and TANF MEGs. Budget neutrality calculations for both with and without waiver expenditures are appli ed on a statewide basis. For each DY, the federal share will be calculated using the FMAP rate(s) applicable to that year. For the purpose of monitoring budget neutrality, the $1 billion in annual LIP expenditures is considered as both with and without w aiver expenditures. a. Projecting Service Expenditures - Each yearly estimate of MMA service expenditures will be the cost projections for the Aged/Disabled and TANF MEGs in sub -paragraph (b) below. The annual budget estimate for each MEG will be the product of the projected PMPM cost for the MEG, times the actual number of eligible member months as reported to CMS by the state under the guidelines set forth in paragraph 85. b. Projected PM PM Cost - The PMPM costs for each MEG used to calculate the annual budg et neutrality expenditure limit for this demonstration is specified below. Demonstration Year Aged/Disabled MEG Trend Rate TANF & Rel Grp MEG DY 9 (SFY 2015) $786.70 4.1% DY 10 (SFY Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 46 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 97. How the Limit will be Applied . The l imits as defined in paragraphs 93 through 96 will apply to the actual expenditures for the demonstration , as reported by the state under Section XVIII . If at the end of the demonstration period the budget neutrality provision has been exceeded, the excess federal funds will be returned to CMS. There will be no new limit placed on the FFP that the state can claim for expenditures for recipients and program categories not listed. 98. Impermissible DSH, Taxes or Donations . CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality ceiling to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statutes, or policy interpretations implemented throu gh state Medicaid Director Letters, other memoranda, or regulations. CMS reserves the right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality cap if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider related donation that occurred during the base year, is deter mined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donation and health care related tax provisions of 1903(w) of the Social Security Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. 99. PMPM Expenditure Review . CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration , rather than on an annual basis. However, no later than 6 months after the end of each demonstration year, the state will calculate an ann ual expenditure target for the completed year and report it to CMS as part of the reporting guidelines in paragraph 81. This amount will be compared with the actual FFP claimed by the state under budget neutrality. Using the schedule below as a guide for the PCCM budget limit, if the state exceeds the cumulative target, they shall submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. The state will subsequently implement the approved program. Year Cumulative target definition Percentage Year 9 Years 1 through 9 combined budget neutrality cap plus 1 percent Year 10 Years 1 through 10 combined budget neutrality cap plus 0.5 percent Year 11 Years 1 through 11 combined budget neutrality cap plus 0 percent XIX. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 100. Submission of Draft Evaluation Design Update s. Included with any application for an amendment or an extension, t he state must submit to CMS for approval a draft evaluation design update that revises the evaluation design in relation to the proposed changes to the demonstration and that builds upon the most recent evaluation findings . At a minimum, the draft design must include a discussion of the goals, o bjectives and specific testable hypotheses, including those that focus specifically on target populations for the demonstration , and more generally on beneficiaries, providers, plans, market areas and public expenditures. The analysis plan must c over all elements in paragraph 102). The updated design should be described in sufficient detail to determine that it is scientifically rigorous. The data strategy must be thoroughly documented . The updated design should accommodate and reflect the staggered implementation of the MMA program to produce more reliable estimates of program impacts. The design should describe how the Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 47 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 evaluation and reporting will develop and be maintained to assure its scientific rigor and completion. In summary, the demonstration evaluation will meet all standards of leading academic institutions and academic journal peer review, as appropriate for each aspect of the evaluation, including standards for the evaluation design, conduct, interpretation , and reporting of findings. Among the characteristics of rigor that will be met are the use of best available data; controls for and reporting of the limitations of data an d their effects on results; and the generalizability of results. The updated design must describe the state's process to contract with an independent evaluator , ensuring no conflict of interest . The design , including the budget and adequacy of approac h, to assure the evaluation meets the requirements of 102(a), is subject to CMS approval . The budget and approach must be adequate to support the scale and rigor reflected in the paragraph above. The rigor also described above also applies as appro priate throughout Section s XIX and XX. 101. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. Should HHS undertake an evaluation of any component of the demonstration, the State shall cooperate fully with CMS or the evaluator selected by HHS. The state shall submit the required data to HHS or its contractor 102. Evaluation Design . a. Domains of Focus - The state must propose as least one research question that it will investigate within each of the domains listed below. The research questions should focus on processes and outcomes that relate to the CMS Three -Part Aim of better care, better health , and reducing costs. i.

MEASUREMENT OF QUALITY OF CARE AND ACCESS TO CARE IMPROVEMENT 104. External Quality Review (EQR). The state is required to meet all requirements for external quality review (EQR) found in 42 C.F.R. Part 438, subpart E. In addition to routine encounter data validation processes that take place at the MCO /PIHP and state level, the state must maintain its contract with its external quality review organization (EQRO) to require the independent annual validation of encounter data for all MCOs and PIHPs. The state should generally have available its final EQ R technical report to CMS and the public, in a format compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d), by April 30th of each year, for data collected within the prior 15 months. This submission timeframe will align with the collect ion and annual reporting on managed care data by the Secretary of Health and Human Services each September 30th, which is a requirement under the Affordable Care Act [Sec. 2701 (d)(2)]. 105. Consumer Health Plan Report Cards. On an annual basis, the state mu st create and make readily available to beneficiaries, providers, and other interested stakeholders, a health plan report card, in a format compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d), that is based on performance data on each h ealth plan included in the annual EQR technical report. Each health plan report card must be posted on the state's website and present an easily understandable summary of quality, access, and timeliness regarding the performance of each participating heal th plan. The report cards must also address the performance of subcontracted dental plans. 106. Performance Improvement Projects (PIP). The state must require each health plan to commit to improving care in the following focus areas, which have the significa nt potential for achieving the demonstration's goals of improving patient care, population health, and reducing per capita Medicaid expenditure. Specialty plans that do not have Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 50 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 sufficient numbers of eligible recipients for the PIP topics identified in 106(a) or 106(b) may conduct alternative PIPs on topics more relevant to their enrolled population in place of, the required focus areas, subject to Florida approval. a. A PIP combining a focus on improving prenatal care and well -child visits in the first 15 months; b. A PIP focused on preventive dental care for children; c. An administrative PIP, topic of which must be approved by the state; and d. A choice of PIP in one of the followin g topic areas: i. Population health issues (such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma) within a specific geographic area that have been identified as in need of improvement; ii. Integrating primary care and behavioral health; and iii. Reducing preventable readmission s. Each PIP must be conducted in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 438.358 and 438.240. The state must incorporate these PIP requirements into its MMA managed care plan contracts upon implementation of the MMA program. 107. Measurement Activities. The state must ensure that each participating health plan is accountable for metrics on quality and access, including measures to track progress in identified quality improvement focus areas, measures to track quality broadly, and measures to track access. The stat e must set performance targets that equal or exceed the 75th percentile national Medicaid performance level. The state must collect data and information on dental care utilization rates, the CMS Medicaid and CHIP adult and child core measures, and must align with other existing federal measure sets where possible to ensure ongoing monitoring of individual well - being and plan performance. The state will use this information in ongoing monitoring and quality improvement efforts, in addition to quality rep orting efforts. 108. Comprehensive State Quality Strategy. The state shall adopt and implement a comprehensive and holistic, continuous quality improvement strategy that focuses on all aspects of quality improvement in Medicaid, including FFS populations; FFS PSNs ; and capitated managed care plans , including the MMA program , and managed LTSS . The Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) shall meet all the requirements of 42 CFR 438 Subparts D and E and must include section 1915(c) HCBS waivers' corrective act ion plan quality components. The currently approved Florida CQS may be found at http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/quality_mc/index.shtml . a. The CQS must also address the following elements: i. The state's goals for improvement, identified through claims and encounter data, quality metrics and expenditure data. The goals should align with the three part aim but should be more specific in identifying specific pathways for the state to achieve these goals. ii. The associated interventions for improvement in the goals. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 51 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 iii. The specific quality metrics for measuring improvement in the goals. The metrics should be aligned with the Medicaid and CHIP adult and child core measures, and should also align with other existing Medicare and Medicaid federal measure sets where possible. The metrics should go beyond HEDIS and CAHPS data, and should reflect cost of care . iv. Metrics should be measured at the following levels of aggregation: the state Medicai d agency, each health plan , and each direct health services provider. The state will work with CMS to further define what types of metrics will be measured for direct service providers. v. The specific methodology for determining benchmark and target perfor mance on these metrics for each aggregated level identified above (state, plan and provider). vi. Performance improvement accountability - i.e., the state must determine if the current plans for financial incentives adequately align with the specific goals and targeted performance, and whether enhancements to these incentives are necessary (increased or restructured financial incentives, in -kind incentives, contract management, etc.). The state must present the findings of the determination to CMS. vii. Specific m etrics related to each population covered by the Medicaid program . HCBS performance measures, consistent with the corrective action plan, in the areas of: level of care determinations, person -centered service planning process, outcome of person -centered goals, health and welfare, and assuring there are qualified providers and appropriate HCBS settings. viii. Monitoring and evaluation. This should include specific plans for continuous quality improvement, which includes transparency of performance on metrics and structured learning, and also a rigorous and independent evaluation of the demonstration , as described in STC 100. The evaluation should reflect all the programs covered by the CQS as mentioned above. ix. HIV evaluation. The s tate will evaluate , in accordance with the rigor described in STC 100, the HIV population to determine if there are better health outcomes for HIV pos itive beneficiaries in the HIV s pecia lty plan as compared to in a MMA health pl an. The s tate will also evaluate medication adherence and improved care and care coordination as a result of being enrolled in the HIV specialty plan. b. The CQS should include a timeline that considers metric development and specification, contract amend ments, data submission and review, incentive disbursement (if available), and the re -basing of performance data. c. The CQS must include state Medicaid agency and any contracted service providers' responsibilities , includ ing managed care entities , and provid ers enrolled in the state's FFS program. The state Medicaid agency must retain ultimate authority and accountability for ensuring the quality of and overseeing the operations of the program. The CQS must include distinctive components for discovery, remediation, and improvement. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 52 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 d. The state must revise (and submit to CMS for review and approval) their CQS whenever the MMA demonstration is renewed or materially amended or significant changes ar e made to the associated Medicaid programs and the content of the C QS. Revisions to the CQS must be submitted to CMS for review and approval within 90 days of approval of the amendment or renewal . Any further revisions must be submitted accordingly: i. Modifications to the CQS due to changes in the Medicaid operating authorities must be submitted concurrent with the proposed changes to the operating authority (e.g., state plan or waiver amendments or waiver renewals); and/or ii. Changes to an existing, appro ved CQS due to fundamental changes to the CQS must be submitted for review and approval to CMS no later than 60 days prior to the contractual implementation of such changes . If the changes to the CQS do not impact any provider contracts, the revisions to the CQS may be submitted to CMS no later than 60 days following the changes. e. The state must solicit for and obtain the input of beneficiaries , the Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC) as set forth in STC 41, and other stakeholders in the development of its CQS and make the initial CQS, as well as any significant revisions, available for public comment prior to implementation. Pursuant to STC 81, Annual Report, the state must also provide CMS with annual reports on the implementation and effectiveness of their CQS as it impacts the demonstr ation. f. If the state chooses to exercise the non -duplication option in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7438.360(b)(4), t he state must identify in the CQS any standards for which the EQRO will use information from private accreditation reviews to complete the compliance review portion of EQR for participating MCOs or PIHPs. The state must, by means of a crosswalk included in the CQS, set forth each standard that the state deems as duplicative to those addressed under accreditation and explain its rationale for why the standards are duplicative. g. Upon approval by CMS, the state will finalize the CQS to be fully compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794d).

COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES The Florida Medicaid Reform demonstration was approved October 19, 2005. The state implemented the demonstration July 1, 2006, in Broward and Duval Counties, and then expanded to Baker, Clay, and Nassau Counties July 1, 2007. On December 15, 2011, CMS agreed to extend the demonstration through June 30, 2014. The December 2011 renewal included several important improvements to the demonstration, such as; enhanced managed care requirements to ensure increased stability among managed care plans, minimize plan turnover, and provide for an improved transition and continuity of care when enrollees change plans and to ensure adequate choice of providers. The renewal also included a Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirement of 85 percent for Medicaid operations. Finally, the renewal included the continuation of the Low Income Pool (LIP) of $1 billion (total computable) annually to assist safety net providers in providing health care services to Medicaid, underinsured and uninsured populations. On June 14, 2013, CMS approved an amendment to the demonstration, which retains all of the improvements noted above, but allowed the state to extend an improved model of managed care to all counties in Florida subject to approval of an implementation plan and a determinatio n of readiness based on the elements of the approved plan. The amendment also changed the name of the demonstration to the Florida Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program. CMS authorized implementation to begin no earlier than January 1, 2014, with the Medicaid Reform demonstration continuing to operate in the five Medicaid Reform counties until the MMA program was implemented there. Under the June 2013 amended demonstration, most Medicaid eligibles were required to enroll in a managed care plan (eithe r a capitated managed care plan or a fee -for-service (FFS) Provider Service Network (PSN) as a condition for receiving Medicaid. Enrollment was mandatory for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) -related populations and the aged and disabled with some exceptions. The demonstration continued to allow plans to offer customized benefit packages and reduced cost -sharing, although each plan must cover all mandatory services, and all state plan services for children and pregnant women (including Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment; EPSDT). The demonstration provided incentives for healthy behaviors by offering Enhanced Benefits Accounts that will be replaced by the plan's Healthy Behaviors program upon implementation of the MMA progr am as described in paragraph 59. Beneficiaries in counties transitioning from Medicaid Reform to MMA continued to have access to their accrued cre dits under Enhanced Benefit Account Program (EBAP) for one year. The June 2013 amended terms and conditions included improvements such as: A phased implementation to ensure readiness including a readiness assessment for each region and a requirement for CMS approval of the state's implementation plan which Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 57 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 will include identified risks, mitigation strategies, fail safes, stakeholder engagemen t and rapid cycle improvement strategies; Strengthened auto -enrollment criteria to ensure consideration of network capacity, access, continuity of care, and preservation of existing patient -provider relationships when enrolling all beneficiaries into the M MA program, including special populations; STCs tailored to special populations, should the state choose to include specialty plans in the final selection of managed care entities and PSNs; Strong consumer protections to ensure beneficiary assistance and c ontinuity of care through the MMA transition. Additional STCs to ensure beneficiary choice, including a comprehensive outreach plan to educate and communicate with beneficiaries, providers, and stakeholders and annual Health Plan Report Cards for consumer s, which will allow beneficiaries to be more informed on health plan performance and assist beneficiaries in making informed decisions related to plan selection; Enhanced Medical Care Advisory Committee (MCAC) requirements to ensure beneficiary and advoc ate group participation as well as inclusion of sub -population advisory committees; Performance Improvement Projects (PIP) to be performed by all health plans; Clarification and enhancements of the monitoring and evaluation of plans to ensure a rigorous an d independent evaluation, and development of rapid cycle, transparent monitoring in order to ensure continuous progress towards quality improvement; and, A Comprehensive Quality Strategy (CQS) that will span the entire Florida Medicaid program. The approv ed 2014 extension of the demonstration continued the improvements authorized in the June 2013 amendment and extended all portions of this demonstration for three years, except for the Low Income Pool (LIP). CMS authorized extension of the Low Income Pool for one year, from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015. During the one -year extension for the LIP, expenditures were authorized to provide stability for providers, for a limited time during Florida's transition to statewide Medicaid managed care and a s ignificantly reformed Medicaid payment system. Funding sources were limited only to existing state and local funding arrangements. The total amount of LIP funding could not exceed $2,167,718,341 (total computable). Florida was required to analyze and dev elop a plan to reform Medicaid provider payments and funding mechanisms, with the goal of developing sustainable, transparent, equitable, appropriate, accountable, and actuarially sound Medicaid payment systems and funding mechanisms that ensure quality he alth care services to Florida's Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the state without the need for LIP funding. Expenditures authorized under the LIP were limited to uncompensated care costs of providers, the independent report discussed below, and other ca tegories of expenditure as specified in the STCs. Uncompensated care costs were required to be verified through provider cost reports. CMS indicated that it would disallow unallowable payments to providers in prior demonstration years as identified on p rovider cost reports. During the one -year LIP extension, the state was required to use a portion of the LIP funds to commission a report from an independent entity on Medicaid provider payment Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 58 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 in the state that reviews the adequacy of payment levels, and the adequacy, equity, accountability and sustainability of the State's funding mechanisms for these payments. The report was required to recommend reforms to the Florida Medicaid financing system that can allow the state, beginning in state fiscal year ( SFY) 2015 -2016, to move toward Medicaid fee -for-service and managed care payments that ensure access for Medicaid beneficiaries to providers without payments through the LIP. The final report was due no later than March 1, 2015. On June 30, 2015, pursuan t to a letter to the state, CMS granted 60 -days of interim expenditure authority under section 1115(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, to make federal funding available to Florida for interim LIP payments to providers from July 1, 2015 through August 31, 20 15 of Demonstration Year (DY) 10, subject to a total spending limit of $166.66 million for the combined federal and state shares of expenditures (with such amount being counted in determining the amount of any further extension of the Low Income Pool). On October 15, 2015, CMS approved three amendments to the demonstration. The first amendment adds two populations as voluntary enrollees in managed care: Medicaid -eligible children receiving Prescribed Pediatric Extended Care (PPEC) services, and recipients residing in group home facilities licensed under section(s) 393.067 Florida Statutes (F.S.). The second amendment authorizes changes to managed care enrollment to auto -assign individuals into managed care during a plan choice period immediately after el igibility determination. The amendment also changes the auto -assignment criteria. Individuals will receive both their managed care plan assignment and information about choice of plans in their area. Individuals may actively select a plan during a 120 -day change/disenrollment period post -enrollment. The third amendment authorizes expenditures under the LIP through June 30, 2017. The total amount of LIP funding in DY 10 (July 1, 2015 - June 30, 2016) will not exceed $1 billion (total computable). The t otal amount of LIP funding in DY 11 (July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017) will not exceed $607,825,452 million (total computable). The changes represent a transition to a LIP that reflects the cost to providers of uncompensated care for uninsured individuals in the state, and that no longer pays for care that may be or has been provided through available coverage options. The changes set Florida on a path to administering a LIP in 2016 -2017 (DY 11) that distributes funds based on the burden placed on providers by services for low -income, uninsured individuals for whom no other coverage options are, or could be, made available. On September XX, 2016, CMS approved three amendments to the demonstration. The first amendment authorizes changes to the demonstration to allow Florida flexibility to contract with up to three vendors under the hemophilia program. The second amendment authorizes changes to the demonstration to include payment for nursing facility services in MMA capitation rates for recipients under the age of 18 years. Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 59 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 The third amendment authorizes changes to the demonstration to allow flexibility for specialty plans to conduct Performance Improvement Projects (PIP) on topics that have more specific impacts to their enrollees, with Florida approval. Under the demonstration, Florida seeks to continue building on the following objectives: Improving outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The demonstration seeks to improve c are for Medicaid beneficiaries by providing care through nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top quality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state will provide oversight focused on imp roving access and increasing quality of care. Improving program performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as HEDIS scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide an d competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabilize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care by enrolling all Medicaid enrollees in managed care except those specifically exempted due to short -term eligibility, limited service eligibility, or institutional placement (other than nursing home care). Increasing access to, stabilizing, and strengthening providers that serve uninsured, low - income populations in the state by targeting LIP funding to reimburse uncompensated care costs for services provided to low -income uninsured patients at hospitals that are furnished through charity care programs that adhere to the Hea lthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) principles.3 3 http://www.hfma.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=14589 Florida Manag ed Medical Assistance Program Page 60 Approval period: July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2017 As amended October 15, 2015 and October 12, 2016 B.

Prior to submitting the draft transition and phase -out plan to CMS, the state must publish on its website the draft transition and phase -out plan for a 30 -day public comment period. In ad dition, the state must conduct tribal consultation in accordance with its approved tribal consultation state plan amendment. Once the 30 -day public comment period has ended, the state must provide a summary of each public comment received, the state's res ponse to the comment and how the state incorporated the received comment into a revised phase - out plan. ................................ ................................ ................................ ...................... 5 b. The state must obtain CMS approval of the phase -out plan prior to the implementation of the phase -out activities. Implementation of phase -out activities must be no sooner than 14 days after CMS approval of the phase -out plan. ................................ ............. 6 c. Transition and Phase -out Plan Requirements: The state must include, at a minimum, in its phase -out plan, the process by which it will notify affected beneficiaries (including those on any applicable wait lists), the content of said notices (including information on the beneficiary's appeal rights), the process by which the state will conduct administrative reviews of Medicaid eligibility for the affected beneficiaries, and ensu re ongoing coverage for those beneficiaries whether currently enrolled or on a wait list, determined to be eligible individuals, as well as any community outreach activities, including community resources that are available. ................................ ....................... 6 d. Phase -out Procedures: The state must comply with all notice requirements found in 42 CFR \u00a7 431.206, 431.210 and 431.213.

If a demonstration participant requests a hearing before the date of action, the state must maintain benefits as required in 42 CFR \u00a7431.23 0. In addition, the state must conduct administrative renewals for all affected beneficiaries in order to determine if they qualify for Medicaid eligibility under a different eligibility category as discussed in October 1, 2010, State Health Official Lett er #10 -008. ......... 6 f. Federal Financial Participation (FFP): If the project is terminated or any relevant waivers suspended by the state, FFP shall be limited to normal closeout costs associated with terminating the demonstration including services and administrative costs of disenrolling enrollees. ................................ ................................ ..................... 6 ATTACHMENT C Page 65 10. Expiring Demonstration Authority. For demonstration authority that expires prior to the demonstration's expiration date, the state must submit a demonstration expiration plan to CMS no later than 6 months prio r to the applicable demonstration authority's expiration date, consistent with the following requirements: ................................ ......... 6 11. CMS Right to Terminate or Suspend. CMS may suspend or terminate the demonstration (in whole or in part) at any time before the date of expiration, whenever it determines, following a hearing, that the state has materially failed to comply with the terms o f the project. CMS will promptly notify the state in writing of the determination and the reasons for the suspension or termination, together with the effective date. ... 7 12. Finding of Non -Compliance. The state does not relinquish its rights to challenge the CMS finding that the state materially failed to comply. ................................ ................. 7 13. Withdrawal of Waiver or Expenditure Authority. CMS reserves the right to withdraw waiver or expenditure authorities at any time it determines that contin uing the waiver or expenditure authorities would no longer be in the public interest or promote the objectives of Title XIX. CMS will promptly notify the state in writing of the determination and the reasons for the withdrawal, together with the effective date, and afford the state an opportunity to request a hearing to challenge CMS' determination prior to the effective date. If a waiver or expenditure authority is withdrawn, FFP is limited to normal closeout costs associated with terminating the waiver or expenditure authority, including services and administrative costs of disenrolling enrollees. ........... 7 14. Adequacy of Infrastructure . The state must ensure the availability of adequate resources for implementation and monitoring of the demonstration, including education, outreach, and enrollment; maintaining eligibility systems; compliance with cost-sharing requirements; and reporting on financial and other demonstration components. ................................ ................................ ................................ ................ 8 16.

Capitation rates shall be developed and certified as actuarially sound in accordance with 42 CFR 438.6. The certifica tion shall identify historical utilization of state plan services used in the rate development process. ........ 9 IV. ENROLLMENT FOR THE M ANAGED MEDICAL ASSIS TANCE PROGRAM ................................ ......................... 10 19. Consistency with State Plan Eligibility Criteria. There is no change to Medicaid eligibility. Standards for eligibility remain set forth under the state plan. There is no eligibility expansion or reduction under this demonstration. ................................ ........ 10 20. Enrollment in managed care under the MMA p rogram . The MMA program began implementation on April 1, 2014 and is expected to complete implementation in all counties by September 30, 2014. MMA program enrollees are individuals eligible under the approved state plan, who reside in the MMA program re gions and who are described below as \"mandatory enrollees\" or as \"voluntary enrollees\". Mandatory enrollees are required to enroll in a capitated managed care plan or FFS PSN as a condition of receipt of Medicaid benefits. Voluntary enrollees are exempt from mandatory enrollment, but have elected to enroll in a demonstration capitated managed care plan or FFS PSN to receive Medicaid benefits. ................................ ...10 V. ENROLLMENT ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .............. 13 21. New Enroll ees. At the time of their application for Medicaid, individuals who would be mandated to enroll in managed care under MMA must receive information about managed care plan choices in their area. They must be informed of their options in ATTACHMENT C Page 66 selecting an auth orized managed care plan. Individuals must be provided the opportunity to meet or speak with a choice counselor to obtain additional information in making a choice, and to indicate a plan choice selection if they are prepared to do so. Eligible individua ls will be enrolled in a managed care plan upon eligibility determination. If the individual has not selected a plan at the time of the approval of eligibility, the state may auto -assign the individual into a managed care plan. Individuals who have been auto-assigned at enrollment will receive both their managed care plan assignment and information about choice of plans in their area. Such individuals then may actively select a plan during a 120 -day change/disenrollment -period without cause post -enrollme nt. All individuals will be provided with information regarding their rights to change plans. Once the plan selection is registered and takes effect, the plan must communicate to the enrollee, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.10, the benefits covered under t he plan, including dental benefits, and how to access those benefits. ................................ ................................ 13 22. Auto-Enrollment Criteria. Each enrollee must have an opportunity to select a managed care plan before or upon being determined eligible for Medicaid . Individuals must be provided information to encourage an active selection electronically or in print. Enrollees who fail to choose a plan by the time their eligibility is determined will be auto-assigned to a managed care plan. At a minimum, the state must use the criteria listed below when assigning an enrollee to a managed care plan. When more than one managed care plan meets the assignment criteria, the state will make enrollee assignments consecutively by family unit. The criteria include but are not limited to: .13 23. Auto Enrollment for Special Populations. For an enrollee who is also a recipient of Supplemental Security Inc ome (SSI), prior to assigning the SSI beneficiary to a managed care plan, the state must determine whether the SSI beneficiary has an ongoing relationship with a provider or managed care plan; and if so, the state must assign the SSI recipient to that mana ged care plan whenever feasible. Those SSI recipients who do not have such a provider relationship must be assigned to a managed care plan using the assignment criteria previously outlined. ........................ 14 24. Lock -In/Disenrollment. Once a mandatory enrollee has selected or been assigned an MMA plan, the enrollee shall be enrolled for a total of 12 months, until the next open enrollment period, unless the individual is determined ineligible for Medicaid. The 12 month period includes a 120 -day period upon initial eligibility or re -eligibility determination to change or voluntarily disenroll from a plan without cause and select another plan. If a n individual chooses to remain in a plan past 120 days, the individual will be permitted no further changes in enrollment until the next open enrollment period, except for cause. Good cause reasons for disenrollment from a plan are defined in Rule 59 -G-8.600, Florida Administrative Code . Voluntary enrollees may disenroll from the plan at any time. ................................ ................................ ............. 15 25. Re-enrollment. In instances of a temporary loss of Medicaid eligibility, which the state is defining as 6 months or less, the state will re -enroll demonstration enrollees in the same capitated managed care plan or FFS PSN they were enrolled in prior to the temporary loss of eligibili ty unless enrollment into the entity has been suspended. The individual will have the same change/disenrollment period without cause as upon initial enrollment. ................................ ................................ ................................ .................. 15 VI. BENEFIT PACKAGES AND PLANS IN THE MMA PRO GRAM ................................ ................................ ........... 15 26. Customized Benefit Packages . MMA plans have the flexibility to provide customized benefit packages for demonstration enrollees as long as the benefit package meets certain minimum standards described in this STC, and actuarial benefit equivalency requirements and benefit sufficiency requirements described in paragraphs 26 -32. For ATTACHMENT C Page 67 other plans, customized benefit packages must include all state plan services otherwise available under the state plan for pregnant women and children including all EPSDT services for children under age 21. The customized benefit packages must include all mandatory services specified in the state plan for all populations. The amount, duration and scope of optional services, may vary to reflect the needs of the plan's target population and plans can offer ad ditional services and benefits not available under the state plan. The plans contracted with the state shall not have service limits more restrictive than authorized in the state plan for children under the age of 21, pregnant women, and emergency service s. ................................ ............... 15 Policies for determining medical necessity for children covered under the EPSDT benefit must be consistent with Federal stat ute at \u00a71905(r) of the Social Security Act (\"the Act\") in authorizing vision, dental, hearing services, and other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures described in \u00a71905(a) of the Act to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, whether or not such services are covered in the state plan. ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 15 27. Overall Standards for Customized Benefit Packages. All benefit packages must be prior-approved by the state and CMS and must be at least actuarially equivalent to the services provided to the target population under the current state pla n benefit package. In addition, the plan's customized benefit package must meet a sufficiency test to ensure that it is sufficient to meet the medical needs of the target population. Customized benefit packages, as analyzed through the Plan Evaluation To ol (PET) discussed below, must be submitted to CMS for approval as part of the standard CMS contract review process. ................................ ................................ ............................. 16 28. Plan Evaluation Tool. The state will utilize a PET to determine if a plan that is applying for, or has been awarded, an MMA plan contract meets state requirements. The PET measures for actuarial equivalency and sufficiency. Specifically, the PET: (1) compares the value of the level of benefits (actuarial equivalency) in the proposed package to the value of the current state plan package for the average member of the population; and (2) ensures that the overall level (sufficiency) of certain benefits is adequate to cover the vast majority of enrollees. The state will evaluate service utilization on an annual basis and use this information to update the PET to ensure that actuarial equivalence calculations and sufficiency thresholds reflect current utiliza tion levels. ................................ ................................ ................................ ......... 16 29. Plan Evaluation Tool: Actuarial Equivalency. Actuarial equivalence is evaluated at the target -population leve l and is measured based on that population's historical utilization of services for current Medicaid state plan services. This process ensures that the expected claim cost levels of all managed care plans are equal (using a common benchmark reimbursement structure) to the level of the historic FFS plan for the target population and its historic levels of utilization. The state uses this as the first threshold to evaluate the customized benefit package submitted by a plan to ensure that the package earns t he premium established by the state. In assessing actuarial equivalency, the PET considers the following components of the benefit package: services covered; cost -sharing; and additional benefits offered, if any. Additional services offered by the plan w ill be considered a component of the plan's customized benefits and not a component of the Enhanced Benefit Plan. ................................ .....16 30. Plan Eva luation Tool: Sufficiency . In addition to meeting the actuarial equivalence test, each health plan's proposed customized benefit package must meet or exceed, and maintain, a minimum threshold of 98.5 percent for benefits identified as sufficiency -tested b enefits. The sufficiency test provides a safeguard when plans elect to vary the amount, duration and scope of certain services. This standard is based on ATTACHMENT C Page 68 the target -population's historic use of the applicable Medicaid state plan services (e.g. outpatient hospital services, outpatient pharmacy prescriptions) identified by the state as sufficiency -tested benefits. Each proposed benefit plan must be evaluated against the sufficiency standard to ensure that the proposed benefits are adequate to cover the vas t majority of enrollees. The sufficiency standard for a service may be based on the proportion of the historical utilization for the target population that is expected to exceed the plan's proposed benefit level. ................................ ................................ ...16 31. Evaluation of Plan Benefits. The state will review and update the PET for assessing a plan's benefit structure to ensure actuarial equivalence and that s ervices are sufficient to meet the needs of enrollees in the demonstration area. At a minimum, the state must conduct the review and update on an annual basis. The state will provide CMS with 60 -days advance notice and a copy of any proposed changes to t he PET. ......... 17 VII. COST -SHARING ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ...... 17 32. Premiums and -Payments. The state must pre -approve all cost -sharing allowed by MMA plans. Cost -sharing must be consistent with the state plan except that managed care plans may elect to assess cost -sharing that is les s than what is allowed under the state plan. ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 17 VIII. PROGRA M IMPLEMENTATION ................................ ................. 17 33. MMA Program Implementation Requirements. The state will continue with the implementation of the MMA program in a region if it meets the following implementation requirements for that region (subject to CMS review and approval). ..17 34. MMA Program Regions. The MMA program shall be implemented over a period beginning no earlier than January 1, 2014 and no later than October 1, 2014, as described in paragraph 33. Note: Medicare -Medicaid eligible beneficiaries who are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan will partici pate in an open enrollment period that coincides with the Medicare open enrollment period (October 15 through December 7) to facilitate beneficiaries' choice of Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans. Therefore, MMA coverage will begin on January 1, 201 5 for beneficiaries in both Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans.

Beneficiaries whose health plans will not continue in their region under the MMA program may continue to receive ATTACHMENT C Page 70 services from their treating provider for up to 60 calendar days after their enrollment effective date under their new MMA health plan. ................................ ........................ 24 a. Communication regarding the continuation of services will be publicized through the state's outreach and community strategy to beneficiaries, providers, and the general public. ................................ ................................ ................................ ......................... 24 b. Health plans will be required to authorize services and reimburse providers whether the provider is contracted with the health plans or an out of network provider. ........... 24 52. Implementation Calls with the Health Plans . The state must develop a schedule of calls with health plans during implementation of MMA program to discuss any issues that arise. The state must submit a copy of the schedule of implementation calls to CMS and allow CMS the opportunity to participate in the state's implementation calls with health plans. The calls sho uld cover all health plans operations and determine plans for correcting any issues as quickly as possible. For the first 60 days in which the region transitions to the MMA program CMS will require weekly reporting of issues encountered and plans for and status of resolution during the Implementation Monitoring conference calls specified in STC 72. ................................ ........................ 25 XI. CHOICE COUNSELING ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .. 26 54. Choice Counseling Defined. The state shall contract for choice counselor services in the MMA program regions to provide full and complete information about managed care plans choices. The state will ensure a choice counseling system that promotes and improves health literacy and provides information to reduce minority health disparities through outreach activities. ................................ ................................ ........ 26 55. Choice -Counseling Materials. Through the choice counselor the state offers an extensive enrollee education and rating system so individua ls will fully understand their choices and be able to make an informed selection. Outcomes important to enrollees will be measured consistently for each plan, and the data will be made available publicly. ................................ ................................ ................................ ...................... 26 56.

Low Income Pool Definition. In Demonstration Year 10, the LIP provides transitional government support for th e safety net providers that furnish uncompensated care to the Medicaid, underinsured and uninsured populations. In Demonstration Year 11 (SFY 2016 -2017) the LIP provides government support for safety net providers for the costs of uncompensated charity ca re for low -income individuals that are uninsured. Uncompensated care includes charity care for the uninsured but does not include uncompensated care for insured individuals, \"bad debt,\" or Medicaid and CHIP shortfall. The definition also excludes the est imated impact on uncompensated care that would result from Medicaid expansion, or that has resulted from Marketplace coverage, under the Affordable Care Act. This is reflected in the total computable dollar limit discussed in STC 64. ................................ ................................ ................. 29 64. Availability of Low Income Pool Funds. The following paragraph presents the total computable dollar limit for LIP spending in DYs 10 and 11, su bject to assurances. ....29 a. Total LIP Amount. The total computable dollar limit for LIP expenditures in DY 10 will be $1 billion. The total computable dollar limit for LIP expenditu res in DY 11 will be $607,825,452 million. ................................ ................................ ................................ .29 b. Assurance. As reflected in the LIP participation requirements in STC 73, in DY 1 1, the state and participating providers who plan to participate in LIP for DY11 will provide assurance that LIP claims include only costs associated with uncompensated care that is furnished through a charity care program for individuals with incomes up t o at least 200 percent of the federal poverty level that adheres to the principles of the Healthcare Financial Management Association operated by the provider. ................................ ....29 65. Capped Annual Allotments. All annual LIP funds must be expended by July 31 following each authorized demonstration year. Any amount not expended does not roll over. Capped annual allotment amounts that are not distr ibuted because of penalties, recoupment due to payments exceeding uncompensated care cost, or are otherwise due to violating the terms of the approved STCs cannot be rolled over to another DY and are not recoverable. LIP dollars that are lost as a result o f penalties or recoupment are surrendered by the state and not recoverable. ................................ ...................... 30 66. LIP Reimbursement and Funding Methodology. Th e Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document (RFMD) is prepared by the state and documents LIP permissible expenditures, including the non -federal share and the total computable expenditures. The RFMD provides that total computable LIP payments to pr oviders for uncompensated care costs must be supported by uncompensated care costs incurred and reported by providers as charity care on the provider's financial records. Through the RFMD, the state must demonstrate that it has reconciled LIP payments to auditable costs. LIP provider payments for uncompensated care as charity care are limited to the uncompensated portion of providers' allowable costs and, in the aggregate, the authorized LIP pool amount for the demonstration year. ..................... 30 a. Prior to November 30, 2015, the state must submit a draft of DYs 10 and 11 (2016 - 2017) RFMDs to CMS for approval and CMS will work with Florida towards app roval by January 31, 2016. However, Florida may not claim federal financial participation for LIP payments in DY 11 until after a revised RFMD is approved by CMS. ................... 30 67. Low Income Pool Permissible Expenditures. Funds from the LIP may be used for health care costs (medical care costs or premiums) that would be within the definition of medical assistance in Section 1905(a) of the Ac t. ................................ ................... 31 a. In DY 10 (SFY 2015 -2016), these health care costs may be incurred by the state, or by hospitals, clinics, or by other pro vider types to furnish medical care for Medicaid, uninsured and underinsured populations for which compensation is not available from other payors, including other federal or state programs. Such costs may include premium payments, payments for provider a ccess systems (PAS) and insurance ATTACHMENT C Page 73 products for such services provided to otherwise uninsured individuals, as agreed upon by the state and CMS. These health care costs may also include costs for Medicaid services that exceed Medicaid payments (after all ot her title XIX payments are made, including disproportionate share hospital payments). ................................ .31 68. Low Income Pool Permissible Expendit ures 10 percent Sub Cap. For DY 10, up to $100 million of the capped annual allotment of the LIP funds may be used for hospital expenditures other than payments to providers for the provision of health care services to an uninsured or underinsured individ ual. Payments from this sub -cap may be used for the improvement or continuation of specialty health care services that benefit the uninsured and underinsured, such as capacity building and infrastructure, hospital trauma services, hospital neonatal servic es, rural hospital services, pediatric hospital services, teaching or specialty hospital services, or safety net providers. Hospital costs funded by these payments cannot be included as allowable costs for purposes of any federally -supported program. The reimbursement methodologies for these expenditures and the non -federal share of funding for such expenditures will be defined in the Reimbursement and Funding Methodology Document as discussed in paragraph 66. ................................ ................................ ................................ ............. 31 69. Low Income Pool Permissible Hospital Expenditures. Hospital cost expenditures from the LIP will be paid up to cost and are further defined in the Reimburs ement and Funding Methodology document utilizing methodologies from the CMS -2552 cost report plus mutually agreed upon additional costs.

The following describes th e reporting of member months for demonstration populations. ................................ ................................ .................... 41 85. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. The state must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each federal fiscal year (FFY) on the Form CMS -37 (narrative section) for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and state and Local Administrative Costs (ADM). CMS will make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 wi th federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. .................... 42 86.

Monitoring the Demonstration. The state must provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable timeframe. .......44 91. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. ............................. 44 XVIII. MONITORING BUDGET NE UTRALITY ................................ ................................ .............................. 44 92. Budget Neutrality Limit for the LIP. The LIP amount is capped at $1 billion total computable for DY 10 and $607,825,452 million for DY 11. Funds not distributed in a DY may be rolled over to the next DY. The federal share of the total computable is the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive during the extension period for the types of Medicaid expenditures for the LIP. For each DY, the federal share will be calculated using the FMAP rate(s) applicable to that ye ar. ................................ ................................ ................................ ...44 93. Limit on PMPM Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of federal Title XIX funding that the state may receive on the Medicaid and demonstration expenditures identified in paragraph 83 during the approval period of the demonstration. The limit is determined using a PMPM method. The budget neutrality targets are set on a yearly basis with a c umulative budget neutrality limit for the length of the entire demonstration. All data supplied by the state to CMS is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality limit. CMS' assessment of the st ate's compliance with these limits will be done using the CMS -64 Report from the MBES/CBES System. .......44 94. Risk. The state shall be at risk for the per capita cost of demonstration enrollees under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration enrollees. By providing ATTACHMENT C Page 77 FFP for all demonstration enrollees, the state will not be at risk for changing economic conditions which impact enrollment levels. However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration enrollees, CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. ................................ ................................ ................................ .......... 45 95. Budget Neutrality Expenditure Limit. The following describes the method for calculating the budget neutrality expenditure limit for the demonstration. Demonstration expenditures are defined under the following Medicaid Eligibility Groups (MEGs) as referenced in paragraph 83(d): ................................ ................................ ................................ .......................... 45 96. How the Limit will be Applied . The limits as defined in paragraphs 92 through 95 will apply to the actual expenditures for the demonstration, as reported by the state under Section XVIII . If at the end of the demonstration period the budget neutrality provision has been exceeded, the excess federal funds will be returned to CMS. There will be no new limit placed on the FFP that the state can claim for expenditures for recipients and pro gram categories not listed. ................................ ................................ .............. 46 97. Impermissible DSH, Taxes or Donations . CMS reserves the right to adjust the budget neutrality ceiling to be consistent with enforcement of impermissible provider payments, health care related taxes, new federal statutes, or policy interpretations implemented through state Medicaid Director Letters, other memoranda, or regulations. CMS reserves th e right to make adjustments to the budget neutrality cap if any health care related tax that was in effect during the base year, or provider related donation that occurred during the base year, is determined by CMS to be in violation of the provider donati on and health care related tax provisions of 1903(w) of the Social Security Act. Adjustments to annual budget targets will reflect the phase out of impermissible provider payments by law or regulation, where applicable. ................... 46 98. PMPM Expenditure Review. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration, rather than on an annual basis. However, no later than 6 mo nths after the end of each demonstration year, the state will calculate an annual expenditure target for the completed year and report it to CMS as part of the reporting guidelines in paragraph 80. This amount will be compared with the actual FFP claimed by the state under budget neutrality. Using the schedule below as a guide for the PCCM budget limit, if the state exceeds the cumulative target, they shall submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. The state will subsequently implement the app roved program. ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ..... 46 99. Submission of Draft Evaluation Design Updates. Included with any application for an amendment or an extension, the state must submit to CMS for approval a draft evaluation design update that revises the evaluation design in relation to the proposed change s to the demonstration and that builds upon the most recent evaluation findings. At a minimum, the draft design must include a discussion of the goals, objectives and specific testable hypotheses, including those that focus specifically on target populati ons for the demonstration, and more generally on beneficiaries, providers, plans, market areas and public expenditures. The analysis plan must cover all elements in paragraph 101). The updated design should be described in sufficient detail to determine that it is scientifically rigorous. The data strategy must be thoroughly documented. The updated design should accommodate and reflect the staggered implementation of the MMA program to produce more reliable estimates of program impacts. The design shou ld describe how the evaluation and reporting will develop and be maintained to assure its scientific rigor and completion. In summary, the demonstration evaluation will meet all standards of leading academic institutions ATTACHMENT C Page 78 and academic journal peer review, as appropriate for each aspect of the evaluation, including standards for the evaluation design, conduct, interpretation, and reporting of findings. Among the characteristics of rigor that will be met are the use of best available data; controls for and r eporting of the limitations of data and their effects on results; and the generalizability of results. ................................ ................................ ..46 100. Cooperation with Fe deral Evaluators. Should HHS undertake an evaluation of any component of the demonstration, the State shall cooperate fully with CMS or the evaluator selected by HHS. The state shall submit the required data to HHS or its contractor ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 47 101.

The report cards must also address the performance of subcontracte d dental plans. ................................ ................................ ................................ ............... 49 ATTACHMENT C Page 79 106. Performance Improvement Projects (PIPs). The state must require each health plan to commit to improving care in the following focus areas, which have the significant potential for achieving the demonstration's goals of improving patient care, population health, and reducing per capita Medicaid expenditure. Specialty plans that focus on specific health condi tions and populations \u2014and that include primarily non - pregnant adults (including HIV/AIDS Specialty Plans, Serious Mental Illness Plans, and the Specialty Plans for Dual Eligibles with Chronic Conditions) \u2014may conduct alternative PIPs on topics more relevant to their enrolled population in place of those indicated in (a) and (b) below, subject to AHCA approval. ................................ .......... 49 107. Measurement Act ivities. The state must ensure that each participating health plan is accountable for metrics on quality and access, including measures to track progress in identified quality improvement focus areas, measures to track quality broadly, and measures to tra ck access.

Table 1 Draft Implementation Schedule 84 Table 2 Projected Enrollment by Region for State Fiscal Year 2014 -2015 85 Table 3 MMA Plans Selected by Region 93 Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistance Program Page 81 I. Executive Summary This document summarizes the implementation schedule and key activities the Agency for Health Care Administration (the Agency) has undertaken or will undertake to implement the Managed Medical Assistance (MMA) program. The following is a brief overview of the waiver, program goals, overall objectives and consumer protections. During implementation, the Agency will focus on four key objectives, with meeting these objectives constituting a successful rollout. First, the rollout in each region must preserv e continuity of care. This entails, to the greatest extent possible, that recipients can keep their current primary care provider and their current prescriptions, and no recipient will have an ongoing course of treatment interrupted. Second, the plans i n the rollout must have sufficient and accurate networks under contract and taking patients, so as to allow an informed choice of plans for recipients and the ability to make appointments. Third, the plans in the rollout must have the ability to pay prov iders fully and promptly to preclude any provider cash flow or payroll issues. This includes giving providers ample opportunity to learn and understand each plan's prior authorization procedures. Fourth, the Agency's choice counseling call center and we bsite must be able to handle the volume of recipients engaged in plan choice at any one time. A. Waiver Overview Florida's Section 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver, entitled \"Managed Medical Assistance Waiver,\" (# 11-W-00206/4), is designed to implement a new statewide managed care delivery system that will improve outcomes, improve consumer satisfaction, reduce and control costs and continue the Low Income Pool program . The MMA program will build upon the successful elements of the previous demonstration while incorporating stronger protections for consumers as well as higher standards and more significant positive and negative incentives for plans. In addition, the following three statewide programs will transition January 1, 20 14 under the authority of the MMA Waiver as they operate today and as specified in Special Term and Conditions #70 and #71 of the approved waiver. The Healthy Start Program; The Program for All Inclusive Care for Children; and The Comprehensive Hemophil ia Management Program The MMA program was established as a component of the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care program in Part IV of Chapter 409, Florida Statutes, by the Florida Legislature in 2011. The MMA program is guided by principles designed to improv e coordination and patient care while fostering fiscal responsibility. The following paragraphs outline the MMA program goals, objectives and consumer protections. A detailed description of the MMA program is available on the Agency's Website: http://ahca.myflorida.com/smmc . Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistance Program Page 82 B. Goals and Objectives 1. Goals and Objectives : The goals of the MMA program are to improve outcomes through care coordination, patient engagement in their own health care, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The Agency envisions a Medicaid program where all recipients will choose their MCO from a list of nationally accredited managed care plans with broad networks, expansive benefits packages, top q uality scores, and high rate of customer satisfaction. The state's role has changed so that it is largely a purchaser of care, providing oversight focused on improving access and increasing quality of care. The overall program objectives are: Improving pr ogram performance, particularly improved scores on nationally recognized quality measures (such as HEDIS scores), through expanding key components of the Medicaid managed care program statewide and competitively procuring plans on a regional basis to stabi lize plan participation and enhance continuity of care. A key objective of improved program performance is to increase patient satisfaction. Improving access to coordinated care by enrolling all Medicaid participants in managed care except those specifical ly exempted due to short -term eligibility, limited service eligibility, or institutional placement (other than nursing home care). Enhancing fiscal predictability and financial management by converting the purchase of Medicaid services to capitated, ris k-adjusted payment systems. Strict financial oversight requirements are established for managed care organizations (MCOs) to improve fiscal integrity. C. Consumer Protections The MMA program will increase consumer protections as well as quality of care and access for Floridians in many ways including: 1. Increasing recipient participation on Florida's Medical Care Advisory Committee and convening smaller advisory committees to f ocus on key special needs populations; 2. Ensuring the continuation of services until a primary care or behavioral health provider reviews the enrollee's treatment plan; 3. Ensuring immediate review of recipient complaints, grievances and appeals for resolution as part of the Rapid Cycle Improvement Process; 4. Establishing Healthy Behaviors programs to encourage and reward healthy behaviors and, at a minimum, requiring plans offer a medically approved smoking cessation program, a medically directed weight loss prog ram and a medically approved alcohol or substance abuse recovery program ; 5. Requiring Florida's External Quality Review Organization to validate each plan's encounter data; 6. Enhancing consumer report cards to ensure recipients have access to understandable summaries of quality, access and timeliness regarding the performance of each participating managed care plan; 7. Enhancing the plan's performance improvement projects by focusing on six key areas with the goal of achieving improved patient care, population hea lth and reducing per capita Medicaid expenditures; 8. Enhancing metrics on plan quality and access to care to improve plan accountability; and 9. Creating a comprehensive and continues state quality strategy to focus on all aspects of quality improvement in Medi caid. 10. Adding benefits, particularly dental care, disease management and other initiatives that improve health outcomes.

Phased Implementation A. Implementation Overview The Agency will phase -in the implementation of the program and has carefully planned the transition of the affected recipients to preserve continuity of care. The Agency will follow a multi -layered approach when transitioning recipients into the program by: Coordinating with the contracted plans and the Agency's choice counseling vendor to create a phased transition to ensure that the volume of recipients bei ng transitioned occurs in an organized manner. This will allow recipients to access choice counseling in stages via phone or via internet, and will make it easier for the Agency and its choice counseling vendor to provide excellent customer services during the roll out. Planning , organizing and implementing a thorough desk and on -site review of all plans to ensure processes and systems are in place before recipients are enrolled, including assessing the capacity of the contracted plans' provider networks. Ensuring continuity of care and continued availability of current primary care and behavioral health providers with the new plan by monitoring plan network participation. Ensuring appropriate and timely notice to recipients, including outreach and educatio n to locations and providers frequented by impacted recipients to help recipients understand the changes that are occurring. Engaging key stakeholders and advocacy groups as well as monitoring complaints through the Rapid Cycle Improvement Process. Append ix I provides a list of the key implementation activities the Agency has or will undertake to implement the MMA program. B. Implementation Schedule Table 1 provides the phased implementation schedule for the MMA program. The estimated total enrollment f or the MMA program is 3,071,171 recipients in state fiscal year 2014 -2015. This projection is based upon the proportion of the total Medicaid population eligible for the MMA program, applied to the Long Range Economic and Demographic Research forecast for the Medicaid caseloads in state fiscal year 2014 -2015. Table 2 located on the following page shows the projected regional enrollment in state fiscal year 2014 -2015.

C. Implementation Triggers, Risks and Mitigation Strategy The triggers and risks that would prevent the Agency from proceeding with implementation include: System failures that prevent recipients from plan enrollment; Lack of choice of two plans in a region due to unresolved litigation (bid protests); Failure of selected plans to meet the readiness review standards and more specifically failure of the plans in the a region to, in the aggregate, build networks sufficient to service the regions population; Systems failures that compromise ongoing courses of treatment and that cannot be resolved through a rapid improvement process. The triggers and risks described above are also the circumstances that would stop the Agency proceeding with implementation to the next region. The Agency will use the follow ing mitigation strategies for the identified risks that could prevent proceeding with implementation in a region: The Agency will monitor the enrollment process daily to determine if any systems issues have developed that prevent recipients from enrolling in their selected plan. The enrollment process the Agency uses has been operational for many years and has effectively functioned during the roll out of the Long -term Care program. The Agency does not anticipate significant problems in this area but wil l monitor the enrollment process daily to ensure problems are resolved immediately. The Agency is working through the competitive procurement bid protest process. The Agency will not implement the program in a region that does not have at least two plans available. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 86 The Agency will conduct the plan readiness review process to ensure all plans are ready to accept recipients upon implementation and have networks in place to serve them. The plan readiness review process is outlined in Section II.J of this d ocument. The Agency will notify the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at least 30 days in advance of conducting on-site readiness review of the plans. The Agency has established a Rapid Cycle Improvement Process to address recipient complaints in cluding complaints about disruption in services. The Agency has historically resolved recipient complaints quickly as demonstrated in the quarterly and annual reports. A description of the Rapid Cycle Improvement Process is provided under Section II.E of this document. The Agency's fail -safe or back -up plan in the event that the mitigation strategy fails is to allow recipients to access the Medicaid fee -for-service system. D. Implementation - Stakeholder's Role Stakeholder feedback will be reviewed an d taken into consideration when determining further implementation of the program to the next region. Stakeholder feedback is a valued component of the Agency's continuous quality improvement strategy to ensure recipients have access to high quality servic es through the selected MMA plans. The Agency will closely monitor stakeholder feedback through the Rapid Cycle Improvement process described below. E. Rapid Cycle Improvement Process Complaints received by the Agency regarding the MMA plans will provide the Agency with feedback on the operation of the program. Complaints may come from recipients, advocates, providers and other stakeholders and are triaged through the Medicaid managed care complaint center. MMA complaints are submitted to the SMMC complaint center via the online complaint form where they are then recorded, triaged and tracked by SMMC complaint center staff. Complaints are then assigned to and researched/resolved by F lorida Medicaid field staff and/or Headquarters staff, depending on the nature and complexity of the complaint. Some complaints are referred directly to the MMA plan for resolution, and the Agency will track these complaints to ensure resolution. Agency s taff will use the Complaints/Issues Reporting and Tracking System, which will allow for real -time, secure access through the Agency's web portal. During implementation, the SMMC complaint center will provide a daily report of recorded MMA complaints by com plaint type. The daily report will be used to quickly identify and resolve critical issues. The Agency will also track the complaints by plan to review complaint data on individual plans on a weekly basis during the first 90 days of implementation in a r egion. After the first 90 days of implementation, the complaints will be tracked by plan on a monthly basis to review complaint data on individual plans. F. Comprehensive Outreach and Education Strategy 1. Overall Outreach and Communication Strategy The Agency has developed a multi -pronged outreach and communication strategy for sharing information about the MMA program. The Agency has separate strategies for outreach to recipients, providers and other stakeholder groups, yet there are some common resou rces available to all audiences. For example, the Agency has created a dedicated Website, Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 87 www.myflorida.com/SMMC , specifically for the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) program. The Website has dedicated sections for both the Long -term Care (LTC) program and the MMA program. The Website includes a calendar of events, which will be populated with the dates of mailings, webinars and public meetings. It also displays the email address dedicated to the SMMC program ( FLMedicaidManagedCare@ahca.myflorida.com ) where questions, comments or concerns can be submitted. All questions are responded to and included in the posted Frequently Asked Question s document. The posted Frequently Asked Questions document is in a searchable PDF format with a table of contents and includes sections for LTC and MMA. The posted Frequently Asked Questions document is updated regularly with new questions and includes t he date for which the most recent update was made. Earlier this year, the Agency developed profiles on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to post information about SMMC program features, updates, resources, dates of importance and webinars. The Facebook and YouTube profiles can also accept reports of complaints or concerns through a private message. Another communication resource that crosses all three outreach groups is the SMMC interested parties email list -serve, which currently has 4,257 individuals sig ned up. Anyone who is interested in learning more about the SMMC program and would like to receive an email alert when key new information is available, for example when guidance statements are released and webinars are scheduled, may be added to the dist ribution list by signing up on the Agency Website. With the MMA program being the second phase of SMMC to be implemented, the Agency has been broadly communicating about it for more than two years since the legislation that created the program became law. Since that time, the Agency has shared information about both LTC and MMA to stakeholder groups. The communication and outreach strategy delineated in this document is a prospective plan for MMA -specific communication activities, which are anticipated t o begin in December 2013. 2. Recipient Outreach Of utmost concern is direct, clear and timely communication to recipients. The primary method of direct communication with recipients is via letter mailed to their address of record. The Agency plans to send a \"pre -welcome\" letter to each recipient 120 d ays ahead of the \"go live\" date for their respective region. The pre -welcome letter introduces the new program and places the recipient on alert for forthcoming correspondence about the upcoming plan choice. Approximately 60 days before implementation in a region, recipients will be mailed a welcome letter, a packet of information about the plans available in their region and information about accessing the available choice counseling services. Recipients who do not select a plan by 30 days before implem entation will receive a third letter reminding them to make their plan choice by an assigned date or they will be automatically assigned to the plan listed in their letter. The Agency continues to use choice counseling services to assist recipients. Recipients are encouraged to use the choice counseling services to learn more about the plans that will be offered in their areas and to make their plan selection. The Agency will have a call center, located in Tallahassee as well as 22 contracted field s taff and an additional local Medicaid office staff who will be certified choice counselors to assist in person . The Agency's choice counseling vendor, Automated Health Systems, will also conduct an outbound call campaign. Field choice counseling efforts a nd outbound calls will focus on recipients with special needs who may require additional assistance in choosing a plan. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 88 The Agency has previously been successful in using traditional media outlets to assist with sharing information. In addition, the Agen cy has previously been successful in submitting guest columns that contain information about the program and upcoming choice timeframes in local newspapers. This strategy was used during the LTC program implementation as another avenue to notify recipient that (1) they should have already received at least one letter from the Agency about the new program and (2) the date by which the recipient should select their plan before auto assignment will take effect. This is a very broad strategy, but one that not ifies both recipients and the general public about the program. 3. Provider Outreach Communication to providers, directly and via their respective membership associations, is the second layer of the Agency's outreach and communication strategy. The ear liest official communication about the MMA program to service providers will likely come from provider alert emails and via the Agency's quarterly provider bulletin. These avenues are used to educate providers about resources, guidance statements, upcomin g trainings and other relevant information. Provider alert emails are sent on an as needed basis, and provider bulletins are distributed and posted on the Agency's Website quarterly. Similar to the LTC program communication strategy, the Agency will host many webinars of varying topics including MMA 101, Choice Counseling, specific provider related issues, transition of special populations continuity of care requirements, and more. Questions submitted through the webinars are responded to during the live event and are also answered in writing as well as incorporated into the Frequently Asked Questions document that is posted on the SMMC Website. It is anticipated webinars will begin at least 90 days ahead of implementation in the first region, will conti nue through all regions going live and will not cease until the Agency feels additional webinars are no longer requested or necessary based on feedback received from providers or their respective associations. Webinars will continue to be recorded and pos ted via the Agency's YouTube and Slideshare accounts so they remain available at all times for anyone to view and/or download. The Agency plans to engage providers in each region directly with educational sessions specific to the different provider types. These meetings will be scheduled approximately 60 -90 days ahead of the regional \"go live\" date. The Agency will also engage w ith providers via local events and as requested. The Agency has begun engaging provider associations about MMA through formal correspondence and, at about the same time, the mailing of recipient letters will begin and the provider webinar series will be initiated. After this time, the Agency will keep open lines of communication with many of the associations via targeted emails and regular phone calls that will occur through the full MMA program implementation. Similar to LTC, the Agency will share articles, guest columns and resources with the provider associations for them to share with their membership via email or newsletter according to their respective schedules. In addition, the Agency, if invited, will participate in the various association's m eetings and conferences. The Agency currently has field staff who host weekly conference calls and webinar trainings for LTC network providers beginning two weeks prior and continuing four weeks into each region's rollout. These calls serve as a forum fo r specific provider types to ask questions relating to the program and to notify the Agency of any issues occurring during the transition period. This method has proven effective in identifying the training sessions and additional resources network provide rs need to ensure success in their region. The region based conference calls Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 89 and webinar trainings have given the providers immediate technical assistance as well as the opportunity to troubleshoot any obstacles along the way. The Agency plans to use this method for implementation of the MMA program as well. 4. Other Stakeholder Outreach The Agency also believes in effective communication to other stakeholder groups. The MMA plans, executive and legislative staffs, sister state agencies, advocacy group s, the media and the general public are all included in this group. Managed Medical Assistance plans : The Agency will hold calls with plans on a regular basis to share new program information, troubleshoot concerns, and discuss the transition status. The Agency anticipates holding weekly plan calls to address specific readiness issues and the transition of special populations. Executive and Legislative Members and Staff : Agency leadership regularly meets with members of the executive and legislative branches to share information and provide written updates about the implementation of the SMMC program. These meetings will continue through the end of the implementation of the MMA program. The Agency will make presentations at legislative committee me etings during committee weeks and during legislative session, as well as other times as requested, to ensure legislators are informed about the status of implementation of the program. Other State Agencies : Similar to communication with the providers and their associations, the Agency will send out guest columns, inclusive of resources and frequently asked questions to our sister agencies for sharing and distribution to their staff and inclusion in their respective newsletters. Agency leadership will also send targeted emails with specific resources ahead of implementation, for example, how to field calls about the program and where to direct callers who may have questions about a variety of topics. The Agency will also host specific training sessions for fellow state agencies as necessary. Advocacy groups : Similar to the outreach activities conducted for other groups, the Agency will make targeted calls and send targeted emails to different advocacy groups to ensure they are educated about the program a nd timeframes for recipient communication and implementation. The Agency plans to share the recipient letters with key advocacy groups for their review and feedback prior to finalizing the correspondence. 5. Media and the General Public The Agency wil l use traditional and new media avenues to relay information about the MMA program through implementation and after. Press releases are anticipated to occur that announce the pre -welcome letters being mailed as well as the go live date in each region. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will also be used to share resources, webinars and as a means of interacting with the general public about the MMA program. The Agency anticipates hosting a public kickoff event for the launch of the MMA program where the plans , media, legislators and other stakeholders will also be invited. 6. Outreach Schedule Appendix II provides the draft Comprehensive Outreach Schedule. The outreach schedule will be continually updated and will be provided to the Centers for Medicare a nd Medicaid Services regularly. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 90 G. Recipient Enrollment 1. Enrollee Choice Potential enrollees in the MMA regions will initially have the choice of enrolling in a plan. Potential enrollees will have a choice of two or more plans in each region. The Agency assures Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that it will comply with section 1932(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (SSA) and 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 438.52, relating to choice since at least two options will be available in a ll MMA regions. 2. Enrollee Information The Agency's choice counseling vendor will ensure that enrollees are provided with full and complete information about their plan options. The Agency's choice counseling vendor will provide information regarding an individual's choice to select a plan. Through the Agency's choice counseling vendor , the Agency will develop enrollee education materials so individuals will fully understand their choices and will be able to make an informed selection. Outcomes import ant to enrollees will be measured consistently for each plan, and the data will be made available publicly. Specifically, the Agency's choice counseling vendor will provide information on selecting a plan. As it does now, the Agency's designated choice c ounseling vendor will provide information about each plan's coverage in accordance with federal requirements. Additional plan information will include, but is not limited to, benefits and benefit limitations, cost -sharing requirements, provider network inf ormation, prescription drug formulary information and contact information. In addition, the Agency will supplement coverage information by posting performance information on each plan once such data is available. Information provided will include enrolle e satisfaction survey results and performance measure data. Enrollment materials will be provided in a variety of ways including print, telephone, online and face-to-face. All written materials will be at the fourth -grade reading level and available in a language other than English when 5% of the region speaks a language other than English. The Agency's choice counseling vendor will also provide oral interpretation services, regardless of the language, and other services for impaired recipients, such a s TTD/TTY. The choice counseling vendor will operate a toll -free number that individuals may call to ask questions and obtain assistance on plans. The call center will be operational during business days, with extended hours and will be staffed with prof essionals qualified to address the needs of the enrollees and potential enrollees. Individuals in mandatory groups for the MMA program will receive information (mandatory new eligible packet) about the plan choices in their region and will be informed of their option to select an authorized plan or be assigned to a plan. The choice counseling vendor will: Send a pre -welcome letter to each recipient 120 days prior to the MMA program \"go -live\" date by region. The pre -welcome letter will describe the MMA p rogram. It places the recipient on alert for forthcoming correspondence about the upcoming 30 day plan choice period. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 91 Mail a welcome letter, packet of information about the MMA plans available in his or her region and information about accessing the choice counseling services approximately 60 days ahead of implementation. For recipients who do not choose a plan 30 days a head of the go live date, send a third letter reminding them to make their plan choice by the assigned date or they will be automatically assigned to the plan listed in their letter. Upon the enrollment, the plan will send the recipient a welcome and enrol lment packet. The Agency assures the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that it will provide information in accordance with Section 1932(a)(5) of the SSA and 42 CFR 438.10, Information Requirements. H. Continuity of Care Provisions The MMA progr am increases consumer protections as well as quality and access to care for eligible Medicaid recipients as noted earlier under Section I.C of this document. Key continuity of care provisions include: The auto -assignment process - If a recipient does not make an active selection to enroll in an MMA plan during the selection period and their existing plan was selected as an MMA plan, the recipient will remain in the plan (now an MMA plan). This process will ensure recipients stay in the same plan and with the same provider(s) whenever possible. The continuation of services - For at least 60 calendar days after the effective date of enrollment or until the primary care or behavioral health provider reviews the enrollee's treatment plan, recipients will recei ve the same prior authorized or scheduled course of treatment with their existing provider. The plans are also required to r eimburse provid ers whether the p rovider is under cont ract or an out of n etwork provid er. This contract provision ensures payment by the MMA plans to non -participating providers. Prescription drugs - For the first year of operation the plans are required to cover all prescription drugs on the Agency's preferred drug list. The plans are proh ibited from having prior authorization or step therapy edits that are more restrictive than the Agency's prior authorization or step therapy edits. This contract provision will allow for a smooth transition by ensuring recipients continue to receive the sa me drugs they are currently prescribed. In addition to the continuity of care provisions described above, the Agency negotiated the following added benefits with select MMA plans to improve quality and access to care: Enhanced provider network standard s ensuring the plans have robust primary care and specialty provider networks; Increased number of primary care and specialist providers in a region that are accepting new Medicaid recipients; Increased number of primary care providers that offer after hou r appointment availability; Established utilization rates for out -of-network specialty care and hospital admissions; More timely processes for standard and expedited prior authorization requests. For many of the standards, the timeframes for processin g the authorization request have been reduced by almost half; Enhanced standards related to claims processing, and enrollee/provider help line (call center operations); I. Plan Selection Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 92 The Agency has selected the MMA plans through a competitive procurement with strict selection criteria. The program will provide for a limited number of plans in 11 geographic regions to ensure stability, but allow for significant recipient choice and furt her ensure coverage in rural areas of the state. The Agency initiated the procurement of the plans on December 28, 2012 and Notices of Intent of Award were published on September 23, 2013 and October 10, 2013. A listing of the plans selected for each reg ion and relevant information about the procurement can be found via the Florida Department of Management Services' Vendor Bid System at: http://www.myflorida.com/apps/vbs/vbs_www.main_menu . The Agency selec ted 14 standard, non -specialty MMA plans through a competitive procurement process. In addition, the Agency selected five companies to provide services to specialty populations, including specialty plans focused on HIV/AIDS, child welfare and foster care, severe and persistent mental illness, and dual eligbiles with chronic conditions. Table 3 on the following page provides a summary of the MMA plans selected in each region. The Agency anticipates executing the plan contracts in January 2014.

Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 94 J. Plan Readiness Review Process In October 2013, the Agency began the process of conducting a readiness review of MMA plans. The purpose of the readiness review is to assess the ability of the plans to effectively meet contractual requirements and ensure all plans are ready to conduct key operational functions by May 1, 2014, the initial date of MMA program implementation. The Agency developed a readiness review request that all the plans must respond to in order for the Agency to complete a through desk review of identified key areas. The key areas include: Administration and Management Care Coordination/ Case Management Claims Management Covered Services Enrollee Materials Enrollee Services Finance Grievance Systems Information Systems Marketing Prescribed Drug Services Program Integrity Provider Network Quality and Utilization Management The Agency has t aken advantage of the expertise of staff across the Agency to ensure the reviewers tasked with evaluating plan readiness have the knowledge and skills to complete a detailed desk review. The plans responses will not only be reviewed to ensure all contract provisions are included, but to evaluate each plan's progress in implementing key operational activities for the MMA program. The plans will also submit all documents which require Agency approval through the plan readiness review process, such as enrollee letters and marketing materials. The Agency will use the documents provided in each plan's response to the readiness review request to gain a detailed understanding of their internal processes and operational functionality. After the desk review is com plete, Agency staff will conduct an on -site review including interviews with plan staff and leadership that manage key operational areas within the plan. The Agency will also have the opportunity to request demonstrations of processes or systems crucial to a successful implementation. The on -site reviews will begin in December 2013. After the on -site review is conducted , the Agency will compile all findings and outstanding items requiring plan action into an Implementation Action Plan. The Implementation Action Plan will outline deadlines for resolution of all outstanding items. The Agency will make a decision on whethe r each plan will be included in the initial implementation of the program based on the plan's response and actions taken in response to the Implementation Action Plan. The following lists the reasons the Agency would not allow a plan to be included in the initial implementation of the program. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 95 If the Agency finds a plan has: An inability to timely authorize services for enrollees An inadequate provider network An inability to pay claims timely The Agency will make a decision on which plans are ready to participate in the initial implementation of the program 60 days before each region's implementation date. Only the authorized plans will be included as options in communications about the program to potential enrollees. K. Plan Contracting The Agency i s following standard Agency contracting procedures to enter into clear and comprehensive managed care contracts developed in accordance with all state and federal requirements. The overarching goal is to promote the health and well -being of enrollees by assuring enrollee access to services, holding contracted plans accountable for outcomes, promoting quality and cost -effective delivery of services. 1. Contracting Assurances - Provider Network and Access Requirements The Agency is requiring the plans en sure availability of services consistent with section 1932(c)(1)(A)(i) of the SSA and 42 CFR 438.206, that is, plans are required to have provider networks sufficient to meet the needs of the anticipated enrolled population and expected utilization of serv ice. To ensure access to necessary Medicaid services, the Agency established specific standards for the number, type and regional distribution of providers in plan networks. Specifically, the plans must maintain a panel of preventive and specialty care providers sufficient in number, mix and geographic distribution to meet the needs of the enrolled population. The pl ans are also required to maintain a provider network sufficient to serve a percentage of recipients in the region, as established by the Ag ency, such that, if any one plan leaves a region, the remaining plans have immediate capacity in their provider network (primary care and specialist) to serve all recipients in that region . The plans are required to have providers available within travel and distance standards established by the Agency. The plans may limit the providers in their networks, if network adequacy standards are met, but must also include providers classified in Florida law as \"statewide essential provider\". The plans will be req uired to negotiate in good faith with statewide essential providers for one year. The plans that have not contracted with all statewide essential providers in all regions as of the first date of recipient enrollment must continue to negotiate in good fait h. The Agency may authorize plans to include providers located outside of their region if appropriate to meet time and distance or other network adequacy requirements standards. While plans may use mail order as a pharmacy option, the exclusive use of m ail-order pharmacies is not sufficient to meet network access standards. In addition, plans are required to establish and maintain an accurate and complete electronic database of contracted providers, including information about licensure or registration, locations and hours of operation, specialty credentials and other certifi cations, specific performance indicators and such other information as the Agency deems necessary. The provider database Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 96 must be available online to the public and allow comparison of the availability of providers to network adequacy standards, and accept and display feedback from each provider's patients. 2. Plan Accountability and Performance Standards The Agency has enhanced the monitoring activities from the current Medicaid managed care program to provide enhanced plan accountability and clear perf ormance standards. These enhanced requirements include, but are not limited to: posting of formulary or preferred drug list on the plan's Website and to ensure the list is updated within 24 hours of any change; acceptance of electronic prior authorization requests; establishment of an internal health care quality improvement system with enrollee satisfaction and disenrollment surveys as well as incentives and disincentives for network providers; collection and reporting of Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures with results published on each plan Website; accreditation within one year of contract execution; establishment of programs and procedures to improve pregnancy outcomes and infant health; and notification of the Agency of the impending birth of a child to an enrollee. In addition, the Agency selected plans that were committed to assisting the Agency in our efforts to increase electronic medical record adoption. The plans agreed to: Establish thresholds for the number o f physician and hospitals that would adopt meaningful use standards by the end of the second contract year. Establish thresholds for the number of enrollees who are assigned to primary care providers meeting meaningful use requirements. The Agency negotia ted more timely claims more timely claims process timeframes than are required by state and federal regulations. Examples include: Selected plans will pay, deny, or contest electronic claims within 15 calendar days. Selected plans will pay, deny, or cont est paper claims within 20 calendar days. Selected plans agreed to pay 50% of all clean claims within 7 calendar days of receipt. The Agency will conduct periodic contract oversight and monitoring reviews to ensure plan compliance with contract requiremen ts and has developed a thorough and consistent oversight review process so that plans are held to consistent standards. 3. Penalties and Sanctions To ensure stability, the Agency will impose new penalties for plans that reduce enrollment levels or leave a region before the end of the contract term. Specifically, plans will be required to reimburse the Agency for the cost of enrollment changes and ot her transition activities associated with the plan action. If more than one plan leaves a region at the same time, costs must be shared by the departing plans proportionate to their enrollments. In addition to the payment of costs, departing plans must pa y a per enrollee penalty of up to three month's payment and continue to provide services to the enrollee for 90 days or until the enrollee is enrolled in another plan, whichever occurs first. In addition to payment of costs, plans must pay a penalty of 25 % of the minimum surplus requirement pursuant to state law. Plans are required to provide at least 180 days notice to the Agency before withdrawing from a region. If a contracted plan leaves a region before the end of the contract term, the Agency is requi red by law to terminate all contracts with that plan in other regions. Implementation Plan - Managed Medical Assistan ce Program Page 97 If a plan that is awarded an \"additional contract\" to ensure plan participation in Regions 1 and 2 is subject to penalties pursuant to state law for activities in Region 1 or Region 2, the additional contract is automatically terminated 180 days after the imposition of the penalties. The plan is required to reimburse the Agency for the cost of enrollment changes and other transition activities. In addition to the above sanctioning cap ability, the Agency will sanction as a means of a financial disincentive to plans that violate contract requirements. Sanctions cover failure to meet any plan contract requirements and include sanctions for failing to meet performance measure scores (up t o $10,000 for failure to meet certain performance measure group thresholds), encounter data reporting ($5,000 per day for each day of noncompliance at the 31st calendar day), fraud and abuse ($2,000 per day for failure to submit an acceptable anti -fraud plan or failure to submit the annual fraud report, $10,000 for failure to implement an anti -fraud plan or investigative unit, and $1,000 per day failure to timely report suspected or confirmed instances of provider or recipient fraud) and failure of plans, a fter two years of continuous operation under the new program, to pay physicians at payment rates at least equal to Medicare rates (no set sanction amount prescribed). The Agency may initiate contract termination procedures on the 90th day unless the plan comes into compliance on encounter data before that date. The Agency may also impose liquidated damages in the event of a plan's breach of contract requirements. The plan contract allows for over 60 different liquidated damages. Damages include breaches in the following areas: staffing, failure to provide continuity of care and a seamless transition consistent with services in place prior to the new enrollee's enrollment in the plan, failure to timely complete a comprehensive assessment or timely develop a treatment or service plan or to authorize and initiate services, failure to facilitate transfers between health care settings, imposition of arbitrary utilization guidelines, reporting requirements, fraud and abuse compliance, maintenance of required in solvency protection and surplus accounts at appropriate levels, submission of timely and audited financial statements, failure to resolve problems with individual encounter records, failure to obtain Agency approval of enrollee and provider materials, non -submission of performance improvement plans, compliance with community outreach and marketing requirements, notice of action failures and other enrollee notification failures, medical and behavioral health network adequacy failures. The liquidated damages range from $250 per occurrence (failure to certify reports correctly) to $25,000 per occurrence (example - imposition of arbitrary utilization guidelines).
