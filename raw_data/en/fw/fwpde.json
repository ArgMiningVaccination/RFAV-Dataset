So, what does detoxification mean? To put it simply, detoxification is a medicinal term and refers to the natural removal of toxins from the body to improve overall health and wellbeing. On a day-to-day basis, the body's internal organs such as the liver, kidneys, intestines and lymphatic systems work tirelessly to eliminate potentially harmful chemicals from our bodies, without ever getting the chance to rest. Our bodies are exposed to a high volume of harsh chemicals on a daily basis from the food we eat, the air we breathe and the products we use on our bodies and around our homes. Whilst some of these are harmless, others can potentially damage our bodies if they're not dealt with quickly and efficiently. Whilst our organs do a fantastic job of removing toxins from the body, we can give them a little helping hand to help them to perform their best. That's where the modern-day 'detox' comes in. Why do our bodies need to detox? Our bodies are extremely intelligent creations, and you may find yourself suffering from a few conditions if it's calling for a detox. These may include unexplained tiredness, allergies, acidity, bloating, lack of focus, emotional instability, irritated skin or a lack of enthusiasm and zest for life. Should you experience any of these, it's time to listen to your body and allow it to self-heal and cleanse by providing it with the best fuel, opportunities for rest and a little extra TLC. Essentially, how you treat your body will be reflected in your physical and mental health. Just the same as your house needs a thorough spring cleaning once in a while, your body works just the same. One of the most harmful toxins for your body is actually stress, as it significantly alters the way the body functions and thrives. A detox allows you to rid your body of whatever is weighing it down, enabling your body to absorb important minerals and nutrients. This is where a detox bath becomes so useful as it simultaneously allows the body to rid itself from harmful toxins and stress while absorbing the goodness from the essential oils in the water, leaving you feeling replenished and revived. After detoxification, you may notice numerous physical and mental benefits. These may include increased energy levels, relief from muscular pain, reduced headaches, an improved immune system, better sleep, clearer skin, improved concentration, better general health and lower stress levels. The great news is, all of these benefits can be achieved in the comfort of your own home by creating a detox bath, without the hefty price tag that often comes attached to other commercial detox plans. There are no strict rules to follow, and you can quickly and easily decide to detox on the spur of the moment at your own convenience, giving yourself no added stress and more flexibility. How do I create a detox bath? Timing is critical when it comes to your detox bath. Try to plan for when you have plenty of time so that you can fully immerse yourself in relaxation. This will enable you to relax and unwind, without the pressures of everyday life getting in the way. The minimum time we'd recommend is 40 minutes, but you'll find the greatest benefit if you can give yourself an entire evening to unwind and forget about the stresses of everyday life. To create your detox bath, simply fill your bath with warm water and select your essential oils. You'll need to mix your chosen essential oils with a carrier oil before adding them to your bath. This allows them to disperse through the water more effectively and helps to reduce the risk of skin irritation. We'd recommend sweet almond oil or jojoba oil for this. How much essential oil you choose to add to the bath is down to personal choice, and it may take some experimentation to find your perfect strength. Most people find between 5 and 20 drops of essential oil mixed with a tablespoon of carrier oil perfect for a detox bath. You may choose to select a single essential oil with a particular property if you're looking to focus on one specific area. Alternatively, you might choose to blend a few different essential oils together to create your own custom detoxing experience that is tailored to your needs. Add the essential oil mixture to your bath just before you get in, and swirl the mixture through the water. By leaving it until the last minute to add your essential oil, you'll reduce how much has evaporated, helping to maximise the effects of the essential oil. To increase the absorption of the oil into the skin, try rubbing the essential oils combined with a carrier oil onto your skin either before getting in the bath or mid-way through your soak to really experience the benefits. Which essential oils work best in a detox bath? Now that you know how to create a calming detox bath, you might be wondering which essential oils are most effective in detoxing the body. At volant, we have a wide range of essential oils to choose from, each with its own individual properties and benefits. Let's take a look at some of the most popular detoxing essential oils. For the ultimate stress-detox If you're looking to rid your mind and body of stress and pressure - and we know stress is a major source of toxicity - [lavender essential oil](/products/lavender-essential-oil) is ideal. With a gentle scent, this essential oil promotes balance and relaxation of the mind whilst helping to reduce stress. Not only that, but lavender oil has been proven to aid sleep, helping you to have a more restful night. If you're looking for the ultimate relaxation experience, combine lavender oil with [frankincense essential oil](/products/frankincense-essential-oil). Frankincense is a calming scent that helps to ease anxiety and calm your nerves. Along with lavender oil, this is a powerful combination that will leave you feeling calm, relaxed and serene. To boost your immune system If you're feeling under the weather, Eucalyptus oil is a great choice for your detox bath. [Eucalyptus oil](/products/eucalyptus-essential-oil) has been proven to be antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial and analgesic, making it a powerful detoxing tool for purifying your body and getting you back on track when you're feeling run down. The antibacterial properties of Eucalyptus oil make it ideal for when you're suffering from a cold or flu, helping to open your airways, relieve your blocked nose and ease your respiratory symptoms. That's why you'll find Eucalyptus oil in many commercial cold and flu remedies. Not only that, but Eucalyptus oil can also help to soothe irritated skin and treat conditions such as dandruff, fungal infections and lice. Eucalyptus also boosts skin ceramide production, and ceramides are important for retaining moisture and protecting your skin! The refreshing and invigorating scent of Eucalyptus oil helps to stimulate and awaken your senses, leaving you feeling energised and recharged when you need it the most. You'll find your mind transported to a Bali beach which you'll want to enjoy for hours. Be sure to play some calming music, and choose your favourite book to enjoy as you lay back and soak up the benefits of Eucalyptus oil. To ease sore muscles Everyday life can leave you feeling achy and tired, and sometimes we all need a break. Luckily, there are some ideal essential oils for easing sore muscles, leaving you feeling energised, refreshed and ready to take on the world. If you're suffering from achy muscles or back pain, try adding a blend of [rosemary](/products/organic-rosemary-essential-oil), [chamomile ](/products/organic-roman-chamomile-essential-oil)and [lavender ](/products/lavender-essential-oil)essential oils to your bath. These essential oils have been proven to act as analgesics whilst reducing muscle spasms and inflammation. Not only that, but they will also help to draw the toxins from your body, giving your liver and kidneys a boost. You can increase the impact by also adding Epsom salt to your bath. The high magnesium and sulphate content of this salt can help relieve your sore muscles whilst also reducing any inflammation. To treat your skin If you find your skin feeling dry or breaking out and your nails lacking shine, try adding a few drops of tea tree oil to your detox bath. This essential oil has many healing and energising properties, as well as being great for your skin and nails. [Tea tree essential oil ](/products/tea-tree-essential-oil)has amazing antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties, making it somewhat of a star when it comes to detoxification. It helps to remove the toxins from your skin whilst aiding in the generation of new skin cells. This will leave your skin soft, clearer and glowing whilst helping to boost your energy levels. Intensify your detox experience If you're looking to step up your detox bath, there are a few other things you can add to the water to intensify your detoxing experience. Epsom salt is a popular choice when it comes to detoxing. This popular mineral is used to draw toxins from the body whilst providing a whole host of additional benefits. These benefits include moisturising dry skin, easing sore muscles and aiding relaxation. If you'd like to try an Epsom salt detox bath, try adding one to two cups of Epsom salts to your bath whilst you're running the water, ensuring that they dissolve fully before adding your essential oils. If you're a fan of bubble baths, you don't have to miss out on your bubbles just because you're using essential oils. Add your bubble bath to the running water as normal and then swirl in your essential oil and carrier oil mixture when your bath is ready. You just might find that the familiar aroma of your bubble bath enhances your relaxation, especially when combined with your detoxing essential oil blend. After your bath Once you've enjoyed your soak, be sure to get out of the bath slowly and carefully, ensuring you hold on to prevent slipping (since adding oil to your bath could make it a bit slippery!). Then drain the water completely and rinse the tub with some hot water to wash away any excess oil residue. Once you're dry and comfortable, use a natural cleaning spray to give the bath a quick wipe down to prevent any risk of the base being left slippery. To further promote the release of toxins from your body, you can stimulate your lymphatic system by rubbing your skin with an exfoliating glove. Use long and sweeping strokes, brushing inwards toward the heart for maximum benefits. This will help to enhance the effects of your detox bath. After this, it's the ideal opportunity to mix some essential oils to a carrier oil for a whole body massage to soothe the skin and give yourself a beautifully subtle scent. It's up to you to decide whether to use the same oils you added to your bath or whether to try something new. Ensure that you drink plenty of water after your detox bath. This will help to rehydrate your body and flush any remaining toxins from your body. Try adding a piece of lemon to your water to give your drink a refreshing twist and to boost your vitamin C levels (which also helps detox, by the way). Don't have a bath tub? Take a detox shower! [Karolina Grabowska](https://www.pexels.com/@karolina-grabowska?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels)from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-people-woman-relaxation-5240786/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pexels) If you don't have a bath tub, there's no need to miss out. You can easily take a detox shower at home in just a few steps. Before climbing into the shower, massage your skin with a blend of your favourite detoxing essential oils combined with a tablespoon of carrier oil. The essential oils will begin to be absorbed by your skin before you even enter the shower, intensifying the experience and increasing the benefits. Then, add 10 drops of your favourite detoxing essential oil to the base of your shower before switching it on. The warm water will turn your essential oils into steam, allowing you to inhale the intense purifying aroma as you shower. [Peppermint essential oil](/products/peppermint-essential-oil) is one of our favourite detoxifying essential oils for use in the shower. The sharp scent of peppermint will unblock your airways, enabling you to breathe with ease and comfort whilst ridding your mind and body of any stress. You'll leave the shower feeling empowered and fresh with a lifted mood. [Rosemary essential oil](/products/organic-rosemary-essential-oil) is another great choice for use in the shower. Rosemary is an antioxidant which also acts as an antiseptic, helping to rid the body of toxins and bacteria. It's also said that rosemary can aid digestion, improve your memory and promote healthy circulation, leaving you feeling healthier all around. To sum up Detoxing the body is an important step when it comes to keeping fit and healthy. However, commercial detox plans can be expensive, and not everyone has the time to dedicate to going to a spa. Taking a detox bath at home is a great way to rid your body of harmful toxins - stress being the worst one - whilst refreshing both your body and your mind. There are many different essential oils to choose from for your detox bath, and everyone will have their favourites. Treat yourself to a range of volant's organic essential oils to enable you to experiment and experience some of the many benefits that they can bring to your self-care routine. By adding a few drops of essential oils to a detox bath, you can treat your body to detoxification, whilst you simply sit back and relax. Feel the toxins flee from your body and float away in the exquisitely scented water whilst you destress and unwind. "}
