Therefore, this summary has been developed from the presentation slides and video recordings. Pertussis vaccines Work Group terms of ref erence: Consider the evidence for a potential policy change to allow either Td or Tdap vaccine to be used in situations where only Td vaccine is currently recommended for: 1) Decennial Td booster in adults 2) Tetanus prophylaxis as needed for wound managem ent 3) Catch -up immuni sation schedule Safety of closely spaced Tdap vaccines in the catch -up immunization schedule Review published literature on studies that have assessed the safety of closely spaced Tdap compared with closely spaced Td doses Study of Tdap v ersus Td: o Study design: double -blind, randomi sed, controlled clinical trial o Study population: 460 adults 40 years from 3 European countries with no Td vaccine for 20 years or unknown vaccination history o Study arms: received the following in a 0-1-6 month schedule: 3 doses of Tdap, 1 dose of Tdap - IPV followed by 2 doses of Td, or 3 doses of Td vaccine (control) o Outcomes: immunogenicity and reactogenicity o Results: No statistically significant differences in local or general symptoms between gro ups were observed Study of maternal Tdap reactogenicity: o Study design: cohort study o Study population: 374 pregnant women; 225 non -pregnant women o Study sub -population of interest: 8 pregnant women who had more than one Tdap within the past 12 months o Compari son groups: none o Outcomes: injection site and systemic reactions o Results: no severe local or systemic reactions o Conclusion: no adverse event of concern but small number of subjects Closely spaced Tdap reports in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAER S) - Methods (unpublished data) o Search VAERS database for U.S. reports of all persons who received more than one dose of Tdap o Jan 1, 1990 - June 30th, 2019 o Review of VAERS reports and any medical records to assess for the length of interval between doses a nd the adverse event (AE), if any o Reports where interval of two Tdap doses 12 months included in final analysis o Among 34,804 reports of Tdap submitted to VAERS during the search period, 342 involved multiple doses of Tdap o In 88 reports interval of two Tda p doses 12 months o 67 (76.1%) did not describe an AE (vaccination errors) o 21 (23.9%) described an AE o The most common AEs were injection site reactions in 8 reports Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) unpublished analysis o Retrospective Cohort Study assessing repeated doses of Tdap v ersus Td - unpublished analysis o Data source: unpublished data from VSD retrospective cohort study evaluating repeated Tdap doses o Study sub -population of interest (unpublished data): 13,599 non -pregnant adolescents and adults 11 -64 years who received Tdap or Td within 12 months of prior Tdap o Comparison groups: 11,687 Tdap v ersus 1,912 Td vaccines given within 12 months of prior Tdap Page | 3 o Outcomes: pre -specified local reactions and neurologic adverse events o Results: Repeated Tdap was not associated with an increase in any adverse event compared to Td within 12 months of prior Tdap Maternal Tdap safety in the VSD - unpublished analysis o Data source: unpublished data from VSD retrospective cohort study evaluating maternal Tdap safety o Study sub -population of interest (unpublished data): 187 women with multiple Tdap vaccines during the same pregnancy (excluded from larger published study) o Comparison group: None o Outcomes: acute adverse events (fever, allergy, and local reactions) and adverse birth outcomes (small for gestational age, preterm delivery, and low birth weight) o Only 1/187 with acute event following multiple Tdap vaccines in same pregnancy o ICD-9 code of limb pain and limb swelling 7 days after vaccination o Occurred on the day of deli very o Affected limb(s) unspecified o Baby born at 39 weeks o Birth outcome rates were similar to pregnant women exposed to a single Tdap dose during the same pregnancy Summary - unpublished data o VAERS: Most reports (76%) of excess doses of Tdap in VAERS did not describe an AE. Among reports with AEs (n=21), local reactions were most commonly reported (n=8) o VSD: Among subjects who received a Tdap dose 12 months compared to Td, no increased rates of AEs were observed. Among 187 women in the VSD who received multi ple Tdap doses in the same pregnancy, one presented with limb pain and limb swelling 7 days after vaccination (unclear if related) Conclusions o Published data on closely spaced Tdap doses shows no increase in AEs when Tdap or Td was administered as a second or third dose o Regimens similar to the current and proposed catch -up schedule did not show differences in reactogenicity o Unpublished data of closely spaced Tdap doses shows no unusual or increased reporting of any AE o While data on multiple Tdap doses is li mited, our review of published and unpublished safety data is reassuring Tdap and Td: Summary of Work Group considerations and proposed policy options Work Group assessment: Safety of >1 dose of Tdap for catch -up immunization schedule Published studies rea ssuring o Data limited o Includes an RCT comparing safety and immunogenicity of Tdap v. Td for catch -up immunization schedule Available published and unpublished data on closely -spaced Tdap vaccines o No concerning safety signal, including in pregnant women o Data sparse on safety of multiple doses of Tdap during a single pregnancy Need for continued safety monitoring Work Group consensus: Either Td or Tdap can be used for additional doses of the catch -up immunization schedule for persons 7 years, both in the gene ral population and for pregnant women Clarification of CDC guidance: Tdap in persons aged 7 -10 years Current guidance: Children 7 -10 years who receive Tdap inadvertently or for catch -up immunization should receive Tdap again at age 11 -12 years Questions from health departments, immunization programs, and providers about 10 year -olds who receive Tdap for school entry requirements Both Tdap vaccines are now licensed to 10 years of age Clarification of guidance in children 7 -10 years who receive a dose of Td ap: o Children 7 -9 years: receive adolescent Tdap at 11 -12 years o Children aged 10 years: Tdap does not need to be repeated Similar changes made to inadvertent DTaP administration guidance Plan to include changes as \"CDC Guidance\" in Policy Note o Should eithe r Td or Tdap be allowed for use in settings where only Td is currently recommended for the decennial booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and the catch up immunization schedule? Page | 4 Work Group interpretation: Benefits and Harms o Increased flexibi lity for providers o May be some additional benefit for pertussis control o Not enough evidence to recommend Tdap preferentially replace Td o No substantive safety concerns o Benefits outweighs potential harms Values, Acceptability and Feasibility o Providers value flexibility o Evidence of widespread use of Tdap instead of Td o Valued by stakeholders; change is acceptable and feasible Resource Use o Tdap more expensive than Td o Economic analyses limited by uncertainty in key parameters o Economic impact not a major considera tion Summary: Proposed policy change Recommendations should be changed to allow either Td or Tdap vaccine to be used in situations where only Td vaccine is currently recommended for: o Decennial booster o Tetanus prophylaxis for wound management o Catch -up immun ization schedule, including in pregnant women Adult Immunization Schedule 2020 Adult Immunization Schedule revisions Hepatitis A vaccination o Living with HIV as an indication HPV vaccination o 2 or 3 doses for men through age 26 depending on age at initial vaccination o Shared clinical decision -making for persons 27 -45 years MMR vaccination in HCW Pneumococcal vaccination o Shared clinical decision -making for immunocompetent persons 65 years Meningococcal B vaccination o Shared clinical decision -making for persons 19 -23 years Tdap vaccination o Tdap may be used any time Td is indicated Varicella vaccination o Indications for adults with HIV infection Influenza vaccines Influenza surveillance update Recommendation for 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine It is recommended that the following viruses be used for trivalent influenza vaccines in the 2020 Southern Hemisphere influenza season: A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09 For quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 B components: o Above 3, plus B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like virus (B/Yamagata lineage) Summary Influenza activity remains low in the US overall Numbers are small, but so far, influenza A(H3N2) viruses are predominant in the US overall but this varies by region o Too early to tell what viruses will be predominant for the season While 2 of the 4 vaccine components were updated for the Southern Hemisphere, the components selected for the 2019 -20 Nor thern Hemisphere vaccine, at this time, look appropriate for our season High -dose inactivated influenza vaccine update Sanofi presented Phase III (Study QHD00013) High -Dose Influenza Quadrivalent (QIV -HD) Vaccine Study results in subjects aged 65 years an d older Page | 5 Summary of safety results o While higher percentages for some solicited reactions were observed for QIV -HD, the overall reactogenicity profile was comparable to TIV -HD o QIV-HD and TIV -HD study groups showed similar rates of unsolicited events, AEs leading to study discontinuation, serious adverse events ( SAEs ), fatal SAEs, and AEs of special interest. o One related SAE: a subject reporting small fiber neuropathy diagnosed 4 2 days after QIV -HD vaccination with other concomitant etiologies (vitamin B12 deficiency and recent viral illness) o Our (the Sponsor) assessment was unrelated to study vaccine given the other more likely etiologies and symptom improvement with vitamin B12 supplementation Overall key study results Safety results o No safety issues were observed with QIV -HD in adults 65 years of age and older o Safety profiles between QIV -HD and TIV -HD were similar Immunogenicity results o was non-inferior to TIV -HD by GMTs and seroconversion rates for all 4 strains. o Secondary objective met: QIV -HD induced an immune response superior to that induced by the TIV-HD that did not contain the corresponding B strain. The study results demonstrated t hat addition of a second influenza B strain in QIV -HD did not impact the safety or immunogenicity of the other 3 strains in subjects 65 years of age and older Work Group considerations Challenges in assessing relative benefits of specific vaccines fo r older adults Large variety of available influenza vaccines o 8 are appropriate for this age group by licensed indications Growing canon of studies comparing individual vaccine types, but data limited for some relevant comparisons Vaccine effectiveness (a nd relative effectiveness of different vaccines) varies from season to season o Cannot be certain that results from one or a few high -quality studies will generali se across all or most influenza seasons Planned systematic review/ meta-analysis - question Do the relative benefits and harms of HD -IIV, aIIV and RIV as compared with one another and with other influenza vaccines favour the use of these vaccines over others for persons aged 65 years and older?

These recommendations have been adopted by the CDC Director and will become official once published in MMWR. Information available on https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html Either Td or Tdap vaccine can be used in the following situations when previously only Td was recommended (new language italicized): o Decennial booster dose: \"To e nsure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of either Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life.\" o Tetanus prophylaxis for wound management: \"For non pregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccina tion with Tdap, either Td or Tdap should be used if a tetanus toxoid -containing vaccine is indicated.\" o Catch -up immunization: \"Persons aged (7 -18 years and 19 years) who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria should receive a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid - containing vaccines, which includes at least 1 dose of Tdap. The preferred schedule is a dose of Tdap, followed by a dose of either Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks afterward and another dose of either Td or Tdap 6 to 12 months later. Persons aged (7 -18 years and 19 years) who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap (preferably the first) in the catch -up series; if additional tetanus toxoid -containing doses are require d, either Td or Tdap vaccine can be used.\" o Prevention of neonatal and obstetric tetanus: \"If more than one dose of a tetanus -toxoid containing vaccine is needed, either Td or Tdap vaccine can be used for those doses.\" The Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, United States, 2020, for ages 18 years or younger.

After the first year, funding will only be available to people entering their first year of living in such institutions Zostavax catch -up programme extended https://www.immune.org.nz/hot -topic/zostavax -catch -programme -extended PHARMAC has extended the Zostavax catch -up programme for adults aged 66 -80 years inclusively on 1 April 2018. Adults who meet this eligibility criteria now have until 31 December 2020 (the catch -up programme was previously due to end on 31 March 2020) or they turn 81 years of age, whichever occurs first, to receive one funded dose of Zostavax . Measles in New Zealand https://www.immune.org.nz/hot -topic/measles -overseas -and-new-zealand In response to the current measles outbreak s, American Samoa, Republic of Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Solomon Islands are requiring travellers to show evidence of measles vaccination at least 2 weeks before entry to these countries. Other Pacific countries such as Samoa and Fiji have not formally implemented travel measures ; however , it is recommended travellers to these count ries are vaccinated against measles . Unvaccinated New Zealanders over th e age of 50 can be given MMR if vaccination is required for proof of entry or is necessary for protection in countries currently experiencing measles outbreak s. Due to the ongoing measles outbreaks across the Pacific, the Director General of Health has authorised health providers to access MMR vaccine for unimmunised Paci fic temporary migrant workers, including those on the RSE scheme. Pacific temporary migrant workers, under normal circumstances, are not eligible for access to publicly funded health care in New Zealand, including access to the MMR vaccine. However, the Mi nistry of Health has worked with PHARMAC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Immigration New Zealand to enable access to one dose of MMR vaccine for workers who are non -residents. Extended eligibility for funded Boostrix (Tdap) vaccination https://www.immune.org.nz/resources/immunz PHARMAC has extended eligibility for funded Tdap vaccination to include parents or primary caregivers of infants: who are admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or Specialist Care Baby Unit (SCBU) for more than 3 days, and whose mother did not receive a maternal Tdap vaccination at least 14 days before the baby's birth 3 Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), UK Department of Health Page | 13 3.1 JCVI Me eting : 2 October 2019 Agenda and draft minutes - https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint -committee -on-vaccination -and-immunisation#minutes This summary was based on the draft minutes only . HPV programme update o Public Health England (PHE) informed the Committee that work had been undertaken to implemen t a gender -neutral HPV programme from the 2019 -20 academic year BCG and SCID screening o The Committee agreed that it would be necessary to remove the neonatal BCG programme from birth to after Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) screenin g results were available o Deferring vaccination could however raise challenges in delivery and reduce uptake of the vaccine PCV vaccination in older adults o Pfizer asked the Committee's advice on pneumococcal conjuga te vaccination in older adults o There has been an increase in pneumonia admission and increase in PCV13 serotype disease and non-PCV13 vaccine type disease in Nottingham o Previously it was agreed that vaccination with PCV13 in older age groups was not cost -effective o Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine s (PPV23) wer e being used due to a shortage of vials, although pre -filled syringes were more expensive. This raised a question around whether PPV23 remained cost -effective, especially with changes to the circulating serotypes and development of higher -valency pneumococ cal conjugate vaccines. PPV23 was likely to remain cos t-effective at the higher price o The cost -effectiveness of the PPV23 vaccination programme could be reviewed along with other issues, including the potential use of higher valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and the cost - effectiveness of PPV23 vaccination strategies Department of Health and Social Care Vaccine Strategy o The UK has lost its 'measles -free status' with the WHO and this has led to the vaccine strategy being brought forward. There is a shorter -term focus on improving coverage of vaccine s, including MMR Ebola post -exposure prophylaxis o PHE has been asked to advise use of vaccine in pregnant or immunosuppressed individuals, should they req uire post -exposure prophylaxis o There are two vaccines available for use of Ebola post -exposure prophylaxis in Western Europe : vesicular stomatitis vaccine (VSV) (Merck) and a prime -boost with two separate composition (J&J) - neither of which was replication -competent o Immunogenicity and safety data from use in pregnant or immunosuppressed individuals were limited for both vaccines o It was noted the Merck vaccine was now being used in DRC i n pregnant and lactating women o Overall, use of vaccine in pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals would require consideration of the potential risk of Ebola disease compared with the potential for adverse effec ts from the vaccines Pandemic influenza preparedness o Since June, the Influenza Sub -committee has been considering potential pandemic -specific influenza vaccines and modelling on the potential impact of vaccination strategies i n a range of pandemic scenarios o There are promising new technologies, but these would not be available for the next few years o Timelines for the availability of these vaccines was approximately 5 to 6 months from the declaration of a pandemic and dependent on a number of factors o Currently there are only three pandemic specific vaccines ( PSV) available, two inactivated adjuvanted and one live attenuated, for use in a pandemic, and all relied on the use of eggs in their manufacture, no new technologies were available for the next three to five years o The Committee agreed that it would be important to have early access to more than one vaccine for a) security of supply and b) because there may be differences in the population you target where different vaccines may be appropriate. o The Committee agreed that there should be an appropriate vaccin e available for use in children o The Committee agreed th at the PSV landscape should be reviewed again in three years because new pandemic vaccine technologies might then be available with shorter manufacturing timelines. Annual National Immunisation Schedule Evalu ation Consortium (NISEC) update o IMAP3 : is a follow -on from IM AP2 which evaluated the use of 2 different pertussis -containing vaccines in pregnancy and the impact on the response to infant immunisation in the offspring . Page | 14 IMAP3 was following infants through to 3.5 years of age, to determine if there wa s any impact of maternal vaccination on pre -school boosters; 75% of the original participants had been retained and the results were expected at the end of October 2019; they would also be looking at the persistence of DTaP vaccines and the impact on pre -school boosters o OPTIMUM: this study included 354 women randomised to receive the DTaP -IPV vaccine at three different time points during gestation. The primary outcome measure was antibody concentrations against pertussis toxin (PT) in the cord -blood of term infants at delivery o What's the story ? : a sero -epidemiology study that aims to evaluate the feasibility and added public health benefit of a UK population based sero -epidemiological programme in 0 - to 24 -year olds. The consortium aimed to undertake analyses of blood from schedule 3 study participants 5 to 13 months of age, to examine the immunogenicity of the 2 + 1 schedule of 4CMenB against hyperinvasive MenW and clinically relevant MenC strains; and blood was also drawn at 2 years of age to examine the persistence of immunogenicity following the 2+1 4CMenB schedule for: 3 MenB strains, MenW and clinically relevant MenC strains. o Shingrix studies are on hold until vaccine was available from the manufacturer . o A study is considering alternative DTaP -IPV-Hib-HepB v accine, Vaxelis, where there is no co - administration data with M enB vaccine Seasonal i nfluenza vaccines for 2020 -2021 o Sanofi Pasteur and Seqirus had presented to the Sub -committee the latest evidence for their respective vaccines, high-dose (Seqirus) ; all evidence came from the 2017 -18 season and mostly concerned its effectiveness compared with quadrivalent influenza egg -culture vaccine ( QIVe ). Study results were mixed but with s ome evidence indicating QIVc performed better than QIVe in the 2017 -2018 season. The Sub -committee had also looked at data presented by Sanofi Pasteur and Seqirus on the vaccines recommended for the elderly, aTIV and TIV HD . The Sub -Committee concluded t hat it could not say whether one vaccine was better than the other based on the available evidence. o The Committee adjusted its advice for vaccines for the elderly saying that TIV HD and aTIV were preferable, but that QIVc could also be considered. This wa s because there was more evidence and stronger evidence in support of TIV HD and aTIV (compared with standard inactivated influenza vaccines) than there was for QIVc. o The Committee's advice for QIVc in the under 65 at -risk groups had also been adjusted to highlight a slight preference for QIVc because of the issue of egg adaptation (in an egg -adapted AH3N2 season) ; however, QIVe was still considered a suitable vaccine for this group, and likely to be similar in H1N1/B seasons or in years in which egg -adaptation was not a major H3N2 issue. o The manufacturer highlighted in its letter that the quality of the evidence in support for TIV HD was better than that for aTIV, because of the number of randomised control tria ls conducted. The Committee felt that supporting data from further seasons were needed to distinguish between TIV HD and aTIV o The Committee agreed that it would like to see more data from the UK on the performance of the vaccines being used, as currently m ost of the evidence came from studies in the US and Europe. o Overall the Committee agreed that the available evidence supported the position that TIV HD and aTIV were preferable to standard egg -based influenza vaccines for those aged 65 years and over, but the evidence was insufficient to distinguish between the two vaccines on the grounds of their relative vaccine effectiveness Tick-borne encephalitis o PHE recently found tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in a small number of ticks in England , and that a possible case of TBE had been identified . All cases identified in the UK had previously been travel -related . o PHE concluded that there were two different strains in the UK from two separate introductions, potentially f rom birds and imported animals. However, Lyme disease continued to be the most common tick -borne infection in the UK o PHE has undertaken several actions following this case , including: sharing key information locally (Thetford Forest and New Forest) and nat ionally; the Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory (RIPL) were testing cases of unidentified acute encephalitis in these areas for evidence of TBEV exposure, with three samples tested and confirmed negative; and samples sent to RIPL for neuroborreliosis, with a general acute encephalitic presentation, which were negative for Lyme disease were being automatically screened for TBEV, with n o evidence of exposure to date o It was suggested that PHE expanded the testing of cases to include other meningo -encephali tis presentations rat her than just neuroborreliosis Page | 15 o The Committee noted that WHO recommended that where vaccination was undertaken, older adults should be vaccinated as a priority, as disease was more severe in this age group o The Committee agreed that this issue should be further reviewed, once more data were available, especially around whether certain occupational groups were at increased risk, and requested that at that time information be provided on the vaccines, their formulation and efficacy Update f rom the Travel Sub -committee o Influenza vaccination for travellers: travellers eligible for the vaccine the UK should be encouraged to receive it in the UK each year, especially for those attending 'mass gatherings' such as the Hajj or those travelling on c ruise ships; and those intending longer stays in the south ern hemisphere could consider vaccination after arrival, where available o HPV for male travellers: The increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) to travellers was well known and these STD risks should be expanded to include HPV. The HPV vaccine is available privately and barrier forms of contraception should also be advised. o Japanese encephalitis vaccination: The vaccine is offered as two doses 28 days apart with a booster at 1-2 years. Where there is continued risk of exposure an additional booster dose is recommended at 10 years in those aged 18 -64 years. There was no recommendation for a second booster in place for those under 18 or over 64 years of age. The evidence in young children in dicated the protection would not extend beyond 10 years, and an additional booster could be considered, where appropriate; and NaTHNaC and HPS had agreed to prepare an update to current guidance o Yellow fever and measles vaccine guidance: The Green Book gui dance indicates that measles protection may be sup -optimal where the MMR vaccine is given with yellow fever vaccine. The sub - committee considered that where yellow fever and MMR are given together or within one month of each other, an additional dose of ye llow fever vaccine should be given at 10 years Annual meningococcal update (based on a presentation from the PHE on meningococcal epidemiology in England and vaccine effectiveness estimates ) o Men B vaccination implemented in 2016, in a 2+1 schedule with a small catch -up in 3 - and 4 -month old infants; 95-96% received one dose, and more than 90% received the second dose. At two years of age around 88% had received the advised three dose schedule. PHE reported a large reduction in disease within the first 10 months of the programme o Using the screening method, vaccine effectiveness for one dose was 24.1%, for two doses was 52.7% and after three doses was 58.9%, the estimate of effectiveness against vaccine preventable MenB IMD was 70.5% o After three million doses of 4CMenC, there were no new safety concerns o It has been estimated that 277 cases of MenB IMD has been prevented in the first three years of the programme o The UK experienced a national MenW outbreak beginning in 2009. MenACWY vaccination started Augu st 2015, with the aim of vaccinating all 13 -18-year olds over a 3-year period o There was an impact in school leavers (17 -18-year olds) within 12 months of the start of the programm e, despite 36% vaccine coverage , 2017 -2018 was the first year with an overall decline in MenW cases across the population o PHE noted that there is a clear impact from the 4CMenB programme o PHE noted that an infant programme should have no impact on strains circulating in adolescents (the main carriers of meningococcal bacteri a) and as such there should be no charge in the circulating strains attributable to the programme o It was noted that an ongoing meningococcal carriage study indicated around a two -third reduction in MenW carriage in Y ear 12 (England) students, since the las t (pre-MenACWY vaccination) study o It was noted that the Austrian NITAG had recommended booster doses of 4CMenB for at -risk groups, and PHE agreed that they would prepare a paper for JCVI to consider on this Coverage o The Committee agreed that action was req uired to reverse the trends in coverage. There was no evidence that the declining trends were associated with parental confidence and the declines were likely to be associated wi th delivery of the programme. o Action: Representative from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to present on their strategies to improve uptake 3.2 Newly published or updated statement/recommendations 3.2.1 JCVI advice on influenza vaccines for 2020 -21 For vaccination of those aged 65 years and over : Page | 16 o JCVI advises the use of the following vaccines : aTIV or TIV HD o QIVc is suita ble for use in this age group if aTIV or TIV HD are not available o When considering a preference between TIV HD and aTIV, the available data are few, somewhat inconsistent, are not available over multiple seasons, are at risk of bias, and are limited by the use of non-laboratory -confirmed influenza endpoints. The level of uncertainty in the available evidence is considered too great to allow for a preferential recommendation between TIV HD and aTIV For vaccination of those in at -risk adults and children for whom there are contraindications for use of live attenuated egg -cultured intranasal influenza vaccine: o Aged 9 to less than 65 years of age in at-risk group , JCVI advises the use of the following vaccines : QIVc or QIVe o Aged less than 9 ye ars of age in an at -risk group , JCVI advises the use of QIVe o Evidence from recent influenza seasons indicate a clear additional benefit in the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in those less th an 65 years of age in an at -risk group, compared with trivalent influenza vaccines o There is a potential advantage to using cell -culture influenza vaccines compared with egg -based culture influenza vaccines, due to the possible impact of \"egg -adaption\" on t he effectiveness of influenza vaccines, particularly against A(H3N2) strains o QIVe can also be considered for use in this group. Both QIVc and QIVe are preferable to standard egg-culture inactivated trivalent vaccines 3.2.2 Updated guidance for Measles - Green Bo ok chapter 21 Updated 31 October 2019 - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles -the-green -book - chapter -21 Added revised chapter, including the epidemiology data, viral rash in pregnancy and measles prophylaxis content 3.2.3 Updated guidance for Tetanus - Green Book chapter 30 Updated 13 November 2019 - https:// www.gov.uk/government/publications/tetanus -the-green -book - chapter -30 Added the revised chapter to include updates on the epidemiology and management of wounds and immunoglobulins. 3.2.4 Updated guidance for Yellow Fever - Green Book chapter 35 Updated 21 Novembe r 2019 - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/yellow -fever -the-green - book -chapter -35 Added yellow fever vaccine guidance for those with weakened immune systems, those over 60 years and anyone who has had their thymus removed. 4 National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), Canada 4.1 NACI Meetings The mo st recent meeting s were conducted 5 -6 June 2019 and 25-26 September 2019 in Ottawa, Ontario; however, the summary of discussions has not yet been or updated statement/recommendations Nil 5 Immunisation updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) Page | 17 5.1 Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, WHO 8-10 October , 2019 Geneva, Switzerland. Full meeting at: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329962/WER9447 -eng-fre.pdf Measles and rubella elimination: o SAGE confirmed that no changes were required to the current WHO recommendation related to vaccine perform ance regarding rubella vaccine o SAGE recommended a gender -neutral high coverage paediatric vaccination and catch -up strategy to avoid gaps in population immunit y o SAGE considered the modelling and economic analyses presented and current progress towards measles and rubella elimination goals and concluded: 1) Eradication of measles and rubella will be achieved only with sustained, high, equitable coverage with 2 dose s of measles - and rubella - containing vaccine. Countries and regions should focus on making substantial progress toward their elimination goals, 2) Stronger support and more coordinated strategies globally, within regions and across transmission blocks must be developed to complement the work of individual countries, 3) Substantial strengthening of primary health care systems is required to effectively deliver routine vaccination, 4) A monitoring and accountability framework should include new benchmarks to measure progress towards measles and rubella elimination, 5) The development of innovative tools (e.g. microarray patches) should be prioritised to support and improve equity and high coverage. Human papillomavirus vaccine: o SAGE reaffirmed WHO current rec ommendations for the use of HPV vaccines o SAGE reiterated that all three licensed HPV vaccine have excellent safety profiles and offer comparable immunogenicity, efficacy and effectiveness for the prevention of cervical cancer, which is caused mainly by HPV types 16 and 18 o There is a current shortage of HPV vaccines that could result in failure to introduce or sustain HPV vaccination programmes in some countries , particularly in those with a high burden of cervical cancer . In the context of a limited supply of HPV vaccine, SAGE recommends the following additional strategies: 1) All countries should temporarily pause implementation of gender -neutral , older age group (>15 years) and multi -age cohort HPV vaccination strategies until vaccine supply allows equi table access to HPV vaccine by all countries . This will significantly relieve supply constraints in the short term and enable allocation of doses to high -burden countries that are currently planning to introduce or sustain HPV vaccination. 2) In the contex t of constrained supply and in consultation with their NITAG, countries should consider alternative strategies to ensure girls receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine before they become sexually active . Based on an analysis of efficiency, cost -effectiveness and dis ease impact, the following alternative strategies are recommended but will require consideration of country context and programmatic feasibility: Count ries could target girls who are 13 or 14 years old in the equivalent school grade for 2 -dose vaccination . The success of this approach depends on achieving high 2 -dose coverage in this age group, and initiation of sexual activity after 14 -15 years. The programme challenges of reaching older girls (e.g. in the setting of school vaccination, school enrolment r ates and ability to reach out-of-school girls) and accurate record -keeping through vaccination registers and vaccination cards should be carefully considered. If targeting of this older cohort results in unacceptably low coverage or high drop -out rates for the second dose, it may be necessary to target girls aged 9 or 10 years or in the equivalent lower school grade instead Countries could adopt an extended interval of 3 -5 years between the 2 doses, with the first dose being given to younger girls, such as those aged 9 or 10 years or in the equivalent lower school grade, and the second dose to 13 -14 year old girls or in the equivalent higher school grade. This strategy constitutes off -label use of the vaccine. Adoption of this approach will require careful consideration of programmatic challenges to achieving high 2 -dose coverage, strong communications, accurate record -keeping in vaccination registers and vaccination cards and the assumption of a low risk of exposure to HPV infection between doses 1 and 2. Co untries should consider the median age of sexual debut and the availability of tool so track administration of dose 2 (e.g. vaccine registry for reminders) before using such a strategy Any country with a stock -out of HPV vaccine should maintain good record s of coverage and ensure that girls who were missed are vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes available o SAGE welcomed the ongoing and planned trials of single -dose schedule, as they will inform future policy recommendations o SAGE welcomed studies of the outcomes of different vaccination schedules, including for special populations such as those with a high prevalence of HIV infection or at risk for HIV acquisition Page | 18 Review of the Global Vaccine Action Plan , lessons learned and recommendations : o Most objectives were not met, but tangible progress was made in many areas o SAGE agreed that GVAP's scope and underlying principles remain relevant, even in changing contexts o More emphasis should be placed in the next decade o n emerging issues such as migration, accelerating urbanis ation, outbreaks and other destabili sing factors, increasingly large underserved populations and ensuring the availability and affordability of vaccines o SAFE endorsed recommendations for the post -2020 global immunisation strategy, to focus on a country -centred, bottom -up approach, ensuring flexibility, a more appropriate governance model, with greater emphasis on advocacy and communication; effective use of data in planning and assessing actions and their impact; long -term planning, i n particular in research, development and delivery of vaccines and innovations; and the importance of monitoring, evaluation and accountability at country and subnational levels Immunisation agenda 2030 (IA2030) o The seven strategic priorities of the IA2030 framework are: 1) immunisation for primary health care and universal health coverage, 2) commitment and demand, 3) coverage and equity, 4) life -course and integration, 5) outbreaks and emergencies, 6) supply and sustainability and 7) research and innovati on o These priorities will be achieved on the basis of 4 core principles: people -focused, country -owned, partnership -based and data -enabled Ebola virus vaccines : o SAGE has made several recommendations on Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) vaccination strategies, such as vaccination of infants and children aged 6 months and of pregnant and lactating women and on the adjusted -dose recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus -Zaire Ebola virus vaccine (rVSV - ZEBOV GP vaccine) o SAGE will develop a priori defined criteria for imp lementation of the dose reduction if future vaccine supply is significantly constrained and the outbreak is not contained o Licensure of the rVSV -ZEBOV GP vaccine was pending at the time of the SAGE meeting o SAGE informed planned use in the DRC of a second in vestigational EVD vaccine Quality and use of data on immunisation and surveillance: o The Working Group recommended strengthening of governance, tools and workforce capacity for data management and use, and assessment using continuous quality improvement methods o SAGE noted that improvements rather than absolute targets for data quality are important and that the data use defines the quality required o SAGE endorsed the following recommendations: 1) Embed monitoring of data quality into global, regional and n ational monitoring of the surveillance of immunisation and VPDs, 2) Increase the capacity and capability of the workforce for ensuring data quality and use, starting at the level at which data are collected, 3) Improve the accuracy of denominators, 4) Enha nce use of all available data for tailored action, including program planning, management and decision -making, 5) Adopt a data-driven continuous quality improvement approach as part of health system strengthening at all levels, 6) Strengthen governance of the pilot -testing and use of new tools for collection and use of immunisation and surveillance data, 7) Improve data -sharing and knowledge management among areas and organisations for greater transparency and efficiency and 8) WHO and UNICEF should strengt hen global reporting and data monitoring through a periodic needs a ssessment and revision process Polio eradication: o SAGE was informed about the progress in the clinical development of novel oral type -2 polio virus (nOPV2 ) o SAGE recommended the following u rgent actions : Conduct high -level advocacy, followed by immediate action, to ensure government and community commitment in Afghanistan and Pakistan to stop the cur rent increase in WPV Revise the standard operating procedures on the scope, quality and timel iness of the monovalent oral type -2 polio virus (mOPV2 ) response to cVDPV2 outbreaks Secure and uninterrupted supply of mOPV2 by identifying \"fill and finished\" capacity and by new bulk production If the mOPV2 supply becomes critically low and is not suffi cient to control cVDPV2 outbreaks, use a 1 -drop mOPV2 strategy Maintain the public health emergency of international concern status of polio Accelerate clinical development of nOPV2 and prioritise its assessment under the WHO EUL procedure Page | 19 Develop and use clear communication to educate health workers and the general public about the complex issue of cVDPVs to prevent misunderstanding and negative impacts on immunisation activities Review the strategy to prevent paralysis in at -risk populations in regions of cVDPV2 outbreaks by accelerating access to and use of IPV 5.2 Meeting of the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Immunisation and Vaccine - Preventable Diseases in the Western Pacific Region (WPRO ) 18-21 June, 2019 Manila, Philippines. Final meeting report is pending. Therefore, this summary has been developed from the dr aft meeting report available at https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2019/october/4_WPR_TAG28.Draft - Report2019September08_with_Annexes.pdf The intention of the meeting of the TAG on Immunisation and Vaccine -Preventable Diseases in the WPRO was to provide practical recommendations for implementing the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) towards 2020 and also to prepare new visions and strategic direction for immunization and vaccine -preventable disease (VPD) control and elimination in the Western Pacific in the coming decade. Three different areas were explored : 1) measles and rubella elimination strategies and poliovirus eradication, 2) regional plans for surveillance, data management and laboratories and laboratory networks for vaccine -preventable disease control and elimination, 3) goals for immunization and V PDs during 2021 -2030 for the 37 countries and areas that make up the WPR The potential risk for the resurgence of VPDs such as measles, polio, diphtheria and pertussis due to population immunity gaps i s a huge concern in the region Although the WPR is expe riencing an increase in measles transmission during 2018 -2019, including the importation of the virus from endemic countries to many WPR Member States, WPR continues to make encouraging progress towards measles and rubella elimination. All Member States ex cept one has introduced a second dose of measles containing vaccine. The overall two -dose MCV coverage is 94% region -wide, but there is still wide variation in coverage among Member States. As of September 2018, the Regional Verification Commission (RVC) f or measles and Rubella Elimination verified nine countries and areas as having eliminated measles; an d five have eliminated rubella The Regional Strategy and Plan of Action for Measles and Rubella Elimination in the Western Pacific describes several operat ional targets for 2020 including : 1) prevent the resurgence of endemic measles virus; 2) sustain interruption of measles virus in countries that have achieved elimination, and 3) prevent large -scale outbreaks after importation The regional 2030 and strategic direction for measles and rubella elimination include : 1) strengthening and enhancing overall immunization systems through measles and rubella elimination strategies, such as school -based immunisation initiatives, injections and immunisation saf ety, and cold chain capacity building, 2) improving broader public health infrastructure and interventions through measles and rubella elimination strategies, 3) developing and implementing coordinated and synchronised cross -border initiatives to improve i mmunity among migrant and stateless populations and r educe cross -border importation The WPR successfully maintains its polio -free status since 2000. Majority of Member States maintain 90% coverage with three doses of polio vaccines. All countries and areas in the Region have successfully introduced one dose of IPV in their national schedules. WHO/EPI started development of the Regional Strategic Framework for VPDs and Immunisation in the Western Pacific 2021 -2030. One of its proposed goals is \"no paralysis due to any type of poliovirus in the WPR.\" WHO (Headquarters and all Regional Offices) is developing the WHO Immunisation Information System (WIISE), which is a collection of applications to collect, manage, analyse and disseminate immunisation and VPD su rveillance data reported to WHO worldwide. WHO is developing a Global Comprehensive VPD Surveillance Strategy , which will be finalised by the end of 2019, to support the Immunisation Agenda 2021 -2030 WPRO convened the Seventh Workshop for National Regulato ry Authorities for Vaccines and Medicines in the Western pa cific in Manila on August 2018 Page | 20 The 25 th Meeting of the TAG on Immunisation and VPD in the Western Pacific recommended developing a guidance document to support countries in the Region to overcome vaccine hesitancy and generate and sustain acceptance and demand. The draft guideline is for the use of EPI staff and partners. WPRO will continue working with relevant stakeholders to finalise the draft for Member State endorsement at the 29 th TAG Meeting in 2020 TAG urged all Member States to continue to introduce new vaccines that are recommended by WHO for inclusion in national immunisation programmes. There are three focus areas 1) patterns of uptake and coverage including, case studies on Haemophilius influenza type b (Hib), pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines, 2) factors influencing uptake and coverage and 3) a look into the future for new vaccines . Selected new vaccines that are expected to be introduced in the Western Pacific Region during 2021 -2030, including typhoid conjugate vaccine, respiratory syncytial virus , dengue and malaria vaccines The draft Regional Strategic Framework for Vaccine preventable diseases and immunisation in the Western Pacific, 2021 -2030 was discussed . The strategic objectives of the regional framework are to 1) strengthen and expand immunisation systems and programmes; 2) manage health intelligence on vaccine -preventable diseases and immunisation and 3) prepare for and respon d to public health emergencies The following immunisation partners' role and their work in the region were acknowledged: Asian Development Bank, International Vaccine Institute (IVI, Republic of Korea), National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM, Japan), National C entre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS, Australia), National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID, Japan), PATH, UNICEF and the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and prevention The TAG endorsed the draft of Regional Guide for Accelerated Control on Japanese Encephalitis in the Western Pacific, taking into account the inputs provided during the TAG meeting 5.3 Meeting of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) The mo st recent meeting was conducted 4 -5 December 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland but the summary of discussions has not yet been released. 5.4 Global Immuni sation News and other items and resources Latest news a vailable here: https://www.who.int/immuniza tion/newsroom/en/ The Regional Verification Commission declared that Bahrain, Iran and Oman achieved elimination status for measles and rubella The Sixteenth Annual Meeting on Surveillance, Preparedness and Response to Meningitis Outbreaks in Africa & 6 th Meeting of MenAfrinet Partners was held in Cameroon 22 -24 October 2019 Global NITAG Network Meeting in Atlanta, USA 24 -25 February 2020 6 Other items 6.1 Published information on assessment and registration of vaccines in Australia by TGA New/updated registrations for vaccines: Fluad Quad is indicated for the active immunisation against influenza in persons 65 years of age and older 6.2 Global measles outbreaks Many countries around the world are experiencing measles outbreaks.
