If you miss feeling well and are ready to commit to lifestyle changes, naturopathic medicine will be a perfect fit for you! Naturopathic doctors approach health and wellness from a holistic standpoint. We view the body as a whole and, therefore, treat the body \"wholistically\". The main objective of naturopathic medicine (also referred to as natural medicine, functional medicine, or holistic medicine) is to find and remove the root cause of illness. Naturopathic doctors then help the body come back into balance by adjusting diet and lifestyle and using natural remedies like herbal medicine, nutritional supplements, and homeopathy. Have you ever left a doctor's office feeling frustrated, being told there's nothing wrong with you when you know something just isn't right? Perhaps you were given a diagnosis like IBS, SIBO, or reflux, handed a prescription for a pill (or a handful!), and left to wonder if you'll be dependent on them forever. But here's the thing: you're still struggling with the same symptoms, and maybe even experiencing new ones along the way. Deep down, you can't shake the feeling that there's more to your health puzzle. Could mold illness or viruses like EBV be playing a role? Are my hormones balanced? How healthy is my gut microbiome? If you're nodding your head in agreement right now, it's time to take charge. It's time to uncover the root cause of your symptoms, optimize your health, and reclaim your well-being! Let's go beyond the surface and explore the underlying factors that have been overlooked. Get ready to embark on a journey of true healing and restoration. Your health deserves nothing less!
