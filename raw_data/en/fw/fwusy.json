Our Cabanna was absolutely beautiful clean and facing the ocean. Lucas and Monica were incredible hosts! Monica and Jenna... LaurenPosted a year ago on BookRetreats I chose to go to Eden because it appeared to be the most intimate yoga retreat I had seen online and in person, it is exactly that. It is a space that has incredible natural beauty, but it also cultivates a space where you can connect deeper with yourself and those around you in a very natural way. I loved all of the yoga sessions, the meals we shared together, and the cacao ceremony. Some accomplishments from this retreat were being able to challenge myself to get back into my practice and push myself to try surf, as well as go deeper into poses. Also pushed me to confront some of what I have been facing personally and work through it in a healthy way. Lauren, you truly made us all feel so welcomed. You have such a welcoming presence and made me feel very safe and comfortable right away. You and Mario have truly cultivated a safe and beautiful space to be in. This was truly a transformative experience and I will forever remember my time at Eden. Thank you. Mona S.Posted 8 months ago on BookRetreats I really enjoyed my time at Eden. The yoga classes, the beautiful surroundings, the attentiveness of the staff and the interesting guests all made for a refreshingly relaxing stay. Hanging out with and petting the animals was the extra perk I didn't realize I needed. I gave them a 4-star review because I think they could have taken a lot more sanitary precautions to contain the stomach flu virus that was going around while I was there. They didn't seem to pay much attention to it, which I found somewhat irresponsible. I ended up getting the stomach flu and was incapacitated for a couple of days. It is possible that I could have caught it from somewhere else but the chances I got it at Eden are very high, as everyone was falling around me like dominoes. While I respect their preference for a raw vegan menu, I ultimately think raw foods are the ideal vehicle for passing on unwanted bacteria and I would highly recommend offering hot, fully cooked options instead, especially since they're in the business of accommodating foreigners whose guts may not be conditioned to local water/foods. Generally speaking, the food (dinner especially) would be something to improve upon in my opinion. Also, their policy of not bringing outside food is not very reasonable in my opinion for those of us who have needs beyond vegan preferences, especially since they don't serve lunch. MettePosted 9 months ago on BookRetreats I just want to send you a few words after my lovely days at Eden. It was an absolutely healing and beautiful time.
