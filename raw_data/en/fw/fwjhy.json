Howeve r, selecting the proper vaccines for your herd can be a difficult task considering the large number of va ccines that are available. Therefore, some things to consider when devel oping a vaccination program for yo ur herd are: 1. Determine the goals of your vac cination program (e.g., what dis eases do you want to prevent and/or control, and in what type/a ge animal?). Dif ferent herds will have different goals, and therefore different va ccination protocols. 2. Discuss these goals with your her d health veterinarian and/or E xtension agent. 3. Understand a vaccine's expected level of protection. 4. Understand a vaccine's duration of immunity. 5. Never underestimate the importan ce of stress management and nut rition with respect to an animal's ability to properl y respond to a vaccination. The following information describe s some of the important facto rs in determining what vaccines are most appropriate for a par ticular operation. Ple ase use this informa tion as a general guideline in developing an effective vaccination program. Vaccines are generally categorized as killed vaccines (KV), tox oids, modified live vaccines (MLV), or chemically altered vaccines. Each category has its advantages a nd disadvantages. Killed Vaccines (KV) and Toxoids Advantages: Available for many diseases No risk of the vaccine organism spreading between animals Minimal risk of causing abortion No on-farm mixing required Disadvantages: More likely to cause allergic reactions and post-vaccination lumps Two initial doses required Slower onset of immunity Immunity is usually not as strong or long-lasting when compare d to MLV products Usually more expensive than MLV products January 2014 Vaccines are available for many diseases. However, not all dise ases are a routine threat to many beef herds, and some vaccines are not sufficiently effective to just ify their use. Therefore, every cattle operation will have unique vaccin ation requirements based on in dividual herd goals. The following guidelines for vaccinating cattle m ay not be applicable in all situations. The best us e of these guidelines is as a starting point to devel op an effective vaccination prot ocol with your herd health veterinarian and/or Extension agent. When a ppropriate, ensure products are s afe for pregnant animals and for calves nursing pregnant cows. Properly store and administer va ccines according to label direc tions, adhere to designated meat withdrawal ti mes, and follow all other Beef Quality Assurance (BQA) guidelines. Nursing calves 7-way viral diarrhea PI3 = parainfluenza 3 BRSV = bovine respiratory syncytial virus Calf-hood vaccination for brucellosis if recommended by herd ve terinarian Consider a leptospirosis 5-way vaccine for future replacement h eifers and Advantages: One initial dose may be sufficient, but boosters are somet imes required Stimulate more rap id, stronger, and longer- lasting immunity than KV products Less likely to cause allergic reactions and post-vaccination lumps Usually less expensive than KV products Disadvantages: Risk of causing a bortion or transient infertility, therefore the y should generally be administered 6-8 weeks prior to the breeding season Must be mixed on-farm and used within about 1 hour Chemically Altered Vaccines Advantages: Share many of the advantages of MLV products Safety is similar to KV products Minimal risk of causing abortion Disadvantages: Two initial doses required Slower onset of immunity than MLV products Immunity is usually not as strong or long-lasting when compare d to MLV products Usually more expensiv e than MLV products January 2014 Breeding animals (replacement h eifers, cows, and bulls should g enerally be vaccinated six to eight weeks prior to the breeding season so immunity is high during the bre eding Understanding on Vaccine Labels The Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB), which is part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the USDA, is the agency that grants the appr opriate protection claims for vaccines based on a thorough analysis of supporting efficacy and safety data. Protection claims are available on all vaccine labels or product insert s. Understanding label claims i s therefore one way to evaluate the expected efficacy of a vaccine, but remember that these claims only apply when products are administered according to label directions. The USDA can grant one of five possible levels of protection statements: 1. Prevention of infection Highest level of protection 2. Prevention of disease 3. Aid in disease prevention 4. Aid in disease control 5. Other claims Lowest level of protection What do these label claims mean? 1. Prevention of infection - preven ts all colonization or replicat ion of the challenge organism. A label statement such as \"for the preve ntion of infection with [specif ic microorganism]\" m ay be used. This claim is rarely granted. 2. Prevention of disease - highly e ffective in preventing clinical disease. A label sta tement such as \"for the prevention of disease due to [specific microorganism]\" may be used. 3. Aid in disease prevention - aids in preventing disease by a cli nically significant amount. A label statement such as \"as an aid in the prevention of disease due t o [specific microor ganism]\" may be used. 4. Aid in disease control - aids in the reduction of disease sever ity, duration or onset. A label statement such as \"as an aid in the control of disease due to [specific m icroorganism]\" or a similar one stating the product's particular action may be used. 5. Other claims - products with bene ficial effects other than dire ct disease control. Products with beneficial effects other than direct disease control, such as t he control of infectiousness through the reduction of pathogen shedding, may make such claims if the siz e of the effect is clinically significant and well suppor ted by appropriate data. These Protection Statements are outlined by the USDA, APHIS, Ve terinary Services Memorandum No. 800.202, June 14, 2002. "}
