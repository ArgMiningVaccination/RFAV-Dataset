No painful injection, just squirt right in the nose with the applicator included.", "sitename": "Jeffers", "date": "2022-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Protects healthy dogs against upper respiratory infections caused by Canine Parainfluenza and Bordetella Bronchiseptica. Solo-Jec KC has the flexibility to customize the dose to fit the size of the dog - either a full volume dose or 1/2 volume dose which may be more comfortable for small dogs. Note that a 1/2 volume dose does not mean the dog is receiving 1/2 the vaccine. The vaccine is in the dry cake so a 1/2 volume dose means there is 1/2 the liquid but a full amount of vaccine. "}
