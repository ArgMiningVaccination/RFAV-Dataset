Version: November 2021 Letter | 1 November 22, 2021 Parents/Guardians, The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) is working with your school division to arrange for the administration of a pediatric dose of the Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine to students aged five to 11 years beginnin g in late November . (Those born in 2009 and earlier continue to be eligible as well.) The delivery plan will also include participating pharmacies and SHA clinics. Providing immunization to student s is consistent with new national recommendations and authorization by Health Canada. The COVID -19 vaccine is voluntary. Children are at lower risk of serious illness or death from COVID -19. However , to minimize the spread of COVID -19 it is important to immunize as many eligible children safely and as quickly as possible. Pfizer is currently the only brand of pediatric COVID -19 vaccine that is approved by Health Canada. The COVID -19 vaccine for children 5 -11 years old is a slightly different formulation /dosage than the vaccine for those 12 years and older. Clinical trials indicated no safety concerns among children five to 11 years of age. The studies also showed that expected vaccine side effects (such as soreness at the injection site and muscle aches) were well tolerated and resolved in 2- 3 days. Children five to 11 years old have very good immune responses when they receive 2 doses as recommended. In fact, the vaccine was about 90.7% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID- 19 among children participating in the clinical trials , and there were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine. The attached consent form and links to vaccine information online are provided for both parents and students to read and discuss before proceeding with immunization. A consent form must be signed by a parent or legal guardian and presented at the clinic in order for children in the five to 11 year old group to receive a vaccine. Information about the Pfizer vaccine , after care following immunization and an e lectronic copy of the consent form are available on saskatchewan.ca/covid19- vaccine . Additional information, including common questions as well as a French version of th is package , is also available on saskatchewan.ca/covid19- vaccine . Parents can accompany their children to participating pharmacies or SHA clinics for immunization. School clinics may have different restrictions, so it is best to check with the clinic at your school/division. Appointments can also be booked by calling 1-888-SASK- VAX. Parents/guardians are able to access their child's immunization record through MySaskHealthRecord . You must have an account yourself, and the child's information can be linked. Parents/guardians with MySaskHealthRecord who have not already made a request for access to a child's immunization record are encouraged to do so. (Those 14 and older must have their own account.) More information is available here: https://www.ehealthsask.ca/MySaskHealthRecord/MySaskHealthRecord/Pages/Child_MSHR.aspx . The CO VID- 19 immunization is a safe, effective way to help everyone stay healthy, prevent illness and save lives.
