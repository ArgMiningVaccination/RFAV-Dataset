With a still unidentified origin, the diagnostic of this syndrome is always made by exclusion of conditions that mimic the phenotypes [ [2](#B2-healthcare-10-01999)]. In 2003, the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) reformulated the diagnosis criteria of PCOS. Two out of the following three criteria should be present to confirm the syndrome: oligo/anovulation, androgen excess, and the confirmation of polycystic ovarian morphology by imaging. These are designed as Rotterdam criteria, and from them, it is possible to identify four distinct phenotypes of PCOS ( [Table 1](#healthcare-10-01999-t001)). PCOS has been strongly associated with alteration in the autonomic nervous system: namely, increased sympathetic nervous activity [ [3](#B3-healthcare-10-01999)]. Endocrine and metabolic implications of the syndrome reflect a high comorbidity [ [4](#B4-healthcare-10-01999)] within three major aspects: hyperandrogenism [24](#B24-healthcare-10-01999), have been designed for PCOS management according to international guidelines [ [11](#B11-healthcare-10-01999), [27](#B27-healthcare-10-01999), [28](#B28-healthcare-10-01999), [29](#B29-healthcare-10-01999)]. However, allopathic therapies have shown several unpleasant secondary effects, which motivate PCOS women to search for complementary medicines such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Among the TCM therapeutics, acupuncture has been used as therapy or co-therapy to improve the comorbidity's symptoms affecting women with this condition. Diverse studies using low frequency electroacupuncture (EA), alone [ [30](#B30-healthcare-10-01999), [31](#B31-healthcare-10-01999)] or in combination with exercise to modulate the sympathetic system, concluded that acupuncture seems to regulate the hypersecretion of androgens, improving both the reproductive and endocrine metabolic functional state [ [32](#B32-healthcare-10-01999)]. Acupuncture has also been used, alone or in combination with clomiphene, to ameliorate the disorder of subfertility in PCOS patients [ [33](#B33-healthcare-10-01999), [34](#B34-healthcare-10-01999)]. With respect to psychological balance, acupuncture studies were designed to relieve anxiety and depression in PCOS patients [ [35](#B35-healthcare-10-01999)]. Acupuncture therapy is thought to have a positive impact on the treatment of PCOS through the following mechanisms: sympathetic output modulation through spinal [ [36](#B36-healthcare-10-01999)]; modulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal [39](#B39-healthcare-10-01999), [40](#B40-healthcare-10-01999), [41](#B41-healthcare-10-01999), [42](#B42-healthcare-10-01999)]; and influencing insulin sensitivity or resistance through functional balance of the insulin signaling pathways [ [43](#B43-healthcare-10-01999)]. PCOS in TCM is considered a complex combination of different factors that end up in blockage of the communication between the Penetrating (Chong Mai) and Conception (Ren Mai) vessels, compromising the female's fertility and reproductive cycle normalization, with or without association to pathogenic heat and phlegm (Lyttleton, 2013). Usually, patients present a tendency to a kidney Yang and/or Yin deficiency, possibly associated to a Qi deficiency in spleen or lung, hence leading to a weakened Shen in the long run. On the other hand, we can have a scenario where kidney Yang deficiency may be associated to Xue stasis leading to cardiac phlegm/dampness in the long run, and, therefore, a disturbed Shen. Main pathogenic factors generating this condition may be stress/overworking, emotional origin (sadness, fear, or excessive worry), cold or phlegm/dampness. According to Maciocia, the kidney is the internal organ most closely associated to the ability to conceive, therefore kidney deficiency is the pattern most commonly found among gynecological pathologies. Kidney deficiency can be due to kidney Yin and/or kidney Yang deficiency. The same author referenced that the overlap of blood and kidney deficiency are quite common due to the relation of kidneys/uterus/blood/Penetrating vessel (Chong Mai). The Penetrating vessel supplies blood to the uterus; however, this supply is also managed by the provision of blood from the liver, the internal organ that stores the blood. So, this liver-blood is key for a healthy menstrual function. Not to mention that, according to the Five Element Theory, Water is the mother of Wood, meaning that the kidney organ is the mother of the liver which is consensual with the relation between essence and blood: kidneys store Jing/essence and the liver stores blood; hence, essence is the mother of the blood. Most published studies of acupuncture in PCOS are concerned with anovulatory cycles and sub/infertility, addressed in TCM as TianGui disorder [ [44](#B44-healthcare-10-01999)], which is the disorder for which most women seek for help in complementary medicine. However, many women also search for the treatment of symptoms associated with hyperandrogenism either for aesthetic reason, such as acne and alopecia, or for derived comorbidities such as overweight, insulin resistance, diabetes type II, and others. Recent analysis of obstetric outcomes in TCM syndromes showed that possibly more than the usual two distinctions between kidney deficiency and phlegm-dampness and/or blood stasis may be found in women diagnosed with PCOS. Wang et al. (2017) made a secondary analysis of the results of the RCT of Wu et al., 2016, and concluded that it is possible to identify four TCM phenotypes that could be correlated with the four phenotypes according to the Rotterdam criteria ( [Table 1](#healthcare-10-01999-t001)). According to the author, these four be: \"kidney deficiency blood stasis\" (10.89%)\u2014to help in understanding the syndromes according to TCM, we can leave a quick definition of these patterns regarding the reproductive function. According to Lyttleton, kidney deficiency can be translated in symptoms such as in the study, where kidney deficiency with liver stasis patients showed a tendency to have psychological or mental problems [ [45](#B45-healthcare-10-01999)]. Spleen deficiency and phlegm stasis patients presented metabolic abnormalities, including higher body weights, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, systolic blood pressure, free androgen index, triglycerides, alanine transaminase, and occurrence of metabolism syndrome. Patients with phlegm and blood stasis had higher free testosterone and insulin, and patients with kidney deficiency with blood stasis presented a more severe reproductive disorder including higher luteinizing hormone and the ratio of luteinizing hormone to follicle stimulation hormone. In general, patterns derived from kidney deficiency demonstrated an association with psychological or mental problems, while patterns associated to phlegm syndrome had more severe glucolipid metabolic abnormalities. [Table 1](#healthcare-10-01999-t001)), which are both characterized by polycystic ovary morphology plus ovulatory disfunction, and in the case of the first phenotype, it is also considered that the diagnosis will show the presence of signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism. Attending to the common denominator of ovulatory disfunction, we can consider the TCM pattern of kidney deficiency in both main groups, because when the kidney Yin is compromised, the glands and hormonal regulation of the body is considered to be compromised as well\u2014the kidney is the internal organ in TCM associated with the reproductive capacity as well to the development of the fetus. On the other hand, the polycystic ovary morphology can be related to not only kidney deficiency but also to stagnant blood and liver Qi. If liver Qi is stagnant for too long, the function of the body where the liver channel travels might be altered/blocked so we can find pain and difficulty in the egg release in the ovaries as well as the formation of cysts for anovulation. This cyst formation is considered to be the presence of phlegm-dampness in the reproductive system. So, thereby, that is the reasoning behind the kidney deficiency + phlegm-dampness. According to TCM, Qi (energy) is considered the mother of the Xue (blood), meaning that if the flow of qi is compromised in the body so is the flow of Xue. The kidney Yang deficiency in some women will manifest as a deficient qi and, to some degree, it will compromise blood microcirculation (designated as Xue stasis in TCM) affecting the function of the internal organ heart in TCM, leading to Heart Fire. This Heart Fire not only is manifested by anxiety but also causes or worsens the pre-existence of kidney deficiency, especially kidney Yin deficiency. Thus, we justified the simple division in the second branch of patterns: kidney deficiency + blood stasis. Blood stasis might be also concomitant with the presence of blood deficiency (either for blood loss, unhealthy dietetic habits, overwork, or even as ethiological\u2014part of the constitution of that female individual). Normally, when the level of blood is low, also the flow or its circulation is often slower. According to Maciocia, to address the Extraordinary vessels is absolutely essential in the treatment of PCOS for the reason that it will allow to resolve the dampness-phlegm from the uterus and to tonify the kidneys (and, therefore, regulate the hormones). In this way, from tonifying the kidney, we expect a better functioning of the Conception vessel, moving stagnant Qi and contributing to unblocking uterus blood stasis\u2014present in kidney deficiency associated with blood stasis syndrome and to deblock phlegm-dampness, present in kidney deficiency associated with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Thus, for women diagnosed with kidney deficiency associated with phlegm-dampness syndrome and/or with the main symptoms of spleen deficiency or liver stasis, we propose Protocol A of acupuncture ( [Table A1](#healthcare-10-01999-t0A1)and [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-01999-f001)a), and for women diagnosed with kidney deficiency with the main symptoms of blood stasis (with or without phlegm stasis), we propose Protocol B ( [Table A1](#healthcare-10-01999-t0A1)and [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-01999-f001)b). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design 2.2. Recruitment, Participants, and Randomization [Figure 2](#healthcare-10-01999-f002). The sample will be 120 women, divided in two main groups according to the TCM diagnosis: Group A (n = 60): kidney deficiency associated with phlegm-dampness syndrome and/or spleen deficiency or liver stasis and group B (n = 60): kidney deficiency with main symptoms of blood stasis. Each group should have a total of 60 participants to achieve statistical difference in the case of 20% withdrawal of the participants [ [34](#B34-healthcare-10-01999)]. Participants will be recruited directly from the family doctor and/or hospital specialty of gynecology/endocrinology. Each medical practitioner will refer patients with PCOS diagnostic aged between 18 and 59 y.o. with main symptoms of metabolic imbalance and women between 18 and 40 y.o. with main symptoms of hyperandrogenism and fertility issues to the principal investigator to be later recruited by telephone interview. Patients who show interest in participating will first be prescreened and recorded by an intake to verify that they meet basic inclusion criteria. All questions about the study, as well as the written informed consent, will be explained in detail. The goal of the screening visit will be to confirm a diagnosis of PCOS and to exclude major medical illnesses. These tests will aim to confirm the western and TCM diagnostic. Women diagnosed with kidney deficiency associated with phlegm-dampness will be randomly allocated by a computer program in a 1:1 ratio to two groups of 30 individuals each, one will be the study group (SGA) submitted to active acupuncture, and the other will be the control group submitted to sham acupuncture (CGA). The same procedure design will be applied to the 60 women diagnosed with kidney deficiency associated with blood stasis (SGB and CGB). All baseline and follow-up measures should be obtained on a single day. However, questionnaires may be spread between the screening and the baseline visit ( [Table 2](#healthcare-10-01999-t002)). 2.3. Inclusion Criteria [48](#B48-healthcare-10-01999)]. Hirsutism should be assessed using the modified Ferriman-Gallwey score (mFG), where a level 4 to 6 indicates hirsutism. Alopecia will be assessed using the Ludwig visual score. For acne, no universally accepted visual assessment is available. When clinical signs of hyperandrogenism are unclear or absent, measurement of calculated free testosterone, free androgen index, or calculated bioavailable testosterone should be undertaken [ [48](#B48-healthcare-10-01999)]. Ovulatory dysfunction is clinically reflected by irregular menstrual cycles, which are defined as less than 21 or more than 35 days in women over 3 years postmenarche to perimenopause. 2.4. Exclusion Criteria 2.5. B\u00e0ihu\u00ec DU-20 may add to the relief of anxiety. On the other hand, Zhngj\u00ed REN-3 and Zhngwn REN-12 will also contribute to moving the stagnated Qi associated with phlegm-dampness syndrome. Stimulating points in the lower Triple Burner, namely, Shnm\u00e0i BL-62 and Si3 H\u00f2ux SI-3, we expect an improvement of issues related to food, fluids, blood stasis, accumulated phlegm, and stagnant emotions derived from kidney deficiency associated with phlegm-dampness syndrome. The Qi stagnation observed in these patients usually leads to an imbalance in the transforming function of the Earth element for which Tinsh ST-25 and Snynjio SP-6 may help to restore the Qi and Xue circulation for a general improvement of homeostasis [ [45](#B45-healthcare-10-01999)]. In women presenting blood stasis, the Conception-Governor vessel circulation is prone to an imbalance that leads to frequent amenorrhea and fertility issues. For that, we suggest regulating the Conception vessel to promote a healthy reproductive cycle by opening Ren Mai and restoring harmony by pairing the Luo points Zh\u00e0ohi KID-6 with right Li\u00e8qu\u00e8 LU-7 and right N\u00e8igun P-6 with left Gngsn SP-4 to regulate the Conception, Governing, and Penetrating vessels [ [49](#B49-healthcare-10-01999)]. We would also add Tinsh ST-25, Gul\u00e1i ST-29, and Yl\u00edngq\u00faan SP-9 to stabilize and harmonize the Earth movement, nourishing blood and eliminate stasis with the spleen's reinforcement [ [45](#B45-healthcare-10-01999)]. Based on the characteristics of the referred points, we designed two protocols: Protocol Snynjio SP-6 bilaterally (tonify). Needles will also be [Table A1](#healthcare-10-01999-t0A1), and [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-01999-f001)a). Protocol B: 25 \u00d7 25 needle will be used. Insertion depth will be 15-35 mm into skeletal muscle or fibrous tissue. The depth of needle insertion could vary according to the location depth of the acupoint between patients depending on body mass index (BMI), as depth should be enough to reach muscle/fibrous tissue. Stimulation: When needles are inserted, they will be stimulated by manual rotation circa 180 degrees back and forth to evoke tingling sensation\u2014so called de Qi\u2014reflecting activation of sensory afferents. As soon as Qi sensation is reached, the needle should not hurt or cause any pain or discomfort. After 10 min, needles will be stimulated manually. This should be repeated after 20 min and again after 30 min. Two sets of acupuncture points will be used according to the symptoms of each study group. 2.5.2. Sham Acupuncture [Table A1](#healthcare-10-01999-t0A1)and [Figure 1](#healthcare-10-01999-f001)c). Stimulation: No manual stimulation, whether tonify or disperse, will be done during the intervention. 3. Results [50](#B50-healthcare-10-01999)], the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale [ [51](#B51-healthcare-10-01999)], Scale [ [52](#B52-healthcare-10-01999)] ( [Table 3](#healthcare-10-01999-t003)). All the questionnaires used are validated for Portuguese language. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after the last acupuncture treatment ( [Table 2](#healthcare-10-01999-t002)). 3.1. Blinded 3.2. Adverse Events/Serious Reactions 3.3. Data Collection and Statistical Analysis 3.4. Ethics and Dissemination [http://www.chiati.org.cn/index.aspx](http://www.chiati.org.cn/index.aspx), accessed on 4 January 2021). A written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. Ethical approval will be obtained from the Ethics Committees of all involved institutions. All procedures performed in this study will be in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Any changes that need to be made in the trial protocol will be communicated to all investigators, the ethics committees, and the trial registry. The results obtained will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. 4. Discussion 4.1. Limitation of Previous Trials [48](#B48-healthcare-10-01999)] since the severity of the disease decreases from A to D phenotype [ [28](#B28-healthcare-10-01999)]. With respect to outcomes, our previous review of the literature revealed that most of the studies mainly focused on the ovarian dysfunctions such as infertility, hormonal ratio LH/FSH, menstrual frequency, and ovulatory and pregnancy rate values [ [53](#B53-healthcare-10-01999), [54](#B54-healthcare-10-01999), [55](#B55-healthcare-10-01999), [56](#B56-healthcare-10-01999)]. On the other hand, hormonal studies contemplated levels of FSH and LH, but no other important biomarkers that, in our opinion, would support better assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism and hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/adrenal sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Additionally, the evidence for long-term efficacy of acupuncture in patients with PCOS is yet insufficient. In summary, we think that acupuncture studies on PCOS should use a broader analysis of sex hormones and assess secondary outcomes to describe the metabolic status of each phenotype, before and after treatment, and have a follow-up analysis. Furthermore, we think it would be important to use international measures to facilitate interstudy comparability. 4.2. Proposed Trial [54](#B54-healthcare-10-01999), [56](#B56-healthcare-10-01999)] which, in our opinion, will be fundamental to understanding the effect of acupuncture on the PCOS condition. The design of our study follows the SPIRIT checklist and the international guidelines recommended for every released RCT [ [57](#B57-healthcare-10-01999)]. Our study design will use the traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic with the respective rationale for the general condition of PCOS and the specific symptoms or signs. Thus, patients will be divided into two main phenotypes according to the TCM pathomechanism proposed by Lyttleton (2013). Although reproductive cycle normalization is a common indicator of a healthy reproductive status, we think it is more accurate to use the increase of the ovulation rate, balance of sex hormones, and improvement of the metabolic profile as the main indicators of the efficiency of the trial. For this reason, we suggest a study where the analysis of the results is divided in three parts: primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes. 4.3. What We Expect with the Trial 5.
