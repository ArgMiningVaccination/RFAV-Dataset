A Primary Care Physician, or PCP, provides continuous care for a patient and is responsible for the patient's overall well-being. The PCP should be the patient's first contact when a health concern arises. PCPs are often trained in family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, or women's health. In addition to primary care, PCPs often refer to specialists, as necessary, for patients to receive proper treatment. At WCCHC, we strive in having a comprehensive clinic which provides an integrative health model, including dental, behavioral health, substance abuse intervention, laboratory, x-ray and pharmacy as well as native Hawaiian healing. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH), is a team based health care delivery model that provides comprehensive and continuous medical care to patients with the goal of obtaining maximized health outcomes. It is \"an approach to providing comprehensive primary care for children, youth and adults\". The provision of medical homes allows better access to health care, increase satisfaction with care, and improved health. Joint principals that define a PCMH have been established at Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center for the last 10 years. This includes: Care coordination is an essential component of PCMH. Care coordination requires additional resources such as health information technology, and appropriately trained staff to provide coordinated care through team-based models. The Native Hawaiian Traditional Healing Center promotes traditional Native Hawaiian healing and cultural education, practices and traditions. The primary practices of the Native Hawaiian Traditional Health Center includes Lomilomi (Hawaiian massage therapy), Laau Lapaau (herbal medicine), Laau Kahea (spiritual healing), and Hooponopono (conflict resolution). A Council of Native Hawaiian elders - Kupuna, who are master practitioners, is responsible for preserving and upholding cultural Hawaiian ways of practice. "}
