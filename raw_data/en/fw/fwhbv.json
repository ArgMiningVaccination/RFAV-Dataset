Instructions for Ayurvedic intestinal detoxification at home", "sitename": "World of European Ayurveda\u00ae", "date": "2018-09-14", "cleaned_text": "Our intestines do a lot of work every day, so that a healthy intestinal flora is indispensable for the entire organism. So that harmful bacteria and co. can be completely eliminated, an occasional cleansing of the intestines is highly recommended. Why such an intestinal detoxification is important and how you can carry out an Ayurvedic intestinal cleansing at home, you can find out here. Why is a colon cleanse useful? A full 80 percent of the immune system is controlled by our intestines. Conversely, this means that if the intestine is not doing well, this will sooner or later manifest itself in a physical reaction. Possible reactions are: Even anxiety and depression can be due to intestinal problems. The cause of these problems then lies mainly on the inner wall of the colon. Bacteria or metabolic residues, also called Ama in Ayurveda, can get stuck in their coils and bulges. The more of these \"blockages\" accumulate, the more difficult it becomes for the intestines to keep your organism healthy. But even if you do not experience any acute health complaints, an intestinal detoxification is certainly not pointless. Because an intestinal cleanse and intestinal cleansing enables the intestinal wall to regenerate. You will see: After the completed detoxification of the intestines, you will feel much lighter and have more energy again. No wonder - after all, the [Agni](https://www.european-ayurveda.at/en/agni), your digestive fire, can now perform its services again undisturbed! At this point, it is important to distinguish between the terms colon cleansing and colon rehabilitation. A colon cleanse means a rather short-term process that you can carry out at home with a few means. The aim is to detoxify the large intestine, as the small intestine can cleanse itself comparatively quickly. With intestinal rehabilitation, on the other hand, you apply several different measures in combination and take a cure that can last several weeks or even months. This may be necessary if the intestines are particularly weakened and the complaints are clearly noticeable. However, we want to assume here that you simply want to do something good for your digestive organs and therefore carry out a colon cleanse. Instructions: Ayurvedic colon cleansing at home There are several ways in which Ayurveda can help cleanse the intestines. One of them is the classic [Ayurvedic fasting cure](https://www.european-ayurveda.at/en/ayurvedisches-fasten). Here you avoid solid food as much as possible so that the intestines have to do as little work as possible and can regenerate better. The second option is an active bowel cleansing cure, called Shankprakshalana in Ayurveda. Ideally, you will have the guidance of an Ayurvedic expert, but you can of course just as easily do this on your own at home. Intestinal detoxification: the cure with yoga and massages Essentially, the Ayurvedic intestinal detoxification cure consists of two elements: Yoga and water with Epsom salts. You always alternate between drinking a glass of salty water and doing a series of yoga exercises that stimulate digestion. This works with all asanas in which you rotate your core. An example is the following exercise: - Sit cross-legged with your back upright. - Place your hands loosely on your knees and arrive in the pose. - Now bring the fingertips of the left hand to the floor slightly behind the body and place the right hand on the left knee. - Now turn to the left so that you can look back over your left shoulder. - Stay in this position for a short time and repeat the movement on the other side. If you always alternate drinking some of the Epsom salt water and doing the asanas, the salty liquid can pass completely through the intestines. Always go to the toilet after a cycle of exercises and repeat these procedures as often as you feel comfortable with them. You can also stimulate the digestive tract by massaging the abdominal area. This tactic works best if you use it for about 10 minutes each morning and evening. Lie on your back and bend your knees slightly so that the abdomen can be completely relaxed. Now you can massage around the belly button with the fingers of one hand and with light pressure in a clockwise direction. Cleanse the bowel through the right diet Apart from the active exercises you can use for intestinal detoxification, diet naturally also plays a big role in cleansing the colon. Make sure to eat as alkaline as possible and lots of vegetables and legumes. Alkaline foods are for example: [su_note note_color=\"#F3B400 text_color=\"#ffffff\"] - Apples - Pears - Rocket - Endive lettuce - Broccoli - Almonds - Mushrooms - Vegetable juices - Green tea [Amalaki](https://blog.sonnhof-ayurveda.at/amalaki) [/su_note] In general, bitter substances are a wise choice for colon cleansing. So especially bitter vegetables you can combine to your heart's content! Also, take the spice Triphala every evening by dissolving 1 teaspoon of the powder in a cup of [warm water](https://www.european-ayurveda.at/en/warmes-wasser-trinken-ayurveda) before going to bed and drinking the mixture slowly. Triphala causes toxins to be expelled from the gastrointestinal tract , thereby helping you to cleanse your intestines in a very decisive way. For those who prefer to take Triphala as a dietary supplement, we recommend the [Triphala herbal capsules](https://shop.european-ayurveda.at/produkt/triphala-100-kraeuterkapseln/) from our online shop. In the morning, on the other hand, you can drink a [glass of warm water with a little lemon juice, honey and ginger](https://www.european-ayurveda.at/en/ayurveda-getraenke) right after getting up. The combination of these ingredients stimulates the metabolism. By the way: Your intestines will also be happy in the long run if you get into the habit of this ritual for every day! Psyllium husks and Epsom salts as laxatives They are the undisputed front-runners when it comes to cleansing the intestines: psyllium husks and Epsom salts may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they are very effective in cleansing the intestines. Bowel cleansing with psyllium Crushed psyllium husks contain many digestive substances. Absorbed with water, they swell in the intestine and soften deposits on the intestinal wall. They also have the effect of increasing the volume of the chewed food. This stimulates intestinal activity and the deposits can be excreted more quickly. You should take a maximum of 40g of the psyllium per day. It is best to drink the mixture one hour before or two hours after a meal. Simply pour a small amount of the psyllium husk powder over water and drink the glass as quickly as possible. Because even though Ayurveda is generally about eating and drinking consciously and slowly, psyllium swells up very quickly and becomes difficult to drink. Intestinal cleansing with Epsom salts or Glauber's salt Epsom salt binds water in the intestine, so that the stool becomes softer and the volume of the intestinal contents is increased. In this case, too, the activity of the intestines is stimulated; the effect sets in after about 1-3 hours. There is no universal amount of Epsom salt that you should take - just try it out and see if you need 1 tablespoon or a little more. Dissolve the Epsom salt in a glass of warm water and drink the mixture. Immediately afterwards, drink plenty of still water or unsweetened herbal tea, as the salt draws water from your body. Intestinal cleansing with Glauber's salt works similarly to Epsom salt. The magnesium sulphate can be dissolved with up to four teaspoons in lukewarm water. After everything has dissolved, the mixture can be drunk slowly and in sips. Bowel cleansing with healing clay and castor oil Cleansing the intestines with the help of mineral-rich healing clay is also a process that comes from Ayurveda. Three times a day, 1 teaspoon of healing clay can be dissolved in lukewarm water and drunk throughout the day. Castor oil is also known in this country for its laxative effect. You should make sure that you do not take more than two tablespoons. Side effects: First worsening possible? A colon cleanse of any kind always means a certain adjustment for your body. Accordingly, so-called detoxification crises can occur. The emphasis is on can - it may just as well happen that you do not notice any major side effects. Possible side effects are basically: [su_note note_color=\"#F3B400 text_color=\"#ffffff\"] - Headaches and lack of energy - Skin impurities - Constipation - Bad breath - increased perspiration [/su_note] However, it is virtually impossible to predict certain side effects for a detoxification pathway. After all, every person has different physical conditions. As is generally the case in Ayurveda, the same applies to colon cleansing: Your body reacts in its own unique way, precisely because it is a unique system. What is important when cleansing the bowel? First things first: It is best to take plenty of time for a colon cleanse. Firstly, it can take hours or days for the activity in the intestines to become noticeable and secondly, you may have less energy during this phase and need more rest. In order to flush out the deposits in the intestines and at the same time keep enough fluid in your body, it is also important that you drink a lot. Ideally, 2-3 litres of warm water per day or more if you are doing the colon cleanse with Epsom salts, for example. The third major factor is diet. Light food is the most easily digestible and therefore particularly suitable for cleansing the intestines. It puts the least strain on the intestines. You can also support the digestion of food with gentle forms of movement such as asanas from the [Hatha Yoga](https://www.european-ayurveda.at/en/hatha-yoga) or abdominal massages. Ideally, a bowel detox is part of a holistic lifestyle. This means that you align both diet and exercise with what is good for your body and mind. It also means continuing to pay attention to these two aspects after the cleansing cure, for example by regularly taking a fasting day. You see: A colon cleanse does not have to be elaborate and yet it can achieve a lot! Daily planning for a colon cleanse in Ayurveda The colon cleansing should be carried out on a day when you can take time for yourself and are not exposed to any additional stress. On the day before, you should avoid heavy meals, and from the afternoon onwards, you should only eat soup.
