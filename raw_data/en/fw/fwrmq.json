BEST MANA GEMENT PRACTICES AND MITIGATION MEA SURES This chapter provides examples of best management practices (BMPs) and mitigation measures that FirstNet and/or their partners would recommend or require to be implemented during deployment and operation of the Proposed Action to help avoid or minimize potential impacts to various resources, or potential impacts to deployed infrastructure from various hazards. Specifically, FirstNet and/or their partners would be required to implement mitigation measures, as defined through permitting and/or consultation with appropriate resource agencies. Unlike mitigation measures, however, BMPs would not necessarily be required in every project activity but would be applied as practicab le or feasible during deployment and operation of the Proposed Action. The BMPs and mitigation measures outlined in this chapter have been developed based on consultation with other agencies as well as through independent research conducted by FirstNet an d their environmental contractors. It is possible that other or additional site -specific BMPs and mitigation measures not included in this chapter may be recommended or required to be implemented as a result of consultation with resource agencies, permits , and/or additional environmental reviews . 16.1. INFRASTRUCTURE 16.1.1. BMP s and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types This section describes BMPs and mitigation measures to address potential impacts to infrastructure resources. Based on the analyses of proposed activities in Chapters 3 to 15, the potential activities associated with the deployment and operation of the Proposed Action and alternatives are expected to have less than significant impacts. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for construction on or near public roads; Follow all applicable federal, state, and local laws concerni ng traffic speed and safety during the transport of equipment; Avoid roads with heavy traffic volumes and during peak travel hours, to the extent possible, when scheduling the transport of heavy equipment or construction materials; Schedule deployment act ivities outside of peak traffic hours; Design staging areas to minimize unnecessary equipment and material mobilizations; Repave and restore disturbed roads and public road rights -of-way (ROWs), in accordance with federal, state, and local laws, as quickl y as possible so as to not create any traffic impediments that hinder access to local public safety and emergency facilities and to allow traffic capacity and safety conditions to return to their pre -construction condition; Design new deployment activities within ROWs, to the extent possible, and outside of roadways and thoroughfares to minimize potential impacts on traffic flow or safety; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-4 Coordinate closely with public safety officials, emergency and medical facilities, and existing telecommunications prov iders so that each is aware of the deployment activities and schedule; Schedule new construction outside of seasons known to cause more accidents (e.g., hurricane or winter storm seasons or times of the year when wildfires are more likely to occur) so that potential service disruptions are less likely to coincide with times of increased demand; Confirm or otherwise install detection systems so that if and when a disruption to utility services or telecommunications systems occurs, it is identified and ca n be repaired quickly; Implement a backup telecommunications system, as needed and feasible , which allows first responders to communicate during deployment activities until the new NPSBN has been successfully implemented; Complete deployment activities as quickly and safely as possible to avoid any possible disruptions to utility services; Complete deployment activities that could interrupt power during non-peak times to minimize disruption of service ; Follow all applicable federal, state, or local requi rements regarding utilities (water, sewer, power, and electricity) and construction within a utility ROW as to not exceed any acceptable limits; and Follow all applicable state and local one -call1 laws and procedures for buildouts. 16.1.2. Project -Type Specific BM Ps and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures beyond those listed above for all project types. 16.2. SOILS 16.2.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Implementation of the Proposed Action and alternatives could in clude potential construction - related impacts to soil resources resulting from ground disturbance activities. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential impacts from the proposed activities would be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its par tners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal, state and local requirements for soil erosion and sedimentation control and permitting to avo id or minimize erosion and sedimentation and restore disturbed soil; Minimize soil disturbance to the extent practicable;2 1 \"One call\" refers to the use of a single phone call to notify the utilities in the area of impending excavation activities. Often the utilities will go to the site and mark their lines (either with flags or paint) so that the excavation can avoid, if pos sible, damaging the utility equipment or disrupting service. 2 See Section 9.5, Wetlands, for a discussion of BMPs and mitigation measures in wetlands. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-5 Avoid construction in areas with steep (greater than 20 percent) or unstable slopes with soils known to be particularly susceptible to soil erosion and construct facilities in alternate locations if practical; Develop a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas, including the use of silt fences, fiber rolls, gravel bag berms, erosion control blankets,3 retention p onds, straw and sandbag barriers, and /or other controls as needed to reduce soil erosion, storm water runoff, and sedimentation; Minimize the area of bare soil at any one time as much as possible by constructing in stages; Revegetate disturbed areas , with native plants to the extent practicable, as progressively and quickly as practicable to achieve stabilization;4 For areas requiring plowing, remove and store topsoil with a woven weed barrier or similar material for post -construction site restoration; Cover exposed areas with tarps or similar materials to prevent exposure; Vehicles should stay on existing roads or previously disturbed areas to the maximum extent practicable; Use deep tillage procedures where practical to loosen compacted soils; Restore s oil surface to original or improved contours; Use timber mats or similar infrastructure, as deemed necessary, to distribute vehicle and heavy equipment weight; Minimize soil disturbance to the extent practicable, especially in wetland and designated natura l resource areas; Maintain topsoil by segregat ing topsoil or surface soil from subsurface layers and implementing temporary topsoil storage areas during construction ;5 Replace topsoil as soon as possible following construction; Use existing roads or previously disturbed areas to the maximum extent practicable ; Avoid construction activities resulting in soil disturbance during periods or months with heavy rainfall and snowmelt,6 to the extent possible; and Pay particular attention to areas identified as having soils that are vulnerable to compaction (see Affected Environment Soils sections) and select alternate locations to construct facilities if practical. 16.2.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specific BMPs and mitiga tion measures for soils beyond those listed above for all project types. 3 Silt fences are designed to trap sediment in the area where construction or soil disturbance is takin g place to minimize or avoid soil erosion and sedimentation. They are often 2 to 3 feet tall and are buried 8 to 12 inches into the soil with stakes. Er osion control blankets are biodegradable or synthetic sheet -like materials that are rolled out onto di sturbed areas to protect soil form wind and water erosion. 4 Plant roots play a significant role in stabilizing soils. Seeding disturbed areas quickly after construction activities woul d allow for faster plant and root development and would therefore pro vide better erosion protection. 5 Topsoil is segregated from subsoil layers by stripping the uppermost soil from the area being excavated and storing it separa tely from the subsurface soil. Once construction is completed, the topsoil is replaced as the up permost soil unit. 6 See Affected Environment Climate Change sections for an explanation of seasonal climate and weather patterns. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-6 16.3. GEOLOGY 16.3.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Environmental concerns regarding geology can be viewed as two distinct types, those that would potentially result in impacts to the project, such as seismic hazards, landslides, and volcanic activity, and those that would potentially be impacts from the project, such as land subsidence, mineral and fossil fuel resources, paleontological resources, and impacts to resources such as surface geology, bedrock, topography, physiography, and geomorphology. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, impacts associated with deployment or operational activities are anticipated to have less than significant impacts to geology. For those areas with the potential to encounter geologic hazards, FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the BMPs and mitigation measures listed below, to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for construction codes, seismic criteria, and geotechnical designs; Locate construction/deployment activities outside of high risk seismic hazard zones, active faults, and away from low coastal areas; Avoid construction in seismically a ctive areas, locations with karst topography or that have shown recent subsidence, or steep or unstable slopes that are susceptible to erosion; construct facilities in alternate locations if practical; Avoid, to the extent practicable, deployment in areas that undergo significant geomorphological changes, such as within streams and rivers; Design and deploy resilient infrastructure to withstand earthquakes typical to the region; Construct all infrastructure to standards that meet or exceed state seismic re quirements; Consider alternate methods to trenching for placement of fiber optic cable and transmission lines in sensitive areas ; Locate construction/deployment activities away from steep slopes with unconsolidated material and other areas prone to landsli des, to the extent practicable; and Locate construction/deployment activities outside of areas identified as having karst topography, loosely compacted soils, and low -density sediments prone to subsidence or compaction, to the extent practicable. For those areas with the potential to encounter mineral or fossil fuel resources, or paleontological resources, or impact surface geology, bedrock, topography, physiography, and geomorphology, FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the BMPs and mitigation measures listed below, to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal, sta te, and local requirements for mineral, fossil fuel, and paleontological resources; Avoid rock ripping to the extent practicable to preserve bedrock resources, topography, and physiography; Minimize the area/volume of disturbed/removed terrain during dep loyment/construction; Avoid areas with significant fossil resources, if practicable; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-7 Monitor deployment/construction activities and salvage fossils if areas with significant fossil resources cannot be avoided, to the extent practicable and in accordance wi th applicable laws and regulations; If paleontological resources are encountered on a project construction site, suspend all work until a certified paleontologist has been brought on -site to oversee project activities and ensure that fossil resources are h andled properly; Limit construction to areas that are not actively mined or undergoing mineral or other material or petroleum extraction activities, or coordinate deployment with mining and extraction activities (both existing and planned) in active areas; Restore topogra phic features and grades to pre -construction/deployment conditions; and Develop a Paleontological Monitoring and Mitigation Plan outlining areas with high likelihood for encountering significant fossil resources and plans for avoidance and appropriate resp onse if previously unknown resources are encountered. 16.3.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures for geology beyond those listed above for all project types . 16.4. WATER RESOURCES 16.4.1. BMPs and Mitiga tion Measures for All Project Types Implementation of the Proposed Action and alternatives could include potential deployment -and operation -related impacts to water resources resulting from ground disturbance activities, such as an increase in erosion or s edimentation near construction and staging areas. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential impacts to water resources from the proposed activities are expected to be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practi cable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Minimize ground disturbance in or near waterbodies during construction, as practicable, particularly in areas prone to erosion; Follow all applicable federa l, state, and local requirements for soil erosion and sedimentation control and permitting to avoid or minimize introduction of eroded materials into waterbodies; Development of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP); Include engineered or site d esigned methods to control storm water; For large -scale construction activities, implement storm water reduction methods, including minimizing impervious surfaces, using porous materials, or collecting and reusing storm water (e.g., extended detention pond s, storm water wetlands, filtration structures,7 and infiltration (or recharge) basins );8 7 Storm water filtration structures use a filtering media (sand, soil, gravel, peat, or compost) to remove pollutants from stor m water runoff. 8 Infiltration basins (also known as recharge basins) are considered a treatment BMP because they can remove pollu tants from surface discharges by capturing the storm water runoff volume (typically, larger volumes than an infiltration trench) and infiltrating it directly to the soil rather than discharging it to an aboveground drainage system. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-8 For large -scale construction activities, direct water to storm water drains, or to constructed bioretention,9 rain garden, or other storage and retention areas design ed to slow water and allow sediments to settle out; Minimize the total area of bare soil at any one time as much as possible by constructing in stages; Minimize clearing of riparian and streamside vegetation, including trees, as practicable; Establish and clearly mark all waterbody buffers in the field with signs or highly visible flagging until construction -related ground disturbing activities are complete; Stabilize and revegetate disturbed areas as progressively and quickly as practicable; Avoid construc tion of roads and other impervious surfaces in floodplain areas to the extent practicable, and where necessary in floodplains, construct roads and other impervious surfaces level with existing grades, as practicable, to not change or restrict water flow; Station all deployables and above ground structures outside of the 100 -year floodplain, to the extent practicable . If deployables or above ground structures must be placed in 100 -year floodplains, station them such that they are not vulnerable to be damage d by flood flows and do not themselves impede or restrict flood flows, as practicable; Restore native vegetation /wetlands to stabilize streambanks and stop erosion; If using directional bores to cross a stream, the length of the bore should include any forested riparian areas along the stream to minimize impacts to forested habitat; The cleared width through any forested area should be the minimum needed to install the line and no more than 20 feet wide through the forested area to allow the canopy to c lose over the line; Restore disturbed streambanks using bioengineering bank stabilization methods and revegetate disturbed banks with native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants; Ensure any development proposed in a floodway or floodplain meets or exceeds state or local regulations; Avoid construction, where feasible, in areas with steep or unstable slopes with soils known to be particularly susceptible to soil erosion and construct facilities in alternate locations if practical; Develop a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas, and implement BMPs, as appropriate, including the use of silt fences, erosion control blankets, and other controls as needed to reduce soil erosion, storm water runoff, and sedimentation; Avoid construction activities (especially activities resulting in soil disturbance), to the extent possible, during rainy or snowmelt seasons when streamflow, rainfall, and runoff are highest; Monitor site restoration following ground disturbance activities, as required by l aw or permit; implement contingency measures if site restoration should fail and soil erosion occurs; Retain vegetative buffers, wherever possible, to prevent runoff into waterbodies; Minimize in -stream work to the extent practicable , and when working in s treams, restore streambeds and banks to original contours ; 9 Bioretention is a stru ctural storm water control measure that captures and temporarily stores storm water runoff using soils and vegetation in shallow basins or landscaped areas to provide enhanced removal of dissolved storm water pollutants, including nutrients, pesticides, or ganics, metals, and biological constituents. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-9 Minimize the use of riprap and the use of alternative erosion protecti on materials whenever possible; Where riprap must be used, place only enough riprap to provide stream bank toe protection, such as from the toe of the bank, and consider using bioengineered bank stabilization methods instead of riprap ; Seed and protect disturbed stream banks that are 3:1 or steeper with heavy -duty net -free biodegradable erosion control blankets to minimize the en trapment and snaring of small wildlife such as snakes and turtles (follow manufacturer's recommendation for installation); seed and apply mul ch on all other disturbed areas; Construct all stream crossings (roads and trenching) as close as perpendicular to the axis of the waterbody channel as engineering and routing conditions permit; Use standard upland construction techniques when crossing of waterbodies when they are dry or frozen and not flowing or as required by permit or law, provided that it is not li kely for flow to resume during construction and prior to post -construction stabilization; Route the stream crossing to minimize the number of waterbody crossings where waterbodies meander or have multiple channels, as practicable; Inspect and maintain tank s and equipment containing oil, fuel, or chemicals for drips or leaks to prevent spills to the ground or directly into waterbodies; Maintain and repair all equipment and vehicles on impervious surfaces, as practicable, away from all sources of surface wate r; Park vehicles at least 50 feet from any stream or wetland unless authorized by a permit or on an existing roadway, as practicable; Prepare a Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan to prevent, contain, and report accidental spills; Design any structures located in floodplains, as feasible, with structural hardening to withstand flooding and to not increase the risk of flooding for other areas of the floodplain; Properly space and size culverts in accordance with federal, state, or local regulations; Stabilize approaches to streams and stream crossings with clean rock or steel plates during construction to minimize erosion and sedimentation, as practicable; Do not permit underwater blasting and pile driving activities in any waterbody; Place materials storage and staging areas outside of waterways and floodplains; Deposit and stabilize all excavated material not reused in an upland area outside of floodplains and streams; and If in-stream construction (trenching or roads) must be conducte d during times that streams have flow, maintain adequate waterbody flow rates to protect aquatic life, and prevent the interruption of existing downstream users, as practicable. 16.4.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specif ic BMPs and mitigation measures for geology beyond those listed above for all project types.

Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15 the deployment and operational activities are expected to have less than significant impacts on wetlands. FirstNet and/or its partners w ould require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal, state, and local requirements related to potential wetland impacts and permitting to avoid or minimize potential wetland impacts, compensate for unavoidable impacts to wetlands, and restore impacted wetlands; Follow all BMPs and mitigation measures related to minimizing soil erosion, sedimentation, and soil compaction presented in Section 9.2, Soils; Conduct a detailed baseline study of the wetland to be impacted, if impacts to a specific wetland are unavoidable, to aid in r estoration of pre -impact condition, including, as appropriate or required by law, a survey of wetland contours; soil texture and profile; plant species, structure, and cover; and hydrology; Develop a n SWPPP; Prepare a Spill Prevention, Control, and Counte rmeasure (SPCC) Plan to prevent, contain, and report accidental spills; Ensure that soil erosion and sediment controls are properly installed and maintained; Clearly mark the boundaries of wetland areas to be avoided during construction using flagging, and maintain markers until reclamation is complete (as applicable). Train equipment operators on the activities to avoid within or near wetlands; Segregate and salvage all topsoil up to a maximum of 12 inches of topsoil from the area disturbed in dry wetland s, where practicable, and restore topsoil to its approximate original stratum after backfilling is complete; Avoid temporarily storing or stockpiling materials in wetland areas or in areas that could alter wetland hydrology (causing damming and flooding) o r impede or divert water (causing drying). When unavoidable, place temporary fill on geotextile fabric; Minimize vegetation clearing in or near wetlands. If vegetation clearing is required, minimize ground disturbance and maintain low groundcover vegetat ion, as well as the roots of taller vegetation; When construction is unavoidable, time construction to outside the breeding and migratory seasons of wetland wildlife; When construction is unavoidable, time construction activities to the low flow period, as defined by the USACE general permit, or to when the soil is frozen; Preserve existing tree canopies and natural areas in and around wetlands as much as possible; When cutting wetland vegetation is unavoidable, complete the work by hand (chain or hand saw) instead of using large equipment; Use timber mats when working in or near wetlands; Avoid both above and belowground wetland crossings; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-11 When crossing a wetland is unavoidable, take advantage of already disturbed areas such as easements, roads, roadway sho ulders, bridges, or old railroad beds; Span wetlands by locating telecommunication poles on either side of the wetland, instead of disturbing the interior , as practicable and feasible ; Avoid diversion of surface water and groundwater sources, which could a ffect nearby wetlands; Prohibit use of herbicides or pesticides within 100 feet of any wetland (unless allowed or required by the appropriate land management, tribal, or federal, state, or local agency); Conduct post -construction monitoring inspections after the first growing season to determine success of revegetation, as applicable, unless otherwise required by a permit; Include engineered or site designed methods to control storm water; Create and maintain buffer zones around wetlands to protect thei r functions and values; Develop management plans such as, but not limited to, wetland and vegetation management and restoration, water quality protection, and erosion and sediment control plans for the management of wetland habitat, vegetation, water quali ty, and soils/erosion control; Follow any BMPs and mitigation measures for work in or near wetlands developed by federal, state and local agencies, such as state departments of transportation; Position deployment activities to avoid wetlands to the greate st extent practicable and to minimize the project footprint while safely and practically implementing the Proposed Action; Install and maintain sediment barriers, as appropriate, at saturated wetlands or wetlands with standing water across the entire const ruction ROW upslope of the wetland boundary and where saturated wetlands or wetlands with standing water are adjacent to the construction ROW as necessary to prevent sediment flow into the wetland; When construction within wetlands is unavoidable, time use of heavy equipment to avoid periods of heavy moisture, as appropriate; Where practicable, do not maintain, store, wash, or repair equipment in or near (within 100 feet of) wetland areas to avoid spills or contamination; Where practicable, do not use heavy equipment within wetlands, even temporarily, and do not travel through wetlands; Use wide -tracked, or low -ground pressure construction equipment and/or conventional equipment operating from the ROW, timber mats, or pre fabricated equipment mats.

Use existing access roads whenever possible; Where construction is required, maintain natural drainage patterns to the extent practi cable by installing culverts in sufficient number and size to prevent ponding, diversion, or concentrated runoff; Use gravel for road surfaces where possible to avoid an increase in permeable surfaces and use proper drainage structures to minimize sedime ntation and erosion to adjacent wetlands; Consult local wetland restoration guidance, including communicating with local agency and other wetland and restoration scientists. Use suggested up -to-date published restoration manuals to ensure that appropriate wetland restoration measures are followed and to increase restoration success; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-12 In areas where wetlands would be restored, stockpile wetland topsoil and sod mats removed during installation using standard reclamation protocol. Re -use the topsoil and sod m ats in the post -construction wetland restoration; Revegetate, as applicable, bare areas as progressively and quickly as possible (preferably within the same growing season) to stabilize soils, reduce sedimentation, and avoid the spread of invasive species . Install erosion protection and leave in place until the area is revegetated and the soil is stabilized; and Determine restoration to be successful if the surface condition is similar to adjacent undisturbed communities or found acceptable by the applica ble regulatory body. 16.5.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply to Wired Projects in addition to those listed above for all project types: New Build - Buried Fiber Optic Plant o Avoi d, as appropriate, stockpiling material from directional drilling in a wetland, or where the stockpile could cause sedimentation into a wetland or dam water, causing flooding of a wetland area; avoid, as appropriate, setting up drilling equipment in a wetland; o Conduct dewatering in a manner to prevent erosion and to prevent heavily silt -laden water from flowing directly into any wetland or waterbody if dewatering an excavation; o Replace topsoil and restore original contours to the greatest extent practicable ; o Install buried cable along existing road ROWs wherever possible to minimize vegetation clearing and other potential impacts to wetlands; and o Use structures or devices to prevent subdraining or groundwater movement along new trenched -in buried conduit suc h as anti -seepage collars, intermittent clay barriers, trench plugs, or clay saddles. New Build - Aerial Fiber Optic Plant o Install overhead transmission lines along existing road ROWs wherever possible to minimize vegetation clearing and other potential im pacts to wetlands .

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES The potential for impacts to biological resources, including terrestrial vegetation, wildlife, fisheries and aquatic habitats, and threatened or endangered species, could occur through activities such as land clearing, excavation activities, cons truction, or operation of ground -based and aerial vehicles. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, impacts to biological resources Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-13 associated with deployment and operation of the Proposed Action are expected to be less than significant; however, poten tial impacts to threatened and endangered species are expected to be less than significant with the incorporation of BMPs and mitigation measures. 16.6.1. Terrestrial Vegetation 16.6.1.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts to terrestrial vegetation: Engage in early consultation with appropriate agencies and stakeholders, including but not limited to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and state agencies; Follow all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for vegetation removal, disturbance, and restoration; Avoid construction/deployment in areas with sensitive vegetation (i.e., woodlots and wetlands) , unique habitat (i.e., shorelines and streambanks) , or designated natural resources, if practicable; Consolidate facilities as much as possible (collocation and use of existing ROWs) to reduce vegetation loss; Avoid high -quality habitat;10 Contro l the spread of invasive plants and animals by inspecting and cleaning equipment and vehicles before moving from one deployment site to another; Identify all areas within the proposed construction footprint that contain noxious or invasive plants and use p re-construction treatments such as mowing or herbicide applications (in consultation with appropriate agencies and stakeholders) prior to ground disturbance activities; Minimize land clearing and vegetation disturbance by using existing roads and unvegetat ed areas, when feasible, during deployment activities; Restore disturbed areas as progressively and quickly as possible to pre -construction use and vegetation cover using appropriate and certified seed mixes and seed dispersal, management, and maintenance processes, as applicable; Minimize or avoid removal of native vegetation (forest, sage brush, grassland, etc.) whenever possible; Close and revegetate any temporary and unnecessary roads after completion of the project; Obtain all appropriate permits and comply with permit conditions to minimize or avoid impacts to vegetation; Revegetate disturbed areas as progressively and proactively as possible to minimize impacts associated with vegetation loss; 10 High quality and disturbed habitats are described as follows: Professional biologists can typically provide a basic assessme nt of the quality of the site based on one or more site visits. Private consultants can also evaluate habitat quality through a standardized assessment tool, the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA). This assessment will provide a quantitative assessment score. The FQA rates sites on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being the highest quality. D isturbed habitats generally contain non -native, invasive species; extremely low plant diversity; are under regular maintenance; and area small and surrounded by unsuitable habitat. High quality habitats contain much the opposite: high plant diversity; low numbers of non -native, invasive plants; are left in a natural state; and have high quality plants or ones that are very valuable to wildlife.

BMPs and Mitiga tion Measures for All Project Types FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts to wildlife: Engage in early consultation with appropriate agencies and stakeholders as necessary, including but not limited to USFWS, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and other relevant federal or state wildlife and natural resources agencies; Follow guidelin es outlined by the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee and USFWS (APLIC, 2012) for any aboveground lines or cables (e.g., use of diverters); Implement seasonal and spatial buffer zones around sensitive areas for deploymen t and maintenance activities, where possible, as recommended by USFWS and state wildlife and natural resources agencies; Implement the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (USFWS, 2007) ; Assess locations of roost sites for bats and timing of critical life stages (e.g., maternity and weaning periods) and hibernation for deployment and associated activities (these times vary greatly depending on region, species, and habitat); Avoid construction/deployment in areas with sensit ive vegetation, unique habitat, or designated natural resources, if practical; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-15 Avoid Important Bird Areas (IBAs) and other known important bird habitats to the maximum extent practicable; Minimize or avoid the need for or use of sodium vapor lights at sit e facilities to reduce attraction of migratory birds; Turn off all unnecessary lighting at night . If nighttime lighting is required use motion sensor security lights that are activated as needed ; Install nest exclusion devices on existing or new structure s to discourage nest construction and use ; Avoid known marine mammal haulouts or concentration areas for deployment and associated activities; Assess critical life stages of marine mammals in haulouts within 1 mile of deployment and associated activities; Provide for passage of fish and wildlife in new crossings and avoid reducing the efficiency of a structure to allow passage; Avoid roads and rights -of-way that provide access to critical wildlife habitat, and near known migration routes (especially terr estrial and semi -aquatic wildlife routes), stopover sites, and large blocks of habitat; Consolidate facilities as much as possible (collocation and use of existing ROWs) to reduce potential habitat loss; Minimize construction of all roads, fences, and othe r ancillary facilities to reduce overall vegetation loss and habitat fragmentation; Restore habitat in construction zones, staging areas, etc. once construction is complete; Control the spread of invasive animals and plants by inspecting and cleaning equip ment and vehicles before moving from one deployment site to another, coordinating mowing schedules and assisting agencies and groups with ROW permits, washing mowers and equipment between sites, and educating staff; Develop \"good housekeeping\" procedures t o ensure that sites would be kept clean of debris, garbage, and fugitive trash or waste during operation , including microtrash ; Develop monitoring programs and adaptive management strategies; Avoid development in areas that contain high densities of breed ing or wintering birds, in high wildlife use areas, migratory staging areas, woodlots, riparian corridors, Audubon Important Bird Areas, Nature Preserves, State and National Parks, State Forests, Fish and Wildlife Areas, and other publicly owned properties ; To reduce habitat fragmentation, minimize the number of new roads constructed.

Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-16 Minimize vehicular harm of animals migrating between seasonal habitats by locating activities, roads, and infrastructure away from these areas , consider ing a reduction of speed limits, or installing barriers along roadsides; Do not permit pets on site in order to avoid harassment and disturbance of wildlife; Follow food and waste management protocols to minimize attractants to proposed network deployment sites; Where mowing is required for site maintenance, require a minimum mower height of 18 inches to reduce potential mortality to tortoises and snakes; Report observations of potential wildlife interactions, including wildlife mortality, to the appropria te agency immediately; Store soil containing noxious or invasive plants that are awaiting proper disposal in a location away from clean topsoil and subsoil; Use existing roads and regularly maintained areas when conducting routine maintenance and inspectio ns to the extent feasible; Use site -appropriate native plants and invasive -free materials (e.g., seed mixes, rock, mulch, soil) for revegetation and restoration efforts; Limit construction equipment and vehicles to approved roads or ROWs ; and Additional t ower lighting BMPs are described in Section 16.6.2.2, Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures (below) . 16.6.2.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply in addition to those list ed above for all project types: Wired Projects o New Build - Aerial Fiber Optic Plant Install bat exclusions and/or deterrents on existing and new structures. Follow recommendations and guidelines outlined by the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee and US FWS (APLIC, 2006) (APLIC and USFWS, 2005) (APLIC, 2012) for any aboveground lines or cables (e.g., use of diverters and anti - nesting devices). Wireless Projects o New Wireless Communication Towers Site towers away from known communal bat use areas and high bird use areas to the extent practicable or feasible. Where practicable or feasible, located towers more than three miles from any ocean or Great Lake shoreline. If towers are closer than three miles to the shoreline, there should be: site -specific studies and a preference for self -standing (un -guyed) towers that are short enough to not require lighting. If towers are closer than three miles to the shoreline and sufficiently tall to require lighting, there should be: site -specific studies; and a preference for self -standing (un - guyed) towers with lighting that does not include steady -burning lights. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-17 Follow updated FAA lighting requirements to eliminate steady -burning, flashing obstruction lights and use only flashing obstruction lights (FAA, 2016a) . Implement guidance contained in the FCC notice \"Opportunities to Reduce Bird Collisions with Communications Towers While Reducing Tower Lighting Costs\" (FCC, 2017) . Follow guidelines outlined by USFWS for Communication Tower Design, Siting, Construction, Operation, Retrofitting, and Decommissioning (USFWS, 2013a) : 1. Collocation of the communications equipment on an existing communication tower or other structure (e.g., billboard, water and transmission tower, distribution pole, or building mount) is strongly recommended. Depending on tower load factors and communicat ion needs, anywhere from 6 to 10 providers should collocate on an existing tower or structure, provided that frequencies do not overlap/'bleed' or where frequency length or broadcast distance requires higher towers. New towers should be designed structura lly and electronically to accommodate the applicant's antenna, and antennas of at least two additional users \u2014ideally 6 to 10 additional users, if possible \u2014unless the design would require the addition of lights and/or guy wires to an otherwise unlit and/or unguyed tower. This recommendation is intended to reduce the number of towers needed in the future. 2. If collocation is not feasible and a new tower or towers are to be constructed, it is strongly recommended that the new tower(s) should be not more than 19 9 feet above ground level (AGL), and that construction techniques should not require guy wires. Such towers should be unlighted if Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations and lighting standards permit (FAA, 2007) (Patterson, J., 2012) .12 Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), through recent rulemaking, now requires that new towers > 450 ft AGL contain no red - steady lights. FCC also recommends that new tower s 350 -450 ft AGL also contain no red -steady lights, and that new towers < 350 ft AGL convert non - flashing lights to flash with existing flashing lights. LED lights are being suggested as replacements for all new construction and for retrofits, with the intent of future synchronizing of the flashes. Given these dynamics, the Service recommends using lattice tower or monopole structures for all towers < 200 ft AGL and for taller towers where feasible. The Service considers the < 200 ft AGL option the 'gold standard' and suggests that this is the environmentally preferred industry standard for tower placement, construction, and operation \u2014 i.e., towers that are unlit, unguyed, monopole or lattice, and less than 200 ft AGL. 3. If constructing multiple towers, the cumulative impacts of all the towers to migratory birds \u2014especially to Birds of Conservation Concern (USFWS, 2008) and threatened and endangered species, as well as the impacts of each individual tower, should be considered during the development of a project. 12 Current FAA guidance (USFWS, 2012) requires lighting for towers greater than 200 feet. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-18 4. The topography of the proposed tower site and surrounding habitat should be clearly noted, especially in regard to surrounding hills, mountains, mountain passes, ridge lines, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and other habitat t ypes used by raptors, Birds of Conservation Concern, state and federally listed species, and other birds of concern. Active raptor nests, especially those of Bald and Golden Eagles, should be noted, including known or suspected distances from proposed tow er sites to nest locations. Nest site locations for Golden Eagles may vary between years, and unoccupied, inactive nests and nest sites may be re -occupied over multiple years. The Service's 2013 Eagle Conservation Plan Guidance, Module 1, Land -based Wind Energy, Version 2, available on our website, is a useful document (USFWS, 2013b) . 5. If at all possible, new towers should be sited within existing 'antenna farms' (i.e., clusters of towers), in degraded areas (e.g., strip mines or other heavily industrialized areas), in commercial agricultural lands, in Superfund sites, or other areas whe re bird habitat is poor or marginal. Towers should not be sited in or near wetlands, other known bird concentration areas (e.g., state of federal refuges, staging areas, rookeries, and Important Bird Areas), in known migratory, daily movement flyways, are as of breeding concentration, in habitat of threatened or endangered species, or key habitats for Birds of Conservation Concern (USFWS, 2008) . Disturbance can result in effects to bird populations, which may cumulatively a ffect their survival. The Service has recommended some disturbance -free buffers, e.g., 0.5 mi around raptor nests during the nesting season, and 1 -mi disturbance free buffers for Ferruginous Hawks and Bald Eagles during nesting season in Wyoming (USFWS WY Ecological Services Field Office, referenced in Manville 2007:23 The effects of towers grouse,' 'sage grouse,' and grassland and shrub -steppe bird species should also be considered since tall structures have been shown to result in abandonm ent of nest site areas and leks, especially for 'prairie grouse' (Manville, A., 2004) . The issue of buffers is currently under review, especially for Bald and Golden Eagles. Additionally, towers should not be site d in areas with a high incidence of fog, mist, and low cloud ceilings. 6. If taller (> 199 ft AGL) towers requiring lights for aviation safety must be constructed, the minimum amount of pilot warning and obstruction avoidance lighting required by the FAA shou ld be used.13 Unless otherwise required by the FAA, only white strobe or red strobe lights (red preferable since it is generally less displeasing to the human eye at night), or red flashing incandescent lights should be used at night, and these should be t he minimum number, minimum intensity (< 2,000 candela), and minimum number of flashes per minute (i.e., longest duration between flashes/'dark phase') allowable by the FAA. The use of solid (non -flashing) warning lights at night should be avoided (Patterson, J., 2012) 13 This guidance was based on earlier FAA guidance that has since been updated (USFWS, 2013c) . Current FAA guidance (FAA, 2015) now requires lighting for towers greater than 200 feet. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-19 (Gehring et al., 2009) \u2014see recommendation #2 above. Current research indicates that solid (non-flashing) red lights attract night -migrating birds at a much higher rate than flashing lights (Gehring et al., 2009) (Manville, A., 2009) . Recent research indicates that use of white strobe, red strobe, or red flashing lights alone provides significant reductions in bird fatalities (Patterson, J., 2012) (Gehring et al., 2009) . 7. Tower designs using guy wires for support, which are proposed to be located in known raptor or waterbird concentrations are as, daily movement routes, major diurnal migratory bird movement routes, staging areas, or stopover sites, should have daytime visual markers or bird deterrent devices installed on the wires to prevent collisions by these diurnally moving species. The eff icacy of bird deterrents on guy wires to alert night migrating species has yet to be scientifically validated. For guidance on markers, see Avian Power Line Interaction Committee (APLIC). 2006 . Suggested Practices for Avian Protection on Power Lines -- State of the Art in 2006. Edison Electric Institute, APLIC, and the California Energy Commission. Washington, DC, and Sacramento, CA. 207 pp, and APLIC. 2012. Reducing Avian Collisions with Power Lines -- the State of the Art in 2012. Edison Electric Institu te and APLIC. Washington, DC. 159 pp. Also see www.aplic.org, www.energy.ca.gov, or call 202 -508-5000. 8. Towers and appendant facilities should be designed, sited, and constructed so as to avoid or minimize habitat loss within and adjacent to the tower 'foo tprint.' However, a larger tower footprint is preferable to the use of guy wires in construction. Several shorter, un -guyed towers are preferable to one tall guyed, lighted tower. Road access and fencing should be minimized to reduce or prevent habitat fragmentation, disturbance, the creation of barriers, and to reduce above ground obstacles to birds in flight. 9. If it has been determined prior to tower design, siting and construction that a significant number of breeding, feeding and roosting birds \u2014especi ally Birds of Conservation Concern (USFWS, 2008) , state or federally -listed bird species, and eagles \u2014are known to habitually use the proposed tower construction area, relocation to an alternate site is highly recommended. If this is not an option, seasonal restrictions on construction are advised in order to avoid disturbance, site and nest abandonment, especially during breeding, rearing and other periods of high bird activity. 10. Security lighting for on -ground facilities, e quipment and infrastructure should be motion - or heat -sensitive, down -shielded, and of a minimum intensity to reduce nighttime bird attraction and eliminate constant nighttime illumination, while still allowing safe nighttime access to the site (Manville, 2011) (USFWS, 2012) . 11. Representatives from the USFWS or researchers from the Research Subcommittee of the Communication Tower Working Group should be allowed access to the site to evaluate bird use; conduct dead -bird searches; place above ground net catchments below the towers (USFWS, 2000) ; and to perform studies using radar, Global Position System, infrared, thermal imagery, and acoustical Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-20 monitoring, as necessary. This will allow for assessment and verification of bird movements, site use, avoidan ce, and mortality. The goal is to acquire information on the impacts of various tower types, sizes, configurations, and lighting protocols. 12. Towers no longer in use, not re -licensed by the FCC for use, or determined to be obsolete should be removed from th e site within 12 months of cessation of use, preferably sooner. 13. In order to obtain information on the usefulness of these guidelines in preventing bird strikes and better understanding impacts from habitat fragmentation, please advise USFWS personnel of th e final location and specifications of the proposed tower, and which measures recommended in these guidelines were implemented. If any of these recommended measures cannot be implemented, please explain why they are not feasible. This will further advise USFWS in identifying any recurring problems with the implementation of the guidelines, which may necessitate future modifications. Follow the FAA requirements to eliminate steady -burning flashing obstruction lights and use only flashing obstruction lights in accordance with FAA Advisory Circulars AC 70/7460 -1L and . o Collocation on Existing Wireless Tower, St ructure, or Building Follow the FAA requirements to eliminate steady -burning flashing obstruction lights and use only flashing obstruction lights in accordance with FAA Advisory Circulars AC 70/7460 -1L and (FCC, 2017) . Deployable Technologies o Avoid activities within migratory bird flyways and in the immediate vicinity of bat roosts to the extent practicable ; o Do not operate aircraft at an altitude that could disturb known natural roosting sites of bats, with the only exception being severe weather conditions; o Do not operate aircraft at an altitude lower than 1,500 feet within 0.5 mile of known calving/lambing a reas during critical life stages, with the exception only for severe weather conditions; and o Do not operate aircraft at an altitude lower than 1,500 feet within 0.5 mile of known seal haulouts observed on land, with the exception only for severe weather c onditions. 16.6.3. Fisheries and Aquatic Habitats 16.6.3.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts to fisheries and aquatic habitats: Engage in early consultation with appropriate agencies and stakeholders, including but not limited to USFWS, NMFS, and other relevant federal or state wildlife and natural resources agencies; Follow all applicable federal a nd state requirements for construction activities near/in fish and fish habitat; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-21 Establish buffers around sensitive areas (e.g., nesting sites, wetlands); Avoid construction, as practicable, during sensitive seasons for fish such as migration, spawning, eg g development (including intra -gravel development) and larval fish (benthic or pelagic)14 development (sensitive seasons/time periods vary by species and location); Avoid construction/deployment, as practicable, in productive riparian zones, marine preserv es, and wetlands since construction could potentially result is less refuge for fish, fundamental changes in channel structure (e.g., loss of pool habitats), instability of stream banks, and alteration of nutrient and prey sources within the shoreline aqua tic community (Hansen, Halvey, & Strach, 2013) ; Avoid physical barriers in waterbodies, to the extent practicable, during installation and operation to allow for the migration of invertebrates and other aquatic fauna; Avoid pro ductive habitats to the extent practicable, such as coastal wetlands, inland waterways, essential fish habitats, spawning areas, and reefs; Consolidate facilities as much as possible; Control the spread of invasive plants and animals by inspecting and clea ning equipment and vehicles before moving from one deployment site to another; Implement an emergency response plan for fuel spills and environmental emergencies; Implement invasive species plans to minimize introduced aquatic plant and animal species into the Proposed Action areas (i.e., wash and inspect equipment and vehicles before moving from one drainage basin or watershed to the next); Include secondary containment for hazardous materials such as fuels and use uplands, as feasible, away from streams a nd waterbodies for refueling of construction or operations equipment; Instruct all construction employees to avoid harassment and disturbance of fish and other aquatic species, and report any signs of mortality to the appropriate agency immediately; Minimi ze construction noise in and near fish habitats, as practicable; Avoid vegetation removal or siting projects in areas in areas with poor bank or shoreline stability to minimize the potential for erosion and sedimentation; Minimize sedimentation and turbidi ty in fish habitats by implementing sediment and erosion control measures, as practicable; the use of such measures (e.g., silt fences, silt curtains,15 and erosion control blankets) could reduce erosion and sedimentation; Minimize the amount of fill place d in wetlands and streams when constructing access roads by installing bridges and or culverts. Use culverts and bridges that are appropriately designed and sized for fish passage; Revegetate and restore riparian areas and other vegetated areas around aqu atic resources to the extent possible once construction activities are complete; Use set -backs when clearing vegetation for construction, where appropriate, from riparian zones to avoid removal of important fish cover such as vegetation boulders, and large woody debris; 14 Inhabiting the water column as opposed to being associated with the sea floor; generally occurring anywhere from the surface to 1,000 meters (NOAA, 2006) . 15 Silt curtains are floating barriers used in marine construction and remediation to control silt and sediment in a body of water. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-22 Use site -appropriate native plants and invasive -free materials (e.g., seed mixes, rock, mulch, soil) for revegetation and restoration efforts; Perform regular maintenance checks of equipment near protected areas to minimize detachment of co mponents reaching critical habitat by tidal flow; and Report spills or other observed pollutants to the appropriate agency immediately. 16.6.3.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply to Wired Projects in addition to those listed above for all project types: New Build - Buried Fiber Optic Plant o Use horizontal directional drilling where possible and appropriate, for stream crossings to avoid potential impacts to the streambed, banks, and as sociated fish habitat.

Threatened and Endangered Species 16.6.4.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types To avoid or minimize potential effects of deployment activities to threatened and endangered species, BMPs and mitigation measures, as defined through consultation with the appropriate resource agency, would be implemented. Additional BMPs and mitigation measures, listed below, may be implemented as appropriate to further minimize potential impacts: Engage in early consulta tion with appropriate agencies and stakeholders including, but not limited to, USFWS, NMFS, and other relevant federal, or state wildlife and natural resources agencies; Follow all applicable federal and state requirements for construction activities near /in fish and fish habitat; Avoid conducting deployment activities in areas with known locations or habitats for threatened and endangered plants; Avoid activities within seagrass beds and control turbidity to minimize potential indirect impacts on seagrass ; Avoid potential impacts within coastal estuarine habitats; Use appropriate sediment and erosion control measures to minimize sedimentation and turbidity in fish habitats; Use setbacks from riparian zones when clearing vegetation for construction to avoid removal of important fish cover such as vegetation boulders and large woody debris; Consolidate facilities as much as possible (collocation and use of existing ROWs) to reduce potential habitat loss; Avoid removal or disturbance of native vegetation (fore st, sage brush, grassland, etc.) to the maximum extent practicable and ensure that any unavoidable forest impacts do not result in the loss of listed snails, butterflies, bird breeding habitat, or bat roost sites or hibernacula;16 Minimize construction of a ll roads, fences, and other ancillary facilities to reduce overall habitat fragmentation; Establish buffers around habitat areas, whenever possible, due to the limited range for some federally listed species; Implement seasonal and spatial buffer zones f or operational activities that involve potentially disturbing activities in listed species use areas; Implement seasonal and spatial buffer zones for construction and other potentially disturbing activities during sensitive periods for listed species such as breeding, nesting, calving/pupping, haulout, migration, spawning, and egg development as identified by USFWS, NMFS, and/or other relevant federal or state agencies; Avoid bat roosting areas, particularly maternity roost colonies, during critical life s tages for deployment and associated activities (i.e., approximately April to November); Avoid or minimize the use of sodium vapor lights at site facilities to reduce attraction of migratory birds; 16 Hibernacula are the habitats within which animals hibernate or otherwise seek refuge for extended perio ds. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-24 Implement invasive species plans to minimize introduced a quatic plant and animal species into the areas affected by the Proposed Action (i.e., wash and inspect equipment and vehicles before moving from one drainage basin or watershed to the next); Control the spread of invasive plants and animals by inspecting a nd cleaning equipment and vehicles on an impervious surface before moving from one deployment site to another; Develop and implement operational monitoring and adaptive management procedures; Follow food and waste management protocols to minimize attractan ts to the deployment site; Implement \"good housekeeping\" procedures to ensure that during operation the sites would be kept clean of debris, garbage, and fugitive trash or waste , including microtrash ; Implement a strict policy prohibiting pets on site and prohibiting hunting or fishing or any other action that would result in any avoidable disturbance of listed species; Implement an emergency response plan for fuel spills and environmental emergencies; Include secondary containment for hazardous materials and use non -wetland sites away from streams and waterbodies for refueling of construction or operations equipment; Instruct all employees involved in construction/deployment activities to identify and report any sightings of listed species, to avoid haras sment and disturbance of wildlife, and to not disturb or enter any nearby caves or mines; Minimize the use of coastal lighting, particularly in the vicinity of known turtle nesting areas.

Project -Type Specifi c BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply in addition to those listed above for all project types: Wired Projects o New Build - Aerial Fiber Optic Plant Follow guidelines outlined by the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee and USFWS (APLIC, 2012) for any above -ground lines or cables (e.g., use of diverters) or other structures (e.g., perch and nest diverters). Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-25 o Collocation on Existing Aerial Fiber Optic Plant Follow guidelines outlined by the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee and USFWS (APLIC, 2012) for any above -ground lines or cables (e.g., use of diverters) or other structures (e.g., perch and nest diverters). o Use of Existing Bu ried or Aerial Fiber Optic Plant or Existing Submarine Cable Minimize underwater construction noise in all aquatic habitats by minimizing vessel speed, using quieter equipment or technologies, or deploying bubble curtains or other noise screens during unde rwater work; and Implement a marine observer program during construction and operation to avoid and minimize boat strikes. Wireless Projects o New Wireless Communication Towers Follow guidelines outlined by USFWS for Communication Tower Design, Siting, Const ruction, Operation, Retrofitting, and Decommissioning (USFWS, 2013a) mentioned above in Section 9.6.2, Wildlife. Deployable Technologies o Restrict aircraft operation at altitudes lower than 1,500 feet within 0.5 mile of kn own pupping or haulout areas during critical life stages, with the exception only for severe weather conditions; and o Keep aircraft above altitudes higher than 1,500 feet within 0.5 mile of seals hauled out on land, with the exception only for severe weathe r conditions. 16.7. LAND USE, RECREATION , AND AIRSPACE 16.7.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Implementation of the Proposed Action and alternatives could include potential deployment - and operation -related impacts to land use, recreation, and airspace resulting from activities including the construction or installation of infrastructure, or deploy ment of deployable assets. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential impacts from the proposed activities are expected to be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Land Use o Follow applicable federal, state, and local land use plans and policies to ensure compatibility with existing and surrounding land uses; o Follow and comply with applicable existing zoning re quirements to ensure compatibility with existing and surrounding land uses; o Contact appropriate agencies, property owners, and other stakeholders early in the planning process to identify potentially sensitive land uses and land use issues and concerns spe cific to the region; o Sign areas, access roads, and/or easements that would require temporary closure or limited access to accommodate certain land uses; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-26 o Schedule construction activities, where feasible, to minimize impacts to existing and surrounding land uses; o Utilize existing roads, ROWs, easements, and utility corridors to the maximum extent feasible and to minimize the number of new access roads; o Give preference to development options that involve use of existing physical infrastructure, and/or that do not involve new aboveground structures (e.g., collocation on existing structures, new buried or undersea infrastructure, etc.), especially near recreation lands; o Select infrastructure locations that are screened from view by topography and/or vegetation, that do not require noticeable permanent changes in landforms (e.g., cut and fill) or vegetation, and that are as far from surrounding residences as possible; o Avoid or minimize, as practicable and feasible, construction activities in areas covered by exist ing incompatible easements; o Retain existing vegetation wherever possible to provide visual screening of new infrastructure; and o Select infrastructure designs that minimize contrast with the surrounding landscape and land uses. Recreation o Contact appropriat e agencies, property owners, and other stakeholders early in the planning process to identify recreation activities specific to the region and their respective seasons; o Sign areas, access roads, and/or recreation trails that would require temporary closure , limited access, or detours to accommodate certain recreation activities; o Schedule deployment activities, where feasible, to not interfere with seasonal recreation activities; o Utilize existing roads, ROWs, easements, and utility corridors to the maximum e xtent feasible and to minimize the number of new access road; o Complete deployment activities with minor, temporary impacts to recreation resources during periods or seasons of low use; o Give preference to infrastructure locations that are compatible with e xisting park or recreation planning documents; o Complete deployment activities, to the extent practicable, outside of and away from existing recreation locations; and o Select infrastructure locations that are as far from recreation lands as possible. Airsp ace o Follow all applicable federal, state, and local requirements for preservation of the airspace to avoid or minimize reducing existing capacity, decreasing safety, negatively impacting current operations, or increasing the risk to airspace users or perso ns and property; Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-27 o To the extent practicable, avoid deploying and operating wired and wireless sources near airports/facilities that trigger the need for an OE/AAA by the FAA based on height and airport elevation criteria; and o For new construction, prepare site plans with sufficient detail to assess potential impacts to special use areas, restricted airspace, and general and military aviation. 16.7.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply in addition to those listed above for all project types: Wireless Projects o New Wireless Communication Towers Select the shortest possible structures necessary to meet the FirstNet system's needs, and only deploy towers less than 200 feet in height whereve r possible; Place new infrastructure near existing similar infrastructure where possible, to minimize the total number of new aerial navigation hazards; Work closely with the National Park Service (NPS) to address any concerns they might have if a tower needs to be placed in an area that might affect the nighttime sky at an NPS unit; Avoid placing new infrastructure near airports or the areas regulated under the FAA's Part 77 regulations (FAA, 2016a) ; and Avoid placing new infrastructure within Military Operations Areas or under Military Training Routes unless coordinated with the relevant military unit. Deployable Technologies o Coordinate early with FAA on aerial deployable technologies (flying unmanned aerial systems [UAS] an d balloon launches) to establish procedures that are in place prior to the need to use these technologies during emergency response events; and o Limit the use of Deployable Airborne Communications Architecture to areas less likely to be used by commercial, military, or private aviation (to the degree feasible, and in consultation with the FAA and Department of Defense). 16.8. VISUAL RESOURCES 16.8.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Implementation of the Proposed Action could result in impacts to visual resources through the construction of towers, structures, roads, or other permanent features, as well as the installation of security or aviation lighting. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, impacts to most visual resources associated with the deployment and operation of the Proposed Action are expected to be less than significant; however, impacts to night skies in rural areas are expected to be less than significant with the incorporation of BMPs and mitigation measures. FirstNet and/or its part ners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-28 Proposed design should take into account the scenic character of the surrounding area to reasonably minimize or avoid visual im pacts to the surrounding area when viewed from existing roadways or shorelines (design structures to complement the natural landscape; for example, use paint that blends with the surrounding landscape); Utilize non-reflecting coatings to towers, antennas, buildings, and associated structures where possible; Implement sensitive grading techniques that blend with the natural terrain; Treat all disturbed slopes for erosion control; Where appropriate, use vegetation as screens to block views of structures and r oadways; Minimize the area of bare soil at any one time as much as possible by constructing in stages; Revegetate disturbed areas as progressively and quickly as practicable to restore vegetative cover; Reduce or eliminate the need for lighting on poles or structures, or restrict the duration and directionality of needed lighting; Give preference to development options that involve use of existing physical infrastructure (e.g., collocation on existing structures, new buried or undersea infrastructure, etc.), and specifically avoid the construction of new aerial fiber optic plant and/or new wireless communication towers within or in locations within sight of federal or other lands where visual resources are regulated (e.g., units of the National Park Sys tem, or areas where local zoning regulations emphasize protection of views or aesthetic conditions), or where residents and visitors have come to expect high visual quality and the absence of human -built structures; Select infrastructure locations that are screened from view by topography and/or vegetation, that do not require noticeable permanent changes in landforms (i.e., cut and fill) or vegetation, and that are as far from surrounding residences as possible; Select infrastructure designs that minimize construction footprints; Comply with all relevant and applicable federal, state, or local regulations and guidance regarding visual and aesthetic conditions and impacts; and Comply with the BMPs and mitigation measures for towers required by USFWS, as deta iled in Section 9.6.2, Wildlife. 16.8.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures The following project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures apply to Deployable Technologies in addition to those listed above for all project types: Select parking locatio ns for deployable technologies that are screened from view by topography or vegetation, that are as far away from as many observers as possible, and that are not in or near areas considered scenic, such as shorelines, ridgelines, or scenic roads; and Selec t deployable designs that minimize the use of nighttime lighting, that include shielded or directional nighttime lighting, and/or that use the minimum nighttime lighting required for safe operations.

BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All P roject Types Implementation of the Proposed Action and alternatives could include deployment and operations activities that would involve public expenditures, construction, and related activities, all of which may influence socioeconomics depending on the deployment activity and location. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential impacts from the proposed activities are expected to be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BM Ps and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Avoid development of new wireless communication towers in or near residential areas, in order to reduce the potential that such activities could have adverse impacts on residential property v alues. Acceptable distances could vary depending on the nature of the aesthetic impacts, the nature of other objectionable effects that influence property values, and other factors such as: residential density, local concern over aesthetics, desire for im proved wireless communications, local media response, and more. According to a recent literature review, measurable adverse impacts of wireless communication towers on property values are generally not observable beyond 300 meters (984 feet), and often ar e not observable beyond 100 meters (328 feet) (Bond, Sims, & Dent, 2013) ; Give preference to development options that involve use of existing physical infrastructure (e.g., collocation on existing structures, buried, or undersea infrastructure, etc.); Select infrastructure locations that are screened from view by topography and/or vegetation, that do not require noticeable permanent changes in landforms (i.e., cut and fill) or vegetation and that are as far from surroundi ng residences as possible to minimize potential impacts to surrounding property values ; Retain existing vegetation wherever possible to provide visual screening of new infrastructure; Select infrastructure designs that minimize contrast with the surroundin g landscape; Avoid development or enlargement of storage, staging, and launch/landing areas for deployable technologies in or near residential areas, in order to reduce the potential that such activities could have adverse impacts on residential property v alues. Acceptable distances could vary, depending on the size of the facility, types of activities occurring there, the nature of the aesthetic impacts or other aspects that influence property values, and other factors such as residential density, local c oncern over aesthetics, desire for improved wireless communications, local media response, and more; Give preference to hiring workers who are local residents, where practicable; and Share deployment plans with public service providers, especially first r esponders, as early in the process as possible and throughout the deployment process. This will provide advance notice to public service providers, and would particularly allow first responders to be better prepared for emergencies that could arise during deployment. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-30 16.9.2. Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures beyond those listed above for all project types. 16.10. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 16.10.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Impacts are considered environmental justice impacts only if they are both \"adverse\" and \"disproportionately high\" in their incidence on environmental justice populations relative to the general population (Council on Environmental Quality, 1997) . Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential environmental justice impacts from the proposed activities are expected to be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the fo llowing BMPs and mitigation measures, to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all BMPs identified throughout this PEIS that reduce adverse impacts of construction activities, such as generation of noise, dust, and traffic; Avoid setting deployment act ivities and facilities requiring construction in proximity to environmental justice communities, in order to reduce the potential that such activities would be seen as disproportionately affecting environmental justice communities. In general, proximity m eans within a distance at which noise and dust would be considered objectionable or where effects on traffic volume or patterns would be considered detrimental to local residents or businesses; Because of their potential impacts on property values, avoid d evelopment of new wireless communication towers in proximity to environmental justice communities in order to reduce the potential that such activities would be seen as disproportionately affecting environmental justice communities. Proximity could be def ined variably depending on the nature of the aesthetic impacts, nature of other objectionable effects that influence property values, other factors (e.g., local concern over aesthetics), desire for improved wireless communications, local media response, et c. According to a recent literature review, measurable adverse impacts on property values are generally not observable beyond 300 meters (984 feet), and often are not observable beyond 100 meters (328 feet) (Bond, Sims, & Dent, 201 3); Where possible, identify specific communities (i.e., neighborhoods or populations that may be contained within individual block groups) that are at risk of experiencing environmental justice impacts. Conduct targeted outreach to these communities \u2014tailored to the specific racial, ethnic, financial, and/or cultural background \u2014as early in the development process as possible to explain the nature and extent of specific potential impacts, and to gain feedback on those impacts; Give preference to develo pment options that involve use of existing physical infrastructure (e.g., collocation on existing structures , buried, or undersea infrastructure, etc.); and Where possible, select infrastructure locations that are not within or near environmental justice c ommunities, particularly new build options.

Project -Type Specific BMPs and Mitigation Measures There are no project -specific BMPs and mitigation measures beyond those listed above for all project types. 16.11. CULTURAL RESOURCES 16.11.1. BMPs and Mitigation Measures for All Project Types Deployment involving ground disturbance has the potential to damage or destroy archaeological sites, and the attachment of communications equipment to historic building and structures has the potential to cause damage to features that ar e historically significant. Based on the analyses in Chapters 3 to 15, potential impacts from the proposed activities are expected to be less than significant. FirstNet and/or its partners would require, as practicable or feasible, the following BMPs and mitigation measures to further reduce potential impacts: Follow all applicable federal requirements for agency and tribal consultation on the identification of and assessment of effects to cultural resources; Avoid deployment in areas with known historic properties and deploy equipment and facilities in alternate locations if practical; Ensure usage of an appropriate indirect effects Area of Potential Effects as part of pre -siting or pre -deployment surveys to sufficiently account for potential indirect eff ects to cultural resources; Establish procedures for pre -deployment monitoring if a project has the potential to adversely and indirectly affect historic properties to collect baseline data, monitor potential indirect effects during deployment, and determi ne if effects have occurred post -deployment; Follow all applicable federal and state requirements if inadvertent discoveries of human remains are made during deployment or operations; Develop BMPs and mitigation measures as part of a Memorandum of Agreement or Programmatic Agreement to address any potential effects, if they were to occur; Use low -impact construction alternatives, when feasible. For instance, ripping17 could be used as an alternative to blasting near structures or archaeological sites identified as at risk of effects from vibration. Other techniques such as bored piling could be used to minimize the vibration generated, where possible; Restrict the timing of deployment activities so as not to dist urb the use of historic properties, as applicable. Stop work at certain times when traditional and/or religious properties are in use, such as during significant events (e.g., religious festivals or ceremonies); Design projects to mitigate potentially neg ative visual and auditory impacts of facilities. The following visual and noise abatement techniques should be considered: noise -reducing barriers, low -profile constructions, proper siting to maximize the use of topography and vegetation, screening, blend ing with topographic forms and existing vegetation patterns, and use of environmental coloration or advanced camouflage techniques to limit visual effects; 17 Ripping is typically performed by a tractor or other heavy equipment to pull the rock. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 16 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network BMPs and Mitigation Measures August 2017 16-32 Consult with site users through a community liaison team to understand site usage and how the projec t could affect user access; and Arrange alternative access using stakeholder input if access to an important cultural heritage site is restricted or blocked.

COMPARISON OF ALTERN ATIVES 17.1. INTRODUCTION This chapter presents in summary form impact rating s for the Preferred Alternative, as well as each of the remaining alternatives outlined in Section 2.2, Description of Alternatives. Under the Preferred Alternative, FirstNet and its partner(s) would construct a nationwide broadband long term evolution ( LTE) network using a combination of the wired, wireless, deployable, and satellite technologi es. There is currently a wide range of technologies that FirstNet may use to implement and deploy the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN ). Full descriptions of wired, wireless , and deployable projects that FirstNet may consider are explain ed in Section 2.1.2, Proposed Action Infrastructure. Under the Deployable Technologies Alternative, FirstNet would procure, deploy, and maintain a nationwide fleet of mobile communications systems, including ground -based and aerial deployable technologies, to provide temporary coverage in areas not covered by existing, usable infrastructure. Generally, these units would be deployed at times of an incident to the affected area for either planned or unplanned incidents or events. Equipment would be statione d in every state and territory, often at multiple locations in each state or territory, to facilitate suitable response. These mobile communication units would be temporarily installed and may use existing satellite, microwave, or radio systems for backha ul. Under the No Action Alternative, the NPSBN would not be constructed; there would be no nationwide, coordinated system dedicated to public safety interoperable communications. The existing multiplicity of communications networks would remain in place, as would the current, known limitations and problems of existing communication networks during times of emergency or disaster. This alternative would require an act of Congress to revise the Act, which currently requires the NPSBN. This Draft P rogrammatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) contains 15 stand -alone chapters, each of which is devoted to 1 of 13 states located in the U.S. South region. Each of these chapters describes the Affected Environment for 15 separate resource areas, such as biological resources, land use, air quality, etc. , and discusses the potential impacts of the Proposed Action in an Environmental Consequences section. Through the programmatic approach, FirstNet has identified four categories of potential impacts on these resources: 1. Potentially significant ; 2. Less than significant with Best Management Practices (BMPs) and mitigation measures incorporated ; 3. Less than significant ; or 4. No impact . Two exceptions exist to this categorization of impacts based on applicable, resource -specific regulations . Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 17 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comparison of Alternatives August 2017 17-2 For threatened and endangered species and species of conservation concern, categories of impacts are defined as: may affect, likely to adversely affect; may affect, not likely to adversely affect; and no effect . These impact catego ries are comparable to those defined in the Endangered Species Consultation Handbook (USFWS and NMFS, 1998) . In Table 17.2-1, the following numeric values have been assigned for the purpose of equivalency: 1. May affect, likely to adversely affect1; 2. May affect, not likely to adversely affect ; or 3. No effect. For cultural resources, categories of impacts are defined as an adverse effect; mitigated adverse effect; effect, but not adverse; and no effect . These impact categories are comparable to those defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800 , Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (NPS, 1983) , and the U.S. National Park Service's National Register Bulletin: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation (NPS, 1995) . In Table 17.2-1, the following numeric values have been assigned for the purpose of equivalency: 1. Adverse effect ; 2. Mitigated adverse effect ; 3. Effect, but not adverse ; or 4. No effect . 17.2. COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES Table 17.2-1 presents impact ratings of the Prefer red Action and Action Al ternatives . Numerical ratings represent whole number averages of ratings across the states in the South region , rounded conservatively to err on the side of greater potential impact significance . Evaluation of impacts was determined by the nature of both the deployment and operation of the infrastructure associated with each Alternative considered : the Preferred Alternative and the Deployable Technologies Alternative. The specific infrastructure a ssociated with the Deployable Technologies Alternative would be the same as the deployable technologies implemented as part of the Preferred Alternative but would likely be implemented in greater numbers, over a larger geographic extent, and used with grea ter frequency and duration. The Deployable Technologies Alternative would not include fixed infrastructure , such as towers or buried or aerial fiber. As a result, i mpacts associated with the Project Alternatives are generally similar . Bo th alternatives have impacts whose significance ranges from no impacts to less than significant with BMPs and mitigation measures incorporated ; neither alternative has potentially significant impacts . For many resources, impact rating s are identical, although some differ ences exist for some resource areas. For example, the Preferred Alternative would have somewhat greater impacts than the Deployable Technologies Alternative to water resources, wetlands, and visual resources. Conversely, the Deployable Technologies Alter native would have somewhat greater 1 For all impact ratings where potential affect is found, full and effective implementation of mitigation is assumed. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 17 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comparison of Alternatives August 2017 17-3 impacts than the Preferred Alternative to air resources. Again, n either alternative would have impacts that would be considered potentially significant. The No Action Alternative would have no impacts, since by definition , the NPSBN would not be deployed and existing conditions would not cha nge. As required by the National Environmental Policy Act , the No Action alternative is used as a baseline against which the impacts of the Action Alternatives are compared. However, the No Action Alternative would not achieve the project 's stated purpose or meet the project need as required by Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law [Pub. L.] No. 112 -96, 126 Statute [Stat. 156 (2012)) (codified at 47 United States Code [USC] \u00a7 1401 et seq.) ; as such , it wo uld require an act of Congress in order for the No Action Alternative to take place.Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 17 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comparison of Alternatives August 2017 17-4 Table 17.2-1: Comparison of Alternatives by Resource Area and Type of Effect2 Resource Area/Type of Effect Preferred Alternative Deployable Technologies Alternative No Action Alternative Deployment Operations Deployment Operations Infrastructure Transportation system capacity and safety 3 3 3 3 4 Strain on capacity of local health, public safety, and emergency response services 3 3 3 3 4 Modifies existing public safety response telecommunication practices, physical infrastructure, or level of service in a manner that directly affects public safety communication capabilities and response times 3 3 3 3 4 Effects to commercial telecommunication systems, communications, or level of service 3 3 3 3 4 Effects to utilities 3 3 3 3 4 Soils Soil erosion 3 3 3 3 4 Topsoil mixing 3 3 3 3 4 Soil compaction and rutting 3 3 3 3 4 Geology Seismic hazard 3 3 3 3 4 Volcanic activity 3 3 3 3 4 Landslide 3 3 3 3 4 Land subsidence 3 3 3 3 4 Mineral and fossil fuel resource impacts 3 3 3 3 4 Paleontological resources impacts 3 3 3 3 4 Surface geology, bedrock, topography, physiography, and geomorphology 3 3 3 3 4 Water Resources Water Quality (groundwater and surface water) 3 3 3 3 4 Floodplain degradationa 3 3 3 4 4 Drainage pattern alteration 3 3 3 4 4 Flow alteration 4 4 4 4 4 2 While the analysis indicates that certain disc rete locations could have higher impact ratings, this table is evaluating the potential regional impacts associated with the Proposed Action.

Cultural r esources present within a project's Area of Potential Effect are not historic properties if they do not meet the eligibility requirements for listing in the NRHP. Sites of religious and/or cultural significance refer to areas of concern to Indian tribes a nd other consulting parties that, in consultation with the respective party(ies), may or may not be eligible for listing in the NRHP. These sites may also be con sidered traditional cultural properties (TCPs). Therefore, by definition, these significance criteria only apply to cultural resources that are historic properties, significant sites of religious and/or cultural signif icance, or TCPs. For the purposes of brevity, the term historic property is used here to refer to either historic properties, sign ificant sites of religious and/or cultural significance, or TCPs.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS The Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) National Environmental Policy Act (N EPA ) implementing regulati ons require an assessment of a proposed action's cumulative impacts (40 Code of Federal Regulations [C FR] Parts 1500 -1508). A cumu lative impact is defined as an \"impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeab le future actions\" (40 CFR \u00a71508.7). Cumulative impacts can result from minor individual actions that collectively become major actions o ver time (40 CFR \u00a71508.7). CEQ' s guidance for considering cumulative effe cts states that NEPA documents \" should compa re the cumulative effects of multiple actions with appropriate national, regional, state, or community goals to determine whether the total effect is significant \" (Council on Environmental Quality, 1997) . Section 18.1 presents the methodology used to evaluate cumulative impacts; Section 18.2 discusses other actions that may have cumulative effects when combined with the potential impacts from the proposed FirstNet deployment and operation activities . Section 18.3 identifies the cumulative impacts for the resource areas discussed in each state chapter. 18.1. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS METHODOLOGY This section assesses the potential cumulative environmental impacts that may result from implementing the Proposed Action. FirstNet identified oth er projects that may be categorized as occurring in the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future. Some of these projects were identified early based on FirstNet's awareness of the project, while others were discovered in the NEPA planning process through internet research. Projects were selected projects using a number of different methods, such as: Reviewing actions recently pro posed by other Federal agencies; Identifying relevant and current grant funding programs sponsored by the Federal gove rnment; and Reviewing projects recently proposed or implemented by public entities or private entities. Cumulative impacts were assessed by resource area as impacts may arise from one or more actions, resulting in additive or interactive effects. CEQ re ports that interactive effects may, in some cases, be countervailing (adverse cumulative effect is less than the sum of the individual effects) or synergistic (net adverse cumulative effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects) (Council on Environmental Quality, 1997) . It should be noted that while the direct impacts of some individual projects were considered, there is little quantitative data available for most of the projects listed in Table 18.2-1. An integral part of this analysis for potential cumulative impacts requires a review of whether impacts from the Proposed Action could contribute to ongoing or for eseeable resource trends. The cumulative impacts analyses assess those impacts resulting from both an Action Alternative and other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions for each resource area. As a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 18 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Cumulative Impacts August 2017 18-2 quantitative analys is cannot be forma lized, FirstNet assessed the potential cumulative impacts qualitatively. 18.2. PAST, PRESENT , AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE FUTURE PROJECTS CEQ defines a cumulative effect as \" an impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non -Federal) or perso n undertakes such other actions\" (40 CFR \u00a7 1508.7). Direct and indirect effects of a Proposed Action are considered as part of cumulative effects, as are other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable (future) projects that are related in the sense that they may affect the same resource areas. Table 18.2-1 lists projects that FirstNet identified that could result in incremental impacts to a number of resource areas when considering the Proposed Action. FirstNet identified projects initially in its review of recent NEPA documentation, during public scoping, and from internet research. Table 18.2-1 provides the project name, geographic location, sponsor, a brief project description, and the completion year , based upon readily available information. Table 18.2-1: Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future Projects Name Location Sponsor Brief Description Completion Year Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) Grant Program Nationwide Department of Commerce (DOC) National Telecommunic ations and Information Agency (NTIA ) and Department of Homeland Security (D HS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA ) $1 billion ( B) grant program to U.S. states and territories for the acquisition of, deployment of, or training for the use of interoperable communications systems that use (or enable interoperability with communications systems that use) reallocated public safety spectrum in the were awarded for 6,750 projects, including the installation of 133 new freestanding and 11 new guyed towers, collocation of equipment at 2,710 existing towers and 2,710 existing facilities, 112.9 miles of fiber opt ic cable, more than 350 training events, and acquisition of over 75,000 radios. 2012 Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) Nationwide DOC NTIA $4.7B grant program to deploy broadband infrastructure in the U .S., expand public computer center capacity, and encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service. As of December 2015, 263 projects had completed their project activities , 17 projects remained in active status , and grant recipients had deployed more than 114,636 miles of new or upgraded network infrastructure .

Of the original 320 BIP projects, 297 were for infrastructure, 4 for satellite broadband service support, and 19 for technical assistance (the majority of which went to tribal communities ). As of March 2014, RUS estimated that 66,52 1 fiber miles and 5,468 wireless access points were installed through BIP infrastructure projects . 2015 Integrated Public Alert & Warning System (IPAWS) Nationwide DHS FEMA IPAWS is a f ederal modernization program of the Nation's alert and warning infrastructure to protect life and property. IPAWS provides public safety officials the means to alert the general public about serious emergencies using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio, and other public alerting systems from a single interface . Proposed infrastructure work includes facility resiliency upgrade s to radio stations , and power generation, fuel storage, and other provisions necessary to operate and maintain transmitter facilities for extended periods without access to commercial electrical power. Undetermined Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 18 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Cumulative Impacts August 2017 18-4 Name Location Sponsor Brief Description Completion Year Commercial Wireless Service Providers Nationwide Major Wireless Service Providers Expansion plans of commercial wireless service providers is proprietary business information. However, publicly available business forecasts from tower owners provide some information regarding the relative scale and expansion plans of wireless providers, compared to the current (Novembe r 2015) baseline. For example, in a recent market analysis (http://www.fiercewireless.com/ 12), it was reported that in February 2015 Verizon agreed to lease the rights to 11,324 of its towers and sell 165 additional towers to American Tower, and that the Verizon towers are, on average, 30 % taller than other carrier towers that have been sold or leased over the last several years. Therefore , American Tower now has access to more space, to add network equipment from other carriers, such as T - Mobile , which is submitting co -location applications to deploy its 700 MHz A Block spectrum to increase i ts long-term evolution footprint to 300 million poin ts of presence (POP) by end of 2015 (an annual increase of 10 million). The recent ownership transfer of nearly 12% of FCC - registered towers of one major wireless service provider, and a 3% annual increase of POPs for another major provider is evidence of continued high demand for existing and new telecommunication towers . Continuing 18.3. SUMMARY OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS Assessing cumulative impacts for resource areas on a regional basis for unknown deployment activities at undetermined locations would be purely speculative at the programmatic level of this analysis. Therefore, the cumulative impacts analysis of individual resource areas focuses solely on those resource areas identified as having potential cumulative impacts. Table 18.3-1 provides a summary of the potential cumula tive impacts by resource area.

OTHER REQUIRED ANALY SES In addition to the analyses discussed in the previous state chapters, the National Environmental Policy Act ( NEPA ) requires an additional evaluation of the potential impacts from the Proposed Action related to unavoidable adverse impacts, any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources, and the relationship between local short -term and long -term productivity . 19.1. UNAVOIDABLE ADVERSE IMPACTS The Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) NEPA implementing regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations [ CFR ] \u00a71502.16) require that an Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS) evaluate the unavoidable adverse impacts from implem entation of the Proposed Action. For this Proposed Action, the analysis indicates no significant or unavoidable adverse impacts are anticipated. Once site-specific project information is known , the potential for adverse impacts would be analyzed , as appr opriate, in NEPA documentation IRREVERSIBLE OR implementing regulations (40 CFR \u00a71502.16) require that an EIS review the potential impacts to irreversible or irret rievable commitments of resources resulting from implementation of the Proposed Action. An irreversible commitment of resources refers to the loss of resource use in the future, whereas irretrievable refers to the loss of a natural resource for harvest, p roduction, or use. These resources are irretrievable in that they would be used for a single project instead of being used for multiple purposes. An irretrievable commitment of resources is the loss of resources that cannot be replaced, recovered, or rev ersed. An example of irreversible commitments of resources could be the conversion of wetlands or the loss of a protected species or a cultural resource; these would be considered permanent losses. The Proposed Action could require an irretrievable comm itment of natural and manmade resources from direct consumption of fossil fuels and construction materials, depending on the deployment activities. These resources include potential building materials used during construction or renovation; energy (gas or electricity ) consumed during construction and operation of facilities using mechanical systems; and human labor to develop, construct, and operate the proposed FirstNet projects as these contractors would be unable to work on other projects, and may cause temporary increases in the cost of local labor, equipment, or materials. These are considered irretrievably committed because their reuse for some other purpose would be highly likely. Potential resource commitments are shown on Table 19.2-1. Where any potential irr eversible or irretrievable commitments of resources are identified, they would be addressed in project specific environmental compliance documentation. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 19 FirstNet N ationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Other Required Analyses August 2017 19-2 Table 19.2-1: Summary of Irreversible an d Irretrievable Commitment of Resources by Resource Area Resource Area Irreversible Impacts Irretrievable Impacts Explanation Infrastructure No No Short -term obstruction or temporary disruption to local infrastructure could occur during construction of deployment activities . There would be no long -term impacts to infrastructure. Soils Yes Yes Soil lost due to potential erosion would be an irretrievable loss. There could be an irreversible commitment of resources if an undisturbed land area is selected for deployment activities . Geology Yes Yes Removal or disturbance of paleontological resources (fossils) could create irreversible and irretrievable impacts. Water Resources and Wetlands No No Deployment activities are not expected to cause any impacts to existing waterbodies, wetlands, or to exceed water quality standards. Biological Resources Yes Yes Removal or disturbance of habitat could create irreversible and irretrievable impacts. Land Use and Recreation Yes No Land use required for the deployment activities could be an irreversible impact. Visual Resources Yes Yes Obstruction of scenic or cultural areas could occur from some angles , resulting in an irreversible and irretrievable loss of visual resources . In addition, the installa tion of lighting in rural areas may have irretr ievable impacts to night skies. Socioe conomic Resources No Yes There could be an increased use of local contractors during construction activities, represe nting an irretrievable loss of workers during construction . Environmental Justice No No In general, Environmental Justice impacts across each state and the District would not include irreversible or irretrievable effects. Analyses of individual proposed projects should assess whether potential impacts to specific environmental justice communities include irreversible and/or irretrievable effects. Cultural Resources Yes Yes Removal or disturbance of previously unidentified cultural resources could result in irretrievable and irreversible impacts. Air Quality No No Project emissions are not expected to exceed federal or state air quality standards. Air quality would return to existing conditions after completion of deployment activities . Noise No No Short -term, temporary noise impacts may result during construction activities for deployment. There would be no long-term impacts to noise. Climate Change No No Greenhouse gas emissions are not expected to increase. Human Health and Safety No No Construction activities during deployment may increase human health and safety concerns. Any hazardous wastes would be disposed of properly. Conditions would return to normal after completion of deployment activities . Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 19 FirstNet N ationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Other Required Analyses August 2017 19-3 19.3. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SHORT -TERM AND LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY CEQ's NEPA implementing regulations (40 CFR \u00a71502.16) require that an EIS address the relationship between short -term use of the environment and the potential impacts of such use on the maintenance and enhancement of long -term produ ctivity, particularly for beneficial uses. Such impacts can arise from choosing one action that could reduce the flexibility of pursuing other options in the future, or from selecting a specific parcel of land or other resource to a certain use that would not allow other uses to occur at the site. It is anticipated that implementation of the Proposed Action would not result in any impacts that would narrow the range of future beneficial uses of the environment because it would not pose any long -term risks to the health, safety, or the general welfare of public communities. See Chapter 1 6, BMPs and Mitigation Measures, for a listing of BMPs and mitigation measures that FirstNet and/or its partner(s) would require, as practicable or feasible, to avoid or mi nimize potential impacts. FirstNet does not intend to alter the current uses of the environment. Project -specific environmental compliance reviews would be conducted to ensure all environmental laws are met. During those reviews, each project element and activity would be evaluated , and the potential long -term effects on productivity of each environmental resource area would be disclosed and discussed relative to potential trade -offs. 3DJH\u0003,QWHQWLRQDOO\\\u0003/HIW\u0003%ODQN\u0011 First Responder Network Authority Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Southern United States VOLUME 14 - CHAPTER 20 Amanda Goebel Pereira, AICP NEPA Coordina tor First Responder Network Authority U.S. Department of Commerce 12201 Sunrise Valley Dr. M/S 243 Rest on, VA 20192 Cooperating Agencies Federal Communications Commission General Services Administration U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014 Rural Utilities Service U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014U.S. Forest Service U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014Natural Resource Conservation Service U.S. Department of Commerce\u2014National Telecommunications and Information Administration U.S. Department of Defense\u2014Department of the Air Force U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Department of Homeland Security August 2017Page Intentionally Left Blank.Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Chapter 20 FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network List of Preparers and Contributors August 2017 20-1 20.

Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.) charges FirstNet with taking all actions necessary to ensure the building, deployment, and operation ofNPSBN, by, at a mm1mum: Ensuring nationwide standards for use and access to the network; Issuing open, transparent, and competitive requests for proposals to the private sector; Encouraging use of existing commercial wireless infrastructure to speed deployment; and Managing and overseeing the implementation and execution of contracts or agreements with non-Federal entities to build, operate, and maintain the network. FirstNet has determined that a PEIS is the appropriate level of environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). FirstNet will use the NEPA planning process to encourage agency and public involvement in the review of the proposed projects. Public involvement allows for full and fair discussion of the project scope and potential environmental impacts. By providing a means for open communication between FirstNet and the public, the procedural aspects ofNEPA promote better decision-making. The Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulation [CFR] Parts 1500-1508) provide guidance on opportunities for public participation. This report provides an overview of the FirstNet PEIS scoping activities, including the public scoping meetings and comments received during the comment period. Public Notification On November 12, 2014, FirstNet published a Notice oflntent (NOi) in the Federal Register to initiate a 45-day scoping comment period (79 Federal Register [FR] 67156). The NOi, provided in Appendix A, identified that FirstNet would be developing regional PEISs and solicited input from the public on potential concerns associated with the Proposed Action and purpose and need, and provided background information on the project. The NOi also included an announcement of PEIS scoping meetings. Issuance of the NOi commenced a 45-day public scoping period that ended on December 29, 2014. April 2017 8-1 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix B FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Scoping Summary FirstNet placed advertisements in local newspapers to invite the public to the scoping meetings identifying the dates and locations. Publication of the notices occurred in the following papers: Washington Post and Washington Post Express (November 23, 2014) Honolulu Star-Advisor(November 30, 2014) San Francisco Chronicle (November 30, 2014) Arizona Republic and Arizona Daily Star (November 30, 2014) Kansas City Star (December 7, 2014) The Times-Picayune (December 7, 2014) New York Times (December 14, 2014) Copies of the newspaper notices are included in Appendix B. Scoping Meetings FirstNet held seven in-person scoping meetings throughout the nation . These meetings provided the general public and interested stakeholders opportunities to learn about the proposed action, talk directly with FirstNet environmental staff, and provide input regarding the scope of the analysis and alternatives. Organized as informal gatherings, the scoping meetings provided the public with an opportunity to learn about FirstNet, alternative ways to implement the NPSBN that will be analyzed in the PEISs, and the overall NEPA process, as well as provide comments and input to the FirstNet team.

DATES: To ensure consideration, written comments must be submitted on or before January 12, 2015. ADDRESSES: Direct all written comments to Jennifer Jessup, Departmental Paperwork Clearance Officer, Department of Commerce, Room 6616, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230 (or via the Internet at jjessup@doc.gov). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Requests for additional information or copies of the information collection instrument(s) and instructions should be directed to Erica Filipek, U.S. Census Bureau, MCD, CENHQRoom 7K057, 4600 Silver Hill Road, Washington, DC 20233, telephone (301) 763-5161 (or via the Internet at Erica.Mary.Filipek@ census.gov). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Abstract The U.S. Census Bureau plans to request a three-year extension of the current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance of the Survey of Housing Starts, Sales and Completions, also known as the Survey of Construction (SOC). The SOC collects monthly data on new residential construction from a sample of owners or builders. The Census Bureau uses the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) electronic questionnaires SOC-QI/SF.1 and SOC- QI/MF .1 to collect data on start and completion dates of construction, physical characteristics of the structure (floor area, number of bathrooms, type of heating system, etc.), and if applicable, date of sale, sales price, and type of financing. The SOC provides widely used measures of construction activity, including the economic indicators Housing Starts and Housing Completions, which are from the New Residential Construction series, and New Residential Sales. We sample about 1,700 new buildings each month (20,400 per year). We inquire about the progress of each building multiple times until it is completed (and a sales contract is signed, if it is a single-family house that is built for sale). For single-family buildings, we conduct an average of 8.17 interviews and for multifamily buildings, we conduct an average of 7.0 interviews. The total number of interviews conducted each year for single-family buildings is about 107,844 and for multifamily buildings is about 50,400. Each interview takes 5 minutes on average. Therefore, the total annual burden is 13,187 hours. II. Method of Collection The Census Bureau uses its field representatives to collect the data. The field representatives conduct interviews to obtain data. III. Data OMB Control Number: 0607-0110. Form Number(s): SOC-QI/SF.1 and SOC-QI/MF .1. Type of Review: Regular submission. Affected Public: Individuals or households, business, or other for-profit institutions. Estimated Number of Respondents: 20,400. Estimated Time per Response: 5 minutes. Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 13,187. Estimated Total Annual Cost to Public: The estimated cost to the respondent is $404,841 based on an average hourly pay for the respondent of $30.70. This estimate was taken from the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey for 2013. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. Legal Authority: Title 13 U.S.C. 182. IV. Request for Comments Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information shall have practical utility; (bl the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden (including hours and cost) of the proposed collection of information; (cl ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of this information collection; they also will become a matter of public record.

ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: The First Responder Network Authority (\"FirstNet\") announces its intent to prepare five regional Federal Register/Vol. 79, No. 218/Wednesday, November 12, 2014/Notices 67157 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements (\"PEISs\") and conduct public scoping meetings to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed nationwide public safety broadband network. The specific locations, dates, and times for the scoping meetings will be announced on the FirstNet Web site, no later than one week prior to each meeting. DATES: The scoping period for this notice will begin on the date of publication of this notice and will end December 29, 2014. Comments to this notice must be submitted on or before December 29, 2014. ADDRESSES: The public is invited to submit written comments to this Notice. Written comments may be submitted electronically via email to PEIScomments@firstnet.gov or by mail (to the address listed in FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT). Comments received will be made a part of the public record and may be posted to FirstNet's Web site (www.Jirstnet.gov} without change. Comments should be machine readable and should not be copy-protected. All personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address) voluntarily submitted by the commenter may be publicly accessible. Do not submit confidential business information or otherwise sensitive or protected information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Amanda Pereira, NEPA Coordinator, First Responder Network Authority, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, MIS 243, Reston, VA 20192. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Pub. L. 112-96, Title VI, 126 Stat. 256 (codified at 47 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.)) (the \"Act\") created and authorized FirstNet to take all actions necessary to ensure the building, deployment, and operation of an interoperable, nationwide public safety broadband network (\"NPSBN\") based on a single, national network architecture. The Act meets a long- standing and critical national infrastructure need, to create a single, nationwide network that will, for the first time, allow police officers, fire fighters, emergency medical service professionals, and other public safety entities to effectively communicate with each other across agencies and jurisdictions. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) (\"NEPA\") requires federal agencies to undertake an assessment of environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making a final decision and implementing the action. NEPA requirements apply to any federal project, decision, or action that may have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. NEPA also establishes the Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ\"). which issued regulations implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (see 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). Among other considerations, CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 1508.28 recommend the use of tiering from a \"broader environmental impact statement (such as a national program or policy statements) with subsequent narrower statements or environmental analysis (such as regional or basin wide statements or ultimately site-specific statements) incorporating by reference the general discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.\" Due to the geographic scope of FirstNet (all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories) and the diversity of ecosystems potentially traversed by the project, FirstNet has elected to prepare five regional PEISs. The five PEISs will be divided as follows: East Central West South Non-contiguous Delaware District of Columbia Connecticut Maine Maryland Massachusetts New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia West Virginia Colorado Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Michigan Minnesota Missouri Montana Nebraska North Dakota Ohio South Dakota Utah Wisconsin Wyoming Arizona California Idaho Nevada Oregon Washington Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi New Mexico North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee Texas Alaska American Samoa CNMI Guam Hawaii Puerto Rico U.S. Virgin Islands Once a PEIS is completed and a Record of Decision (ROD) is signed, the proposed FirstNet projects can begin to submit the site-specific environmental documentation to determine if the proposed project has been adequately evaluated in the PEIS or warrants a Categorical Exclusion, an Environmental Assessment, or an Environmental Impact Statement.

April 2017 B-20 What are the Project Alternatives? Mixed Technologies Alternative: F1rstNet intends to construct a long-te rm evolution (LTE) nat1onw1de public safety broadband netwo rk (NPSBN) using a combinat ion of the follow ing method s: Collocat ion of the network equipment on existing towe rs. poles and structure s. some of which would require structural hardening or reinforcement to improve disaster resistance and resiliency , Construction of new communication towers, poles and assoc iated strnctures to include generators, equipment sheds. fenci Collocat ion lighting da1\u00b7k fiber and 1nstallat 1on of new on existing poles and 1n existing condu it; Installat ion of new conduit and using ( nclud1ng v bratory plowing) or d1rect1onal boring (1nclud1ng hor zontal directional drrllrng); Deployment of satellite phones and other portable satell ite technology; Installat ion of microwave facilities for cell-site backhaul commun1cat1on; and Utrlrzat ron of deployable technolog ies to reach rural and remote areas . Deployable technologies encompass a range of items, generally characterized as the following: -Cell on Wheels (COW): a cellular base station on a trader\u00b7 with an expandable antenna mast and usually a microwave or satellite link back to the main controller ; -Cell on Light Truck (COLT): a cellular base station on a light truck platform with an expandable antenna mast and usually a microwave or satellrte lrnk back to the main contrnller; -System on Wheel s (SOW): a full base station and controller on a trarler/truck/brg ng/etc. A SOW 1s a fully self-contarned cellular system that can provide an island system with no need for satell1te/m rcrowave link back; apphcab1l1ty of this type of deployable technology may be lrmited 1f there 1s no internet connect1v1ty: and, -Depl oyable ral Communications Arch itecture: Aer\u00b7 al vehicles, 1nclud rng, but not limited to. drones, weather balloons, and blimps, which would be deployed at high altrtudes and are capable of providing wide-a1\u00b7ea coverage, although w ith relatively low capacrty/throughput. Deployable Technologies Only Alternative: Procure. deploy. and maintain a nat1onw1de fleet of mobrle communications systems to provide tempora1 \u00b7y coverage 1n areas not covered by exist ing, usable 1nfrastructu1 e. as there would be no collocation of equipment or new construction. Generally, these units would be deployed at times of an inc dent to the affected area. These mobrle communication units would be temporarily installed and may use ex1st1ng satellite, m1crnwave, or radio systems for backhaul. No Action Alternative: Under the No Action Alternat ve, the Nat1onw1de Publrc Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) would not be constructed . there would be no nat1onw1de, coordinated system dedicated to publ c safety interoperable communications. The ex1st1ng mult1pl1c1ty of communications networks would remain 1n place, as would the cu1-rent. known limitations and problems of ex1st1ng communication networks during trmes of emergency or drsastec This alternat rve would 1\u00b7equire an act of Congress to revise the Act, which currently requires the NPSBN. Description of the Project Area The F1rstNet Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement project area would cover the geography of 50 states, 5 territories, the District of Columbia, and 566 tribal nations. Over the past 30 ;ears, wireless operators have invested tens of billions of dollars in terrestrial networks covering over 60\u00b0~ of the U.S. land mass. The Nat1onw 1de Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) 1s intended to provide nat1onw1de service, 1nduding substantial ru1\u00b7al milestones as part of each phase of the construction and deployment of the network. F1rstNet has determined that the design, construction, and operat ion of the NPSBN is a broad action with nationwide implicat1ons.Th1s approach provides for the broadest and most extensive analysis 1n order to support the balancing of different cons1derat 1ons, including social. economic. and environmental issues. The prog1\u00b7ammat1c approach creates a comprehensive analytical framework that assesses impacts expected from the NPSBN as a whole. It also supports any subsequent site-specific environmental analyses that may be required for ind1v1dual actions at specif c locations, once they are identified. The programmatic approach allows F1rstNet to identify and define three categories of actions: those types of actions that would not have a significant impact on the environment; those actions that would not have a significant impact f certain m1t gat1on measures or best management practices are implemented; and those actions that will require s1te-specifc analysis to determine the nature and extent of impacts. The project area 1s d1v1ded into five regions: East -comprised of FEMA regions I. 2, and 3 (with the exception of PR and USVI) Central -comprised of FEMA regions 5, 7, and 8 South -comprised of FEMA regions 4 and 6 West -comprised of FEMA regions 9 and IO (except for AK and the Pacific Islands) Non-Contiguous -comprised of AK, HI, PR. USVI , CNMl,AS, and CNMi / (, Guam Samoa _.. USVI., NEPA Process The National Environmental Pohcy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) provides a framework to evaluate the impact of maior fede1\u00b7al actions on the environment and allows the pubhc the opportunity to provide input on 1mplementat1on alternative s NEPA requires federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their decision-making processes by con s1de11ng the environmental impacts of their proposed actions and reasonable alternatives to those actions. NEPA also established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).As part of the Execut ive Office of the President. CEQ coordinates federal environmental efforts and is responsible for adv1s1ng the President on environmental policy mattei-s. CEQ has also promulgated regulations 1mplement1ng NEPA which are binding for all fede1\u00b7al agenc ies. These regulations address the procedural provis ions of NEPA and the administrat ion of the NEPA process. 1nclud1ng preparat on of Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). NEPA 1s applicable lo all 'maior\" federal actions affecting the quality of the human environment. A major federal action is an action with effects that may be ma101\u00b7 and which a1\u00b7e potentially subJect to federal control and respons1b1lity.These act ons may include new and cont1nu1ng act1v1t1es. including projects and programs entirel y or partly financed. assisted, conducted, regulated, Begin PEIS Notice of Intent (NOi) or approved by federal agencies; new or revised agency rules, regulations. plans. policies, or procedures; and leg1slat1ve proposals. F1rstNet has determined the construction, operat ion, and maintenance of the Nat1onw1de Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) qualifies as a maior fede1\u00b7al act1v1ty under these rntena and triggers a NEPA review. Because of this. F1rstNel 1s requwed lo comply with NEPA. which requires that the government examine the environmental. social. historic. and cultural impacts of its proposed actions before 1t irretrievably commits resou ,-ces to undertake them. Furthermore. F1rstNet must comply with its own NEPA implementing procedures, which were finalized and published 1n the Federal Register on Apnl 29.2014. On November 12.2014. FirstNet published a Notice of Intent (NOi) to prepare five coord inated Prog1\u00b7ammatic Environmental Impact Statements (PEIS) 1n the Register. The PEISs will analyze the direct. 1nd1rect, and cumulative impacts of the alternative approaches to the const 1\u00b7uct1on, operation, and maintenance of the NPSBN on natu1\u00b7al cultural. and social resources. The NEPA process 1s depicted 1n the diagram below.The light blue coloring 1nd1cates those opportunities for the public to comment on the proiect. Public/Agency Scoping .I Public Hearings Develop and Publish Draft PEIS \u00b7 -- Review/Incorporate Develop and Publish Final PEIS Comments Review Scoping Comments Issue Record Of Decision (ROD) The PEIS process started with publication of the Notice of Intent 1n the Federal Register on November 12, 2014.The scop1ng/pubhc comment penod for this PEIS will end on December 29, 2014. Currently. the PEIS 1s at the scoping phase. During the scoping phase, a wide range of partners including the pubhc, interest groups, and agencies at all levels of government are encouraged to provide input about the proiect.The PEIS w1ll 1ncorporate and build upon the p or planning efforts. environmental studies, and public input. All of the collected 1nformat1on will form the basis for a range of alternatives to implement the project and eventually the selection of a preferred alternative. The preferred alternative will be 1dent1fied 1n the Draft PEIS when 1t 1s made available to the pubhc for review and comment. A 45-day pubhc comment penod with public hearings similar to the scoping meetings will be held.The Final PEIS will incorporate comments received on the Draft PEIS. After publicat ion of the Final PEIS, F1rstNet will make the dem1on regarding the selection of an alternative wrthin a Record of Decision. Public Involvement The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations require that a lead agency preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is to involve the public, along with government agenoes, American Indian t1\u00b7ibes, private-sector F1rstNet Programmatic EIS (PEIS) began with publ1cat1on of the Notice of Intent 1n the Federal Register on November 12.2014. Scoping is the first phase of the NEPA analysis process and gives interested parties the chance to comment on the proposed action and to offer suggestions about the issues to be considered 1n the EIS analyses. Interested government agencies, American Indian t1\u00b7ibes, private- sector organizations, and the gene1\u00b7al public are encouraged to part1c1pate in this scoping process.The scoping pe1\u00b7iod will last for 45 days, ending on December 29, 2014.

Do not submit confidential business information or otherwise sensitive or protected information. How Are Scoping Comments Used? Scoping for the Draft PEIS will provide several key elements to assist 1n the preparation of the document\" I. Gathering 1nformallon and ideas from Lhe publi c and key stakeholder groups , such as the public safety community. about the analytical issues related to the Nationw ide Publ c Safety Broadband Netwo1\u00b7k; 2. Making determinations about which issues should be analyzed; and 3. Identifying alternatives to the proposed action that should be considered for analysis. The scoping process is ongoing and crt1cal to nfo,\u00b7m1ng federal agency actions, in that 1t begins before the PEIS analyses are initiated and continues throughout document development of the PEIS. What is the Proposed Action? The purpose of the proposed action 1s to develop a nat1onw1de. interoperable, public safety broadband netwo1 \u00b7k (NPSBN). The goal of F1rstNet 1s to prov ide dedicated services that are comparable lo or better than those services public safety has access to today through comme rcial broadband w reless earners. These applications and se1\u00b7v1ces are ntended to enha nce the ability of the public safety community to perform more reliably. effect ively and safely. F1rstNet's goal is that the NPSBN would also prov ide a backbone to allow for improved commun1cat1ons by can y1ng high-speed data. location information. images and. eventually. streaming video.This capability is intended to increase srtuat onal awareness during an emergency and improve the abili y of the publ c safety commun ty to effectively engage 1n those critical act1v1ties. Description of the Proposed Action The Proposed Action would encompass the des gn. construct ion, and operation of the NPSBN by Fll\"stNet or a partne1\u00b7 organ1zat 1on(s). have seve1\u00b7al rnclud rng security, resiliency. backwards compatibility with ex1st 1ng commercial networks, 1ntegrat1on with public safety access point (PSAPs) or their equ valents, substantial rural coverage. rt must be built to open, non-pmpnetary, commeroally available standards, and 1t must use ex sting infrastructure to the maximum extent economically desirable. FirstNel intends to construct a core network. comprised of all standa ,\u00b7d Evolved Packet Core elements under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards (1nclud1ng the Serving and Packet Data Network Gateways. Mobility Management Entity. and the Policy and Charging Rules Funct ion). device services, location services . b1ll1ng functions. and all other network elements and funct ions other than the Radio Access Network (RAN). FrrstNet expects to construct RAN networks that would consist of all cell site equipment, antennas and backhaul equipment and se1\u00b7v1ces requi red to enable wireless communications with devices using the public safety broadband spectrum. In addit ion, FrrstNet must continue to ma1nta1n and improve the NPSBN to account for new and evolving technolog ies. FirstNetN The Promise of FirstNet WHAT IS THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITY (FIRSTNET)? FirstNet is an independent authority within the U.S. Department of Commerce 's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. FirstNet is governed by a 15-member Board consisting of the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security , the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and 12 members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. The FirstNet Board is composed of representatives from public safety; local , state and federal government; and the wireless industry . Signed into law on February 22, 2012, the Middle Class Tax Reliet and !ob Creation Act created FirstNet. The law gives FirstNet the duty to build, operate and maintain the first high -speed , nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety entities. FirstNet will provide a single interoperable platform for public safety communications. WHAT WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE FIRSTNET NETWORK? The FirstNet network will improve citizen and responder safety and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response through cutting edge broadband communications. Imagine a day when a single communications network can be used to dispatch EMS personnel, a medical helicopter, police officers, and fire personnel from different jurisdictions all at the same time, utilizing voice, video , and data at broadband speeds. Public safety personnel using the FirstNet network will be able to share applications, access databases, and provide better informed responses to incidents through integrated communications. FirstNet's goal is to provide public safety-grade reliability and nationwide coverage so all public safety personnel can count on the network when they are on the job. FirstNet is also aiming to provide coverage solutions that let public safety \"take the network along\" to the destination in certain geographies. FirstNet will create a nationwide standard of service while affording localized customization and control. When the FirstNet network launches, it will provide mission-critical, high-speed data services to supplement the voice capabilities of today's Land Mobile Radio (LMR) networks. Initially, the FirstNet network will be used for sending data, video, images and text. The FirstNet network will also carry location information and eventually support streaming video. FirstNet plans to offer cellular voice communications such as Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) or other alternatives. Appendix B Scoping Summary F.inaU\u00bbrogrommauc Envtronmental Impact Statement irstNot Nationwid Public Safety Broadband Network WHY WAS FIRSTNET CREA TED? The public safety community fought hard to fulfill the 9/11 Commission's last standing recommendation and lobbied Congress to pass legislation establishing a dedicated, reliable network for advanced data communications nationwide. During emergencie s, public safety personnel need priority access and preemption, which are not available on commercial networks . HOW WILL THE FIRSTNET NETWORK BENEFIT PUBLIC SAFETY? Using the FirstNet network will improve situational awareness, decision-making and responder and citizen health and safety. Just as smartphones have changed personal lives, FirstNet devices and applications will ultimately change the way public safety operates. FirstNet devices will work anywhere on the network and will save time when seconds matter. A market of millions of public safety users will bring savings opportunities to state and local budgets. FirstNet will bring the benefits of a single, nationwide, interoperable network that is built to open standards to public safety agencie s acros s the countr y. With millions of users on a single network, FirstNet can take advantage of increa sed vendor competition and economies of scale to drive down the final cost to the public safety user. WHAT WILL USERS PAY FOR FIRSTNET'S SERVICES? FirstNet intends to offer services at a compelling and competitive cost to attract million s of publi c safety users and make FirstNet self-sustaining. The use of FirstNet services and application s will be voluntary. The costs for FirstNet services and devices have not yet been set. HOW WILL ST A TES AND AGENCIES PARTICIPATE IN THE BUILDOUT OF FIRSTNET? The law that established FirstNet requires it to consult with regional , state , tribal and local jurisdictions to ensure that the FirstNet network is designed to meet the needs of public safety acros s the country. State consultation will be a collaborative process, invol ving key stakeholders and leader ship from each state and territory, and will be iterative to allow for enhancements and improvements from the state and territory. FirstNet will work through the designated single officer or governmental body during consultation to gather requirements from key stakeholders for developing its deployment plan. Additional information on state consultation is available at http://firstnet.gov/consultation . FirstNet ~ Public Involvement The public scoping process began with publication of the Notice of Intent in the Federal Register on November 12, 2014. Scoping is the first phase of the NEPA analysis process and gives interested parties the chance to comment on the proposed action and to offer suggestions about the issues to be considered in the EIS analyses . Interested government agencies,American Indian tribes, private-sector organizations, and the general public are encouraged to participate in this scoping process. The scoping period will last for 45 days, ending on December 29, 2014. Written comments can be submitted either electronically or by paper copy. Information and public comments received during the scoping period will be reviewed for consideration in the development of each regional Draft PEIS. Submitting Comments The public is invited to submit written comments for consideration during scoping. Written comments may be submitted electronically via email to PEIScomments@firstnet.gov or by mail to: Amanda Pereira, NEPA Coordinator I Sunrise Valley Drive, M/S 243 Reston,VA 20192 Comments received will be made a part ofthe public record and may be posted to t/,e FirstNet website without change.

Description of the Project Area The FirstNet Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement project area would cover the geography of 50 states, 5 territories, the District of Columbia, and 566 Federally recognized tribes. Over the past 30 years, wireless operators have invested tens of billions of dollars in terrestrial networks covering over 60% of the U.S. land mass. The NPSBN is intended to provide nationwide service, and it is intended to include milestones that address wilderness and rural coverage gaps. The project area is divided into five regions: D East -comprised of FEMA regions I, 2, and 3 (with the exception of PR and USVI) Central -comprised of FEMA regions 5, 7, and 8 South -comprised of FEMA regions 4 and 6 D West -comprised of FEMA regions 9 and IO ( except for AK and the Pacific Islands) l!!I Non-Contiguous -comprised of AK, CftMI , G\" m What are the Project Alternatives? Mixed Technologies Alternative: Potential elements to be considered for the construction of a long-term evolution (LTE) nationwide public safety broadband network (NPSBN): Collocation of the network equipment on existing towers, poles and structure s; Construction of new communication towers, poles and associated structures; Collocation on existing fiber facilities; Installation of new conduit and fiber using trenching or directional boring; Deployment of satellite phones and other portable satellite technology; Installation of microwave facilities for cell-site backhaul communication; and Utilization of deployable technologies to reach rural and remote areas, such as; -Cell on Wheels (COW) -Cell on Light Truck (COLT) -System on Wheels (SOW) -Deployable Aerial Communications Architecture: Aerial vehicles, including, but not limited to, drones , weather balloons, and blimps, which would be deployed at high altitudes and are capable of providing wide-area coverage, although with relatively low capacity/throughput. Deployable Technologies Alternative: Procure, deploy, and maintain a nationwide fleet of mobile communications systems to provide temporary coverage in areas not covered by existing, usable infrastructure, for deployment at times of an incident to the affectted area. These mobile communication units would be temporarily installed and may use existing satellite, microwave, or radio systems for backhaul. No Action Alternative: Under the No Action, the NPSBN would not be constructed; there would be no nationwide, coordinated system dedicated to public safety interoperable communications. This alternative would require an act of Congress to revise the Act, which currently requires the NPSBN. What is the Proposed Action? The proposed action is to develop a nationwide, interoperable, public safety broadband network (NPSBN) with the goal of being comparable to or better than those services public safety has access to today through commercial broadband wireless carriers. These applications and services are intended to enhance the ability of the public safety community to perform more reliably, effectively and safely. FirstNefs goal is that the NPSBN would also provide a backbone to allow for improved communications by carrying high-speed data, location information, images, and, eventually, streaming video.This capability is intended to increase situational awareness during an emergency and improve the ability of the public safety community to effectively engage in those critical activities. Description of the Proposed Action The Proposed Action would encompass the design, construction, and operation of the nationwide NPSBN by FirstNet or a partner organization(s). By statute, the network must have several characteristics, including security, resiliency, backwards compatibility with existing commercial networks, integration with public safety answering points (PSAPs) or their equivalents, substantial rural coverage, it must be built to open, non-proprietary, commercially available standards, and it must use existing infrastructure to the maximum extent economically desirable. FirstNet intends to construct a core network, comprised of all standard Evolved Packet Core elements under the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, device and location services, billing functions, and all other network elements other than the Radio Access Network (RAN). FirstNet expects to construct RAN networks that would consist of all cell site equipment. antennas, and backhaul equipment required to enable wireless communications with devices using the public safety broadband spectrum . Finally, the Act states that FirstNet must continue to maintain and improve the NPSBN to account for new and evolving technologies.

The Department of Environmental Quality (\"DEQ\") is responsible for coordinating Virginia's review of federal environmental documents prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\") and responding to appropriate federal officials on behalf of the Commonwealth. DEQ also coordinates Virginia's review of federal consistency determinations and certifications prepared pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (\"CZMA\") and the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program (\"VCP\"). DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED ACTION According to the Notice, the First Responder Network Authority (\"FirstNet\") is a unit of the Department of Congress, created by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-96, codified at Title 47, United States Code sections 1401 et seq.) and authorized to \"take all actions necessary to ensure the building, deployment, and operation of an interoperable, nationwide public safety broadband network.\" The network is intended to \"allow police officers, fire fighters, emergency medical service professionals, and other public safety entities to effectively communicate with each other across agencies and jurisdictions.\" (Notice, page 67157, center column). According to the Notice, FirstNet will prepare five regional Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements (PEISs) and conduct scoping meetings, notice of which will be given in the FirstNet\" web site (http://www.firstnet.gov). Following completion of the PEISs, proponents of proposed projects will submit site-specific environmental documentation to determine whether a proposed project warrants a Categorical Exclusion, an Environmental Assessment, or an Environmental Impact Statement. The concept of tiering (see National Environmental Policy Act regulations at Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, part 1508, section 1508.28) will be employed as FirstNet moves from the five PEISs to regional, basin-wide, or site-specific project considerations (Notice, pages 67156-67157).Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to comply with all requirements. 11/18/2014 Mail Ellie L.

Accordingly, we are sharing this response to the Notice, and copies of the Notice itself, with selected state and local Virginia agencies whose responsibilities may affect, or be affected by, the plans and/or projects considered in the PEIS covering the eastern states. These agencies are likely to include the following (note: starred (*) agencies administer one or more of the enforceable policies of the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Plan; see \"Federal Consistency ...\" heading, next):Department of Environmental Quality: -Office of Impact Review Office* Office* -Tidewater Regional Office -Valley Office -Blue Ridge Regional Office -Southwest Regional Office -Division of Air Program Coordination* -Division of Land Protection and Revitalization (formerly Waste Division)Office of Stormwater Management* Department of Conservation and Recreation Department of Health (Division of Water Programs*) Department of Game and Inland Fisheries*Virginia Marine Resources Commission* Department of Historic Resources Department of ForestryDepartment of TransportationDepartment of Mines, Minerals, and EnergyVirginia State PoliceDepartment of Emergency Management.In keeping with our regular practice, we will solicit comments from regional planning district commissions and localities when EISs, EAs, or federal consistency documents (again, see next heading) are prepared for programs or projects, based on their nature and geographic impacts.In order to ensure an effective coordinated review of the PEIS, we will require at least 19 copies of it when it is published. This submission may include at least 3 printed copies and 16 CDs, or at least 3 printed copies and an electronic copy available for download at a web site or ftp site. If the PEIS addresses geographic reach or impacts of the program or projects, then it should include one or more U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps as part of its information. We recommend, as well, that project details unfamiliar to people outside FirstNet be adequately described in the PEIS.Due to the nationwide scope of our current programmatic analysis and the considerable size of the documents, it may not be possible for FirstNet to provide hard copies of the draft and final documents to all interested parties. However, the documents will be available for download on our website to all interested parties. 11/18/2014 Mail Ellie L. Irons Commonwealth of VA - Department of Environmental QualityCoastal Zone Management ActFEDERAL CONSISTENCY UNDER THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT Pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended, and the Federal Consistency Regulations (15 CFR Part 930), federal projects with reasonably foreseeable effects on Virginia's coastal uses or resources must be conducted in a manner which is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program (VCP). The VCP is comprised of a network of programs administered by several agencies.FirstNet must submit a federal consistency determination (FCD) which analyzes the coastal effects of the project in light of the enforceable policies of the VCP (first enclosure), and provides a commitment to comply with the enforceable policies. In addition, we invite FirstNet's attention to the advisory policies of the VCP (second enclosure). Requirements for the contents of FCDs are found in the Federal Consistency Regulations (15 CFR Part 930, Sub-part D, sections 930.39) and also in DEQ's Federal Consistency Information Package (available online at http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/O/DEQ/EnvironmentallmpactReview/FederalConsistencyManual.7.27.1 1. pdf. The Federal Consistency Information Package defines Virginia's coastal zone, among other things.The Federal Consistency Regulations allow up to 60 days for our review of an FCD (15 CFR Part 930, Sub-part C, section 930.41(b)).The FCD may be submitted as a part of and EIS or separately, as you prefer. We recommend that the FCD for a particular project or plan be submitted with the Final EIS rather than the Draft EIS, in order that it reflect resolution of coastal issues that may arise during the comment period for the Draft EIS. In the event broadband network project proponents should seek FirstNet licensing or permitting for their projects, the Federal Consistency Regulations have slightly different requirements and time frames. Three examples of these differences will suffice here: The federal consistency document is called a \"federal consistency certification\" rather than a \"federal consistency determination.\" Projects or plans subject to federal licensing or permitting must be consistent with the enforceable policies of the VCP; the qualifier \"to the maximum extent practicable\"applies only to direct federal actions. The time frame for the state's response is 180 days, with a requirement that the state provide a progress report in 90 days and an explanation of the reason for furtherdelay in the response.The Federal Consistency Regulations address federal licensing and permitting in Sub - part D (sections 930.50 through 930.66).Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to comply with all requirements.

FirstNet intends to build, deploy and operate an interoperable, nationwide public safety broadband network based on a single national network which will allow police, fire emergency medical and other professionals and entities to effectively communicate with each other across agencies and jurisdictions. PRO comments for this project are as follows: Water: Where building and deployment cross or impact surface and groundwater features, erosion and sediment controls should be properly implemented and maintained throughout all phases of construction. E & S controls and Best Management Practices (BMPs) should be inspected/repaired before and after rain events. Please follow all standards and specifications under the Virginia DCR Erosion & Sediment Controls Handbook (1992, 3rd Edition). DEQ recommends maximizing pervious surface areas and green spaces in the construction design to reduce runoff and the environmental impact associated with urban runoff. Please contact Allison Dunaway at (804) 527-5086 for questions dealing with permitting of construction in and near wetlands. Please contact Emilee Adamson at (804) 527- 5072 for questions dealing with construction or industrial stormwater permitting.Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to comply with all requirements. 12/2/2014 Mail Mark Alling Commonwealth of VA - Department of Environmental QualityWaste Waste: Hazardous or solid waste materials generated should be tested and removed in accordance with the Virginia Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (9 VAC 20- 60) and/or the Virginia Solid Waste Management Regulations (9 VAC 20-80). Please understand that it is the generator's responsibility to determine if a solid waste meets the criteria of a hazardous waste and as a result be managed as such. In addition, asbestos waste, lead waste, or contaminated residues generated must be handled and disposed of in accordance with the VSWMR or VHWMR as applicable. DEQ recommends that pollution prevention principles be implemented to reduce the amount of wastes at the source, such as the re-use and recycling of waste materials.

BTW I met with four Firstnet people in Tucson at the scoping meeting. They brought professionalism and interest to it. I thought they included their contact information in the material they gave me, but I could not find it when I returned home. The first name of the leader was Genevieve and I would like very much to get in touch and thank her. Sincerely, MikeMichael l. RosenzweigDirectorTumamoc: People & HabitatsProfessorUniversity of ArizonaThank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesBecause of its location in the heart of Tucson, and its prominent elevation and many straight-line radio access paths to the city, this US National Historic Landmark was selected as one of the sites for a transmission tower in the Pima County system to insure interoperability among first responders. The tower is now working as legs for numerous antennae. But its construction was an historic mistake because it greatly erodes the integrity of the NHL.As it seems likely that FirstNet's new technology will collocate by default on the Tumamoc tower, I believe FirstNet needs to learn about the NHL so that its decisions will be fully informed and not directed to such a default position for lack of background data.I add that the County of Pima & The University of Arizona agreed that as new technology was needed to replace the old on Tumamoc, the new would be deployed elsewhere and the old removed from Tumamoc Hill.Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies to comply with all requirements. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesOwnership The Landmark has four major ownership divisions: 350 acres of fee simple land; owner, U of A 200 acres from the original U of A land grant 300 acres open space; owner, Pima County 20 acres of former landfill; owner, City of Tucson (capped with an ecologically sound, evapotranspirative layer of soil that makes it available for experiments)Thank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Biological Resources Ecology Founded as The Carnegie Desert Botanical Laboratory in 1903, it instantly became a leader in ecological research. In 1975, the US Department of the Interior designated part of it and some of its structures a US National Historical Landmark. In 1981, the State of Arizona designated the Hill an \"Environmental Research Natural Area.\" Most of what the world knows about the physiology and ecology of Arizona's iconic saguaro cactus comes from research that began on Tumamoc Hill in 1903 and continues to this very day. In 1985, University and USGS investigators were finally able to establish the nature of the sporadic reproduction of saguaros \u2014 it had taken us 80 years! More recently, the Hill hosted the discovery that the isotope ratios of saguaro cactus spines allow us to measure, for the first time, the climate of the Sonoran Desert during the past two centuries. And in 2014, one of its saguaros provided a tissue sample that resulted in the first genome description of any cactus species in the world.Tumamoc Hill is the site of nine plant ecology study quadrats that date from 1906 and are the world's oldest permanent ecology study plots. From 2010-2012, all quadrats were resurveyed with modern optical and digital tools, given GPS coordinates and recensused. All the data of the previous century-plus were digitized, filed with the National Park Service and made publicly available via the Ecological Society of America. Beginning in 1982, long transects were established to record and understand the ecology of more than 100 species of annuals (wildflowers). We now have an unbroken and growing record of 33 generations, capable of detecting subtle variations in environmental conditions such as water regime and weather.Thank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesConservation In 1987, the Interior Dept added the remainder of the 680-acre scientific reservation to the landmark in recognition of the Hill's importance to conservation. In 1906, it banished its active stone quarries and excluded domestic grazers and browsers with a 5(+) mile-long fence in order to allow the desert to return to a natural state. Thus was established the world's first restoration ecology project. It is the Hill's conservation status, one of national and international historical significance, whose integrity is severely damaged by the tower.Thank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesArchaeology For nearly half a century, research on Tumamoc Hill has produced archaeological knowledge about the people who farmed in Tucson starting thousands of years ago. Archaeological remains on the Hill include massive, 2300-yr old trincheras (encircling walls and terraces), more than 150 structures, an array of almost 1000 petroglyphs, and an elaborate prehistoric trail system. The Hill was the site of three successive hilltop settlements with masonry architecture. Very recent work with the isotopes in potsherds shows that, for two millennia or more, Native Americans have been gathering together on the Hill from all around the Tucson basin. In 2010, the US Department of the Interior designated the land and its remains, The Tumamoc Hill Archaeological District of the United States of America.The present communications tower and its associated structures sit on the mesa top where much of the most charismatic ruins are located.Archaeologists must quickly rebury any new excavation to protect it. Any hope of creating an educational experience for visitors is thwarted.Thank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesSignificance to Native American Cultures Tumamoc Hill is a centerpiece of the history of the ancestors of Arizona's O'odham, including the Tohono O'odham Nation, the Ak Chin Indian Community, the Gila River Indian Community, and the Salt River (Pima-Maricopa) Indian Community. The Hill is sacred to all of them. The same is true of the Hopi Nation, and the Pasqua Yaqui, too.Both the University of Arizona and Pima County respect the sensitivity and traditions of native people regarding Tumamoc Hill. The university and the Nations agreed in writing that the footprint of western culture on the Hill would not be increased. When their permission was sought by the county to erect the current tower, they consented only because they were told it was necessary to save lives. Absent that consideration, they would surely prefer to see the tower removed.Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and federally-recognized Indian tribes, to comply with all requirements.

Without promotion or marketing, \"Walking the Hill\" has become a Tucson institution woven into the fabric of the community, uniting people from every socio-economic group within our region. The Hill hosts approximately 300,000 to 500,000 walking trips per year. For many, their Tumamoc walk has become a daily ritual. Recently the University of Arizona College of Medicine has begun work on a research project focused on the walkers. It studies the effects of the green desert environment in the midst of an urban heat island on the allostatic load of stress, well-being and spirituality.Meanwhile, despite the crowds, the Hill has no security apparatus or personnel. Instead it relies on the honor and sound judgment of walkers to stay off the mesa top itself. But the need for good security for the FirstNet system would seem to promise tension between the need for reliable interoperability and the demand for liberal public use. Put simply, if FirstNet's needs interfere with easy access to Tumamoc by walkers, the result will be a sustained gnashing of teeth.Thank you for your comment. 12/15/2014 Email Attachment Michael Rosenzweig University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesSUMMARY OF IMPACTS Use of the mesa top of Tumamoc Hill for a communication tower to support interoperability in Pima County will have the following negative impacts. It will establish, far into the future, a communication superstructure that amounts to a serious cultural, environmental and historical mistake. It will erode the integrity of a National Historic Landmark. It will prevent important archaeological resources from being made available to educate the public. Either it will risk a clash between public use of the Hill for recreation, or else it will occupy an area without security. It will frustrate the desire of six Native American nations to reduce the presence of unwelcome technical apparatus on a Hill invested with deep religious significance.Michael Rosenzweig 15 December 2014Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and federally-recognized Indian tribes, to comply with all requirements.

In recent time they established unique baseline data on desert plants that span most of the century. They organization is unique and the facility priceless. I hope you can help protect it with FirstNet.SincerelyPaul DaytonThank you for your comment. 12/16/2014 Email Rich Watson Public Cultural / Historic resourcesI recently heard about the future involvement of First Net on Tumamoc Hill and am encouraged that the Federal Government is concerned about secure communications. However, on a more personal level, I am concerned about maintaining the integrity of this unique and irreplaceable historical and scientific resource. Unique, in part, because it has been guarded, researched and protected by the University of Arizona and many others for over a century.In ancient times, this was home to native people long before Europeans imagined our existence and a strong remnant of those people is still intact on the property. In addition, severe encroachment by recreational users (welcomed with sensitivity), the City of Tucson and high traffic on the perimeter causes substantial risk to this delicate property.Prior to construction of the new towers on Tumamoc, I was personally involved in discussions relating to use, impact and future maintenance. When bonds are passed, funding is available and agreement reached between multiple agencies and jurisdictions it is easy to make well intended promises. Such promises were made prior to the tower development with good intentions. History dictates that memories become short and promises are forgotten over time.In this particular case, it is my sincere hope that you take seriously your new responsibility as a joint caretaker of the history, management and protection of Tumamoc. Once damaged or destroyed, it can never be restored. Consequently, it is imperative that all who are caretakers never lose vigilance as we move into the future. Please respect the ancient people, the century of scientific study and Dr.Michael Rosensweig, who is a highly qualified and deeply invested steward of this property.Rich WatsonOnce specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and federally-recognized Indian tribes, to comply with all requirements. 12/16/2014 Email Russell P.

The hill was used by prehistoric people at least as long ago as 500 B.C. The summit is surrounded by low basalt \"walls\" (linear rock piles extending for many yards), and the summit itself contains dozens of prehistoric pit structures. There are also over 700 examples of prehistoric rock art on the summit and slopes of the hill. These were recently recorded and published as \"Tumamoc Rock Art Revisited: With a Focus on Temporal Affiliation and Management\" by Gayle Harrison Hartmann and Peter C. Boyle. The monograph was part of Arizona State Museum Archaeological Series No. 208; the entire publication was entitled New Perspectives on the Rock Art and Prehistoric Settlement Organization of Tumamoc hill, Tucson, Arizona, edited by Gayle Harrison Hartmann and Peter C. Boyle. It is extremely important that no damage be done to the basalt \"walls,\" (trincheras in Spanish), pit house structures, rock art and other manifestations of prehistoric or historic activity on the hill.

Smith Public Cultural / Historic resourcesDear Ms. Pereira; As a Pima County resident and an avid archaeological enthusiast, I am extremely concerned about the proposed impact to the most important site, both historically and archaeologically, in Pima County - Tumamoc Hill. This site is extremely important for ongoing research about Hohokam Cultures, as well as immense local historical value to many of Pima County's first pioneer families, the University of Arizona, the UA School of Anthropology and the Arizona State Museum. Please help protect Tumamoc Hill by limiting the proposed construction to the existing antenna pads. I fully realize the importance of providing advanced communications for our first responders, but it is also important to protect the ancient trincheras sites and petroglyphs such as those found on Tumamoc Hill that we can never replace or restore once impacted. So many important archaeological sites in Pima County have been lost in recent years; we just can not afford to lose a treasure as important as Tumamoc Hill. As a proud member the Arizona State Museum, the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society and Archaeology Southwest, I am committed to offer whatever help or assistance is needed to develop a plan that will provide the necessary communications structure and preserve this irreplaceable Hohokam site.

I am in complete support of creating a first responders wifi network, but respectfully ask that any new hardware installations on Tumamoc Hill be confined to existing hardware sites so that the rest of this precious archeological site remains. It is wonderful to think of using the internet to help our first responders in disasters and emergencies. It is also wonderful that you'all are so ready to be partners in preserving the rest of the aspects of this site.Thank you, Judith Reisman, site stewardThank you for your comment. 12/22/2014 Email Kaitlin Meadows & Albert Lannon Wild Heart Ranch Cultural / Historic resourcesPlease limit FirstNet construction on Tucson's Tumamoc Hill to existing antenna sites so that new footprints are not created. Any new work away from already-disturbed areas will impact negatively on ancient archeological sites, sites that contain habitation and farming areas, rock art with an amazing number of solstice and equinox markers, and artifacts that continue to help archaeologists understand the ancient history of this important area. Several years ago we helped document some of those solstice markers. To stand on the top of Tumamoc Hill as the sun rose in the east and the full moon set in the west on the Winter Solstice and see the sudden light -- \"sun daggers\"-- on petroglyphs mark the changing of the season was a magical and humbling experience. It speaks to the knowledge, skill, and ability of those ancient people as something well worth preserving.Thank you,Kaitlin Meadows & Albert LannonThank you for your comment. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Appendix B Scoping Summary August 2017 B-45Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response 12/22/2014 Email Katherine Cerino Arizona Archaeological and Historical SocietyCultural / Historic resourcesFirst, I am pleased with the Firstnet efforts - this seems like a very sensible idea. The purpose of this note is to bring to your attention the importance archaeologically of Tumamoc Hill in Tucson. The Hill has already been impacted by many towers some of which are no longer in use. I would like to ensure that the development you carry out on the Hill uses the existing disturbed footprint rather than adding to it. The Hill is archaeologically unique in the Tucson Basin in that it has some of the earliest habitation sites dating to 500 BC and some of the earliest pottery in the Basin. It was later used by the Hohokam people who pecked rock art over a great deal of the hill concentrating on the top where developmental impact is greatest. In addition, there are unique prehistoric walls around the hill. It was clearly an important and sacred place in the past and if you go up there today and simply look at the spectacular 380 degree view without even considering the importance of the past it is obviously a special place. Thank you,Katherine CerinoThank you for your comment. 12/22/2014 Email Lance Trask Public Cultural / Historic resourcesDear Sir or Madam; I applaud the government for coming up with plans to have Wi-Fi available to first responders and an agency to oversee those plans. Communication at the beginning of an event is critical and can make the difference between life and death. It is likely that antennae(s) or repeaters will be considered at a location called Tumamoc Hill. It is ideal because it has a 360 degree view of a considerable portion of Southern Arizona. It is also on the National Register and holds valuable cultural resources. Some disturbances have already occurred on Tumamoc Hill and I urge you to consider placing any equipment in areas already impacted. Access to the top of the hill is via existing roads and these roads should be adequate for transporting and installing the equipment for the proposed Wi-Fi system. Currently the top of the hill is off limits and behind locked gates, so any installed equipment will be fairly well protected. I also urge you to work closely with the archaeological community within the Tucson area as they can provide expertise and work with the agency so it's needs are met and the cultural resources are preserved for the future.Thank you very much,Lance K.

I've called Tucson home for fifty 50 years and worked downtown for the last 38. I've had the privilege of spending time atop the hill with extraordinary experts Paul and Suzi Fish, as well as fascinating petroglyph experts. I've sadly watched Tumamoc being \"loved too much\" by looters, and \"loved too little\" by Pima County's and the University of Arizona's budgetary stinginess. Too much irreversible damage has been done already.Please encourage Firstnet to be extraordinarly sensitive to the unique culture treasures still left on Tumamoc, minimize work to existing pads and overall trod with the lightest footprint possible.

As a result the Pima County Board of Supervisors, upon which Iserve,bought 320 acres of land on and around the hill in 2009 to protect it from development and unsuitable uses. There are now 860 acres of land on and around the hill protected in perpetuity.This hill was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years, ancestors of today's Tohono O'Odham Nation members, and carries an O'Odham name, Tumamoc, which is their word for horned lizard. Remains of their residency and farming on the hill are visible and subject of substantial study.FirstNet does not yet have a network design, however we will work to avoid adverse impacts to sensitive resources wherever possible.

I think this is a wonderful goal for our nation, but I realize this may also impact a very important historical/archaeological site - the ancient trincheras on Tumamoc Hill in Tucson, AZ. Would you please consider restricting construction to the existing antenna pads so that as little impact as possible occurs to this historic area?Although I have lived in Tucson for 13 years, I only recently visited this site through the auspices of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society. I had no idea that there were trincheras there dated to 300 B.C., and that there was evidence of Hohokam settlement dating to 800 A.D. I saw some amazing rock art, as well as evidence of solar markers and alignments.It's an impressive site so close to a major urban area, and one that needs to be preserved for everyone to be able to have to same opportunity as I had to learn and enjoy part of our southwestern legacy.I hope you will be able to complete your Wi-Fi goal as well as helping preserve this important landmark.

Thus, I wanted to write to you to express the value of Tumamoc so that this information can be applied when evaluating the potential impacts of any proposed Firstnet activities on or around Tumamoc. Tumamoc Hill is a National Historic Landmark, a U.S. Archaeological District, and its value to the local, regional, national, and global communities are immense.

Flesch, Ph.D. University of Arizona Biological Resources As an ecologist that works on the Hill, and as a member of the Tucson community that walks the Hill and helps interpret its natural history and ecology to the public, I can speak specifically about Tumamoc's ecological and social values. In the first decade of the 1900s, some of our nation's first ecologists were tasked with locating a site to study desert plants and placing what would become the US' first ecological research station. At that time when the landscape was largely undeveloped and options for placing the stations nearly unlimited, they considered sites in Arizona, New Mexico, California, and the neighboring Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua. In the end, they chose Tumamoc for the site because of its remarkable diversity, exceptional natural qualities, and the fact that the Hill and surroundings included a large number of plant communities for study. Those facts speak to the uniqueness and incredible value of the Hill and the natural vegetation that still covers it. For the next 100 years scientists working on the Hill have made immeasurable contributions to our understanding of how the natural world is structured and how it functions, and those activities continue to this day under the leadership of Director Rosenzweig.Thank you for your comment. 12/24/2014 Email Aaron D. Flesch, Ph.D. University of Arizona Aesthetics / Recreational UseAs the surroundings around the Hill have changed over the last 100 years, the values of Tumamoc have grown. Tumamoc sees tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands of visitors each year of all ages and backgrounds. Many of those visitors live in a suburban or urban environment where they have little opportunity to experience the Sonoran Desert in its natural state and to connect with nature on deeper spiritual and aesthetic levels. Those qualities and experiences are offered by Tumamoc because of its close proximity to those populations and the accessibility the University of Arizona and the station's Director have provided.

Pima County Sustainability and ConservationCultural / Historic resourcesDear Ms. Pereira: This letter is a response to the request for comments on the proposed undertaking published in the Notice in the Federal Register (Vol. 79, No. 218). Tumamoc Hill has several important federal and state designations. Comprised of some 870 acres, it is an Archaeological District listed in the National Register of Historic Places and the Desert Laboratory was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. In 1976, the Desert Laboratory and Tumamoc Hill were together designated a National Environmental Study Area by the Department of Interior; and designated by the State of Arizona as a State Scientific and Educational Natural Area in 1981. Tumamoc Hill is also considered a traditional cultural property and ancestral site to local Tribes.Tumamoc Hill's peak rises to an elevation of 3,108 ft (947 m) above sea level. Located just west of downtown Tucson in T14S, R13E, Sections 9, 10, 16, and 15, the preservation of its cultural and scientific significance is of great importance to the local community and at a national level. Land ownership includes the University of Arizona on behalf of the Board of Regents, Pima County, Arizona State Land Department, and the City of Tucson.Archaeol ogical surveys of Tumamoc Hill began in the 1970s followed by subsequent limited archaeological excavations. Known as Cemamagi Do'ag in O'odham,Tumamoc Hill, archaeological site designated AZ AA:16 :6(ASM)], is known to have multiple prehistoric occupations that left behind remnants of large rock walls ( trincheras) , petroglyphs, agricultural fields, pithouses, and O'odham cemeteries.A recent undertaking on Tumamoc Hill included the consolidation of wireless facilities and replacing several towers with a single communications tower (by the Pima County Wireless Integrative Network (PCWIN) project implemented in 2014). As the construction included consolidation and the dismantling unused buildings, the overall footprint was reduced . State, Federal, and Tribal consultation resulted in a determination of Adverse Effect to the Area of Potential Effect for Direct Effects and for Visual Effects to the Tumamoc Hill Archaeologi cal District. The undertaking licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required an Environmental Assessment to fulfill requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and a Memorandum of Agreement was executed to fulfill Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Mitigation strategies included archaeological data recovery and cultural sensitivity education program in accordance with the Arizona State Historic Preservation Office and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation .The Univers ity of Arizona Tumamoc Hill Cultural Resources Policy and Management Plan (2008) specifies tribal interests in restoring Tumamoc Hill to its former natural condition.FirstNet does not yet have a network design, however we will work to avoid adverse impacts to sensitive resources wherever possible.

This is an area of cultural significance to the Tohono O'odham Tribe from the 15th Century to modern times. It also contains evidence of occupation from the Early Agricultural Period of the indigenous people as far back as 2,000 years ago as well as the Hohokam people circa A.D. 800 (1100 years ago). This length of human occupation is highly significant and an important reason why modern construction in this area should not be expanded. The University of Arizona currently manages many currently active research projects into the cultural and biological resources of this area. This is an additional reason why expansion of present areas impacted construction should not be allowed. Perhaps most important of all is the impact to the Tohono O'odham people who have used this area for at least five centuries and continue to use it today. As the first Americans, we should respect their longstanding rights to use of Tumamoc Hill as our first priority.

The purpose of the proposed action is typically the specific objectives of the activity, while the need for the proposed action may be to eliminate a broader underlying problem or take advantage of an opportunity. Recommendation: The purpose and need should be a clear, objective statement of the rationale for the proposed project.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXAlternatives Alternatives Analysis The National Environmental Policy Act requires evaluation of reasonable alternatives, including those that may not be within the jurisdiction of the lead agency (40 CFR Section 1502.14(c)). A robust range of alternatives will include options for avoiding significant environmental impacts. The DPEIS should provide a clear discussion of the reasons for the elimination of alternatives which are not evaluated in detail. Alternative network routes, including buried or aerial options, as well as environmentally preferable routes, should be evaluated. The DPEIS should also evaluate alternative configurations for access roads.The alternatives analysis should describe the approach used to identify the alternative routes and the criteria used to select the different routes. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives should be presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decision maker and the public (40 CFR 1502.14). The potential environmental impacts of each alternative shouldbe quantified to the greatest extent possible (e.g., acres of forest impacted, tons per year of emissions produced). Recommendations: The DPEIS should describe how each alternative was developed, how it addresses each project objective, and how it will be implemented. The DPEIS should describe the methodology and criteria used for determining the network route and alternative routes. The alternatives analysis should include a discussion of environmentally preferable options for the network, including the use of underground cables versus overhead wires; alternative configurations for access roads; and alternative methods of construction, such as using heavy lift helicopters to transport and set cell towers.The DPEIS should clearly describe the rationale used to determine whether impacts of an alternative are significant or not. Thresholds of significance should be determined by considering the context and intensity of an action and its effects (40 CFR 1508.27).The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Appendix B Scoping Summary August 2017 B-51Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response Water Resources Geographic Extent of Waters of the United States The project applicant should coordinate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine if the proposed project requires a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act. Section 404 regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States (WUS), including wetlands and other special aquatic sites. The DPEIS should describe all WUS that could be affected by the project alternatives, and include maps that clearly identify all waters within the project area. A jurisdictional delineation will confirm the presence or absence of WUS in the project area and help determine whether ornot the proposed project would require a Section 404 permit. Recommendation: The DPEIS should discuss the potential that WUS could be affected and that consultation with the USACE may be required to determine if there are jurisdictional WUS present at individual project sites. Drainages, Ephemeral Washes, and Floodplains Natural washes perform a diversity of hydrologic, biochemical, and geochemical functions that directly affect the integrity and functional condition of higher-order waters downstream. Healthy ephemeral waters with characteristic plant communities control rates of sediment deposition and dissipate the energy associated with flood flows. Ephemeral washes also provide habitat for breeding, shelter, foraging, and movement of wildlife. Many plant populations are dependent on these aquatic ecosystems and adapted to their unique conditions. The potential damage that could result from disturbance of flat-bottomed washes includes alterations to the hydrological functions that natural channels provide in arid ecosystems, such as adequate capacity for flood control, energy dissipation, and sediment movement; as well as impacts to valuable habitat for desert species. Recommendations: The DPEIS should discuss the potential that individual projects may impact aquatic features that are determined not to constitute WUS, and discuss potential mitigation. The DPEIS should address the potential effects of project discharges, if any, on surface water quality. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXBiological Resources Biological Resources, Habitat and Wildlife The DPEIS should identify all petitioned and listed threatened and endangered species and critical habitat that might occur within individual project areas. The document should identify and quantify which species or critical habitat might be directly, indirectly, or cumulatively affected by each alternative and mitigate impacts to these species. Emphasis should be placed on the protection and recovery of species due to their status or potential status under the federal or state Endangered Species Act. Network line rights of way are anthropogenic disturbances which alter the spatial structure of habitat elements, creating linear patches or line corridors which in tum impact ecological integrity by modifying ecological processes (abiotic & biotic) at various scales. Network line ROWs can result in habitat fragmentation and increased habitat edge effects, affecting individual species with different intensity. Recommendations: The DPEIS should discuss how the proposed action would comply with ESA requirements, including any necessary ESA Section 7 consultation efforts with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. EPA recommends that FirstNet coordinate with USFWS field offices and with applicable state biological resource management agencies to ensure that current and consistent surveying, monitoring, and reporting protocols will be applied in protection and mitigation efforts. The DPEIS should describe the potential for habitat fragmentation and obstructions for wildlife movement from the construction of individual projects and other projects in the area. Discuss the need for monitoring, mitigation, and if applicable, translocation management plans for the sensitive biological resources. This could include, but is not limited to, a Bird and Bat Conservation Strategy, a Raven Monitoring, Management, and Control Plan, and Special - Status Plant Impact Avoidance and Mitigation Plan. The DPEIS should include assurances that the design of the aerial lines would be in compliance with current standards and practices that reduce the potential for raptor fatalities and injuries.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Water Resources The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXAnn McPherson Email Attachment 12/29/2014 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Appendix B Scoping Summary August 2017 B-52Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response The EPA is also concerned about the potential impacts of construction, installation, and maintenance activities (grading, filling) on habitat. We encourage the use of alternatives that avoid and protect high value habitat and create or preserve linkages between habitat areas. We are also concerned with management of the ROW, specifically vegetation control, in order to prevent natural forest succession. ROW management is usually practiced to protect the system from windfall, contact with trees and branches, and other potential hazards. Additionally access roads are maintained in order to ensure access for maintenance and upkeep of the system components. Recommendations: , The DPEIS should describe potential impacts from construction, installation, and maintenance activities on habitat and threatened and endangered species. The DPEIS should describe the ROW vegetation management techniques to be used and potential associated environmental impacts, especially if mechanical methods or herbicides are to be used. The DPEIS should indicate the location of important wildlife habitat areas. The DPEIS should describe what measures will be taken to protect important wildlife habitat areas and to preserve linkages between them. Invasive Species Human actions are the primary means of invasive species introductions. The construction of network lines may cause disturbance of ROW soils and vegetation through the movement of people and vehicles along the ROW, access roads, and laydown areas. These activities can contribute to the spread of invasive species. Parts of plants, seeds, and root stocks can contaminate construction equipment and essentially \"seed\" invasive species wherever the vehicle travels. Invasive species infestations can also occur during periodic buried/aerial line ROW maintenance activities especially if these activities include mowing and clearing of vegetation. Once introduced, invasive species will likely spread and impact adjacent properties with the appropriate habitat. Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species (February 3, 1999), mandates that federal agencies take actions to prevent the introduction of invasive species, provide for their control, and minimize the economic, ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause. Executive Order 13112 also calls for the restoration of native plants and tree species. If the proposed project will entail new landscaping, the DPEIS should describe how the project will meet the requirements of Executive Order 13112. In addition, we encourage alternative management practices that limit herbicide use, focusing instead on other methods to limit invasive species vegetation and decrease fire risk. Recommendations: The DPEIS should describe the invasive plant management plan used to monitor and control noxious weeds. If herbicides or pesticides will be used to manage vegetation, the DPEIS should disclose the projected quantities and types of chemicals. The invasive plant management plan should identify methods that can be used to limit the introduction and spread of invasive species during and post-construction. These measures can include marking and avoidance of invasive species, timing construction activities during periods that would minimize their spread, proper cleaning of equipment, and proper disposal of woody material removed from the ROW. Because construction measures may not be completely effective in controlling the introduction and spread of invasives, the DPEIS should describe post-construction activities that will be required such as surveying for invasive species following restoration of the construction site and measures that will be taken if infestations are found.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Air Quality The DPEIS should provide a discussion of ambient air conditions (baseline or existing conditions), National Ambient Air Quality Standards, criteria pollutant nonattainment areas, and potential air quality impacts.The DPEIS should describe and estimate air emissions from potential construction and maintenance activities, as well as proposed mitigation measures to minimize those emissions. The EPA recommends an evaluation of the following measures to reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants and hazardous air pollutants (air toxics).Recommendations: Existing Conditions - The DPEIS should provide a detailed discussion of ambient air conditions, NAAQS, and criteria pollutant nonattainment areas in the vicinity of the project. Quantify Emissions - The DPEIS should estimate emissions of criteria pollutants and green house gasses from the proposed individual projects and discuss the timeframe for release of these emissions over the lifespan of the projects. The DPEIS should describe and estimate emissions from potential construction activities, as well as proposed mitigation measures to minimize these emissions. Specify Emission Sources - The DPEIS should specify the emission sources by pollutant from mobile sources, stationary sources, and ground disturbance. This source specific information should be used to identify appropriate mitigation measures and areas in need of the greatest attention. Construction Emissions Mitigation Plan -The DPEIS should include a draft Construction Emissions Mitigation Plan and ultimately adopt this plan in the Record of Decision.In addition to all applicable local, state, or federal requirements, we recommend the following control measures (Fugitive Dust, Mobile and Stationary Source and Administrative) be included in the Construction Emissions Mitigation Plan in order to reduce impacts associated with emissions of particulate matter and other toxics from construction-related activities:The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.

We recommend that the plan include these general commitments: Stabilize heavily used unpaved construction roads with a non-toxic soil stabilizer or soil weighting agent that will not result in loss of vegetation, or increase otherenvironmental impacts. During grading, use water, as necessary, on disturbed areas in construction sites to control visible plumes. Vehicle Speed Limit speeds to 25 miles per hour on stabilized unpaved roads as long as such speeds do not create visible dust emissions. Limit speeds to 10 miles per hour or less on unpaved areas within construction sites on un-stabilized (and unpaved) roads. Post visible speed limit signs at construction site entrances. Inspect and wash construction equipment vehicle tires, as necessary, so they are free of dirt before entering paved roadways, if applicable. Provide gravel ramps of at least 20 feet in length at tire washing/cleaning stations, and ensure construction vehicles exit construction sites through treated entrance roadways, unless an alternative route has been approved by appropriate lead agencies, if applicable. Use sandbags or equivalent effective measures to prevent run-off to roadways in construction areas adjacent to paved roadways. Ensure consistency with the project's Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, if such a plan is required for the project Sweep the first 500 feet of paved roads exiting construction sites, other unpaved roads en route from the construction site, or construction staging areas whenever dirt orrunoff from construction activity is visible on paved roads, or at least twice daily (less during periods of precipitation). Stabilize disturbed soils (after active construction activities are completed) with a non-toxic soil stabilizer, soil weighting agent, or other approved soil stabilizing method. Cover or treat soil storage piles with appropriate dust suppressant compounds and disturbed areas that remain inactive for longer than 10 days. Provide vehicles (used to transport solid bulk material on public roadways and that have potential to cause visible emissions) with covers. Alternatively, sufficiently wet and load materials onto the trucks in a manner to provide at least one foot of freeboard. Use wind erosion control techniques (such as windbreaks, water, chemical dust suppressants, and/or vegetation) where soils are disturbed in construction, access and maintenance routes, and materials stock pile areas. Keep related windbreaks in place until the soil is stabilized or permanently covered with vegetation.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Appendix B Scoping Summary August 2017 B-54Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response o Mobile and Stationary Source Controls: If practicable, lease new, clean equipment meeting the most stringent of applicable Federal 1 or State Standards.2 In general, commit to the best available emissions control technology. Tier 4 engines should be used for project construction equipment to the maximum extent feasible.3 Where Tier 4 engines are not available, use construction diesel engines with a rating of 50 hp or higher that meet, at a minimum, the Tier 3 California Emission Standards for Off-Road Compression-Ignition Engines,4 unless such engines are not available. Where Tier 3 engine is not available for off-road equipment larger than 100 hp, use a Tier 2 engine, or an engine equipped with retrofit controls to reduce exhaustemissions of nitrogen oxides and diesel particulate matter to no more than Tier 2 levels. Consider using electric vehicles, natural gas, biodiesel, or other alternative fuels during construction and operation phases to reduce the project's criteria and greenhouse gas emissions. Plan construction scheduling to minimize vehicle trips. Limit idling of heavy equipment to less than 5 minutes and verify through unscheduled inspections. Maintain and tune engines per manufacturer's specifications to perform at EPA certification levels, prevent tampering, and conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure these measures are followed.o Administrative controls: Develop a construction traffic and parking management plan that maintains traffic flow and plan construction to minimize vehicle trips. Identify any sensitive receptors in the project area, such as children, elderly, and the infirm, and specify the means by which impacts to these populations will be minimized (e.g. locate construction equipment and staging zones away from sensitive receptors and building air intakes). Include provisions for monitoring fugitive dust in the fugitive dust control plan and initiate increased mitigation measures to abate any visible dust plumes.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXInfrastructure Hardening of Infrastructure We understand that FirstNet will likely utilize existing commercial infrastructure to the maximum extent possible in its deployment of the Public Safety Broadband Network. Most likely, existing cellular towers, transport backhaul and data centers will need to be hardened to meet the stringent requirements of the PSBN. Hardening typically includes back up power supply, incorporating backhaul that is not easily disrupted (microwave or satellite), and stockpiling portable sites (Cell on Light Trucks or Cell on Wheels). Some of the larger cell phone companies have been hardening their infrastructure in disaster prone areas. Recommendation: The DPEIS should discuss the need for hardening sites, the use of portable equipment and the need for redundant or alternative backhaul equipment. FirstNet should commit to using as much commercially available equipment as possible and consider using as much renewable energy sources for backup power as is economically feasible.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXClimate Change Climate Change Scientific evidence supports the concern that continued increases in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities will contribute to climate change. Global warming is caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. On December 7, 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of GHGs contribute to air pollution that \"endangers public health and welfare\" within the meaning of the Clean Air Act. One report indicates that observed changes in temperature, sea level, precipitation regime, fire frequency, and agricultural and ecological systems reveal .that parts of the western United States is already experiencing the measurable effects of climate change. 5 The report indicates that climate change could result in the following changes: poor air quality; more severe heat; increased wildfires; shifting vegetation; declining forest productivity; decreased spring snowpack; water shortages; a potential reduction in hydropower; a loss in winter recreation; agricultural damages from heat, pests, pathogens, and weeds; and rising sea levels resulting in shrinking beaches and increased coastal floods. Recommendation: The DPEIS should consider how climate change could potentially influence the proposed project, specifically within sensitive areas, and assess how the projected impacts could be exacerbated by climate change.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXWaste Hazardous Materials/Hazardous Waste/Solid Waste The DPEIS should address potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of hazardous waste from construction and operation of the proposed individual projects and facilities. The document should identify projected hazardous waste types and volumes, and expected storage, disposal, and management plans. It should address the applicability of state and federal hazardous waste requirements. Appropriate mitigation should be evaluated, including measures to minimize the generation of hazardous waste (i.e., hazardous waste minimization). Alternate industrial processes using less toxic materials should be evaluated as mitigation since such processes could reduce the volume or toxicity of hazardous materials requiring management and disposal as hazardous waste.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.

These resources should be characterized in terms of their response to change and capacity to withstand stresses. Trends data should be used to establish a baseline for the affected resources, to evaluate the significance of historical degradation, and to predict the environmental effects of the project components. For the cumulative impacts assessment, we recommend focusing on resources of concern or resources that are \"at risk\" and/or are significantly impacted by the proposed project, before mitigation. The EPA supports a regional assessment of the potential cumulative effects of other projects in the area to a range of resources, including aquatic, biological, and cultural resources. These findings should help inform current and future development proposed in the region. The EPA assisted in the preparation of a guidance document for assessing cumulative impacts in California that we find to be very useful. While this guidance was prepared for transportation projects in California, the principles and the 8-step process outlined therein can be applied to other types of projects and offers a systematic way to analyze cumulative impacts for a project. The guidance is available at: http://www.dot.ca.gov/ser/cumulative_guidance/purpose.htm. In accordance with this guidance, the EPA recommends that the DPEIS identify which resources are analyzed, which ones are not, and why. For each resource analyzed, the DPEIS should: Identify the current condition of the resource as a measure of past impacts. For example, the percentage of species habitat lost to date. Identify the trend in the condition of the resource as a measure of present impacts. For example, the health of the resource is improving, declining, or in stasis. Identify all on-going, planned, and reasonably foreseeable projects in the study area that may contribute to cumulative impacts. Identify the future condition of the resource based on an analysis of impacts from reasonably foreseeable projects or actions added to existing conditions and currenttrends. Assess the cumulative impacts contribution of the proposed alternatives to the long-term health of the resource, and provide a specific measure for the projected impactfrom the proposed alternatives. When cumulative impacts are identified for a resource, mitigation should be proposed. Disclose the parties that would be responsible for avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating those adverse impacts. Identify opportunities to avoid and minimize impacts, including working with other entities. Recommendations: The DPEIS should consider the cumulative impacts associated with other development projects proposed in the individual project areas and the potential impacts on various The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Coordination with Tribal Governments Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (November 6, 2000), was issued in order to establish regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications, and to strengthen the United States government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes. Recommendation: The DPEIS should describe the process and outcome of government-to-government consultation between FirstNet and each of the tribal governments within the individual project areas, issues that were raised (if any), and how those issues were addressed in the selection of the proposed alternative.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. National Historic Preservation Act and Executive Order 13007 Consultation for tribal cultural resources is required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Historic properties under the NHPA are properties that are included in the National Register of Historic Places or that meet the criteria for the National Register. Section 106 of the NHPA requires a federal agency, upon determining that activities under its control could affect historic properties,consult with the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer/Tribal Historic Preservation Officer. Under NEPA, any impacts to tribal, cultural, or other treaty resources must be discussed and mitigated. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that Federal agencies consider the effects of their actions on cultural resources, following regulation in 36 CFR 800. Executive Order 13007, Indian Sacred Sites (May 24, 1996), requires federal land managing agencies to accommodate access to, and ceremonial use of, Indian sacred sites by Indian Religious practitioners, and to avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity, accessibility, or use of sacred sites. It is important to note that a sacred site may not meet the National Register criteria for a historic property and that, conversely, a historic property may not meet the criteria for a sacred site. Recommendation: The DPEIS should address the existence of Indian sacred sites in the individual project areas. It should address Executive Order 13007, distinguish it from Section 106 of the NHPA, and discuss how FirstNet will avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity, accessibility, or use of sacred sites, if they exist. The DPEIS should provide a summary of all coordination with Tribes and with the SHPO/THPO (if any), including identification of NRHP eligible sites, and development of a Cultural Resource Management Plan.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Email Attachment Ann McPherson U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXEnvironmental Justice Environmental Justice and Impacted Communities Executive Order 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations (February 11, 1994) and the Interagency Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice (August 4, 2011) direct federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations, allowing those populations a meaningful opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.Guidance6 by CEQ clarifies the terms low-income and minority population (which includes Native Americans) and describes the factors to consider when evaluating disproportionately high and adverse human health effects. Recommendations: The DPEIS should discuss the potential need to evaluate environmental justice populations within the geographic scope of the individual projects. If such populations exist, the DPEIS should discuss the potential for disproportionate adverse impacts to minority and low-income populations, and the approaches used to foster public participation by these populations. Assessment of the projects impact on minority and low-income populations should reflect coordination with those affected populations. The DPEIS should discuss the potential need to provide outreach to all communities that could be affected by the individual projects.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.

It can affect humans, many species of mammals and some reptiles .7 The fungus, Coccidioides, is endemic in the soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. Coccidioides can live for long periods of time in soil under harsh environmental conditions including heat, cold, and drought. 8 Coccidioides can be released into the air when soil containing the fungus is disturbed, either by strong winds or activities such as farming or construction. Distribution of the fungus is typically patchy, but in some \"hot spots,\" up to 70% of the human population has been infected.The number of reported Valley Fever cases in the U.S. has risen from less than 5,000 in 2001 to more than 20,000 cases in 2011.9 An estimated 150,000 more cases go undiagnosed every year. The majority of reported cases are located in Arizona and California. 10 The reason for the recent increase in cases, however, is unclear. Dust storms in endemic areas are often followed by outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis. If the dust storms are severe, the fungal spores can be carried outside the endemic area into neighboring counties, where outbreaks follow. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, workers engaged in soil-disturbing activities in endemic areas should be considered at risk for the disease. 12 Occupational groups at risk include farmers, agricultural workers, construction workers and archaeologists. Some groups of people appear tobe at increased risk for disseminated disease and can become seriously ill when infected. People at risk for severe disease include those with weakened immune systems, persons with cancer or who are on chemotherapy, or persons who are HIV-infected. Also at higher risk for serious illness are the elderly, persons of African or Filipino descent, and women in the third trimester of pregnancy.Recommendations:The EPA recommends that the DPEIS discuss potential exposures to the fungus, Coccidioides, and susceptibilities of workers and nearby residents to Valley Fever due to soil-disturbing activities of the project.The Environmental Awareness Program for the workers should include training on the health hazards of Valley Fever, how it is contracted, what symptoms to look for, proper work procedures, how to use personal protective equipment, the need to wash prior to eating, smoking or drinking and at the end of the shift, and the need to inform the supervisor of suspected symptoms of work- related Valley Fever. The training should identify those groups of individuals most at risk and urge individuals to seek prompt medical treatment if Valley Fever symptoms (flu-like illness with cough, fever, chest pain, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness) develop.The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statements will comply with all requirements under NEPA and other relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. 12/29/2014 Mail Diana Rhoades Public Cultural / Historic resourcesDear Ms. Pereira, Tumamoc Hill is a sacred place. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a landmark, it is a University research station, studying plants and the changes in climate since 1903. It is a national archeological district, a burial ground for Native American People. It was an early trading post for the First People. It is rich in natural and cultural history.It should not be a place where the government places large towers or builds huge power lines.

I would like to offer the suggestion that Firstnet keep any new construction to areas of this hilltop that have already been disturbed by previous construction activities. We have known Tumamoc was an important archaeological site for 100 years, but it has only been in the past 10 years that the evidence has been understood in proper contexts. The ancient homes built on Tumamoc were constructed at the beginning of what we now know of as the ancient southwest culture area. The Cliff Dwellings in Mesa Verde, the stunning buildings of Chaco Canyon, the 5 story adobe Casa Grande, all of these places were built by a people who apparently got their start 4000 years ago, along the Santa Cruz River, where modern Tucson sits today. Though partially disturbed, the village on top of Tumamoc still contains evidence about how this pan-Southwestern culture began. What has not been destroyed should be preserved when ever possible.I think everyone in the archaeological community believes that your project needs to be supported, our community's safety has to come first. However, if new construction can be steered away from archaeologically critical areas, we also believe that we can achieve a win-win scenario here. Best Wishes, Doug Gann, Ph.D.Preservation ArchaeologistFirstNet does not yet have a network design, however we will work to avoid adverse impacts to sensitive resources wherever possible. Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and federally-recognized Indian tribes, to comply with all requirements. 12/29/2014 Email Scott Sysum U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region IXNOI Dear Ms. Pereira I have been assigned as the lead reviewer for the U.S. EPA Region 9 for the FirstNet National Public Safety Broadband Network PEIS Project.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions, seek clarifications or if we can help in any other way. v/r Scott SysumThank you for your comment. 12/30/2014 Email Attachment Public Alternatives The FirstNet Dilemma In order for FirstNet to succeed, it must provide broadband wireless service to public safety users for less than market rates. In addition, the FirstNet infrastructure must be more robust and more resilient than commercial wireless networks. The only way for FirstNet to achieve both of these goals is to leverage excess Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) capacity to create a revenue stream that subsidizes public safety user recurring monthly fees to the point that no commercial operator can undercut them. If the recurring monthly fees charged to public safety users by FirstNet is not significantly lower than commercial wireless rates, the commercial networks will likely simply lower their rates for public safety subscribers to undercut and undermine FirstNet. Financially strapped localities will likely choose the less expensive commercial network rather than subscribe to FirstNet, despite the fact that FirstNet will offer priority access to a more robust network. If such a scenario plays out, FirstNet will fail. Rather than becoming a customer of commercial wireless network operators, public safety should leverage the excess capacity in the NPSBN so that commercial operators and other secondary users become FirstNet customers, not vice versa. If Public Safety does not control the network, it will never achieve its goal of unrestricted priority access to broadband wireless, supported by a public safety grade (bulletproof) network infrastructure. One way to address the FirstNet Dilemma is for FirstNet to petition the FCC to issue an Order that would require all new 700MHz. broadband wireless subscriber devices be capable of accessing FirstNet spectrum (Band 14). This single regulatory action would create an immediate market for FirstNet spectrum, even in the absence of a deployed network. By creating an environment that ensures that band 14 capable devices become ubiquitous, the FCC Order would increase the value of FirstNet spectrum to potential lessees, enabling FirstNet to generate a revenue stream prior to the deployment of the NPSBN simply by leasing the spectrum until the NPSBN is ready to deploy in a given locale. In addition, the FCC Order would ensure the availability of band 14 devices and substantially lower their cost to public safety users when the NPSBN is deployed. Every day that FirstNet spectrum lays fallow is a lost opportunity to generate revenue that could help fund NPSBN construction, deployment and ongoing operating expenses. Once the NPSBN is deployed, FirstNet (or the designated local network operator) could continue to lease excess NPSBN capacity to secondary users through a public private partnership, thus reducing public safety user recurring user recurring monthly fees to a level far below commercial market rates, whilst encouraging public safety network participation and discouraging potential competitors. Thank you for your comment. 12/31/2014 Email Patricia A. Gilman, Ph.D., RPA University of Arizona Cultural / Historic resourcesMs. Pereira, I am writing in support of the idea that FirstNet use the existing antenna pads on Tumamoc Hill in Tucson. The entire top and sides of the hill are an archaeological site that is very important in the history of Tucson. It has hundreds of rock-ringed houses that are about 2000 years old along with petroglyphs and a very early community building. For an archaeologist like me, it is a very cool site because it has told us about the lives of people living at this time in the Tucson Basin. The site is unique, by the way. There are no others like it, which suggests its importance. Most of the site has not been excavated, and so there is much more we could learn here. But the most important thing is to preserve the site for the future so that others, both the public and archaeologists, can appreciate the lives of these people. Please do the right thing for the history of Tucson and use only the existing antenna pads. That way, everyone gets what they want and need.Thank you for you attention to this. Patricia A. Gilman, Ph.D., RPAFirstNet does not yet have a network design, however we will work to avoid adverse impacts to sensitive resources wherever possible. Once specific projects are identified, FirstNet will work with the appropriate federal, state, and local agencies, and federally-recognized Indian tribes, to comply with all requirements. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Aesthetics / Recreational UseDear Amanda, Mike Rosenzweig, my boss at Tumamoc: People and Habitats, asked me to comment on my perspective on Tumamoc Hill. I have been artist-in-residence there since 2011. You can see a more of what I've done there on my blog: http://TumamocSketchbook.com. Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Geology What is Tumamoc Hill? It's a highly protected natural wild-lands Sonoran Desert mountain, National Historic Landmark, ecological research preserve, U.S. Archaeological District, and community icon\u2014all of two miles from downtown and surrounded by growing urban Tucson.But there is no single description of Tumamoc Hill that is complete. There are many layers to the place, with different meanings depending on who you are talking to.A geologist will tell you that Tumamoc is an inselberg of volcanic rock remaining from eruptions between 20 - 30 million years ago. And it originally was formed near what is now the Santa Catalina Mountains.Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Cultural / Historic resourcesA paleontologist will tell you that the current Sonoran Desert environment came about 8-15 million years ago during a drying trend, when the unique desert plants here evolved from tropical ancestors moving north from Mexico.The Tohono O'odham call it Cemamag Doag, \"Horned Lizard Mountain.\" is considered ancestral site for O'odham, Yaqui, and Hopi Indians.Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Infrastructure The summit is now a site for a number of communications and homeland security communications towers, yet this role has probably been played for thousands of years. We know that up until historic times, Sentinal Peak, Tumamoc's sister peak was used, for it's broad view of the valley, as a lookout post, especially for marauding Apaches.Thank you for your comment. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Appendix B Scoping Summary August 2017 B-58Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Cultural / Historic resourcesIt has been called many names. Lawrence Clark Powell, famed librarian and writer who lived in Tucson, called Tumamoc \"Tucson's Acropolis.\" It's been called by various names, including \"A Mecca for botanists, and \"The Jerusalem of desert rats.\"Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Biological Resources The first thing a modern ecologist will say to you is \"don't stray off the road.\" Beginning with the establishment of the Desert Botanical Laboratory in 1903 by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Tumamoc is the oldest continually monitored ecological research preserve in the world, with data from over 100 years of study. This is the world's first restoration ecology project. The nature here is to look at, to study, to appreciate, but not to exploit-not even to use.Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Cultural / Historic resources To an archeologist, Tumamoc is a mystery that would challenge even Sherlock Holmes. Ruins of cultures living on Tumamoc go back 3,500 years, and at various times in prehistory, the Tumamoc hilltop was probably an important landmark, cultural focal point, and ceremonial ground. Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Aesthetics / Recreational UseTo the thousands of people who walk the road daily (only authorized vehicles are allowed) Tumamoc is the best workout in town, a treadmill with a spectacular view. It's a source of healing and health. It's a place where one can stroll among grazing deer five minutes from downtown. Dig a little deeper and many walkers will confide that Tumamoc is a very personal emotional or spiritual sanctuary.Thank you for your comment. 1/1/2015 Email Paul Mirocha Public Cultural / Historic resourcesUrban culture and ecological research can co-exist on Tumamoc Hill. It is a sanctuary for humans as well as other Sonoran Desert life forms, but the boundaries are clear: no one steps off the road without special permission. Scientists have protected the Hill for the last century. Now it's up to the community to take part in stewardship of the Hill as a special place and a cultural value for the next 100 years.At that time, we'll check in again and see how it's going. In the mean time I urge Firstnet to join the other institutions, groups, and governmental entities that are united as part of the stewardship of this valuable site.best regards, Paul MirochaThank you for your comment. 1/3/2015 Email Marc Severson Public Cultural / Historic resourcesDear Ms. Periera,I am writing to urge you to protect the cultural resources on the top of Tumamoc Hill in Tucson. This historic/prehistoric site has unique constructions that give insight into the prehistory of the Southwest. Further constructions endangers these resources.There are archaeological resources on and around this site that are irreplaceable. Considerable damage has already occurred over the years.I urge you to limit construction on this site to areas that have been previously disturbed and allow no further destruction of these resources.Thank you, Marc SeversonThank you for your comment. 1/6/2015 Email Matt Goode University of Arizona Biological Resources Dear Ms. Pereira, I am a Research Scientist at the University of Arizona and my lab is situated on Tumamoc Hill. I am writing to let you know how important Tumamoc Hill is to me and my students, as well as the community of Tucson. I have been conducting research on reptiles on Tumamoc for the past three years. Besides providing us with an incredible opportunity to better understand how reptiles persist in fragmented habitats, Tumamoc also enables us to provide unprecedented opportunities to educate the general public about scientific research and conservation of natural resources. Your help in keeping Tumamoc Hill healthy and productive is greatly appreciated by a lot of diverse stakeholders who care about Tucson's history and it's future!Thank you so much for your support!MattThank you for your comment.

Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix D FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Environmental Justice Methodology August 2017 D-1 APPENDIX D - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE METHODOLOGY FirstNet Methodology to Screen for Potential Environmental Justice Populations This appendix explains the methodology used in this Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to screen for the presence of potential environmental justice populations. The PEIS applies this methodology to every state and territory. Future analyses for site -specific actions may tier -off the resul ts and methodology of this PEIS (see Section 1.2). The first step in developing a screening methodology is to determine the types of communities that are relevant. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) defines both place -based and non-place based com munities for environmental justice consideration. Specifically, \"agencies may consider as a community either a group of individuals living in geographic proximity to one another, or a set of individuals (such as migrant workers or Native Americans), where either type of group experiences common conditions of environmental exposure or effect. \" (CEQ, 1997) Telecommunications projects could have effects on place -based minority or low -income populations, meaning populations of ind ividuals \"living in geographic proximity\" to one another and to an action such as placement of a telecommunications tower. Potentially, such projects could affect place -based environmental justice communities disproportionately due to localized human heal th or environmental effects. (The focus in environmental justice assessments is always on adverse effects, but telecommunications projects could also have beneficial effects such as improvements in police, fire, and emergency medical services. The Enviro nmental Consequences section for infrastructure addresses such effects.) Telecommunications projects would be very unlikely to affect disproportionately any populations that are not place -based. Because FirstNet is such a broad program, it would affect a t the same rate and intensity the general population and groups not defined by where they live, such as migrant workers, other types of workers that disproportionately fall into particular minority categories, racial and ethnic groups in general, and Nativ e American Tribes as dispersed entities. Identifying potential place -based environmental justice communities involves screening geographic areas for minority and low -income populations. This requires choosing the appropriate geographic units of analysis, the appropriate general population comparison group, and the appropriate metrics for classifying populations according to the CEQ definitions. The following paragraphs address each consideration in turn. Any adverse effects of FirstNet projects are most likely to manifest at a local level. For example, dust and noise exposure from construction of communication towers, changes in property values, and any adverse radiation from operation of communications equipment - should these be actual impacts - would affect people in proximity to those activities. Therefore, the environmental justice population screening analysis in this PEIS uses the smallest geographic unit for which regularly updated socioeconomic data are readily available, the census block group (BG). Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix D FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Environmental Justice Methodology August 2017 D-2 The Census Bureau defines this unit as follows : \"Block Groups are statistical divisions of census tracts, [and] are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people. ... A BG usually covers a contiguous area. ... BGs never cross state, county, or census tract boundaries but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity.\" (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a) In dense inner city areas, a BG may only encompass a few city blocks. In rural areas, a BG may cover many square miles. Regarding the choice of general population comparison group, this PEIS uses each state's population as the comparison group, hereafter called the reference population. This is because: a) states are the fundamental analysis units for the PEIS as a whole, and b) states vary considerably in their demographic and economic conditions, thus it would not be appropriate to compare BG figures to national figures on population by minority group or poverty status. The choice of appropriate metrics for i dentifying minority populations and low -income populations is somewhat complicated. The CEQ provides some basic guidance. Additional aspects are discretionary and are matters of precedent and best practice within particular agencies and among socioeconom ic analysts. The CEQ provides the following direction on minority populations: \"Minority populations should be identified where either: (a) the minority population of the affected area exceeds 50% or (b) the minority population percentage of the affected area is meaningfully greater than the minority population percentage in the gene ral population or other appropriate unit of geographic analysis.\" (CEQ, 1997) The CEQ does not define \"meaningfully greater.\" In practice, many analysts use varying percentages above the reference population's percentage of i ndividual minority groups (e.g., Asian or Hispanic) or combined minority groups. The CEQ also directs that \"Low -income populations in an affected area should be identified with the annual statistical poverty thresholds from the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports, Series P -60 on Income and Poverty\" (CEQ, 1997) . Poverty thresholds are specific income levels that take into account factors such as family size and the ages of family members. The federal government defines these levels annually for the nation. The CEQ does not provide additional direction on applying poverty thresholds. In practice , many analysts use varying percentages above the reference population's percentage of people with incomes at or below the poverty level. Minority and low -income populations are each of concern in envir onmental justice assessments. If a block group meets either the minority criteria or the low -income criteria, it is considered a potential environmental justice population. This PEIS uses several different criteria (thresholds) in a screening methodolog y designed to identify degrees of likelihood that a BG contains a potential environmental justice population. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix D FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Environmental Justice Methodology August 2017 D-3 These thresholds are: a) An absolute threshold of over 50 percent of the BG's population being of minority status. This is a CEQ -defined threshold as noted above (CEQ, 1997) . b) An absolute threshold of 20 percent or more of the BG's population living in poverty. This is the Census Bureau's definition of a \"poverty area\" (Bishaw, 2014) . c) A mean ingfully greater threshold of 20 percentage points greater than the reference population's minority population, whether an individual minority population or combined minority population. For example, if the combined minority population in the reference population is 10 percent, the threshold applied to each BG is 30 percent. This is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's definition of a \"minority neighborhood\" (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2015) . An example of a recent, multi -state PEIS that used this threshold is the Approved Resource Management Plan Amendments/Record of Decision (ROD) for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States (U.S. Bureau of Land Manage ment, 2012) . Its Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Solar Energy Development in Six Southwestern States (U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Department of Energy, 2010) provides the environmental justice screening analysis (see Chapter 4, Affected Environment, and the individual state affected environment and impact assessment chapters). d) A meaningfully greater threshold of 120 percent of the reference population's minori ty population (individual minority or combined minority population). For example, if the minority population in the reference population is 10 percent, the threshold applied to each BG is 12 percent. However, using this as the sole criterion at the BG le vel would be problematic because it may mis -identify the environmental justice potential of many BGs.1 e) A meaningfully greater threshold of 120 percent of the reference population's percentage of individuals living with incomes below 200 percent of the fede ral poverty level. For example, if 25 percent of the reference population is below 200 percent of the poverty level, the threshold applied to each BG is 30 percent. This approach aligns with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ( USEPA) approach to defining \"low income\" in its recently released environmental justice screening tool, EJSCREEN. EPA's rationale for this threshold cites literature indicating that the \"effects of income on baseline health and probably on other aspects of susceptibility ar e not limited to those [people] below the poverty thresholds,\" and the view of some socioeconomic analysts that \"today's poverty thresholds are too low to adequately capture the populations adversely affected by low income levels.\" (USEPA, 2015) However, this definition broadens the definition of low - income provided by the CEQ (CEQ, 1997) and considerably increases the number of BGs identified as having environmental justice potential. 1 For instance, if the reference population percentage for a specific minority is 1 percent, the threshold for defining a poten tial environmental justice population is 1.2 percent . If a BG has a total population of 1,000, the specific minority population equivalent to the reference population percentage is 10, and the threshold for defining an environmental justice population i s 12. The difference of only two persons categorizes th is BG as a potential environmental justice population. This is a questionable conclusion in terms of data fidelity (census and sampling errors), and whether such small differences truly are meaningful in the environmental justice context. The 120 percent approach to \"meaningfully greater\" can lead to identifying many BGs as potential environmental justice populations based on very small differences, and where the individuals do not constitute a community according to the CEQ def inition noted above \u2014\"a grou p of individuals living in geographic proximity to one another.\" Therefore, this EIS uses this threshold to identify moderate potential for environmental justice populations, and other, higher thresholds to identify high potential for environmental justic e populations. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix D FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Environmental Justice Methodology August 2017 D-4 For this PE IS, combinations of these thresholds define three degrees of likelihood that a BG contains a potential environmental justice population: High Potential for Environmental Justice Populations: Greater than 50% combined minority population ; Or greater than 20 % of the total population living in poverty ; Or greater than the reference percentage plus 20 percentage points for at least one minority population ; Or greater than 120% of the reference percentage for combined minority population . Moderate Potential for Environmental Justice Populations : Does not meet any of the above thresholds ; And greater than 120% of the reference percentage for at least one minority population ; Or greater than 120% of the reference percentage for individuals living with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level . Low Potential for Environmental Justice Populations : Does not meet any of the above thresholds . The thresholds specific to the Moderate Potential category are much broader than those of the High Potential category . The Moderate Potential category casts a wide net - it was defined to err on the side of including an area as a potential environmental justice population. During FirstNet deployment, further analysis to verify the presence of specific, localized enviro nmental justice populations would be particularly warranted for the Moderate Potential category. This PEIS applies this methodology to all BGs in a state, using data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 2009 -2013 5 -Year Estimates (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015b; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015c; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015d; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015e) and Census Bureau urban classification data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a; U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b) . The ACS is the Census Bureau's flagship demographic estimates program for years between the decennial censuses. The 5 -Year Estimates use sample data taken over a five -year period; this is the only nationally consistent source of the necessary data at the BG level.

Your letter arrived at my desk today, was dated from October 11, and was received by our mail department on October 17. The meeting for our state is less than 20 days away. Some of meetings were scheduled only 2 weeks after your intial letter. I will try to make it to your meeting in OKC, si nce it is close to our offices.

FirstNet welcomes comments from tribes at any point during the process. South 10/21/2016 email Michael Robotham NRCS DPEIS Review I have attached some correspondence related to NRCS concerns about the use of STATSGO2 vs SSURGO soils data in these PEIS documents for your information. STATSGO2 is appropriate, although not ideal, at this broad level of analysis. However, for any sitespecific decisions related to the implementation of the network (e.g. selection of locations for tower construction), the SSURGO information must be used when it is available (and that is nearly 80% of CONUS and all of the Pacific Islands). Another issue that has come up in our internal agency discussions is the need for FirstNet to be aware of land use easements that are held by NRCS (and I believe by other agencies - but we are focused on ours). NRCS holds some very large acreage easements, primarily focused on wildlife habitat. These are mainly located in the Western US, but Information related to NRCS easements has been included in the Final PEIS within the Land Use, Airspace, and Recreation sections of each state/terri tory chapter. In addition, a BMP has been added to Chapter XX, BMPs and Mitigation Measures, indicating that reasonable efforts would be taken to avoid or minimize construction activities in areas covered by existing incompatible easements. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix F FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comment Response August 2017 F-2 Region Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response easements have been purchased nationwide. Easement conditions often severely restrict potential management activities including, but not limited to, construction activities. Easements can be amended, but this is typically a very long process and, depending on the particular species of concern, proposed FirstNet activities may not be compatible with the goals of the particular easement. To address this issue, we suggest that language be included in the Draft PEIS recognizing that FirstNet is aware of this as a potential issue, and that all reasonable efforts will be taken to avoid construction activities in areas covered by existing easements.

The Kickapoo are South Texas while the Isleta are West Texas. Since this is a P EIS, I assume the National Environmental Policy Act is involved. If so, that needs to be stipulated in the regulations section. Importantly, NEPA has inclusive language of Section 106 of the NHPA; unfortunately, interpretation often leads to adhering to Ca tegorical Exclusions within the regulations. The law specifically states Categorical Exclusions must be reviewed and approved by federally recognized tribes Thank you for your review and comments. FirstNet is committed to working closely with tribes and to full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Ac t and the National Historic Preservation Act, both of which are discussed in Chapter 1 of the South PEIS and provide the regulatory foundation for this analysis. FirstNet will consult with the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix F FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comment Response August 2017 F-4 Region Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response before such can be implemented. I make mention of this to avoid any attempt to CAT EX any undertaki ng our Office has not approved. This is not an effort to delay any undertaking for public safety but to ensure agency obligations for regulatory compliance. Under the NHPA, tribes have the opportunity to assume the SHPO responsibilities over Reservation l ands (101d responsibilities as THPO). For any tribes that have not assume the 101(d) responsibilities, the SHPO still has authority to provide input and review on undertakings occurring on Reservation (trust) lands. The SHPO may invoke the State Antiquitie s law at their own discretion. (We have spoken with the THC regarding undertakings occurring on Alabama - Coushatta trust lands, including the environmental review process the Tribe adheres to wherein our Office does review every project in consideration of known sites by oral history and documented maps along with pedestrian survey. We do anticipate assuming the THPO status on trust lands, wherein the THC has vocally supported this effort, with the guidance of a professional investigator in compliance of the Secretary of the DOI's requirements. The THC has vocally indicated our process fulfills their immediate concerns for such undertakings on trust lands.) The federally recognized (FR) tribes of Texas segment is accurate in the designation of the three tribes. However, the regulations previously mentioned in the context opens the door for all FR tribes with ancestral interests in the state of Texas. I believe there are over 20 tribes that claim some portion of the state. Some of those are included in the map provided though the text indicates they are not FR. That needs to be corrected since they are. Further, this PEIS will require due diligence of consultation to all those tribes as their tribal interests may parallel or intersect those of the three FR trib es.

The Proposed Action may impact federally -listed species and migratory birds. Because the DPEIS does not include specific locations or impacts, it is not possible to assess those specific impacts at this time. The Department recommend s that FirstNet consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) when planning specific clearing and construction projects. The USFWS offer the following comments on the DPEIS related to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 (87 Stat. 884, as ame nded; 16 U.S.C. 1531 ef seq.) and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 -7 12). General Comments In Chapter 16, pages 16 -20 of the DPEIS, it is stated that FirstNet will conduct early consultation for threatened and endangered species and mig ratory birds with the USFWS, among other agencies. The Department encourages FirstNet to coordinate and provide an opportunity for the USFWS to review and comment on FirstNet's determinations, once site specific information is available on activities such as land/vegetation clearing and excavation to ensure compliance with the ESA.

The Proposed Action may impact federally -listed species and migratory birds. Because the DPEIS does not include specific locations or impacts, it is not possible to assess those specific im pacts at this time. The Department recommends that FirstNet consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) when planning specific clearing and construction projects. The USFWS offer the following comments on the DPEIS related to the Endangered Spe cies Act (ESA) of 1973 (87 Stat. 884, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1531 ef seq.) and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 -7 12). General Comments In Chapter 16, pages 16 -20 of the DPEIS, it is stated that FirstNet will conduct early consultation fo r threatened and endangered species and migratory birds with the USFWS, among other agencies. The Department encourages FirstNet to coordinate and provide an opportunity for the USFWS to review and comment on FirstNet's determinations, once site specific i nformation is available on activities such as land/vegetation clearing and excavation to ensure compliance with the ESA.

South 12/9/2016 regulations. gov Michaela Noble USDOI DPEIS Review Specific Comments The USFWS Kentucky Field Office (KFO) has three updates to the list of federally -listed species provided in the DPEIS. The Kentucky arr ow are listed as \"proposed\" in the DPEIS. These two species have been recently listed under the ESA: the Kentucky arrow darter as \"threatened\" on November 4, 201 6, (81 FR 68963) and the white fringeless orchid as \"threatened\" on October 13, 2016, (81 FR 62826). The white -haired goldenrod (Solidago albopilosa) is \"threatened\" in the DPEIS; this species was delisted on October 12, 2016, (81 FR 70043). The KFO believes that the \"typical Best Management Practices (BMPs) and mitigation measures\" in Table Thank you for your review and comments. Firs tNet has updated the species content in Section 7.1.6.6 to reflect USFWS's recent listing that were updated after publication of the PEIS. FirstNet will review Table 7.2.6 -2 per comments.

Table 7.2.6 -2 describes the \"impact signif icance rating criteria\" that would be used to evaluate effects to listed species resulting from the range of actions that could be covered under this p rogrammatic evaluation. The first row of that table, shown below, organizes types of effects on listed s pecies by impact level. The Department has identified the following places in which the information i s not consistent with the ESA: In the ESA, \"harm\" is defined as \"an act which actually kills or injures wildlife\" and is included in the definition of \"take.\" Therefore, the appropriate determination for all actions that result in injury or mortality of a listed species would be \"may affect, likely to adversely affect.\" The statement \"excludes permitted take\" in the \"may affect, likely to adversely aff ect\" column is not correct. \"May affect, likely to adversely affect\" is still the appropriate determination for actions that result take of a listed species, even if the take is not prohibited (e.g. permitted). South 12/9/2016 regulations. gov Michaela Noble USDOI DPEIS Review The USFWS KFO has the following comments regarding the DPEIS's evaluation of potential effects of actions to federally -listed species: Beginning on page 7 -334, the DPEIS lists \"activities likely to have no effect\" on threatened and endangered species or their habitat. One of the activities listed is \"use of existing conduit - new buried fiber optic plant\" that involves installing new fiber optic cable in existing conduit and would only require disturbance at entry and exit points of previously disturbed areas. The DPEIS states that \"although threatened and endangered species and FirstNet understands your concerns related to the use of existing conduit, but we believe that the disturbance at any entry a nd exit points (i.e., an individual walking to the location) would be highly unlikely to have any effect on listed species. However, should any research indicate that such species may be present, FirstNet and/or its Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix F FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comment Response August 2017 F-11 Region Date Rec'd Format Name Organization Topic Comment Response their habitat could be impacted, it is anticipated that effects to threatened and endangered species would be temporary, infrequent, and likely not conducted in locations designat ed as vital or critical for any period.\" Although concurrence is not required if a Federal action agency determines that an action will have no effect on listed species or critical habitat, we believe that, considering the evaluation provided for these imp acts, a \"may affect\" determination may be the more appropriate determination. Impacts that are temporary, infrequent, or not in locations designated as vital or critical may still result in adverse effects. Beginning on page 7 -334, the DPEIS lists \"activ ities with the potential to affect listed species\" and, in the final summary paragraph, concludes that \"potential impacts may affect, but are not likely [to] adversely affect protected species.\" These activities include land/vegetation clearing and excavat ion and trenching. This section refers to BMPs and mitigation measures that would be implemented to minimize potential impacts during these activities and concludes that these activities are not likely to adversely affect listed species. For some actions, the use of these measures may limit the effect to listed species to a level for which a \"may affect, not likely to adversely affect\" determination would be appropriate. However, \u00b7site -specific evaluations and/or a comprehensive programmatic evaluation woul d be necessary to support that determination. Consultation with the USFWS is required under section 7 of the ESA for all actions that may affect listed species. If it is determined that a \"may affect, likely to adversely affect\" is appropriate for a specif ic action or actions, then formal consultation would need to be initiated. The Department appreciates the opportunity to participate in the environmental review of the Network Partner will contact USFWS for guidance. FirstNet and/or its Network Partner would engage in consultation with the USFWS for any site specific activities that had the potential to affect listed species, and would adhere to the results of that consultation, in accordance with the law. FirstNet is still developing its site specific review process. Once that process has been defined, FirstNet will develop a supplemental programmatic environmental impact statement.

Most towers or building antenna sites have more than one antenna radiating in any given direction, plus signals come from other nearby s ites, and the ground infrastructure such as cellphones, tablets etc. So levels at ground level are likely to be far higher than that and levels in apartments or homes which get a direct hit from neighboring buildings could be far higher depending on dista nce. Several IARC panelists have made public statements that the evidence now shows that radiofrequency radiation should be classified as either a class 2A or class 1 human carcinogen.

Young kids, teenagers, and young adults are already disabled from EMFs and environmental toxins and can not go out in public without a complete meltdown from EMFs including EMFs found in artificial lighting (except incandes cent which is the safest artificial lighting there is and is the hardest to get now). I get contacts regularly from young adults and parents with kids who have no place to go or live without EMF exposure. Their lives have already been stripped from them. Disabling America and ruining our economy with all this sickness and medical issues is not the answer. Foreign countries are removing wireless from their cities and public places because it is a worldwide epidemic and they are having to pay out disabili ty for it.

My main interest in critiquing the FirstNet PEIS documents is making sure that the environmental and health effects of the radiofrequency (RF) radiation that the wireless component of FirstNet will emit are appropriately factored into deci sions about how to implement FirstNet. I address the serious deficiencies below. (Page numbers listed originate from Volume 1 Chapter 2 Draft Programatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Central United States, but the critique should be broadly appli cable to the RF radiation section for all four regions.) There were seriously inaccurate statements made about the safety level assured by existing FCC RF radiation limits: p. 2-10 \"For 20 years, the regulatory levels for human exposure to RF emissions hav e been established by the FCC as a means of protecting both workers and the general public from any potential effects.\" p. 2-12 \"These limits are based on thermal effects (i.e., the amount of RF energy required to heat tissue). According to the FCC, the es tablished limits are well below levels that are considered to have adverse health effects.\" Other government officials dispute claims such as these that FCC RF radiation limits provide sufficient population -based protection from harm during continuous expo sures. The Department of Interior (DOI) said \"the electromagnetic radiation standards used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continue to be based on thermal heating, a criterion now nearly 30 years out of date and inapplicable today\" (http://w ww.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/us_doi_comments. pdf), clearly indicating that they do not consider FCC RF radiation limits to be \"protecting both workers and Thank you for y our review and comments.

Mr. Norbert Hankin from the Center for Science and Risk Assessment, Radiation Protection Division, EPA, makes it clear in his correspondence with the EMR Policy Institute that \"The FCC's current exposure guidelines, as well as those of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the International Commission on Non - ionizing Radiation Protection, are thermally based, and do not apply to chronic, nonthermal exposure situations. They are believed to protect against injury that may be caused by acute exposures that result in tissue heating or electric shock and burn. The hazard level (for frequencies generally at or greater than 3 MHz) is based on a specific absorption dose -rate, SAR, associated with an effect that results from an increase in body temperature.

I have radiofrequency sickness, an environmentally -induced functional impairment caused by exposure to radiofrequencies, from either wireless technology or \"dirty\" electricity. I am addressing you today t o highlight the need to again make public places and buildings accessible for people with radiofrequency sickness. I experience many symptoms, including cardiac arrhythmias, cognitive difficulties, memory problems, headaches, and fatigue when I am around r adiation from wireless technology. The presence of wireless internet and wireless devices in public places now prevents me from using the public library or the judicial system, participating in public meetings, going to restaurants, going shopping, and usi ng public transportation. All are things that I used to be able to do without experiencing functional impairment prior to the proliferation of wireless devices. Most importantly, I can no longer safely access medical care due to the ubiquitous presence of wireless technology in hospitals and clinics. I am not alone. Over 300 comments from U.S. citizens pleading with the FCC to establish biologically -based safety limits for radiofrequency radiation to replace the existing outdated thermally -based radiofreque ncy limits were submitted in their docket to re -evaluate the RF limits. It is extremely important that people with radiofrequency sickness be able to access hospitals, medical facilities, and government buildings. WiFi and other wireless technology poses a significant, potentially life -threatening, access barrier for people with radiofrequency sickness. Access to medical care is generally considered a human right, a right now being denied those with radiofrequency sickness.

If he tries to compensate by taking additional insulin, as he normally would, his blood sugar plunges dangerously low upon leavin g the affected area. He recently had a new and very scary reaction. While at a federal office for an essential appointment, he was forced into close proximity to two functional smart phones and a WiFiing computer. He went into the office feeling fine with a normal blood sugar and came out with a very high blood sugar, a very elevated body temperature of 101 degrees Farenheit, and feeling awful. It took two days for his blood sugar and body temperature to return to normal and about a week to feel well. RF ha s been shown to cause calcium ion efflux. Inappropriate calcium efflux is known to cause a condition called malignant hyperthermia which can be fatal and is usually caused by certain anesthetics.

Disability claims related to symptoms or syndromes which have been connected to functional impairment by RF (RF Sickness) are rising. People with multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, and diabe tes have improved when their RF exposure from wireless technology and \"dirty\" electricity is minimized. Eliminating RF from public places will improve accessibility and decrease disability. It is time that national accessibility standards address the very serious access barrier posed by radiofrequency pollution. Background Our Experience: Wireless Technology is an Access Barrier Radiofrequency radiation, such as the radiation given off by wireless devices and their base stations (antennas) can cause an envi ronmentally -induced functional impairment called Radiofrequency sickness (see Dodge http://www.magdahavas.com/wordpress/wp - content/uploads/2010/08/Dodge_1969.pdf). I have radiofrequency sickness which was originally misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .

One major failing of the FCC limits that merits dis cussion in the PEIS is the fact that they govern each antenna separately. Collocations result in much higher RF radiation levels around the site because each antenna still broadcasts at the same level as if there were no collocation. Transmission from othe r antenna sites and mobile devices further increase ambient exposure levels. This must be discussed in the PEIS as an environmental impact since the purpose of the broadband provision portion of FirstNet's mission mentioned on p. 2 -8 is to encourage the us e of wireless technology which will in turn increase the ambient RF radiation levels from both devices and base station antennas. In the example on p. 2 -14, each antenna produces a field of 477W/m2 at ground level, but collocation of 4 such arrays (which is not uncommon) would result in 1,908 W/m2 at ground level. This is still below the FCC RF radiation limits, but which we established above are outdated and meaningless according to the DOI and not protective in chronic exposure situations according to t he EPA.

We slept in a tent well away from the building site while we tried to deal with the utility and PSC. Our younger son's heart rate got so slow one night when we were forced by broken tent poles to sleep at home that he lost bladder control, wetting only his underwear because the volume of urine was so small. When I went to him in response to his call, he was agitated and upset, but his heart rate was very slow and the beats were weak and irregular. This continued for a couple of hours. We did not sleep in the house again after that until the utility company removed the secondary power line from their transformer to our house. It was obvious the situation was too dangerous to be allowed to continue. So, we did the only thing we could do and told the utilities t o remove our service and we went off -grid since they refused to even properly investigate the situation, never mind do anything. After going completely off -grid, we had three heavenly weeks. We slept well, felt well, and had lots of energy. Our pets' healt h improved. Most importantly, our sons' cardiac rhythms had almost completely normalized. Unfortunately, the toxic exposure we received has left our whole family extremely sensitized to radiofrequency radiation so when, in early January 2012, 4G cellphone service was installed in our area we began to experience impairment quickly. Within a week, our sons' cardiac rhythms were again highly irregular. Our younger son was again waking us in the night crying and feeling unwell with a highly irregular cardiac r hythm.

The structure of the VGCC voltage sensor is discussed in more detail in the Discussion section below. It is plausible, the refore, that the electrical forces of these low intensity EMFs act through their electrical effects on the voltage sensor to activate the VGCCs. It is predicted that the forces on the 20 charges in the VGCC voltage sensor are highly amplified because of tw o important factors [2]. The law of physics called Coulomb's law predicts that forces on charged groups are inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium in which the charges occur. Because the dielectric constant of the aqueous phases in the cell or extracellular medium are about 120 times higher than the dielectric constant of the lipid bilayer [2], this predicts that forces on the each of the 20 charges of the voltage sensor are about 120 times higher than are electrical forces on singl y charged groups in the aqueous phases. In addition, Sheppard et al. [10], predicted that the electrical forces produced by EMFs across the plasma membrane are amplified about 3000 -fold compared with the forces in the aqueous phases because of the high ele ctrical resistance of the plasma membrane.

The comprehensive review by Dr. Cherry, which documents health effects and explores mechanisms, besides thermal mechanisms, through which microwave and radiowave radiation can impact health, also supports the contention that exposure to microwa ve and radiowave radiation is a public health threat which is probably contributing to significant public illness. A review of the Soviet literature on radiofrequency sickness by Christopher Dodge3 of the Naval Observatory discusses radiofrequency sickness in detail. The symptoms attributed to chronic exposure to radiofrequency radiation mirror the deterioration of health being seen in the U.S. in recent years, probably due to the dramatic increase in exposure to radiofrequencies from electrical pollution and wireless technology.

As note d on p. 2 -12, in 1996 the FCC was given the responsibility to \"prescribe and make effective rules regarding the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions\" (TCA, 104 Pub. L. 104), obviously it has not done this, as discussed above the rules are out dated and inapplicable. The FCC is in the process of updating them so the common practice of relying on compliance with FCC RF radiation limits as being sufficient for protection of health and the environment must end (see p.2 -12). As discussed previously, until the FCC completes revision of the FCC RF radiation limits so that they are population based biologically -protective RF radiation limits the FCC is in violation of their Congressional delegated responsibility to adopt \"uniform, consistent requirement s, with adequate safeguards of the public health and safety\" these were to be \"established as soon as possible\" (H.R.

Unfortunately, it appears that the undue industry influence at the FCC documented in a report published by Har vard (http://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center -for- ethics/files/capturedagency_alster.pdf), may have compromised the agency's ability to promptly revise its RF radiation safety limits.

Thus, the fact that FCC has abrogated its duty to maintain protective up -to-date RF radiation limits does not excuse FirstNet from having to consider the serious health and environmental consequences of its program in the PEIS and find a reasonable alternative to protect public health and the environment. In Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Feder al Power Commission, 354 F.2d 608 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied 384 U.S. 941 (1966), on appeal the Circuit Court pointed out (at p. 620) that Congress gave the FPC a broader responsibility. The Scenic Hudson Court noted \"In this case, as in many others, the Commission has claimed to be the representative of the public interest. This role does not permit it to act as an umpire blandly calling balls and strikes for adversaries appearing before it; the right of the public must receive active and affirmative protection at the hands of the Commission.\" This decision has obvious applicability to the need for FirstNet to act proactively to protect the health of the American people, as well as the environmental health, not just do a pro forma PEIS without real consid eration of the great potential for harm that a portion of the FirstNet program has. Given both the serious inadequacy of the FCC RF radiation limits and the potential for serious harm to public health and the environment that can result if FirstNet impleme nts the program as originally envisioned, FirstNet needs to take steps to amend the program to prevent that harm.

The TCEQ reviews the emissions of HAPs by agency - generated, chemical -specific screening levels called effects screening levels (ESLs) or air monitoring comparison values (AMCVs). The ESLs are utilized to evaluation of emissions, reflected in modeling exercises, during the air permits process. The intention of ES Ls is to provide a screening level that functions as a trigger to perform an in -depth evaluation of predicted chemical concentrations and industrial activities when this level is exceeded. The intention of ESLs is to prevent industrial emissions from becoming a threat to human health and welfare. Similarly, the TCEQ uses AMCVs to evaluate ambient chemical concentrations observed:bY fixed - site or mobile monitoring equipment. Like an ESL, the exceedance of an AMCV does not immediately induce the agency to engage in enforcement actions. It does, however, induce an evaluation of the AMCV exceedance to determine whether observed chemical concentrations are of concern to human health or welfare.

The Proposed Action may impact listed species and migratory birds. Because the DPEIS does not include specific locations or impacts, it is not possible to assess those impacts at this t ime. The Department recommends that FirstNet consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) when planning specific clearing and construction projects. The Department offers the following comments from the USFWS Field Offices in Wyoming and Minneso ta. The Proposed Action includes the potential construction of new wireless communication towers and/or modification of existing towers. The placement and operation of towers can affect migratory birds directly through injury, crippling loss, and death f rom collisions with towers and their supporting guy -wire infrastructure, as well as indirectly through habitat destruction or degradation due to vegetation clearing and tower construction. Additionally, communication towers might have an impact on migrator y birds due to non -ionizing electromagnetic radiation emitted by the tower. Please review the February 7, 2014, letter from the Department to Mr. Eli Veenendaal (National Telecommunications and Information Administration) for additional information regardi ng electromagnetic radiation impacts for the Proposed Action (Enclosure 1 ). The DPEIS notes that \"If proposed project sites are unable to avoid sensitive areas, best management practices (BMPs) and mitigation measures as defined through consultation wit h the appropriate resource agency, would be implemented.\" (Page 29, Executive Summary).

Sub mitted by Albert M. Manville, II, Ph.D., C.W.B. Principal, Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Solutions, LLC1; Adjunct Professor, Krieger School of Arts and S ciences, Advanced Academic Programs, Johns Hopkins University, Washington DC campus; and former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agency lead on avian-structural impacts \u2014 including from co llision and radiation impacts to migratory birds from communication towers September 29, 2016 [FirstNet DPEIS W.U.S. Comments-AMM.docx] Introduction I am pleased to provide comments regarding FirstNet's DPEIS for the Western United States. Please con- sider my comments regarding this DPEIS for the Western United States as representative of national and con tinental needs and co ncerns regarding both wildlife and the impacts from communication towers and their radiation. My comments and recommenda tions are focused on new wireless communication towers which FirstNet will contract to be built and make ope rational. Overview of my A ssess ment Below I provide more details not discussed in Chapter 2 abo ut migratory birds, their status and importance. I recommend \u2014 based on DPEIS Chapter 9, Best Management Practices (BMPs) \u2014 even stronger se- lection criteria for new towers, purposely avoiding \u2014 as practical and feasible \u2014 tower siting and operation in heavily human developed areas and wildlife conce ntration areas, especially for migratory birds. I make a strong evidentiary case\u2014 in reviewing DPEIS Chapter 2 \u2014 based on the most recent peer- reviewed scientific literature and professional contacts, that the effects on non -thermal radiation must be included in FirstNet's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, based on a 2014 a greement with the Department of Interior. Furthermore, I argue that, \"the potential effects of major concern are rare...\" (p. 2-12) is an inaccurate conclusion based on the prepon derance of recent new evidence and cumulative database effects. I will show that independent studies from radiation effects should be supp orted by FirstNet to develop cons istent, standardized, agreed-upon radiation metrics, based on peer-reviewed monitoring and testing research protocols. W hile arguably we have, \"no consistent measures of 1 whcsllc006@verizon.net Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-6 exposure...\" (p. 2-12), FirstNet has an opportunity to lead in establishing them. I will show that independent scientific research supported by FirstNet could help develop and set expo sure guidelines for radio frequency radiation (RFR) effects on wildlife, especially migratory birds, as well as on humans. I assert that th e statement, \"[we have] no scientifically agreed upon biological mechanism of harm ...\" (p. 2 -12) is an incorrect one based on the current scientific evidence, and fu rther that the communications industry continues to spend enormous amounts of money fighting current biological conclusions and recommendati ons Qualifications My expe rtise in wildlife, including migratory birds, and impacts from radiation is extensive. I earned a B.S. in zoology from Allegheny College, an M.S. in natural resources and wildlife management from the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point, and a Ph.D. from Michigan State University in wildlife ecology and management. More recently, I was designated as a \"Certified Wildlife Biologist\" (C.W.B.) by The W ildlife Society. During my military service, I was trained by the U.S. Navy in the use of electronic gear, then trained and certified by the Departments of State and Defense as a Mandarin Chinese linguist prior to working for the National Security Agency during my Navy tour of duty. I worked as a Federal wildlife biologist for 17 years, retiring in June 2014 from my position as a Senior Wildlife Biologist with the Division of Migratory Bird Mana gement, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS or Service), Headquarters Office, Arlington, VA. I was the Service's national lead on issues related to anthropogenic causes of bird injury and mortality, including from communication towers. In that capacity, I chaired the Communication Tower Working Group (looking at both avian-tower collisions and avian-radiation impacts), working closely with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Federal Aviation Administration, other Federal agencies, all the large tower and cell phone trade associations, se veral cell phone and tower companies, scientists, academicians, and consultants. I was the FWS p roject officer for the cu tting edge tower lighting study at Michigan State Police communication towers (Gehring et al. 2009, Gehring et al. 201 1), served as the project officer for a U.S. Coast Guard tall communication tower study, developed a cell tower research monitoring protocol for the U.S. Fo rest Service (Manville 2002), crafted a peer-reviewed cell tower radiation monitoring protocol, and represented FWS as lead reviewer on many co mmunication tower projects from cell towers to tall, digital television towers. I have published more than 175 professional and popular papers, chapters (including my current chapter in Prob lematic Wildlife: a Cross-Disciplinary Approach ; Springer Publishing, 2016 ), and book reviews. I was considered my agency's lead, go-to person on co mmunication tower impacts to migratory birds and co ntinue to work in consulting and teaching capacities on these issues. Previous Agreement On Feb ruary 4, 2014, the Director of the Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance (OEPC), Department of Interior (DOI), sent a letter to the U.S. Commerce Department's NTIA suggesting regulatory compliance by its FirstNet, a newly created federal entity, implementing development of emergency b roadcast systems nationwide (USDOI 2014 ). Included in those Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-7 recommenda tions were inadequ acies which FirstNet had acknowledged and was then proceeding to address. These included inadequacies for conserving migratory birds in Enclosure A of the OEPC letter which I authored while working for the Division of Migratory Bird Mana gement, USFWS. In it, I provided recommenda tions for addressing bird injury, crippling loss, and death from communication tower collisions; and research nee ds for beginning to address impacts from non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation emitted from such towers. The take-home message was clear. We had a federal agency (FirstNet) willing to recognize and begin add ressing the impacts of radiation on migratory birds \u2014 a significant and important step forward. On February 27, 2014, I began co mmunicating with FirstNet's Director of Environmental Compliance regarding their PEIS, including beginning to address impacts from low-level, non -thermal non-ionizing radiation that FirstNet stated they then did not intend to categorically exclude. We met with FirstNet's Director of Environmental Compliance and her staff on March 20, 2014, and proceeded to help FirstNet further develop their DPEIS. FCC standards dealing with tower radiation are flawed and co ntinue to be based solely on thermal heating, now more than 30 years out of date. FCC, to date, has been un willing to update their radiation regulatory standards while, to their credit, they are updating tower lighting, height and guy-wire standards. S ignificantly lower radiation output does not equate to reduced risk (e.g., Panagopou los and Margaritis (2008). I hope FirstNet officials will evaluate their current position based on the recommendations that follow. Background Recapping, the electromagne tic radiation standards used by the FCC continue to be based on thermal hea ting, a criterion now more than 30 years out of date and inapplicable today \u2014 except when o ne is very close to a base station antenna where thermal radiation is at issue. For example, for health and safety reasons, the FCC requires that power to cell and other communication towers must be turned off during maintenan ce by tower workers. The current electromagnetic radiation issues are primarily due to the lower levels of radiation output from microwave-powered co mmunication de vices such as cellular telepho nes and their cell towers, emergency b roadcast antennas, Wi-Fi, so c alled \"s mart meters,\" and other sources of point-to-point communications; levels typically lower than from microwave ovens. The FCC's radiation standards are currently being legally challenged at cell towers in the U.S. Migratory birds are impacted by these tower structures and their broadcasting/receiving radiation, including by very low levels of non-thermal radiation. Why Are Migratory Birds Important? Migratory birds \u2014 i.e., those that migrate across U.S., Canad ian and/or Mexican borders, of which 1,0 27 spe cies are currently protected in the United States (50 C.F.R. 10.13 list), are a public trust resource, meaning they belong to everyone. Mo st birds in the western United States are migratory as they are elsewhere in the U.S. Almost all North American continental birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The Act implements and regulates Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-8 bilateral protocols with Canada, Mexico, Japan and Russia. It is a strict liability statute; proof of criminal intent in the injury or killing of birds is not required by enforcement authorities for cases to be made. The statute and its regulations protect migratory birds, their parts, eggs, feathers and nests from un- permitted po ssession and \"take\" (i.e., un -permitted injury, crippling loss, or killing). Migratory bird nests are protected during the breeding season while eagle nests are protected year-round. Efforts are currently unde rway by FWS to develop a permit where un-permitted and \"unintentional take\" could be allowed under MBTA; that process began in 2001. A Federal permit is required to possess a migratory bird and its parts, but the MBTA currently provides no provision for the accidental or incidental \"take\" (causing injury, crippling loss, or death \u2014 including from tower collisions and from radiation) of a protected migratory bird, even when otherwise normal, legal business practices or personal activities are involved, such as the construction and ope ration of the FirstNet emergency broadca st system. The U.S. Congress noted the \"take\" of even one protected migratory bird to be a violation of the Statute, with fines and criminal penalties that can be extensive. Under the purview of the MBTA and E xecutive Order 13186 (the Migratory Bird EO), agencies such as FirstNet need to make every effort to \"avoid and minimize take\" of migratory birds. You already reference in Chapter 9 of this DPEIS the FWS 2013 voluntary communication tower guidelines which I upda ted, authored and provided to FCC (Manville 2013 b), in addition to other BMPs such as the Avian Po wer Line Interaction Committee guidelines (APLIC 2006, 2012 ), both which I co-authored. Bald and Golden Ea gles are also protected by the Bald and Golden Ea gle Protection Act (BGE PA), an- other strict liability statute. \"Take\" under BGEPA is more expan sive than un der MBTA, and includes pu rsuit, shooting, poisoning, cap turing, killing, trapping, collecting, molesting and disturbing both species (50 C.F.R. 22.3). It is important to note that eagles do not simply need to be killed or injured to be in violation of the Ea gle Act. \"Disturbance take\" could result in reduced survivorship of adults, juveniles and ch icks, affecting their population viability, including from the con struction and operation of FirstNet towers. These \"takes\" are potential criminal offenses. Status of Migratory Birds: Migratory birds are in trouble, including impacts from individual structures and the cumulative communication tower network continent-wide. There are growing numbers of Birds of Conservation Concern (BCC s; USFWS 2008) \u2014 species in decline but not yet ready for federal listing as threatened or endan gered und er the En dangered Spe cies Act (ESA), although some are under listing review. Currently there are 273 species (out of 1,027 protected birds) and subspecies on the national BCC, Service Regional BCC and Bird Conservation Region BCC lists, providing an early warning of likely peril unless the population trends are reversed. Additionally, there are 93 endan gered and threatened bird species on the ESA List of Threatened and Endangered Species. Collectively, BCC and ES A-listed birds represent at least 366 bird species (36%) in decline \u2014 some seriously \u2014 with numbers of both listed and BCC species growing (Manville 2013a). The FWS is also tasked to maintain stable or increasing breeding populations of Bald and Golden Ea gles under implementing regulations of BGEPA and compliance with NEPA \u2014 including for broadcast towers. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-9 Bird Collisions: Migratory birds have been docu mented killed in single night, mass mortality collision events (up to 10,000 in single night, single tower collision events) with communication towers, guy- suppo rt wires, and tower lights in the U. S. since 1948 \u2014 Aronoff 1949, summarized in Manville 2007 \u2014 including at unguyed, un lit, < 200 -ft above-ground -level (AGL ) cell towers. During nighttime migrations, birds can be overwhelmed by inclement weather events, forcing bird fall-out, significant reductions in flight heights, and resultant attraction to lighted structures and confusion (Manville 2014, 2016 a) \u2014 such as security lighting that may be placed at power sheds, attracting birds, cau sing them to collide with the towers. Currently an estimated 6.8 million birds/yr are killed in the U.S. and Canada (Longcore et al. 2012 ). The vast majority of these bird deaths are in the U.S. In ano ther review, at least 13 species of BCC s were estimated to suffer annual mortality of 1-9% of their estimated total population based solely on co mmunication tower collisions in the U.S. or Canada (Longcore et al. 2013 ). These include estimated annual mortality of > 2% for the Yellow Rail, to 350 species of birds have been d ocumented killed at communication towers (Manville 2014, 2016a ). Each time one of these birds is killed at an individual communication tower such as that planned by FirstNet, these \"takings\" add to the overall impacts to bird pop ulations not unlike the pheno menon of the \"death by a thousand cuts.\" That, of course, is a important purpose of your DPEIS \u2014 investigate cumulative effects. Radiation: While there is a massive and growing global database \u2014 studies being published weekly \u2014 on effects of tower and other non-ionizing radiation on wildlife, laboratory animals and hu mans, and it is important to note that the impacts from both thermal and non-thermal radiation ha ve already been well documented (e.g., www .saferemr.com). In fact, most scientists consider non - thermal effects as well established even though all of the implications are not yet fully understood. Thermal effects are generally pretty clear. It is also important to note that tests on laboratory animals referenced in a radiation memo I provided to FCC in early 2016, and updated for release to the public on July 14, 2016 (excerpted herein; M anville 2016 b; http://bit.ly/savewildlifeRFR), such as those on chicken embryos, mice and rats are used as surrogates to predict harm to humans, protected migratory birds and other wildlife. For practical, ethical and legal reasons, wild migratory birds would not otherwise be subjected to laboratory studies on impacts from radiation. F urthermore, scientists generally do not want to perform harmful experiments on either humans or protected wildlife such as migratory birds. Studies on the negative effects of non-thermal radiation to wild birds in Europe, b riefly summarized below, are clearly relevant as predictors of what will, is likely, or is happening to wild birds in North America. These issues therefore need to be examined in detail by FirstNet, not categorically excluded as currently done in FCC's flawed approach. In the June 2016 Scientific American Blog (Portier and Leon ard 201 6), in response to the question, \"do ce ll phones cause cancer?\" The authors response was clear: \"pro bably, but it's complicated. The degree of risk almost certainly depends on the length and strength of Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-10 exposure \u2014 but we still don't know how s ignificant the actual danger is.\" These same issues pertain to impacts to wildlife from both thermal and non -thermal effects emitted from cell and broadcast communication towers and FM antennas. I submit that the radiation effects on wildlife need to be addressed by the FCC, the En vironmental Protection Agency (EPA), FirstNet, the FWS a nd other governmental entities. While radiation studies have been ongoing for decades, not until recently have the effects of low-level, non -thermal electromagnetic radiation on do mestic and wild birds been made pu blic. Laboratory studies by T. Litovitz (2000 pers. comm.) and DiCarlo et al. (2002) from the standard 915 MHz cell phone frequency on do mestic chicken embryos showed that radiation from extremely low levels (0.0001 the level emitted by the average digital cell phone) caused heart attacks and deaths in some embryos; controls were unaffected (DiCarlo et al. 2002). You already referenced these studies in your DPEIS. However, the effects of microwave (and other) radiation from communication towers on nesting and roosting wild birds are yet unstudied in the U.S. In Europe, impacts have been well documented. Balmori (2005) found strong negative correlations between levels of tower-emitted microwave radiation and b ird breeding, nesting, and roosting in the vicinity of electromagnetic fields in Spain. He documented nest and site abandonment, plumage deterioration, locomotion problems, and d eath in House Sparrows, White Storks, Rock Doves, Ma gpies, Collared Doves, and o ther species. While these species had historically been docu mented to roost and nest in these areas, Balmori (2005) did not observe these symptoms prior to construction of the cellular phone towers. In a troubling discovery, Balmori (2005) docu mented \"far-field,\" low level radiation exp osures affecting migratory birds out to 300 meters (nearly 1,000 ft) distance from cell towers in Europe. Twelve nests (40% of his study sample) were located within 200 m (nearly 660 ft) of the antennas and never successfully raised any chicks, while only 1 (3.3%), located further than 300 m, never had chicks. Strange behaviors were observed at White Stork nesting sites within 100 m (328 ft) of one or several cell tower antennas. Those birds that the main beam impacted directly (i.e., electric field intensity/EFI > 2 V/m) included young that died from unknown causes. Within 100 m, paired adults frequently fought over nest cons truction sticks and failed to advance the construction of the nests with sticks falling to the ground while nests were being constructed. Balmori (2005) reported that some nests were never completed and the Storks remained p assively in front of cellsite antennas. The electric field intensity was higher on nests within 200 m (2.36 \u00b1 0.82 V/m) than on nests further than 300 m (0.53 \u00b1 0.82 V/m). However, the EMF levels, including for nests < 100 m from the an tennas, were not intense enou gh to be classified as thermally active. Po wer densities need to be at least 10 mW/cm2 to produce tissue heating of even 0.5 C (Bernhardt 1992). The radio frequenc ies used in Europe and here in the U.S. are similar to the 700 MHz frequency band FirstNet is planning to utilize. Balmori and Hallberg (2007) and E veraert and Bauwens (2007) found similar strong negative correlations a mong male House Sparrows. In ano ther review, Balmori (2009) reported health effects to birds which were continuously irradiated. They suffered long-term effects including reduced territorial defense posturing, deterioration of bird health, problems with reproduc tion, and reduction of useful territories due to habitat deterioration. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-11 Beason and Se mm (2002) demonstrated that microwave radiation used in cell phones produces non- thermal responses in several types of neurons of the nervous system of Zebra Finches. The brain neurons of anesthetized birds were tested with a 900 M Hz carrier, modulated at 217 Hz. Stimulation resulted in chan ges in the amount of neural activity by more than half of the brain cells with most (76%) of the respon ding cells increasing their rates of firing by an average 3.5- fold as opposed to controls \u2014 a clearly definitive study showing non-thermal effects. The other respon ding cells exhibited a decrease in their rates of spontaneous activity suggesting potential effects to humans using hand -held cell phones affecting sleep (Borbely et al. 1999). The Beason and Semm (2002) theoretical model could also help explain why birds may be attracted to cell towers, an important theoretical premise that they previously hypothesized in regard to Bobolinks (Semm and Beason 1990). Radiation effects can be characterized as \"near-field\" (near the source of radiation), \"far-field\" (some distance from the so urce) or \"intermediate.\" The growing evidence is clear; there are low-level, non - thermal effects (Manville 2016b: p.4; http://bit/ly/savewildlifeRFR). In a meta- review of studies through 2008, and based on laboratory research they condu cted, Pana gopou los and Margaritas (2008) determined maximum radiation distances for both cell phones and for communication towers, based on the Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM) and the Digital Cellular System (DCS). This maximum radiation distance corresponds to an intensity around 10 mW/cm2 for both types of radiation in regards to the RF componen ts \u2014 i.e., Bernhardt's (1992) threshold for thermal heating effects. In the Pana gopou los and Margaritas (2008) study, a \"near-field\" thermal effect which they called an \"intensity window\" appe ared at a distance of 20-30 cm for the cell phone antenna, corresponding to a distance of 20-30 meters (66 to 98 feet) from the base antenna. This could be considered a classic nonlinear effect and would also apply to far field exposures where effects from an \"intensity window\" are greater than expected. S ince cell phone base station antennas are frequently located within residential areas where houses and workplaces are often situated at distances 20-30 m from such an tennas, not to mention birds nesting and roosting close to these antennas (e.g., Balmori 2005), humans, migratory birds and other wildlife may be expos ed up to 24 hours per day. As a recommended mitigation measure, FirstNet shou ld avoid siting any new broadcast antennas in close proximity to human development and in areas prone to heavy migratory bird use \u2014 where there are practical and reasonable alternatives. The FW S's 2013 guidelines (Manville 2013b ), referenced within the DPEIS, provide so me recommenda tions of where to locate antennas. Complicating the issue is the fact that there currently are no standards for wildlife expos ure, including by the licensing and regulatory rules and procedures of the FCC. Other than the letter to and \"agreement\" between DOI and F irstNet, neither DOI nor the FWS have any policy or quasi policy that currently ad- dresses radiation effects on migratory birds \u2014 with the exception of the 2013 (Manville 2013: p.2) guide- line number 5. recommending at least a 1-mile disturbance-free buffer between new cell towers and nesting Bald Eagles and Ferruginous Hawks. Arguably, \"effects\" need to be determined by the EP A, which has no funding for this, and regulated as part of a NEPA site review process, including both thermal and non -thermal effects. There is an increasing body of published laboratory research that finds DNA damage at low Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-12 intensity exposu res \u2014 well below levels of thermal heating \u2014 which may be comparable to far field exposures from ce ll and broadcast antennas, including those being constructed or to be used by FirstNet. This body of work would apply to all species, including migratory birds, since DNA is DNA , whether single-strand or doub le helix. The first study to find such effects was conduc ted by H. Lai and N.P. Singh in 1995 (Lai and S ingh 199 5). Their work has since been replicated (e.g., Lai and Singh 1996, as well as in hundreds of other more recent published studies), performed in at least 14 laboratories worldwide. The take-home m essage is clear: low level transmission of EMF from cell and other broadcast towers and other sources p robably causes DNA damage. The laboratory research findings strongly infer this relationship. Since DNA is the primary building block and genetic \"map\" for the very growth, production, replication and su rvival of all living organisms, deleterious effects can be critical. The entire thermal model and all FCC categorical exclusions for all of the electronic devices we see to- day, rests on the incorrect assumption that low-level, non -ionizing non-thermal radiation cannot cause DNA breaks because it is \"so low-power\" (B. Levitt and H. Lai, Comments Filed Jointly to FCC, ET Docket No. 13 -84, 2013 ). The evidence strongly suppo rts the opp osite conclusion: low power produces ne gative effects. These issues need to be adeq uately addressed by the appropriate authorities including the FCC, EPA, FW S, and FirstNet. Currently they are not. Based on their research and meta-analyses, Pa nagopou los and Margaritas (2008) concluded that large de- creases in reproductive capacity were being caused by GSM and DCS radiation fields. This included extensive DNA fragmentation on reproductive cells of experimental animals induced by these fields, exerting an intense biological action able to kill cells, damage DNA , and d ramatically decrease the reproductive capacity of living organisms, including popu lations of wild birds and insects. They cautioned, how- ever, that the ph ysical parameters of these radiations, including intensity, carrier frequency, pulse repetition frequency, distance from the antenna, a nd similar factors provided inconsistency and lack of standardization making it difficult to correlate specific thermal and non -thermal effects to specific types of radiation. Their take-away message, ho wever, was clear: bio-effects to migratory birds, other wildlife, in- sects, laboratory animals and humans continue to be documented from thermal and non-thermal expo sures, as well as effects from intermediate exposures between the near-field and far-field levels. All migratory birds are potentially at risk, whether they be Bald Eagles, Golden Ea gles, Birds of Conservation Conce rn (USFWS 2008), Federally and/or State-listed bird species, other birds in peril regionally or population-wide, or birds whose populations are stable. FirstNet must therefore address these issues in the DPEIS and your subsequent implementing instructions. Ignoring non-thermal effects based on flawed FCC standards would not be acceptable. Cucurachi et al. (2013) reported on 1 13 studies from original peer-reviewed pu blications and relevant existing reviews. A limited number of ecological studies was identified, the majority of which were conducted in a laboratory setting on bird embryos or eggs, small rodents and plants. In 65% of the studies, eco logical effects of RF-EMF (50% of the animal studies and about 75% of the plant studies) were found both at high as well as at low dosages. L ack of standardization and limited sampling made generalizing results from the organism to the ecosystem level very Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-13 difficult. Cucurachi et al. (2013) concluded, however, that due to the number of variables, no clear dose-effect relationship could be found especially for non -thermal effects. However, effects from some of the studies reviewed were well documented, and ce rtainly can serve as predictors for effects to wild, protected migratory birds and other wildlife in North America. Engels et al. (2014) investigated \"electromagnetic noise\" emitted everywhere humans use electronic de- vices including from cell phones and their towers. While prior to their study on European Robins, no \"noise effect\" had been widely accepted as scientifically proven, the authors in this double-blind experiment were able to show that migratory birds are unable to use their magnetic compass in the presence of urban electromagnetic noise. The magnetic compass is integral to bird movement and migration. The findings clearly demonstrated a non -thermal effect on European Robins and clearly serves as a predictor for effects to other migratory birds including those in North America. Levitt and Lai (2010) reported nu merous biological effects from cell tower radiation docu mented at very low intensities comparable to what the pop ulation experiences within 60- 150 m (197- 492 ft) distance from a cell tower, including effects that occurred in studies of cell cultures and animals after expos ures to low-intensity RFR. These reported effects were genetic, growth, and reproductive in nature; they docu mented increases in permeability of the blood- brain barrier; behavioral respons es; illustrated molecular, cellular, and metabolic changes; and provided evidence of increases in cancer risk \u2014 all applicable to migratory birds, other wildlife and to far field exposu res in general. They cited published, peer- reviewed examples of effects that included: Dutta et al. (1989) who reported an increase in calcium efflux in human neu roblastoma cells after exposure to RFR at 0.005 W/kg. Calcium is an important component in normal cellular functions. Fesen ko et al. (1999) who reported a change in immunological functions in mice after exposure to RFR at a power density of 0.001 mW/cm2. These results can serve as predictors for impacts to wild animals. Magras and Xenos (1997) who reported a decrease in reproductive function in mice exposed to RFR at power densities of 0.000168\u2014 0.001 053 mW/cm2. The results also serve as predictors for reproductive impacts to wildlife. Forgacs et al. (2006) who reported an increase in serum testosterone levels in rats expo sed to GSM-like RFR at specific absorption rates (SAR) of 0.018 \u2014 0.025 W /kg. The results also serve as predictors for reproductive impacts to wildlife. Persson et al. (1997) who reported an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in mice ex- posed to RFR at 0.0004- 0.008 W/kg. The blood-brain barrier is a physiological mechan ism that protects the brain from toxic substances, bacteria, and viruses. These findings have clear applicability to wildlife including migratory birds. Phillips et al. (1998) who reported DNA damage in cells exposed to RFR at the SAR of 0.002 4- 0.024 W/kg. DNA is integral to the very function and survival of all living organisms, including migratory birds. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-14 Kesari and Behari (2009) also reported an increase in DNA strand breaks in brain cells of rats after expo- sure to RFR at the SAR of 0.0008 W/kg. The results also serve as predictors for impacts to DNA in wild- life. And, Belyayev et al. (2009) who reported changes in DNA repair mechan isms after RFR expos ure at a SAR of 0.0037 W/kg. DNA is integral to the maintenance and repair of cells and cellular function in all animals. All sources from above were cited in Levitt and L ai (2010). In a 2-year study conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the National Institutes of Health (May 2016 ), NTP (Wyde 2016) reported partial findings from their $25 million study on cancer risk to laboratory rodents from cellphone radiation. The report summarizes a long-term expos ure study to cell phone radiation, with statistically significant evidence of DNA damage from non-thermal expos ure to cellphone radiation to laboratory mice and rats. Controlled studies on laboratory rats showed that cell- phone radiation caused 2 types of tumors, glioma and schwanno ma, the results which \"could have broad implications for public health.\" The report has been characterized as a \"game-change r\" as it proves that non -ionizing, radiofreque ncy radiation can cause cancer without heating tissue. The researchers con- trolled the temperature of the test animals to prevent heating effects so the cancers were caused by a non- thermal mechanism. The report on the mice component of the study will be released at a later date. Not surprisingly, much of the media coverage contained considerable bias or \"media spin\" intended to create doubt about the study's important findings regarding cancer risk from expos ure to cellphone radiation (Moskowitz 2016 ). The implications are troubling for migratory birds and other wildlife. Summary Recommendations Levitt and Lai (2010) concluded that the obvious mechanism of effects from RFR are thermal (i.e., tissue hea ting) \u2014 which is what FCC bases its current radiation standards on, even if they are more than 30 years out of date and rejected bo th by the Department of Interior and Department of Commerce (USDOI 2014, Manville 2016a) as incomplete. However, for decades, there have been qu estions about non- thermal (i.e., not depende nt on a change in temperature) effects, whether they exist, and what specifically causes the effects to surface. The sources cited above shou ld help dispel that doubt or at the very least show that non-thermal effects do indeed occur, have been well documented, and can ha ve significant deleterious effects on migratory birds and other wildlife. Practically, as Levitt and Lai (2010) concluded, we do not actually need to know whether RFR effects are thermal or non-thermal to set exposure guidelines. Most of the biological-effects studies of RFR that have been condu cted since the 1980s were under non-thermal conditions, including the most recent NTP (2016) studies. In studies using isolated cells, the ambient temperature during exposure was generally well controlled. In most animal studies, the RFR intensity used usually did not cause a significant in- crease in body temperature in the test animals. M ost scientists consider non-thermal effects as well established, e ven though the implications are not fully understood. Scientifically, Levitt and Lai (2010) concluded that there are three rationales for the existence of non- thermal effects: Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-15 1. Effects can occur at low intensities when a significant increase in temperature is not likely. Heating does not produce the sa me effects as RFR exposure. RFR with different modulations and c haracteristics produce different effects even though they may produce the same pattern of SAR distribution and tissue heating. There is virtually no non-thermal research to indicate what is safe for either humans or wildlife, including migratory birds which are highly sensitive to perturbations in ways humans are not (see previous citations). Unfortunately, there also is very little far-field, distance-to- safety research for wildlife \u2014 most espe cially for migratory birds \u2014 as this has not been studied with that focus in mind. W hat little EMF/RF field research on wildlife that has been conducted, its focus has been on beha vior, mortality and reproductive outcomes (e.g., B. Levitt and H. Lai, Comments Filed Jointly to FCC, ET Docket No. 13 -84, 2013; Balmori al. 1984; and Semm and Beason 199 0). In summary, we need to better understand, tease out, and refine how to address these growing and po orly unde rstood radiation impacts to migratory birds, bees, bats, and myriad other wildlife. Currently, other than to proceed using the precautionary approach and keep emissions as low as reasonably achievable, we are at loggerheads in advancing meaningful guidelines, policies and regulations that address non-thermal effects. The good ne ws: there appears to be an awakening at least within a significant segment the scientific community to the realization that these issues must be addressed \u2014 for the health of humans, wildlife and o ur environment \u2014 and hop efully FirstNet will continue on the course of assessing how to minimize the impacts of radiation on wildlife and humans as had been a greed to in 2014. Sugges ted Next Steps for FirstNet The following suggestions would help significantly advance the need to address effects/impacts from non-thermal radiation on migratory birds and other wildlife, and help in further reducing collision impacts and ha bitat fragmentation: We desperately need to conduct field research on thermal and non -thermal radiation impacts to wild migratory birds and other wildlife here in North America, similar to studies cond ucted in Europe. Specifically, the research focus shou ld center on causality for \"near- field,\" \" far-field\" and \"intermediate\" effects, ideally based on some standa rd, agree-upon radiation metrics. FirstNet and leading indepe ndent radiation experts (ideally none affiliated with the communication industry) should work together to develop radiation metrics. The metrics need to be consistent with standards for intensity, carrier frequency, pulse repetition frequency, distance from the antenna, and similar factors. The research must be based on peer-reviewed monitoring and testing protocols (e.g., upgrades to the Manville 2002 peer- reviewed research protocol submitted to the U.S. Forest Service for studies on cell towers in Arizona, and key methodo logies used in studies previously referenced in the Manville [2016b] memo, among others). The research needs to be conducted by credible, independe nt third party research entities with no vested interest in the outcomes, and the results need to be published in refereed scientific journals, made available to the public and the affected federal agencies. Studies need to be designed to better tease out and un derstand causality of thermal and non - thermal impacts from radiation on migratory birds. Results need to be carefully compared Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-16 with findings from Europe and elsewhere on wild birds, and efforts need to be made to begin developing expos ure guidelines for migratory birds and other wildlife based on dose-effect and other nonlinear relationships. We do not actually need to know whether RFR effects are thermal or non-thermal to develop and s et exposure guidelines (Levitt and Lai 2013). To minimize deleterious radiation exposures, these guidelines should include use of avoidance measures such as those developed by the electric utility indus try for bird collision and electrocution avoidance (APLIC 2006, 2012 ). In the case of Bald Eagles, the communication tower guidelines refined and updated by FWS (Manville 2013 b) \u2014 and submitted to the FCC and industry \u2014 recommend one -mile disturbance free buffers during active nesting of Ferruginous Hawks and Bald Eagles, and 0.5- mile buffers around other active raptor nests, based on nest studies conducted by the W yoming Ecological Services Field Office in that State; Guideline number 5. Impacts must address collision mortality, crippling loss, and injury; mortality, injury, popu lation viability and su rvivorship based on impacts from radiation; as well as disturbance and habitat fragmentation. The upd ated 2013 Service Guidelines were intended to be inclusive. Agencies tasked with the protection, management, and research on migratory birds and o ther wildlife (e.g., FWS, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, U.S. Fo rest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and USDA Wildlife Services, among others) need to develop radiation policies that avoid or minimize impacts to migratory birds and other trust wildlife species. This means suppo rting \u2014 and where applicable \u2014 conducting research, and developing policies that help minimize radiation impacts. FirstNet can work with these agencies in sup port of these efforts. As Levitt and L ai (2010) concluded, we do not actually need to know whether RFR effects are thermal or non-thermal to set exposure guidelines. Most scientists consider non-thermal effects as well established, e ven though the implications are not fully understood. Given the rapidly growing database of peer-reviewed, published scientific studies (e.g., http://www .saferemr.com, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley), it is time these issues be addressed both by FCC and NTIA. Without question, these are challenging and daunting issues. FirstNet can begin by taking \"small bites out of this 800 po und gorilla\" first by developing a siting review process for new towers based on bird- and hu man-friendly habitats \u2014 using the precautionary approach as the direction forward \u2014 much like what FWS did following release of its 2000 guidance through a site review process. Proper site location will help to minimize collision and radiation impacts, especially given the scientific information we have available (many sources referenced within these comments). Meanwhile, FirstNet needs to proceed as agreed to in 2014 with helping supp ort independent field radiation research, including in the DPEIS review process, implementing instructions, and through funding and a gency suppo rt. It is important for FirstNet to begin focusing on new tower siting and location \u2014 given the enormity of this endea vor. Implementing the BMPs recommended in this DPEIS and suggestions provided in these comments would be a good start. Thank you for the opp ortunity to comment on this complicated but incredibly important issue. Hopefully reasoned minds will prevail, impacts of non-thermal radiation will be included as part of this review, and BMPs will result in a significant reduction of impacts to migratory birds, other wildlife and hu mans.

The PEIS uses outdated documents to excuse inaction. Contrary to their asser tion, FCC limits do not protect against adverse effects, even the DOI noted \"the electromagnetic radiation standards used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continue to be based on thermal heating, a criterion now nearly 30 years out of date and inapplicable today \" (http: //www.ntia.doc.gov/fil es/ntia/us_doi_comments.pdf ) The open ing of the FCC docket to re -evaluate limits is acknowledged, but then ignored. The logical step of delaying implemen tation of t he wireless compo nent until that is completed is not even mentioned. The N ational Toxicology Program find ings are not even m ention ed. Their exposure calculations are based on only one antenna and work out to 477uW/m2, which is over the level s hown to graph at end). Most towers or building antenna sites have more than one antenna radiating in any given direction, plus signals come from other nearby sites, and the ground infrastructure such as cellp hones, tablets etc. So leve ls at gro und level are likely to be far higher than that and levels in apartm ents or homes which get a d irect hit from neighbori ng buildings could be far higher depend ing on distance. Several IARC panelists have made p ublic s tatements that the evidence now shows that radiof requency radiation should be classified as either a class 2A or class 1 human carcinogen. The recent (ignored) National Tox icology Prog ram findings s upport this. This should ca use the wire less por tion to be stopped and FirstN et should explain why to Con gress, but no mention is made and therefore no such action is recommended. They refuse to t ake action to protect birds in sp ite of lab and epid emiological evidence that support each other in finding hard because it requires \"interpr etation and extra polation.\"(2 -20) Doesn't it always?

Sinc erely, Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-35 Public Comment - NIDILRR Catherine Kleiber Public Listening Session Comment November 18, 2016 My name is Catherine Kleiber. I have radiofrequency sickness, an environmentally -induced functional impairment caused by exposure to radiofrequencies, from either wireless technology or \"dirty\" electricit y. I am addressing you today to highlight the need to again make public places and buildings accessible for people with radiofrequency sickness. I experience many symptoms, including cardiac arrhythmias, cognitive difficulties, memory problems, headaches, and fatigue when I am around radiation from wireless technolog y. The presence of wireless internet and wireless devices in public places now prevents me from using the public library or the judicial system, participating in public meetings, going to restaurants, going shopping, and using public transportation. All are things that I used to be able to do without experiencing functional impairment prior to the proliferation of wireless devices. Most importantl y, I can no longer safely access medical care due to the ubiquitous presence of wireless technology in hospitals and clinics. I am not alone. Over 300 comments from U.S. citizens pleading with the FCC to establish biologically -based safety limits for radiofrequency radiation to replace the existing outdated thermally -based radiofrequency limits were submitted in their docket to re-evaluate the RF limits. It is extremely important that people with radiofrequency sickness be able to access hospitals, medical facilities, and government buildings. WiFi and other wireless technology poses a significant, potentially life -threatening, access barrier for people with radiofrequency sickness. Access to medical care is generally considered a human right, a right now being denied those with radiofrequency sickness. Access to public facilities by people with radiofrequency sickness is protected under the 2008 ADA Amendments which specifically protects individuals with environmentally -induced functional impairments. Radiofrequency sickness is a functional impairment induced by radiofrequency exposure, which can cause serious, even life-threatening functional impairment. A replicated double -blind placebo -controlled study documented that cardiac arrhythmias occur in some people in response to exposure to radiation from cordless phones. This is obviously a potentially life- threatening functional impairment. My children experience cardiac arrhythmia in response to radiation from wireless technolog y, as do I. My husband, a type 1 diabetic, finds that his blood sugar elevates markedly in response to radiation from wireless technolog y. If he tries to compensate by taking additional insulin, as he normally would, his blood sugar plunges dangerously low upon leaving the affected area. He recently had a new and very scary reaction. While at a federal office for an essential appointment, he was forced into close proximity to two functional smart phones and a WiFiing computer. He went into the office feeling fine with a normal blood sugar and came out with a very high blood sugar, a very elevated body temperature of 101 degrees Farenheit, and feeling Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-36 awful. It took two days for his blood sugar and body temperature to return to normal and about a week to feel well. RF has been shown to cause calcium ion efflux. Inappropriate calcium efflux is known to cause a condition called malignant hyperthermia which can be fatal and is usually caused by certain anesthetics. Fortunately for him, the reaction stopped accelerating when he came home to our shielded house and then crawled into our shielded bed. It could easily be a fatal reaction for someone who did not realize what was happening. The presence of wireless radiation at levels which cause functional impairment is making it harder for us to earn our living. We had to quit bringing our pasture -raised meat products to the local farmers markets two years ago since my husband could no longer be at the market without experiencing serious neurological effects suggestive of early ALS that disappeared when he stopped attending market. I have not been able to function well enough cognitively at the market to vend for several years. Being unable to sell at the market has decreased our ability to earn our living. Obviousl y, if we cannot tolerate the RF environment outside in the city, working in an office or store in the city with their multiplicity of WiFi routers and high volumes of individual cellphones would not be possible. Disability claims related to symptoms or syndromes which have been connected to functional impairment by RF (RF Sickness) are rising. People with multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome, asthma, and diabetes have improved when their RF exposure from wireless technology and \"dirty\" electricity is minimized. Eliminating RF from public places will improve accessibility and decrease disabilit y. It is time that national accessibility standards address the very serious access barrier posed by radiofrequency pollution. Backg round Our Experience: Wireless Technology is an Access Barrier Radiofrequency radiation, such as the radiation given off by wireless devices and their base stations (antennas) can cause an environmentally -induced functional impairment called Radiofrequency sickness (see Dodge http://ww w.magdahavas.com/wordpress/wp - content/uploads/2010/08/Dodge_1969.pd f). I have radiofrequency sickness which was originally misdiagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome. Howeve r, once I found out I was being exposed to large amounts of radiofrequencies from electrical pollution, including \"dirty\" power on my wires and plumbing, and reduced that exposure as much as I was able, I began to recover almost immediatel y. Here is a brief summary of symptoms I experienced as a result of the functional impairment caused by radiofrequency exposure from electrical pollution: heart palpitations, very pain sensitive, constant nerve pain, sluggish reactions, poor dept h perception, muscle weakness, lactic acid buildup with little exertion, unrefreshing sleep, often wakeful in the night, fatigue, night Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-37 sweats, poor circulation to my extremities, reflux, difficulty concentrating, difficulty thinking, inability to make decisions, low-grade fever and chills, headaches, and a dry sore throat. After we reduced our exposure as much as possible, I was well at home for years and able to participate in family gatherings, go to the doctors, and generally participate in society because I could always plug in filters to minimize the electrical pollution. We had children. When my youngest was about three, our utility began installing transmitting electrical meters in the area. Shortly after that we all began experiencing serious functional impairment, even at home, from the radiofrequency pollution the transmitting electrical meters put on the electrical wiring along with the power line communications frequencies. Utilities providing basic service (electricit y, gas, and water) should not be allowed to use transmitting utility meters. There are many examples of utility companies bullying customers with threats of disconnected service to force them to take transmitting utility meters, including my famil y. There are many examples of people being disabled by the radiation from transmitting utility meters and even force d from the neighborhood by the radiation from neighbors' utility meters, even when they have been able to have an analog meter on their own home (see FCC docket below for some of them). We still had analog meters and yet, the radiation coming off of our end -of-the-line transformer from all the mete rs and cell towers caused cardiac arrhythmias in our two young children and for my husband and me. We slept in a tent well away from the building site while we tried to deal with the utility and PSC. Our younger son's heart rate got so slow one night when we were forced by broken tent poles to sleep at home that he lost bladder control, wetting only his underwear because the volume of urine was so small. When I went to him in response to his call, he was agitated and upset, but his heart rate was very slow and the beats were weak and irregula r. This continued for a couple of hours. We did not sleep in the house again after that until the utility company removed the secondary power line from their transformer to our house. It was obvious the situation was too dangerous to be allowed to continue. So, we did the only thing we could do and told the utilities to remove our service and we went off-grid since they refused to even properly investigate the situation, never mind do anything. After going completely off-grid, we had three heavenly weeks. We slept well, felt well, and had lots of ene rgy. Our pets' health improved. Most importantl y, our sons' cardiac rhythms had almost completely normalized. Unfortunatel y, the toxic exposure we received has left our whole family extremely sensitized to radiofrequency radiation so when, in early January 2012, 4G cellphone service was installed in our area we began to experience impairment quickl y. Within a week, our sons' cardiac rhythms were again highly irregula r. Our younger son was again waking us in the night crying and feeling unwell with a highly irregular cardiac rhythm. We have shielded in various ways and keep pulling them back from the brink. The drastic measures we have taken (e.g. going off-grid, shielding) to reduce their exposure have momentarily stabilized them at about early stage 2 radiofrequency sickness. (See Dodge) We are very concerned that any increase in the radiofrequency radiation levels could again push them over the edge toward stage 3 radiofrequency sickness. They should not be involuntarily exposed Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-38 to a pollutant that has such profound detrimental effects on them. We are literally trapped on our farm and in our home as outdoor radiofrequency radiation levels have climbed rapidly over the few years. We have had to restrict the amount of time our outdoors -loving sons can be outside. They are now only able to be out a half an hour at a time a few times a week. If they are out more than that with any regularity their cardiac arrhythmias become severe enough that they become symptomatic. We have difficulty going anywhere due to all the radiation from towers and the WiFi and cellphones present indoors are even worse, often causing symptomatic arrhythmias almost immediatel y. Because of the serious e ffects exposure to radiofrequencies has on my health, we have never owned a cellphone, cordless phones, wireless route r, baby monitors, or subscribed to wireless internet. Our children both experience health problems when exposed to radiofrequencies. They feel sick, become hyperactive, less able to think logically and control their behavio r. They also sleep poorly in bad radiofrequency environments. The recent increase in radiofrequency radiation exposure from the transmitting electrical meters and wireless technology has given them chronic cardiac arrhythmias which improve when we can reduce their exposure. We have done this several times only to have ambient levels increase and cause the arrhythmia to return. We are homeschooling them so they will not be exposed to the dangerous radiofrequency environment in our local public school. The school has both WiFi and high electrical pollution levels. We are unable to bring them to the zoo, museums, most parks, indeed almost anywhere, because of the ubiquitous presence of radiation from wireless technolog y. Our social isolation by wireless technology is a total violation of our civil rights. Wireless technology needs to be eliminated from public buildings and public places. Elimination of Wireless from Public Buildings and Public Places is a Reasonable Accommodation In consideration of wireless technology 's exclusionary effect and the very real threat it poses to public health (see www.bioinitiative.o rg and http://ww w.iarc.fr/en/media - public -information/ final_mobile_towers_report.pd f ), it is reasonable to eliminate radiation from wireless devices from the public arena. Internet access should be provided using publicly available wired connections. In addition, radiofrequency radiation detectors can remind people to turn off wireless devices as they enter public buildings. My family 's on-going nightmare of societal exclusion and serious functional impairment, caused by the presence of biologically active levels of radiofrequencies on the electrical grid and radiofrequency radiation transmitted into the environment through use of wireless technolog y, is illustrative of why it is essential to establish biologically -based radiofrequency radiation safety limits. The Environmental Protection Agency should be given the authority to do so since the FCC lacks the expertise. In the meantime, eliminating radiation from wireless technology from public places would allow people with radiofrequency sickness to participate in societ y. Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-39 I have maintained the website www.electricalpollution.com since 2002, shortly after I discovered that the radiofrequencies present on building wiring and flowing across the ground from non- linear time varying loads were making me, and others, sick. Research on the health effects of electrical pollution is available on the website on the Research Page. More technical information is available on the Technical Page. Electrical pollution is a very potent form of exposure to radiofrequencies. Exposure to all forms of radiofrequencies, including electrical pollution, must be included in standards regulating exposure of the general public to protect the public health during continuous exposure. I have read widely on the research into the health effects of exposure to radiofrequencies. There is a growing body of evidence that the increased exposure to radiofrequencies from radiowave and microwave transmitters and from electrical pollution are behind the public health crisis that has dramatically increased utilization of our medical system for chronic conditions. The article by Halbe rg and Johansson in Pathophysiology supports this contention. The comprehensive review by D r. Cherr y, which documents health effects and explores mechanisms, besides thermal mechanisms, through which microwave and radiowave radiation can impact health, also supports the contention that exposure to microwave and radiowave radiation is a public health threat which is probably contributing to significant public illness. A review of the Soviet literature on radiofrequency sickness by Christopher Dodg e3 of the Naval Observatory discusses radiofrequency sickness in detail. The symptoms attributed to chronic exposure to radiofrequency radiation mirror the deterioration of health being seen in the U.S. in recent years, probably due to the dramatic increase in exposure to radiofrequencies from electrical pollution and wireless technolog y. Papers by D r. Milham4, Dr. Havas5,6,7 and Dr. Wertheimer8 also show that exposure to electrical pollution constitutes a public health threat, as does a report by Char Sbraggia regarding health improvements experienced by teachers and students when the electrical pollution in their school was cleaned up (http://ww w.electricalpollution.com/ images/MelMinNurse.jpe g). These are just a few of the papers I have read. However, they provide a picture which should illustrate how reasonab le it is to institute the accommodations necessary to enable people with radiofrequency sickness to participate in community life, utilize public services, and enter public buildings . 1. \u00d6.

Accommodations for people with radiofrequency sickness are really common sense and societally beneficial because radiofrequency radiation poses a serious threat to the public health. \"Public safety standa rds are 1,000 - 10,000 or mo re times higher than levels now commonly reported in mobile phone base station studies to cause bioeffects.\" (http://ww w.bioinitiative.o rg/conclusions /) Accommodations necessary for people with requency sickness Provision of Basic Services: Utilites - wate r, gas, electric People with radiofrequency sickness are being forced to choose between forced to experience serious environmentally -induced functional impairment in order to access utility services. NIDILRR needs to put the PSC/PUCs on notice that it is their job to force utility companies to comply with the 2008 ADA Amendments which require accommodation of people with environmentally -induced functional impairment. At this time, many utilities and PSC/PUCs are flatly refusing to provide any accommodation, never mind the important accommodation of metering utility service with an analog mechanical meter which used to be standard operating procedure until recentl y. Many utilities are pretending these meters are no longer available. They are. Telephone Telephone companies must be required to provide RF interference -free copperwire telephone service to people with RF sickness. Most people with RF sickness cannot use cellphones. Cable phones and fiber optic phones can come with electronics that emit biologically significant RFI (RF interference - which can be Incidental or Unintentional, but is still biologically active) and are intolerable to some people with RF sickness. Phone companies need to provide RF filters and DSL filters to people with RF sickness without a hassle. Experience has shown that RF cross -contamination between lines (DSL to non -DSL lines) and between lines and electrical grid RF can be biologically significant so all lines should be equipped with filters. (From a public health perspective, it would be best if these were provided to all customers as a matter of course. All people experience biological effects from RF exposure, but many are either still compensating well enough they are not symptomatic or they simply do not make the connection between exposure and symptoms.) Transportation Most people with RF sickness are unable to use public transportation due to the presence of wireless radiation. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that people with RF sickness have access to stripped -down low RF automobiles. These would be the safest automobiles for everyone, but they are essential for those with RF sickness to retain independent mobilit y. For more details, please read my attached comment related to cars which was submitted into Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-41 the TECHNOLOGICAL ADVISO RY COUNCIL (TAC) NOISE FLOOR TECHNICAL INQUI RY (ET Docket No. 16 -191). Regulatory The FCC Noise Rules urgently need to be updated to prevent new electrical devices, lighting, etc. from being sold and used in the public arena that block access by people with radiofrequency sickness. The existing FCC Noise Rules are solely designed to prevent technological interference. They need to be revised to prevent new electrical devices from being access barriers or from causing a public health threat. For more details, please read my attached comment about the need to update the noise limits which was submitted into the TECHNOLOGICAL ADVISO RY COUNCIL (TAC) NOISE FLOOR TECHNICAL INQUI RY (ET Docket No. 16 -191). Below is a list of accommodations necessary to allow people with radiofrequency sickness to once again participate fully in public and community life. It is divided into two categories - one for transmitted radiofrequency radiation and one for radiofrequency exposure from \"dirty\" Austria radiofrequency radiation safety limits until biologically -based population - protective RF safety limits can be established (1microW/m2 inside and 10microW/m2 outside - lowered as necessary to prevent biological effects because our experience shows that levels should be below 3microW/m2). Eliminate wireless internet service from public places (including transportation). Transmitters on wireless devices turned off in public places - detectors should be installed at entrances to remind people. Hospitals only use wired internet, wired in-building networks, and wired devices within the hospital. This would also protect privacy and securit y. Cell and broadband antennas situated at a distance from hospitals and residential areas such that Salzbu rg radiation limits of 1microW/m2 not exceeded inside the hospital or homes. Medical clinics use only wired in-office network and internet service and devices. \"Dirty\" electricity radiof requency accommodations: Kazakstan \"dirty\" power standard adopted globally - maximum of 50 G/S units on Stetzerizer meter on building wiring. (www.stetzerelectric.com/ ) Daylighting should be encouraged. All new lighting installations must be low radiofrequency lighting e.g. properly engineered lighting with very low or no emission of Incidental or Unintentional RF. LED lights can be engineered to this standard, but many are not at this time and therefore emit high amounts of RF. (Additional benefits - LEDs are more energy efficient than fluorescent lighting and do not emit UV thereby allowing greater access for people with lupus.) Use of tiered lighting instead of dimmer switches (also saves ene rgy). See the Solutions page at www.electricalpollution.com for a more comprehensive list of steps to minimize RF exposure.

The 1500 -page BioInitiative Report on RF/MW health effects was published in 2012. The authors are 29 scientists from ten countries. They reviewed thousands of studies showing interference with chemical processes in the body, implicating RF/MW in a whole spectrum of alarming effects including genetic damage, cance r, immune dysfunction, neurological injur y, and infertilit y. The report can be found at www.bioinitiative.o rg. For people with radiofrequency sickness, these effects can be immediate and serious. Cardiac arrhythmias can be caused by wi reless technolog y. Recent replicated double blind studies show that a cordless phone base station operating at WiFi frequencies can cause cardiac arrhythmias in susceptible individuals. This short video discusses the cardiac effect that wireless can have - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EI9fZX4iww . View this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv1E9IXUd6M to see further discussion. You can read the studies at http://www.magdahavas.com/wordpress/wp -content/uploads/2012/01/Havas -HRV - Ramazzini.pdf and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675629# . Obviously, for susceptible people (like those of us with radiofrequency sickness), WiFi can make whole buildings inaccessible and unsafe. A recent study in rabbits found that not only did WiFi change heart function parameters, but it dramatically changed the cardiac effects of both dopamine and epinephrine: Saili L, et al. Effects of acute exposure to WIFI signals (2.45 GHz) on heart variability and blood pressure in Albinos rabbit. Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 40 (2015) 600 -605. This should be of great concern since WiFi has become ubiquitous in medical settings and may compromise the effectiveness of essential medical interventions, especially for people with radiofrequency sickness. Medical care is conside red to be a basic human right, but people with radiof requency sickness can no longer access it without potentially endangering their lives or at least experiencing severe functional impairment. Causal connections between radiof requency exposu re and biological functional impairment. More recent papers look specifically at causality such as Pall ML Microwave frequency elect romagnetic fields (EMFs) produce widesp read neuropsychiatric effects including depression. Chem Neuroanat. 2015 Aug 20. ( http://ww w.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061815000599 ). It discusses the causal relationship between exposure to radiation from wireless technology and neuropsychiatric effects. Mechanisms of action are also discussed. Yakymenko et al discuss the fact that RF radiation is documented in numerous studies to cause oxidative damage and discusses mechanisms for bioeffects (Low intensity radiofrequency radiatio n: a new oxidant Sci 2014; 3(1):1 -3) (http://ww w.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668915300594 ).

The International (ICNIRP) sets radiof requency (RF) exposu re limits for Europe that a re similar to what the IEEE sets for Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-43 the U.S. According to ICNIR P, FCC guidelines would not be protective for individuals with sensitivities/ impairments from low exposu res of RF/M W. It is a scientific fact that even small amounts of these environmental exposures are harmful to some. ICNIRP stated the following: \"Diffe rent groups in a population may have differences in their ability to tolerate a particular NIR (non-ionizing radiation) exposu re. For example, child ren, the elderl y, and some chronically ill people might have a lower tolerance for one or mo re forms of NIR exposu re than the rest of the population. Under such ci rcumstances, it may be useful or necessary to develop separate guideline levels for different groups within the general population, but it may be more effective to adjust the guidelines for the general population to include such groups. Some guidelines may still not provide adequate protection for certain sensitive individuals nor for normal individuals exposed concomitantly to other agents, which may exacerbate the effect of the NIR exposu re, an example being individuals with photosensitivit y.\" from ICNIRP STATEMEN T, GENERAL APPROACH TO PROTECTION NONIONIZING RADI www.icnirp.o rg/documents/philosoph y.pdf) In light if this statement and all the other evidence, it is time that accessibility guidelines for hospitals, medical facilities, and other essential government buildings prohibit the presence of facility provided WiFi and other wireless transmissions within the facilit y. Medical records, electronic data, and the internet can be accessed perfectly well (and far more securely) using dedicated communication cables. Our doctors office has used electronic records for years which they accessed using direct cabled connections which they plugged their laptop into upon entering the office. The Threat to Public Health Posed by Wireless Technology Makes Elimination of Wireless from Public Buildings, Hospitals, Medical Facilities, Schools, and Public Places a Very Reasonable Accommodation The following links are of interest in spite of the fact that they relate to public health since they help with understanding that the accommodations needed for people with radiofrequency sickness are actuall y beneficial for public health. Wireless technology not only restricts accessibility for people with radiofrequency sickness, it jeopardizes public health. U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) recently released findings that the radiation utilized by wireless technology is carcinogenic and breaks DNA.

These findings have enormous implications for cardiac health in a chronically RF exposed population.Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-45 Catherine Kleiber December 15, 2016 Dear Ms. Walker, Thank you for your attention to my comments. My main interest in critiquing the FirstNet PEIS documents is making sure that the environmental and health effects of the radiofrequency (RF) radiation that the wireless component of FirstNet will emit are appropriately factored into decisions about how to implement FirstNet. I address the serious deficiencies below. (Page numbers listed originate from Volume 1 Chapter 2 Draft Programatic Environmental Impact Statement for the Central United States, but the critique should be broadly applicable to the RF radiation section for all four regions.) There were seriously inaccurate statements made about the safety level assured by existing FCC RF radiation limits: p. 2-10 \"For 20 years, the regulatory levels for human exposure to RF emissions have been established by the FCC as a means of protecting both workers and the general public from any potential effects.\" p. 2-12 \"These limits are based on thermal effects (i.e., the amount of RF ene rgy required to heat tissue). According to the FCC, the established limits are well below levels that are considered to have adverse health effects.\" Other government officials dispute claims such as these that FCC RF radiation limits provide sufficient population -based protection from harm during continuous exposures. The Department of Interior (DOI) said \"the elect romagnetic radiation standards used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continue to be based on thermal heating, a criterion now nearly 30 years out of date and inapplicable today \" (http://ww w.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/us_doi_comments.pdf ), clearly indicating that they do not consider FCC RF radiation limits to be \"protecting both workers and the general public fro m any potential effects\" as the PEIS states. Mr. Norbert Hankin from the Center for Science and Risk Assessment, Radiation Protection Division, E PA, makes it clear in his correspondence with the EMR Policy Institute that \"The FCC's current exposure guidelines, as well as those of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the International Commission on Non -ionizing Radiation Protection, are thermally based, and do not apply to ch ronic, nonthermal exposu re situations . They are believed to protect against injury that may be caused by acute exposures that result in tissue heating or electric shock and burn. The hazard level (for frequencies generally at or greater than 3 MHz) is based on a specific absorption dose-rate, SAR, associated with an effect that results from an increase in body temperature. The FCC's exposure guideline is conside red protective of effects arising from a thermal mechanism but not f rom all possible mechanisms. Therefore, the generalization by many that the guidelines protect human beings from harm by any or all mechanisms is not justified.\" (emphasis added) (http://ww w.emrpolic y.org/litigation/case_law/docs/noi_epa_response.pd f) This very credible evidence is unmentioned and ignored . As M r. Hankin makes plain above, the FCC RF radiation limits are not protective from all adverse effects only those from thermal mechanisms during acute exposures, so the second sentence of the Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-46 quote from the PEIS (p 2 -12), and copied above, is an implicit lie. Whether this is intentional or inadvertent, it should be corrected. FCC RF radiation limits are based on thermal effects in a large male. They are not population -protective. They do not and were never intended to protect from biological effects or even thermal effects during the chronic exposures we all experience today and which FirstNet would increase. Even ICNIRP acknowledges the need to adjust their RF radiation guidelines (referred to here as NIR): \" Diffe rent groups in a population may have differences in their ability to tolerate a particular NIR (non- ionizing radiation) exposu re. For example, child ren, the elderl y, and some chronically ill people might have a lower tolerance for one or mo re forms of NIR exposu re than the rest of the population. Under such ci rcumstances, it may be useful or necessary to develop separate guideline levels for different g roups within the general population, but it may be more effective to adjust the guidelines for the general population to include such g roups. Some guidelines may still not provide adequate protection for certain sensitive individuals nor for normal individuals exposed concomitantly to other agents, which may exacerbate the effect of the NIR exposu re, an example being individuals with photosensitivit y.\" from ICNIRP STATEMEN T, GENERAL APPROACH TO PROTECTION NONIONIZING RADI w.icnirp.o rg/documents/philosoph y.pdf After the release of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) findings showing that non- thermal RF radiation exposures cause DNA breakage and cance r, the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) posted an article with comments from Kenneth Foster of the IEEE committee that reviews RF radiation exposure limits: With the NTP study results, Foster expects more governments to put out cautionary guidelines and radiation labeling for cellphones. He says he wouldn 't be surprised if California adds RF radiation to its Proposition 65 list of carcinogenic chemicals, and if the IARC ups its classification rating from 2B: possibly carcinogenic to humans to 2A: probably carcinogenic to humans. \"And they wouldn 't be out of line in doing that,\" he says. \"This is going to change the rhetoric in the field. People can point to much mo re hard evidence that [cellphone RF cancer -in-rats) the U.S. NTP findings from the PEIS RF radiation section is a very serious one and should be remedied. FirstNet cannot argue the U.S. National Toxicology Program is not a sufficiently reputable. P. 2-18 \"Howeve r, the BWG [BioInitiative Working Group] itself has been criticized by other scientific, professional, and governmental bodies for ignoring conflicting, inconsistent, or other credible evidence that clashed with its report (e.g., (Dolan, M. and J. Rowle y, 2009)).\" The BioInitiative Working Group, a group of researchers and public health experts, are criticized in this quote with attribution to a paper written by representatives of telecom industry interest groups. This is analogous to dismissing the body of research on the health effects of tobacco, asbestos, or lead paint due to a critique by industry representatives. This was done for years and we have now seen what a mistake it was to allow it. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives due to the regulatory delays that resulted from allowing industry to dismiss research Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-47 critical of it. This article is not different. If its opinions warrant inclusion in the PEIS at all, they should be clearly attributed as representing the telecom industr y. This was definitely not done. On p. 2 -12, studies are cited as finding that even with roof-top antennas, measurements inside those buildings are low compared to FCC limits, scant comfort since we already established that the government knows that the FCC limits are \"...now nearly 30 years out of date and inapplicable toda y.\" Discussion about findings of widespread violations of FCC limits are omitted from the discussion, but are highly relevant and should be included. A detailed investigation by the EMR Policy Institute showed almost no enforcement of existing FCC RF radiation limits and rampant violations (http://www.marketwired.com/press -release/ -1770139.htm -worries - 1412293055 ) reports similar findings with one in ten towers out of compliance and experts concerned that out of compliance towers could be transmitting in the thermal range by around the end of 2015. The fact that the FCC is incredibly lax, even negligent, in taking regulatory action even when violations are reported, never mind going out and conducting unannounced spot inspections, should be of great concern and should be a factor considered in the PEIS. Additionall y, these studies are old and date to a time when few people used wireless in many areas and there were many fewer antennas. One major failing of the FCC limits that merits discussion in the PEIS is the fact that they govern each antenna separatel y. Collocations result in much higher RF radiation levels around the site because each antenna still broadcasts at the same level as if there were no collocation. Transmission from other antenna sites and mobile devices further increase ambient exposure levels. This must be discussed in the PEIS as an environmental impact since the purpose of the broadband provision portion of FirstNet 's mission mentioned on p. 2 -8 is to encourage the use of wireless technology which will in turn increase the ambient RF radiation levels from both devices and base station antennas. In the example on p. 2-14, each antenna produces a field of 477W/ m2 at ground level, but collocation of 4 such arrays (which is not uncommon) would result in 1,908 W/ m2 at ground level. This is still below the FCC RF radiation limits, but which we established above are outdated and meaningless according to the DOI and not protective in chronic exposure situations according to the E PA. Even 477W/m2 exceeds levels shown in studies to cause biological effects, specifically negative e ffects related to sleep, stress, immune function, brain cance r, breakage of the blood -brain barrie r, other cancers, reproduction, and oxidative damage. A ground level of 1,908 W/ m2 exceeds levels shown in studies to cause heart effects and calcium metabolic areas will certainly be exposed to high enough RF radiation levels on the ground to cause serious biological effects. RF radiation levels in portions of neighboring buildings elevated above ground level are likely to be even higher. On p. 2 -11, there is a list of \"Some of the major problems with demonstrating cause and effect for RF\" which seem to be cited as excusing FirstNet from an obligation to take action to protect the public and the environment. Each point is addressed below. \"No consistent measu res of exposu re. Exposu re is changing with the proliferation of cell phone Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-48 use, and the re is no real unexposed or \"cont rol\" population (Ahlbom et al., 2004) (Khurana et al., 2010 )\" While the absence of a control population cannot be used to justify inaction, it does support the high level of urgency to making sure that public health policy and regulations related to RF radiation exposure are sufficiently protective since everyone is exposed . Exact continuity of exposure measurement is not necessary between studies as long as care has been used within each study to be consistent. Studies show that RF radiation has very serious biological effects at levels far below existing FCC RF radiation limits. Below are some examples of serious clinically important biological effects resulting from real-life RF radiation exposures: Cardiac arrhythmias can be caused by wi reless technolog y. Recent replicated double blind studies show that a cordless phone base station operating at WiFi frequencies can cause cardiac arrhythmias in susceptible individuals. This short video discusses the cardiac effect that wireless can have - http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EI9fZX4iw w. View this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv1E9IXUd6M to see further discussion. You can read the studies at http://www.magadahavas.com.wordpress/wp -content/uploads/2012/01/Havas -HRV - Ramazzini.pdf and http://www.ncbi.ntm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675629# . Obviously, for susceptible people (like those of us with radiofrequency sickness), WiFi can make whole buildings inaccessible and unsafe. A recent study in rabbits found that not only did WiFi change heart function parameters, but it dramatically changed the cardiac effects of both dopamine and epinephrine: Saili L, et al. Effects of acute exposure to WIFI signals (2.45 GHz) on heart variability and blood pressure in Albinos rabbit. Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 40 (2015) 600 -605. A mouse cardiac study showed that mice exposed to RF radiation from a cellphone had significantly lower vitamin D levels, low calcium, low antioxidant capacit y, low cardiac tissue MDA and elevated renin levels compared to controls. They also had enlarged left ventricles and ECG abnormalities (Fatma 2011). Both these cardiac effects are pre-disposing factors toward cardiac arrest. Obviousl y, these serious cardiac effects caused by RF radiation exposures from consumer devices ought to be discussed in the PEIS, since FirstNet will be promoting their use and emitting radiation levels from its antennas comparable to these exposures. Cancer levels around antennas are elevated and FirstNet will either be elevating already heightened risks by adding collocation antennas, increasing emissions of existing antennas by increasing use, or putting up new towers and increasing cancer risk in those around them. This should be discussed in the PEIS. \"The Influence of Being Physically Near to a Cell Phone Transmission Mast on the Incidence of Cancer \" (http://emrstop.o rg/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=4&Itemid=18 ) found significant increases in cancer risk at RF radiation levels below FCC RF radiation limits. Other studies have as well. These merit serious consideration in the FirstNet PEIS and should not be omitted. Anything that will increase cancer risk for a large segment of the population should be considered very carefully. A review by Dr. Cherry (2000). Criticism of the Health Assessment in the ICNIRP Guidelines for Radiofrequency and Microwave Radiation (100 kHz - 300 GHz) http://www.electricalpollution.com/documents/Cherry2000EMR_ICNIRP_critique_09 -02.pdf discusses common errors in understanding about RF radiation exposures and studies and is, as Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-49 its title states a criticism of ICNIRP. Radiofrequency radiation exposure causes important endocrine changes . \"Changes of Clinically Important Neurotransmitters under the Influence of Modulated RF Fields - A Long - term important study documenting hormonal changes in residents before installation of a cellphone antenna and for a year and a half afterward. They found initial hormone level increases consistent with a stress response to RF radiation exposure levels as low as 60W/m2. Initially adrenaline and noradrenaline increased and dopamine and phenylethylamine (PEA) levels decreased. While adrenaline and noradrenaline did decrease, dopamine and PEA levels never ret urned to pre -base station levels, remaining substantially lower during the year and a half of the study. According to the authors \"This is of considerable clinical relevance because psychiatric symptoms also exhibit altered PEA levels. In Rimbach, the increase in sleep problems, cephalgia, vertigo, concentration problems, and allergies could be clinically documented after the cell phone base station had been activated. The newly developed symptoms can be explained clinically with the help of disturbances in the humoral stress axis.\" These long -term debilitating effects of cell towers must be mentioned in the PEIS and weighed in the decision making about how to move forward with FirstNet. \"How does long term exposure to base stations and mobile phones affect human hormone profiles?,\" Eskander et al. (http://ww w.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S00099120 11027330 ) is a very important study which documented hormonal changes occurring over time with chronic exposures to base station antennas or cell phones. It is extremely important that ACTH, cortisol, and T4 were significantly reduced in exposed individuals compared to controls. So were testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin. These effects became more pronounced over time. Endocrine disruption is extremely important clinically and should be considered as an extremely negative effect of the planned wireless portion of FirstNet. It should not be omitted from the FirstNet PEIS. \"No scientifically agreed upon biological mechanism for harm. The lack of a clear biological mechanism increases uncertainty into whether the health end point that the study examined is the correct endpoint to try and measu re (Hauri et al., 2014) (Ahlbom et al., 2004) \" Agreed upon by whom? The telecom industry? There are two mechanisms by which RF radiation produces biological effects that are currently well-supported by research literature. One is oxidation caused by RF radiation exposu re (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151230 ). Oxidation can occur even with non -ionizing radiation exposure. At least 93 studies have now found that RF radiation has oxidative effects. Oxidation has important biological effects. Yakymenko states \"In addition, ROS at relatively low concentrations can modulate inflammation via activation of NF -kB pathway (Hayden and Ghosh, 2011). Therefore, even subtle exposures to RFR with generation of hardly dete ctable quantities of free radicals can have their meaningful biological consequences.\" This is because \"free radicals/ROS are an intrinsic part of the cellular signaling cascades.\" Increasing Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-50 population -wide exposure to an unavoidable oxidant will have pro found effects on public health and the environment and should be discussed and weighed appropriately in the FirstNet PEIS. The second is the ability of non -thermal levels of RF radiation to cause voltage -gated Ca2+ ion channels to open inapp ropriatel y. This can have profound and detrimental biological effects because Ca2+ is utilized in many cellular and intercellular systems as a messenge r, meaning that when the voltage -gated Ca2+ ion channel opens inappropriately it sets off a cascade that affects metabolic activities within the cell or bod y. Not only is Ca2+ efflux well-documented in the literature, but a reasonable mechanistic explanation for how very low RF radiation levels can cause voltage -gated Ca2+ channels to open is elucidated by D r. Martin Pall in Elect romagnetic Fields Act Similarly in Plants as in Animals: Probably Activation of Calcium Channels via Their Voltage Senso r, Current Chemical Biology , 2016, Vol. 10, No. 1., as follows: \"The voltage sensor opens the ion channel due to the action of changes in the electrical force across the plasma membrane acting directly on these 20 voltage sensor charges [8]. The structu re of the VGCC voltage sensor is discussed in more detail in the Discussion section below. It is plausible, therefore, that the electrical forces of these low intensity EMFs act through their electrical effects on the voltage sensor to activate the VGCCs. It is predicted that the forces on the 20 cha rges in the VGCC voltage sensor are highly amplified because of two important factors [2]. The law of physics called Coulomb 's law predicts that forces on cha rged groups a re inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the medium in which the charges occu r. Because the dielectric constant of the aqueous phases in the cell or extra - cellular medium are about 120 times higher than the dielectric constant of the lipid bilayer [2], this p redicts that forces on the each of the 20 cha rges of the voltage sensor are about 120 times higher than a re electrical forces on singly charged groups in the aqueous phases. In addition, Sheppa rd et al. [10], p redicted that the electrical forces produced by EMFs across the plasma membrane are amplified about 3000 -fold compa red with the forces in the aqueous phases because of the high electrical resistance of the plasma membrane. It follows from this, that the forces on the voltage sensor are estimated to be vastly increased as compa red with forces on aqueous phase single charges, where most if not all cha rged groups occur: 20(# of charges in voltage sensor) X 120 (f rom the dielectric constant) X 3000 (amplification at the plasma membrane) = 7.2 million Because of this, the electrical forces placed on the voltage sensor by these EMFs is calculated to be app roximately 7.2 million times higher than are the forces placed on singly charged groups located elsewhe re in the cell because these singly charged groups a re predominantly in the aqueous phase [2]. It is highly plausible, therefore, that this extrao rdinary sensitivity of the voltage sensor to such weak electrical effects is the final answer to this long puzzle of how such low intensity EMFs can produce biological effects in many animals, including humans. \" This important mechanism explains many of the biological effects RF radiation can have at levels far below the outdated FCC RF radiation limits and far below the levels that FirstNet would emit. Obviously this should be discussed in the PEIS and provides reasons for modifying the execution of FirstNet. \"Some potential effects of major concern are rare, such as brain cancer and acoustic neuroma, both of which have been potentially linked to RF exposu re. If the health outcome is rare, it is Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-51 even harder to demonstrate cause and effect (Ahlbom et al., 2004) .\" Even rare effects are significant when the whole population is being exposed to the causal agent. The early study cited here likely contain gross underestimates of the effect of RF radiation exposure on brain cancers and acoustic neuroma due to the long latencies normally involved in brain cancers (30-40 years). That studies are already finding effects should highlight the truly dangerous nature of RF radiation as a carcinogen. The U.S. NTP study should be discussed here. It found that non-thermal levels of RF radiation break DNA (considered the hallmark of a carcinogen) and increases the risk of glioma of the brain of glioma, is increasing 1.3% -2.3% per year over a 15 -year period, which was statistically significant (http://microwavenews.com/news - center/ntp -and-brain -tumor -rates ). Thus, controlled lab studies and epidemiological findings are in agreement. A replicated European study found that RF radiation promotes cancer growth, supporting the carcinogenicity of RF radiation (Lerchl, et. al., 2015 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25749340 ). Exposures were non -thermal and well -below existing FCC RF radiation limits. These findings, especially taken togethe r, should carry a lot of weight and strongly suggest the need for precaution, especially with the studies above showing that cellular base station antennas cause increases in cance r. They must be included in the Firstnet PEIS. Research findings are sufficiently strong now related to carcinogenicity that former IARC panelists like D r. Dariusz Leszczynski warn that RF-EMF should be classified as a Group 2A carcinogen, and Dr. Lennart Hardell reports that several studies indicate a Group 1 classification is justified, placing RF- EMF in the same category as tobacco, asbestos, and benzene. Dr. Dariusz Leszczynski MSc, DSc, PhD https://betweenrockandhardplace.wordpress.com/2014/08/14/carcinogenicity -of-cell-phone - radiation -2b-or-not-2b/ \"In conclusion, I consider that currently the scientific evidence is sufficient to classify cell phone radiation as a p robable human ca rcinogen - 2A category in IARC scale. Time will show whether 'the probable ' will change into 'the certain'. Howeve r, it will take tens of years before the issue is really resolved. In the mean time we should implement the Precautionary Principle. There is a serious reason for doing so.\" Dr. Lennart Hardell MD, PhD https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24192496 \"Based on the Hill criteria, glioma and acoustic neuroma should be conside red to be caused by RF -EMF emissions from wireless phones and regarded as ca rcinogenic to humans, classifying it as g roup 1 acco rding to the IARC classification. Current guidelines for exposu re need to be urgently revised .\" These opinions are important because these researchers were among the IARC panelists that decided in 2013 only to classify RF radiation as a class 2B carcinogen and now they consider the evidence significant enough to warrant changing the classification to \"probably carcinogenic\" or even carcinogenic. The U.S. NTP study results have been released since these statements were made, probably further weighting them in the direction of carcinogenicit y. These factors should definitely be discussed in the PEIS. They should also have real influence over whether the scope of the FirstNet project should be adjusted. On pages 2-19 to 2-20 serious effects of RF radiation and RF infrastructure are discussed and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-52 dismissed in a bizarre manne r. Nine studies showing harm to bird populations via a variety of mechanisms are discussed, including reproductive failure. Then two laboratory studies showing reproductive failure in chickens are discussed \"Laboratory studies conducted with domestic chicken embryos have shown that emissions at the same frequency and intensity as that used in cellular telephones have appea red to result in death (DiCarlo et al., 2002) (Manville II, A., 2007). \" Then the idea that these studies show that low level RF radiation emissions support the findings in the environmental studies is ridiculed because \"given the controlled nature of the studies and potential exposu re differences in the wild, this causation is left to interp retation and extrapolation. \" This is a case where bird epidemiological findings and bird lab studies are in agreement. Thus, the evidence show that towers affect birds negativel y, at least reproductivel y. This should be given great weight. FirstNet should be adjusting its plans accordingl y. RF radiation kills and damages trees Very little attention is paid to tree studies. This is an egregious oversight. We rely on trees for the very health of our planet. Trees are being killed and damaged across the U.S. and world -wide by RF radiation even without full-scale implementation of either FirstNet or 5G . RF radiation is being implicated as the cause. Several studies show the very serious effects that RF radiation has on the health of trees. Trees are essential to the welfare of the global environment and the continuation of the human race. They convert carbon dioxide into oxygen for us and purify our air. These are essential services. They also cool and provide shade in our cities and countryside. Additionall y, they provide important wildlife habitat. Decimation of the Amazon rainforest by direct human actions has been oft-cited as endangering the global environment. FirstNet should not be moving forward with plans to increase RF radiation exposure in urban or rural areas since it will hasten the RF radiation -induced death of our urban and rural forests. We cannot afford additional forest die -off. Large mature trees are being seriously damaged and killed, this damage will take 50 y ears or more to repair. The references listed below clearly show that RF radiation has detrimental effects on tree health at levels far below the outdated FCC RF radiation limits.

We have seen it in the city for years, but now we are seeing it in the country as well, on a widespread basis. Please see attached file. The damage is becoming serious and widespread. The nation 's trees cannot survive continued chronic increases in RF radiation levels such as FirstNet would bring through direct infrastructure -induced increases and increases caused by increased utilization and greater numbers of devices. Please read the following reports which demonstrate that wireless technology is causing serious Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-53 harm to wildlife: \"The Report on Possible Impacts of Communication Towers on Wildlife Including Birds and Bees\" commissioned on 30th August 2010 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India http://ww w.moef.nic.in/downloads/public - information/final_mobile_towers_report.pdf \"Impacts of radio -frequency electromagnetic field (RF -EMF) from cell phone towers and wireless devices on biosystem and ecosystem - a review \" http://www.biolmedonline.com/Articles/Vol4_4_2012/Vol4_4_202 -216_BM -8.pdf Balmori, A. logy (2009), doi:10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.01.007 http://ww w.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264463 The Supreme Court of India ordered cell towers removed from schools, colleges, hospitals and playgrounds in Rajasthan because of radiation being \"hazardous to life.\" The court's amazing 200+ page decision thoroughly reviews the worldwide evidence that cell towers are harming human beings and wildlife (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/No - mobile -towers -near-schools -hospitals -directs -Rajasthan -HC/articleshow/17399705.cms ). On July 5, 2013 th e Supreme Court of India upheld this decision. None of these are mentioned in the PEIS. They are of great relevance. The PEIS also did not mention the fact that increasing RF radiation exposure would increase RF radiation -induced functional impairments, violating the rights of those already experiencing serious e ffects from RF radiation (RF radiation sickness - see http://www.magdahavas.com/wordpress/wp -content/u ploads/2010/08/Dodge_1969.pdf ). Furthermore, FirstNet would be in violation of the 2008 ADA Amendments, causing further exclusion from society and greater levels of disability for those already experiencing RF radiation sickness and increasing the numbers of people developing RF radiation sickness since it is caused by chronic over exposure to RF radiation. The only cure for RF radiation sickness is avoiding exposure and the wireless broadband portion of FirstNet would make that virtually impossible. I have attached a comment I made to The National Institute on Disabilit y, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) regarding the need for the elimination of wireless from public places, public buildings, and medical facilities. Numerous other people also made comments. My comment also has relevance for ensuring that wired FirstNet infrastructure does not cause additional disability by causing \"dirty\" electricit y. I hope that FirstNet will steps to ensure that its systems do not cause \"dirty\" electricit y. As noted on p. 2 -12, in 1996 the FCC was given the responsibility to \"prescribe and make effective rules regarding the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions\" (TCA, 104 Pub. L. 104), obviously it has not done this, as discussed above the rules are outdated and inapplicable. The FCC is in the process of updating them so the common practice of relying on compliance with FCC RF radiation limits as being sufficient for protection of health and the environment must end (see p.2-12). As discussed previousl y, until the FCC completes revision of the FCC RF radiation limits so that they are population - based biologically -protective RF radiation limits the FCC is in violation of their Congressional delegated responsibility to adopt Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-54 \"uniform, consistent requirements, with adequate safeguards of the public health and safety\" these were to be \"established as soon as possible\" (H.R. Report No. 104 -204, p. 94). Unfortunatel y, it appears that the undue industry influence at the FCC documented in a report published by Harvard (http://ethics.harvard.edu/files/cente r-for- ethics/files/capturedagency_alste r.pdf), may have compromised the agency's ability to promptly revise its RF radiation safety limits. The need for biologically -based RF radiation safety limits is supported by the RF/EMF research communit y. Over 220 scientists have signed an appeal to the UN (www.emfscientist.org/ ). The need for FirstNet to do its own due diligence is supported by case law. In Massachusetts v. E.P.A., 549 U.S. 497 (2007) Justice Stevens wrote for the majority that agencies cannot ignore Congresses command to regulate. Thus, the fact that FCC has abrogated its duty to maintain protective up-to-date RF radiation limits does not excuse FirstNet from having to consider the serious health and environmental consequences of its program in the PEIS and find a reasonable alternative to protect public health and the environment. In Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, 354 F.2d 608 (2d Ci r. 1965), cert. denied 384 U.S. 941 (1966), on appeal the Circuit Court pointed out (at p. 620) that Congress gave the FPC a broader responsibilit y. The Scenic Hudson Court noted \"In this case, as in many others, the Commission has claimed to be the representative of the public interest. This role does not permit it to act as an umpire blandly calling balls and strikes for adversaries appearing before it; the right of the public must receive active and affirmative protection at the hands of the Commission.\" This decision has obvious applicability to the need for FirstNet to act proactively to protect the health of the American people, as well as the environmental health, not just do a pro forma PEIS without real consideration of the great potential for harm that a portion of the FirstNet program has. Given both the serious inadequacy of the FCC RF radiation limits and the potential for serious harm to public health and the environment that can result if FirstNet implements the program as originally envisioned, FirstNet needs to take steps to amend the program to prevent that harm. Recommended reasonable modifications to FirstNet: FirstNet must inform Congress of the health and environmental hazard posed by the RF radiation emission required for wireless broadband and request Congress to eliminate provision of wireless broadband internet from FirstNet's mission. As discussed earlier in this document, it is now acknowledged by government agencies, particularly the Department of Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency that the FCC RF radiation limits are not protective of the public during the chronic exposures experienced today. Furthermore, the U.S. National Toxicology Program has found that RF radiation damages DNA and causes cance r. These are sufficient reasons to halt the portion of the FirstNet Program aimed at increasing wireless broadband coverage and usage. Increasing wired, cabled, and fiber optic access to broadband could be substituted instead. Thereb y, achieving a comparable result without causing public health or environmental problems. For the same reasons, FirstNet should delay implementation of the wireless first responder's component until they design as system that provides good interoperable first responder communication while minimizing radiofrequency emissions from antennas and first responder's communicators. Thus, communicators should be able to contact each other directl y, not require Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-55 an outside antenna (certai n types of buildings might make communication to an outside antenna impossible anyway), but also be able to utilize it if needed and available. Radiofrequency emissions should not occur continuousl y, only as needed. FirstNet should request that the NTP quickly undertake and complete toxicology studies comparing the di fferent communication technologies, including, but not necessarily limited to, 3G, 4G, and 5G LTE technologies so that FirstNet can utilize the least toxic least biologically active technology for its first responde r's interoperable communication system. Oxidative parameters and calcium efflux should be among the measures used. Please make the necessary modifications to all the FirstNet Draft PEIS documents. Please also make the next versions more readily available. You should, for instance, include links to the different sections on your website so they can be readily located and downloaded. Thank you.

Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-58 RF Radiation F rom Wireless Technology Kills and Damages Trees By Catherine Kleiber Trees are being killed and damaged across the U.S. and world -wide even without full-scale implementation of 5G. RF radiation is being implicated as the cause. Several studies show the very serious e ffects that RF radiation has on the health of trees. Trees are essential to the welfare of the global environment and the continuation of the human race. Decimation of the Amazon rainforest by direct human actions has been oft-cited as endangering the global environment, the FCC should not be moving forward with implementing a technolog y, 5G wireless technolog y, that will hasten the RF caused death of our urban and rural forests. Please read the following papers to see the toll RF is already taking on trees. We cannot afford additional forest die-off. Large mature trees are being seriously damaged and killed, this damage will take 50 years or more to repai r.

Most of them greened up this spring, then had the leaves die and drop. Two still retain leaves low down. Others are completely dead. As you can see the damage to trees is progressing quickly to death. Balimori discusses the fact that \"White and black poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.) a re more sensitive. There may be a special sensitivity of this family exists or it could be due to their ecological characteristics forcing them to live near wate r, and thus electric conductivit y.\" Certainly the trees that are worst off in our area are willows and cottonwoods and they are growing in areas that are wet, but I have seen trees of all types exhibiting damage. Please think of the future. We cannot live without a healthy tree population. We rely on them for the very oxygen we breathe. No technology is worth endangering something as essential as our source of oxygen.

Please read through the list of critiques below for a list of some of the most problematic points and omissions. We (and the Department of Interior) were successful in getting FirstNet to compl ete a Programatic Envi ronmental Impact Statement (PEIS). The Central Region document is available at the following site: https://www. regulations .gov/do -0002 -0001 The South region is available for review and comment at the following link: https://www. regulations documents are huge, however the RF portion is tiny. It is not dealt with throughout the documents. It seems to be in 2.4 which I believe means Chapter 2 section 4 for the two PEIS documents that I was able to obtain. Here are my critiques: RF health risks to workers, the popu lation, and the environment are not addressed throughout the document - they are isolated to the RF section and quickly dismissed.

Toxicology studies shou ld be done comparing 4G and other communications protocols so that first respond ers and the popu lation are exposed to the safest. FirstNet has created to allow first respond ers to communicate easily AND TO PROVIDE WIRELESS BROADBAND NATIONWIDE (2-8). Contrary to their statement FCC regulations do not protect from \"any potential effects,\" as this letter from Mr. Norbert Hankin from the Center for Science and Risk Assessment, Radiation Protection Division, EPA, regarding the limit ations and purpose of the FCC exposu re standards notes (http://www. emrpolicy.org/litig ation/case_law/docs/noi_ epa_respon se.pdf) This very credible evidence is unmentioned and ignored. FCC regulations are poorly enforced. (An issue which is completely ignored in the PEIS.) Rampant violations are documented by the Wall Street Journal and EMR Policy Institute. A detailed investigation by the EMR Policy Institute showed almost no enforcement of existing FCC RF limits and rampant violations (http://www.marketwired.com/press -release/ - 1770139.htm ). A Wall -antenna -safety -worries -1412293055 ) reports similar findings with one in ten towers out of compliance and exp erts concerned that out of compliance towers could be transmitting in the thermal range by around the end of 2015.

The PEIS uses outdated documents to excuse inaction. Contrary to their assertion, FCC limit s do not protect against adverse effects, even the DOI noted \"the electromagnetic radiation standards used by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) continue to be based on thermal heating, a criterion now nearly 30 years out of date and inapplicable today\" (http://www.nti a.doc.gov/files/ntia/us_do i_comm ents.pd f) The opening of the FCC docket to re-evaluate limits is acknowledged, but then ignored. The logical step of delaying implementation of the wireless compon ent until that is compl eted is not even mention ed. The National Toxicology Program findings are not even mentioned. Their exposu re calculations are based on on ly one antenna and work out to 477u W/m 2, which is over the level sho wn at end). Most towers or building antenna sites have more than one antenna radiating in any given direction, plus signals come from other nearby sites, and the ground infrastructure such as cellphon es, tablets etc. So levels at ground level are likely to be far higher than that and levels in apartments or homes which get a direct hit from neighboring bu ildings could be far higher depending on distance. Several IARC panelists have made public statements that the evidence now shows that radiofrequency radiation shou ld be classified as either a class 2A or class 1 human carcinogen. The recent (ignored) National Toxicology Program findings suppo rt this. This shou ld cause the wireless po rtion to be stopped and FirstNet shou ld explain why to Congress, but no mention is made and therefore no such action is recommended. They refuse to take action to protect birds in spite of lab and epidemiological evidence that suppo rt each other in finding hard because it requires \"interpretation and extrapolation.\"(2-20) Doesn't it always? They hardly touch on tree damage and totally ignore the following tree and plant studi es: Radiofrequency radiation injures trees around mobile phone base stations: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306435017_Radiofrequency_radiation_injures_tree s_around_mobile_phone_base_sta tions Adverse Influence of Radio Frequency Background on Trembling Aspen Seedlings: Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-71 Preliminary Observations https://www.hind awi.com/jou rnals/ijfr/2010/836278/ Review: Weak cbi.nlm.nih .gov/pubm ed/27650031 ?dopt=Abst ract Tree http://kompetenzinitiative.net/KIT/wp -content/uploads/2016/06/Tree -damages -in-the- vicinity -of-mobile -phone -base-stations.pdf The make it easy to recognize the effects of RF-EMF. Examples Fields Act Similarly in Plants as in Animals: Probably Activation of Calcium Channels via Their Voltage Sensor Current Chemical Biology, 2016, Vol. 10, No. 1. - IMPORTANT MECHANI STIC DISCUSSION On 2 -20 the PEIS acknowledges \"A number of other studies generally touch upon the nature of RF exposure and the disruption of biological processes that are funda mental to plant and animal growth and health, including but not limited to behavior, DNA damage, immune deficiencies, reprodu ctive system effects, hormone d ysregulation, degrad leep, and neural activity (BioInitiative Working Group, 2012) (Balmori, A., 2005 ),\" but then no protective action is being taken because \"The common pra ctice for NEPA documents related to cellular towers is to cite FCC standards and po int to the fact that they would be built and op erated according to allowable FCC RF emission limits. Some NEPA documents that have more directly addr essed the RF emissions potential largely point to the existing literature and sugg est that a lthough there is evidence that RF emissions could potentially affect some species, the evidence is insufficient to support a finding of adverse impacts on these species due to RF emissions (Ballistic Missile Defense Organ ization, 2000) (FCC, 2012 ).\" This approach was not allowable by the courts in other situations. Especially since the inadequacy of the FCC RF limit s is now acknowledged by both the DOI and the EPA. In addition, numerous studies have added to the kno wledge about the hazard that RF poses to human health since both 2000 and 2012, including the NTP study which has found that RF is carcinogenic and breaks DNA . I am fully disabled from wireless damage and exposu re. Wireless has also caused a hypersensitivity in me to all types of EMFs. It is against the Nuremberg Treaty to experiment on us without informed consent and it is unconstitutional to take away basic human rights and freedoms from me. I can not work, drive, access most public places or medical facilities, and can not even live on my own property without exposu re with wireless being spread everywhere. Millions of Americans are already disabled from EMFs and most can not even use a wired device anymore because their sensitivi ty is too high. You are destroying the health of America and the environment creating a large microwave oven cooking everything within it. Radio Waves do not end. They continue forever. The younger generation that was raised with this technology is already severely damaged. Young kids, teenagers, and young adults are already disabled from EMFs and environmental toxins and can not go out in public without a compl ete meltdown from EMFs including EMFs found in artificial lighting (except incandescent which is the safest artificial lighting there is and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-72 is the hardest to get now). I get contacts regularly from young adults and parents with kids who have no place to go or live without EMF exposu re. Their lives have already been stripped from them. Disabling America and ruining our economy with all this sickness and medical issues is not the answer. Foreign countries are removing wireless from their cities and public places because it is a worldwide epidemic and they are having to pay out disability for it. Russia never allowed high amounts of radiation to begin with and told the world that these cell towers and RF levels were way too high. Will they be the only country left without damaged DNA to reproduce and without their whole country disabled, sick, economically collapsed and famined? Wireless RF/EMFs reach everyone and everything 24/7. You can not opt out of it. It causes severe pain, brain fog, dementia, shuts down mitochond ria and causes severe abnormal chronic fatigue, Parkinsons, Alzheimers, Diabetes type 3, shu ts down kidneys/liver function, stops/paralyzes my heart, causes irregular heartbeat, anxiety, sharp painful heart jerking, rapid heart beat, cardiac arrest, headaches, joint pain, damages DNA , fertility, constant bleeding and severe abdominal pain, seizures, autism, ADHD , and so much more. It is the nu mber one killer of bees and all pollinators along with birds, bats, frogs, etc. It makes animals and humans sick and destroys crops, trees, plants, etc as it weakens them and makes them more prone to sickness, disease, insect damage, etc. It also increases mold both in your body and environment over 600 times including Lyme disease. There is now a mold epidemic due to all the wireless. When wireless hits mold, mold creates a self-defense against it and creates mycotoxins to survive. Mycotoxins are a chemical toxin that can be more deadly than mold itself and is still toxic will killed. It is too small to filter and extremely hard to kill but the dead spores are just as dangerous. Your body creates autoimmune disease the same way when wireless radiation hits your body to try to defend itself against the radiation poison. RF/wireless is a carcinogenic, neurotoxin and genotoxin. Create safer technologies and safe zones where people can live with no wireless/RF radiation. Zone yourselves in and radiate only yourselves. Then when you are all dying from cancer, tumors, and sickness and have no more food after killing off all the pollinators, then let me know what ya think then? I will be sending all my construction and medical bills to any company or government that causes radiation to be on my property. The answer isn't to cover up symptoms. The answer is to remove the problem. Just b ecause there is a new technology, it does not mean that we have to use it. Every person who has a part in wireless deployments will be personally held accountable in court for the damage it has created as crimes against humanity and the environment. The law suits are coming! I will attach a second word document with a list of videos, studies, medical information and more on the dangers of wireless radiation/EMFs along with a Worldwide list of wireless deactivation and removal that has already taken place due to this epidemic.

Even LEDs have blue light. \"Morning sun has blue light in the spectrum, but it is balanced with the other colors in the sun so you get the exact amount you need to reset your circa dian rhythm by getting out in the morning soon after rising and being grounded outside as well. No lenses should be worn for the 15 minutes you do this. This helps to reset melatonin as well. Blue light doesn't just affect our eye clock, it also affects our skin s urface, and our skin detects this color. Jack always recommends that if there is blue light exposure and you're inside, make sure your body is covered up from the blue light exposure, as well as your eyes.

Once the mitochondria doesn't work well, EMF problems loom lar ge as well as other autoimmune conditions, cancer, etc. Once blue light is mitigated by using blue blockers, getting natural sunlight in our eyes, grounding outside barefoot, and setting our circadian r hythms right again, we can reverse the problems. In EMF fields he believes we need a LOT of fatty fish to replace our lost DHA. Jack Kruse is really the top of the list when it comes to having information on blue light, non- native EMF, circa dian biology and quantum biology.

The Vienna Med ical Association has issued cell phone safety guidelines stating that cell phones should be used for as short of a time as possible and that children under 16 should not use cell phones at all. T hey also state that \"wire less LAN leads to high microwave exposure\". January 2016 : Vienna Medical Association has issued new Ten Cell Phone Guidelines. They are: 1. Make calls as short and little as possible - use a landline or write SMS. Children and teenagers under 16 years old should carry cell phones only for emergencies! 2. Distance is your friend- Keep the phone away from body during connection of Phone. Pay atte ntion to the manufacturer's safer distance recommendation in t he manual, keep a distance during the call s et-up from the head a nd body. Take advantage of the built-in speakerphone or a headset! 3. When using headsets or integrated hands-free, do not position mobile phones directly on the body - special caution applies here for pregnant women. For men, mobile phones are a risk to fertility if Mobile is stowed in Tr ouser pockets. Persons with electronic implants (pacemakers, insulin pumps et cetera) must pay attention to distance. U nless otherwi se possible, use coat pocket, backpack or purse. 4. Not in vehicles (car, bus, train) calls - without an external antenna, the radiation in the vehicle is higher. In a ddition, you will be distra cted and you bother in public transport the other passe ngers! Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-91 5. During the car when driving should be an a bsolute ban on SMS and internetworking - the distract ion lea ds to self-endangerment and endangering other road users! 6. Make calls at home and at work via the fixed corded (not wireless) network - Internet access via LAN ca ble (eg via ADSL, VDSL, fiber optic) no Radiation, is fast and secure data transfer. C onstant radiation emitters like DECT cordless telephones, WLAN access points, data sticks and LTE Home base stations (Box, Cube etc.) should be avoided! 7. Go offline more often or use Airplane mode - Remember that for functions such as listening to music, camera, alarm cl ock, calculator or offline games an internet connection is not always required! 8. Fewe r apps means less radiation - Minimize the number of apps and disable the most unnecessary background services on your smartphone. Disabling \"Mobile services\" / \"data network mode\" turns the smartphone again into a cell phone. You can still be reached, but avoid a l ot of unnecessary radiation by background traffic! 9. Avoid Mobile phone calls in places with poor reception (bas ement, elevator etc) as it increases tra nsmission power. Use in poor reception Area a headset or the speakerphone! 10. For buyers of mobile phones, Look out for a very low SAR value and an external antenna connection!

India 2012 The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued new EMF guidelines with new Exposure Limits lowered to 1/10 of the ICNIRP level, and SAR labeling on phon es. Official cell phone radiation guidelines Precautionary Guidelines for mobile users: 1. Keep distance - Hold the cell phone away from body to the extent possible. 2. Use a headset (wired or Bluetooth) to keep the handset away from your head. 3. Do not press the phone handset against your head. Radio Frequency (RF) energy is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source -- being very close increases energy absorption much more. 4. Limit the length of mobile calls. 5. Use text as compared to voice wherever possible. 6. Put the cell phone on speaker mode. 7. If the radio signal is weak, a mobile phone will increase its tra nsmission power. Find a strong signal and avoid movement - Use Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement Appendix G FirstNet Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network Comments Received August 2017 G-92 your phone where reception is good. 8. Metal & water are good conductors of radio waves so avoid using a mobile phone while wearing metal-framed glasses or having wet hair. 9. Let the call connect before putting the handset on your ear or start speaking and listening - A mobile phone first makes the communication at higher power and then reduces power to an adequate level. More power is radiated during call connecting time. 10. If you have a choice, use a landline (wired) phone, not a mobile phone. 11. When your phone is ON, don't carry it in chest/breast or pants pocket. When a mobile phone is ON, it automatical ly transmits at high powe r every one or two minutes to check (poll) the network. 12. Reduce mobile phone use by children as a younger person will lik ely have a longer lifetime exposure to radiation from cell phones. 13. People having act ive medical implants should preferably keep the cell phone at least 15 cm away from the implant. The Parlia mentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment & Forests issued a r eport in the Rajya Sabha on July 23, 2015, recommending \"indigenous methodology and techniques to check the alarming increase in ra diation from radio-active signals, RF and Elect ro- magnetic Fields (EMFs).\" The committee said \"Indians were more prone to risk from radiations as compared to Europeans because of their low body mass index (BMI) and low fat content. Therefore, comprehensive scientific studies must be conducted to \"conclusively esta blish t he level of risks and adverse health ef fects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) of cell towers\". 2013: Supreme Court of India upheld the High Court of the State of Raj asthan decision to remove all cell towers from the vicinity of schools, hospitals and playgrounds because of radiation \"hazardous to life.\" Two hund red and four mobile towers installed on the school premises of Raj asthan have been removed in compliance.

Here is the story. As of 2011 it offered specific Recommendations to reduce cell phone radiation exposure to children. Read t he pre 2015 webpage entitled 'Risks of mobile phone use' with recommendations which stat e; \"Children are though t to be at higher risk of health implications from the use of mobile phon es. T his is because their skulls and cells are still growing and tend to absorb radiation more easily. It is recommended that children use mobile phones only if absolutely necessary.\" Read t he UK Department of Health pre- 2015 brochure on mobile phones and health which reads: \"The expert group has therefore recommended that in line with a precautionary approach , the widespread use of mobile phones by children (under the age of 16) should be discouraged for non-esse ntial calls. In the light of this recommendation the UK Chief Medical Offi cers strongly advise that where children and young people do use mobile phon es, they should be encou raged to: use mobile phon es for essential purposes only keep all calls short - talking for long periods prolongs exposure and should be discouraged T he UK CMOs recommend that if parents want to avoid their children being subject to any possible risk that might be identified in the future, the way to do so is to exercise their choice not to let their children use mobile phon es.\" Read t he 2011 brochure on base stations and health which r eads, \"Therefore, as a precaution, the UK Chief Medical Offi cers advise that children and young people under 16 should be encou raged to use mobile phon es for essential purposes only, and to keep calls short. If y ou are conc erned, you can take steps to reduce your exposure such as using hand s free kits or texting.\" The NHS also had a dditional website sections on health effects. The Mobiles and mums-to- be webpage was about the research s howing cell phone was linked to behavioral issues in children. Read it here. The NHS webpage Mobile effect on sleep detailed research which concluded RF \" is associated with adverse effects on sleep quality within certain sleep stages\".

Then, the UK National Health service changed the public advice text. Everything noted above was reworded. Now the website states: \"If there are any health risks from the use of mobile phones, children might be more vulnerable because their bodies and nervous systems are still developing. Research carried out to date hasn't supported a link betwee n mobile phone use and childhood cancers such as leukaemia.

See the brochure (2011) entitled \"Mobile phones and base stations: Health advice on using mobile phones\" which states: The body and nervous system are still developing into the teenage years. Therefore, as a precaution, the UK Chief Medical Officers advise that children and young people under 16 should be encouraged to use mobile phones for essential purposes only, and to keep calls short. The newly edited section called Mobile phone safety - FAQs states: Do scientists know everything about mobile phones and health? No, and research is continuing. Mobile phon es have only been widely used for abou t 20 to 30 years, so it's not possible to be so certain abou t the safety of long-term use. More research on the effects of mobile phon es on children is also needed, as they're known to be more sensitive than adults to many environmental agents, such as lead pollution and sunlight. Gove rnment advice is to be on the safe side and limit mobile phone use by children. 2016 The Control of Electromagnetic Fields at Work Regulations 2016 (CEFAW) requires employers to ass ess the levels of EMFs their employees may be exposed to, ensure compliance, provide information on risks and take action if necessary.

SEE A FULL LIST OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT REMOVED WI-FI LATER IN DOCUMENT HEALTH ADVICE TO THE PUBLIC 2016: American Academy of Pediatrics Issues Recommenda tions to Reduce Exposure The AAP has updated their Healthy Children Webpage on Cell Phones entitled Cell Phone Radiation & Children's Health: What Parents Need to Know. The webpage reiterated children's unique vulnerability to cell phone radiation stating, \"Another problem is that the cell phon e radiation test used by the FCC is based on the devices' possible effect on large adults\u2014not children. Children's skulls are thinner and can ab sorb more radiation.\" The AAP issued the following cell phone safety tips specifically to reduce ex posure to wireless radiation: Use text messaging when possible, and use cell phones in speaker mode or with the use of hands-free kits. When talki ng on the cell phone, try holding it an inch or more away from your head. Make only short or essential calls on cell phones. Avoid carrying your phone against the body like in a pocket, sock, or bra. Cell phone manufacturers can't guarantee that the amount of radiation you're absorbing will be at a safe le vel. Do not talk on the phone or text while driving. This increases the risk of automobile crashes. Exercise caution when using a phone or texting while walking or performing other acti vities. \"Distracted walking\" injuries are also on the rise. If you plan to watch a movie on your device, download it first, then switch to airplane mode while you watch in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Keep an eye on your signal strength (i.e. how many bars you have). The weaker your cell signal, the harder your phone has to work and the more radiation it gives off. It's better to wait until you have a stronger signal before using your device. Avoid making calls in ca rs, elevators, trains, and buses. The cell phone works harder to get a signal through metal, so the power level increases. Remember that cell phones are not toys or teething items.
