And this on its own brings up an earnest debate on the very real possibility that there might be many avenues left to explore other than the conventional route. One such road leads us to the inspiring world of homeopathic medicine. Have more questions? We have the answers! Read on below to discover the benefits and drawbacks of the different medical systems. What is Allopathic medicine? Allopathic medicine is the term used to describe traditional/ conventional/ modern Western medicine. It is a system in which doctors and healthcare professionals use a combination of drugs, radiation, and even surgery to treat illnesses and infections. Allopathic medicine is thought of as an evidence-based system in how doctors assess symptoms and use diagnostic tests to decide on and prescribe a treatment plan. And while the allopathic system of medicine is largely accepted; the side effects and risks associated with the medications and treatments prescribed, along with any unexpected allergic reactions or interactions that may occur, give many a cause for concern. What is Homeopathic medicine? Homeopathic medicine or homeopathy is a centuries-old alternative medical system that is based around the ability of the body to heal itself. Homeopathy works on two main principles: - Like cures like- A substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person, can also (in very small doses) be used to treat an illness with similar symptoms. For example, the red onion commonly causes teary eyes. In homeopathy, it is used in the treatment of allergies and hay fever. - The more diluted the substance, the greater its potency- This is why many homeopathic remedies contain substances that have been diluted several times, until there is almost none of the original substance left. Homeopathic doctors take into consideration your physical, mental, and emotional health before prescribing remedies and tailoring a treatment plan for you. And though thought of as unconventional, homeopathic remedies are generally safe and well tolerated. They may be used to treat a wide variety of illnesses including: - Allergies - Migraines - Depression - PMS - IBS - Chronis fatigue - Rheumatoid arthritis With a basic understanding of the differences between allopathic and homeopathic medicine, it is also interesting to further explore the two in relation to their use and efficacy in treating heart disease. What causes heart disease? Heart disease is a type of cardiovascular disease that affects the heart or blood vessels. It is a devastating disease that has no cure, and could affect you in the form of conditions such as heart attacks, heart failures, arrhythmias, strokes, and valve disease, just to name a few. While a single cause for heart disease cannot be pinpointed, there are several factors that put you at risk for developing it. These include: - High blood pressure - High cholesterol levels - Diabetes - Obesity - Smoking - Lack of physical activity - Unhealthy diet - Family history of cardiac disease Therefore, an ideal treatment plan for heart disease should include measures that help reduce or eliminate the associated risk factors. Allopathic medicine for heart disease The extensive research and rigorous testing have paid dividends in terms of providing many options of allopathic medications for patients of heart disease. These include: - Blood thinners - Statins - Beta blockers - Nitrates - ACE inhibitors - Calcium channel blockers And so many more. These work on multiple levels such as lowering cholesterol levels, lowering blood pressure, and preventing the occurrence of blood clots. And though effective, their side effects and interactions must be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis. Due to the range and variety of drugs available, doctors are usually able to find an ideal combination of medications that works best for you. However, these medications are only one part of the treatment. Lifestyle changes are equally crucial in creating an effective treatment plan. Homeopathy for heart disease Homeopathy too, offers an incredible array of medicines and remedies that treat a multitude of cardiac diseases and their underlying causes such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels. Some of the common homeopathic medicines used for the treatment of heart disease include: - Aconitum Napellus - Arnica Montana - Digitalis Purpurae All homeopathic medications are derived from natural sources. However, their preparation and dosage are very specific; and therefore, must be ingested only as advised and prescribed by a licensed practitioner. Homeopathy and Ayurveda Contrary to popular belief, homeopathy is not the same as Ayurvedic medicine. However, like Ayurveda, homeopathy has a holistic approach to healing. This becomes particularly important in the treatment of heart disease which requires considerable lifestyle changes to ensure overall health and wellbeing. As a result, combining Ayurvedic practices with homeopathic remedies may be the perfect route to a healthier heart. Since diet, physical activity, and stress are some of the biggest factors to affect heart health, using Ayurveda allows you to treat your heart, while preventing further complications. Some of the best ways to use Ayurveda to heal your heart is by: - Following an Ayurvedic diet - A nutrient-packed, wholesome, and heart-healthy diet which incorporates spices such as turmeric, fennel, and cumin, and healthy fats such as olive oil, can have a significant (and positive) impact on your heart health. - Exercising - Exercise improves circulation, lowers high blood pressure and stress levels, while increasing aerobic function and arterial elasticity. All this simply means, it is great for your heart. It need not be strenuous either. Walking and even yoga have proven to be some of the best ways to combat a sedentary lifestyle while promoting a healthy heart. - Relieving stress - Ayurveda understands the importance of looking after the heart as a physical organ as well as an emotional centre. This is why it recommends incorporating stress-relieving practices as part of the overall therapy for a healthier heart. These include: - Meditation - Pranayama - Aromatherapy - Massages Conclusion Cardiac disease is no laughing matter. It comes with serious symptoms and outcomes, and as such, requires serious and urgent attention. And while the debate between allopathic and homeopathic remedies for heart disease remains as heated as ever, with each having specific advantages and disadvantages; one thing becomes crystal clear. Either medical system works best when integrated with Ayurvedic practices and an Ayurvedic lifestyle. Why? Because Ayurveda treats cardiac issues effectively and lastingly. This too, with simple measures that make a significant impact on your heart, health, and lifestyle.
