Yet, despite national and local mandates, key sectors of the population continue to demonstrate lower compliance rates. In the United States, young adults have the lowest vaccination rates among the adult population. The goal of our study was to utilize the largest state-health survey to assess the key determinants of such hesitancy in order to create targeted interventions for the most at-risk groups to ensure equitable outcomes in disease prevention. We utilized the latest available California Health Interview Survey, a population-based complex probability survey, to evaluate determinants of vaccine hesitancy among young adults. Survey-weighted descriptive statistics, bivariate statistics, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. All statistical tests used p less than 0.05 to determine statistical significance. A total of 1203 respondents, representative of 4,027,462 young adults (ages 18-25 years) were included in our study. Our primary findings note that 24% of participants reported they would not be willing to take the COVID-19 vaccination. Prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was also significantly higher among young adults who were current smokers (including electronic cigarettes), when compared to non-current smokers (36% vs. 22%). Further, the highest prevalence was also noted among young adults who identified as African-American (51%), had a high school degree or less (34%), those who were overweight or obese (28%), and reported a poor health status (22%). Multivariable regression analysis demonstrated that current smokers, as compared to non-current smokers, had more than double the odds of reporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. African-American young adults or young adults with a high school degree or less were both independently associated with at least a three-fold increase in vaccine hesitancy. Participants with psychological distress, however, were more likely to be accepting of the vaccine. Public health efforts to improve vaccine compliance need targeted efforts, including building trust in the healthcare system for African-Americans and promoting easier access and knowledge of vaccines among those with a high school degree or less, as well as young-adults who are currently smoking, with such efforts targeting behavioral interventions focused on risk aversion.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-05-12", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Behavioral Risk Takers [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050767](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10050767) [COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance and Uptake: Yet, vaccines can serve as one of the most efficient preventive measures to mitigate the burden of the rising incidence of an infectious disease. Current vaccines are known to prevent over 20 diseases with life-threatening prognosis [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-00767)], and even more so during the current pandemic. [3](#B3-vaccines-10-00767)]. Further, the United States continues to experience a disproportionately high burden of COVID-19, with over 80 million total cases and 959,412 deaths to date [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-00767)]. On the other hand, vaccine hesitancy, which has seen a rise in recent years, can posit a significant barrier to effective disease management [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-00767), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-00767)]. Such vaccine hesitancy also has substantial ethical concerns, as it increases exposure to the most vulnerable populations and further increases health disparities by lowering possibility of herd immunity [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-00767)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-10-00767)], vaccine hesitancy led to an emergence of cases, with 555 cases reported across 20 states between the first four months of 2019 [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-00767)], with a similar pattern of vaccine hesitancy emerging for COVID-19 prevention as well. Likewise, Soares et al. [ [10](#B10-vaccines-10-00767)] noted that in Portugal, factors such as being younger, lack of income resulting from the pandemic, hesitancy to take the flu vaccine, as well as confidence in health services, government, as well as trust in the COVID-19 vaccine were related to hesitancy. Wang and group [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-00767)] also found that in China, factors such as being male, married, having a high risk perception of infection, having former history of vaccination, as well as confidence in the vaccination or healthcare provider were associated with increased acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. In a study from the United Kingdom and Ireland, low vaccine acceptance was found among those who were prone to seeking health information from non-traditional or non-authoritative sources and distrusted such sources [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-00767)]. In the United States, vaccine hesitancy has also been associated with perceived severity of COVID-19, as well as being of minority status [ [13](#B13-vaccines-10-00767)]. While such studies provide a plethora of demographic and psychological factors associated with vaccine hesitancy, none have addressed social determinants of vaccine hesitancy, especially among young adults, who continue to have lower rates of compliance. For instance, in the United States, vaccination rates among young adults (aged 18-24 years) remain the lowest (61.5%), compared to all other adult age groups in the nation [ [14](#B14-vaccines-10-00767)], and thus understanding the key groups within the population at most risk of being non-compliant is key to creating targeted public health campaigns. In our study, we particularly aimed to assess if young adults with risk taking behavior are more likely to be hesitant to vaccine compliance. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Population [15](#B15-vaccines-10-00767)]. 2.2. Measures 2.3. Data Analysis 2.4. Ethical Compliance 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-10-00767-t001), our study population had a nearly similar distribution of males (49%) and females (51%). Furthermore, 35% of our study population were Latino, 41% reported living below 200% FPL, 34% had some college (including vocational, associates), 82% remained insured all past 12 months, 42% were overweight or obese, 29% reported serious psychological distress, and 15% reported having COVID or COVID-like symptoms. A small fraction also reported fair/poor general health status (9%), illicit drug use (3%), and being a current smoker (8%). Further, 24% reported they would not be willing to take the COVID-19 vaccination. [Table 2](#vaccines-10-00767-t002)shows the results of chi-square analyses to highlight associations between study population characteristics and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy was significantly higher among current smokers (36%) than non-current smokers (22%). In addition, significant associations were found with race/ethnicity, with the highest prevalence of vaccine hesitancy noted among African-Americans (51%), followed by those who were identified as other (29%), Latinos (24%), whites (20%), and finally Asian-Americans (10%). Prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was also significantly higher among those with a high school degree or less (34%), as compared to those with some college/vocational/associates (19%), and a Bachelor's degree or higher (13%). Respondents who were overweight or obese also had a significantly higher rate of reporting vaccine hesitancy, compared to their counterparts (28% vs. 21%), with a similar trend noted among those who reported fair/poor health status (34%), as compared to those with excellent/very good/good health status (22%). [Table 3](#vaccines-10-00767-t003). After adjusting for control variables, current smokers, when compared to non-current smokers, reported more than double the odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Further, African-Americans were over three and a half fold more likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, when compared to whites, whereas Asians were 48% less likely to report such hesitancy. Likewise, having a high school degree or less was associated with an over three-fold likelihood of being vaccine hesitant, when compared to those with a Bachelor's degree or higher. On the other hand, those with psychological distress were 36% less likely to report such hesitancy. We further conducted such analyses in additional age groups (data not shown), with results highlighting that vaccine hesitancy and tobacco use remained significant for young adults only. 4. Discussion [16](#B16-vaccines-10-00767)]. Likewise, assessment among college students in Canada found that lacking advice from medical professionals and concerns over the speed of vaccine development, safety, and efficiency were part of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the population [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-00767)]. Despite being from different nations with different political, economic, and public health systems, results from both China and Canada note that concerns over safety and side effects were common. As such, despite cultural differences, it appears that vaccine hesitancy may stem from limited knowledge on the development process and direct communication in an easy to understand language that avoids medical jargon are needed to ensure higher acceptance. Such studies provide insight into the individual level factors associated with vaccination but are often limited to college students as a proxy for young adults. In our study, we expanded that by including young adults, independent of college attendance, and thus provide a more generalizable assessment of vaccine hesitancy in the age group, and in turn identifying putative factors associated with lower likelihood of compliance for COVID-19 vaccine mandates. In particular, we found a significant association between being a current smoker and showing vaccine hesitancy, both of which are related to behavioral decision making. [18](#B18-vaccines-10-00767)]. This similar pattern of risk taking is also noted among smokers, where studies highlight that smokers are likely to be more insensitive to risks [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-00767)]. As such, it remains plausible the association between being a current smoker and being hesitant to the COVID-19 vaccine is rooted in the foundation of becoming complacent or insensitive to risks. Thus, to lower the vaccine hesitancy, especially among current smokers who are more prone to respiratory illnesses, health intervention efforts that promote vaccine acceptance and address risk-taking behaviors by promoting aversion instead, may be more effective than vaccine mandates alone. [20](#B20-vaccines-10-00767)], exemplifying the importance of targeted educational interventions. We draw the analogy that similar educational opportunities through colleges, universities, and places of work for young adult smokers on vaccine efficacy may help lower the rates of hesitancy. This remains especially needed due to the emergence of nicotine vaccination trials [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-00767)], and thus to lower the burden of tobacco-related disease, promoting vaccine compliance among tobacco users would be a critical next step for future nicotine vaccine acceptance as well. [22](#B22-vaccines-10-00767), [23](#B23-vaccines-10-00767)]. Among young adults, peer norms have been also shown to influence vaccine acceptancy versus hesitancy [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-00767)], and thus targeted measures that promote vaccination led by peers may provide a scope for improving compliance in the young adult population. [25](#B25-vaccines-10-00767)] that targeted Black men has often been a consistent reminder of the lack of public confidence in the public health system. Further, an assessment conducted by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and partners noted that trust in vaccine safety was only prevalent among 14% of Blacks surveyed and often historical cases are a factor, but so are everyday experiences of discrimination that the community faces [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-00767)]. Thus, community-based efforts, such as faith-based initiatives [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-00767), [28](#B28-vaccines-10-00767)], may provide opportunities to promote trust in public health efforts on vaccination mandates among the historically underserved population. Likewise, those with a lower education status also had higher vaccine hesitancy in our study, further demonstrating the need to educational initiatives that go beyond college campuses and integrate community outreach activities. [29](#B29-vaccines-10-00767)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-10-00767), [31](#B31-vaccines-10-00767)]. Further, while the literature on vaccine hesitancy and acceptance has highlighted several individual level factors, to our knowledge, our study is the first to identify an at-risk group of vaccine hesitancy related to another risk-taking behavior: smoking. As such, given that despite California being in the forefront of tobacco control policies [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-00767)], tobacco use among young adults remains prevalent. As indicated by our results, such smokers may be at most risk of remaining vaccine non-compliant. Therefore, we propose that mandates alone may not increase vaccine compliance and there is an imperative need for public health campaigns that target health behavior change at the community level. While a systematic review on measures to address vaccine hesitancy noted that most interventions addressed knowledge and awareness [ [33](#B33-vaccines-10-00767)], our study further highlights that health behavior interventions to promote risk aversion, peer-based initiatives, building community trust (especially among those historically mis-treated by the healthcare system), along with knowledge and awareness campaigns may provide the multi-component strategy needed to improve vaccine acceptance among young adults.
