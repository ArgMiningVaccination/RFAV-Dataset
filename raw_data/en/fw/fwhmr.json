Mayo Clinic Minute: What is integrative health and how can it help? When you're sick, medication or even surgery may be just what the doctor orders. Dr. Adam Perlman, an integrative health specialist at Mayo Clinic, asks an additional question. \"What else can we do to really improve our sense of well-being?\" That's where acupuncture, yoga or tai chi may be integrated into an overall plan of care. Dr. Perlman describes it as \"really helping people to go beyond the treatment of disease and pathophysiology, to really a place where they are optimizing their vitality.\" Evidence shows, for instance, that acupuncture can help with chronic pain and may be recommended to those with cancer, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. Tai chi helps with balance and reduces falls in older adults. Yoga may help reduce stress, lower blood pressure and lower your heart rate. But, Dr. Perlman says, it's not just what you do with your body that's important. \"Other things that tend to impact our health and well-being are things like gratitude and relationships.\" For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Vivien Williams.

Massage therapy Massage therapy for people in the hospital Massage therapy may be used to help you feel better as you undergo treatment for an injury or condition. Massage therapy may be offered on an outpatient basis or to people who are admitted to the hospital. Mayo researchers have found that this integrative medicine practice can reduce pain, anxiety and tension in people facing or recovering heart surgery, breast cancer, colon surgery and other procedures. Mayo Clinic massage therapists provide massage therapy to thousands of people each year. Mayo Clinic's massage therapists have sought additional training in techniques such as acupressure, reflexology, mobilization of scar tissue and craniosacral therapy. A board-certified massage therapist works with you and uses techniques based on your needs and goals. The massage therapist may offer other suggestions as well, such as aromatherapy or relaxation resources. Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the world's oldest recognized medical therapies. It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine and embraced by many people, including those who practice conventional medicine, as a safe and effective treatment for many conditions. You are treated by a doctor trained in acupuncture or a licensed acupuncture practitioner supervised by a doctor. Mayo Clinic acupuncture specialists perform more than 1,400 acupuncture treatments each year. Techniques include acupuncture with manual and electrical stimulation, acupressure, and cupping. Treatments are tailored to your needs, concerns and diagnosis. Mayo Clinic treatment rooms dedicated to acupuncture have soft music and gentle lighting to help you relax while your practitioner places the needles. A typical acupuncture visit is 45 to 60 minutes. Mind-body therapies Meditation Meditation can help promote physical, mental and spiritual wellness. There are many mind-body therapies, such as meditation, paced breathing, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation and biofeedback. These therapies are used to relax and rejuvenate the mind, body and spirit. Many people find that mind-body therapies help them refocus and gain inner peace. Botanicals and supplements consultation Botanicals and supplements are marketed and taken like medications but regulated like foods. They can interact with medications and each other, resulting in side effects or suboptimal treatment. During a botanicals and supplements consultation, you talk with a pharmacist who is an expert on these popular products and learn about how their potential risks and side effects might affect your health and well-being. Yoga Yoga is one of several approaches that enhance the mind-body connection. Contact Arizona Florida Minnesota "}
