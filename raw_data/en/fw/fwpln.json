In 1994, the Pacific Islands Science Center (PISC) wa s established with the creation of the National Biological Survey (NBS). On October 1, 1996, NBS was transferred by Congress to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as th e Biological Resources Division. As part of the reorganization, PISC was renamed the Pacific Isla nd Ecosystems Research Center (PIERC) to reflect the Center's increasing emphasis on ecosystem science. The primary responsibility of PIERC is to assi st resource managers in the Pacific region by providing them with sound biologi cal information and with assist ance in applying the information to their needs. The mandated field of operations for PIERC includes the Hawaiian archipelago plus current U.S. holdings and former Trust Territories in Polynesia and Micronesia. This is an area spanning six time zones, from 30 degrees North to 15 degrees South of the equator, and from 155 degrees East to 130 degrees West ac ross the International Date Line. The mission of PIERC is to work with others to provide scientific understanding and technologies needed to support and im plement sound management and conservation of our Nation's biological resources occurring within cultural, sociological and political contex ts of the State of Hawai'i and other locations in the Pacific Basi n affiliated with the United States . PIERC fulfills this mission by 1) investigating biological reso urce issues faced by Federal and St ate land managers and providing meaningful information important for management purposes; 2) pr oviding scientific information necessary to effectively intercede in the decline of native biodiv ersity in this region; and 3) providing the best possible inform ation concerning the nature, stru cture, condition, evolution, and importance of the biodiversit y of the Pacific region. We offer this Annotated Bibliography as an intro duction to our research fo r all those who share our quest for understanding a nd interest in preserving and restoring native ecosystems in Hawaii and other Pacific islands. Within ea ch section, works are sorted by year and then author. Hawaiian words have been spelled as they were in the orig inal work, and variants pr ovided in square brackets to enhance searchability. A brief summary of each peer-reviewed work has been provided wherever possible.

Determining age and sex of 'Oma'o were de veloped on the basis of 66 museum specimens and 149 live 'Oma'o captured in mist nets on the island of Hawai'i. Our results indicate that 'Oma'o can be separated into three age classes (i.e., hatching ye ar , second year, and adult) on the basis of plum age, but that adult 'Oma'o cannot be reliably sexed by plumage or body measurements.

['Akiap l'au] Methods for identifying the age of the Akiapolaau ( Hemignathus munroi ), an endangered honeycreeper found only on the island of Hawaii, were developed by examina tion and measurement of 73 museum specimens and 24 live birds captured in mist nets. Little geographic differentiat ion was observed among four si tes that spanned 2100 m in elevation and included extremely wet lowland rainforest, montane mesic fo rest, and subalpin e xeric woodland.

Wilson Bulletin, 106: populations of ccineus coccineus) and Hawaii Creeper (Oreomystis mana) at four sites on the island of Ha waii. Both species appears to defend Type-B territories typical of cardueline finches, retained mates for more than one year, and showed strong philopatry. Home ranges for Hawaii Creepers were larger than those for Akepa; no difference was found between home rang sizes of male and females for either species. Ralph, C.J. & S.G. Fancy (1994). De mography and movements of the timing of breeding and molti ng, and movements of the Omao or Hawaiian Thrush were studied at four sites on the island of Hawaii. Omao showed strong site fidelity and were highly sedentary. Mean home range size did not differ be tween sexes or study sites. Ralph, C.J. & S.G. Fancy (1994). Timing of breeding and molting in six species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. The Condor , 96: 151-161. The timing of breeding and molting was studied in six specie s of Hawaiian honeycreepers with differing food habits on the Island of Hawaii. All six species of honeycreeper ha d extended breeding and molting periods with peak breeding between April and July and peak molt ing in August. Although overlap of breeding and molting was rare, some individuals may have been able to allo cate energy resources to both activities because of low clutch size, extended brooding of young, and a low rate of molting. 2 Lindsey, G.D., K.A. Wilson, & C.M. Herrmann (1995). Color change in Hughes's celluloid leg bands. Journal of Field Ornithology , 66: 289-295. Color change was recorded in 10 colors for 237 Hughes celluloid bands attached to the tarsi of 84 birds for up to 5 yr and for 45 celluloid bands exposed to na tural sunlight on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. For long-term studies, biologists should select only those colors that can be rec ognized for the duration of the study or use another type of color and that is more resistant to fading or discoloration.

Presently, the palila occupies <5% of its and is confined to mamane above 1950 m elevation on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In 1987, we began a study of palila demography, and here report on the age and sex structure, and annual survival of the only remaining palila population. Ralph, C.J. & S.G. Fancy (1995). Demography an d movements of Apapane and Iiwi Density, annual survival, and movements of two species of Hawaiian ho neycreepers, were studied at four sites on the island of Hawaii. Highest densities of both species occurred during the breeding seas on and were highly correlated with flowering by Metrosideros . Widespread movements of Apapane and Iiwi in re sponse to the seasonal and patchy availability of Metrosideros nectar have important implications for disease transmission since Apapane are the primary carrier of avian malaria in Hawaii, and Iiwi appear to be highly susceptible to mortality from malaria.

Description of adults, eggshells, nestling, fledgling, and honeycreeper discovered on the island of Maui in 1973 and now nearing extinction, is represented in museums by only two spec imens. Based on the first observations of a nesting p[air and re-examination of the two specimens, we describe the adult male and female, eggshells, nestling, and fledgling Poo-uli. Fancy, S.G., S.A. Sandin, M.H. Reynolds, & J.D. Jacobi (1996). Distribution and population status of the Hawaiian honeycreeper that is found only in high-elevation native forests on the island of Hawaii. We used a newl y developed analysis approach to estimate the population size for 'Akiap l'au based on surveys conducted during 1990-1995. We estimate that there are 1163 \u00b1 54 (90% CI) 'Akiapl'au in the world. The distribution has been greatly reduced in the Ka' District, where the estimated population has declined from 533 (ca. 1980) to 44 birds, and relic populations in m mane forest and South Kona are likely to become extinct within the next five years.

Weather is usually poor th roughout the year in the relictual range of the Poo-uli and is likely to impact nesting success. We suspect that factors such as decrea sing food availability, habitat disturbance by feral pigs, and 3 predation by non-native mammals may be more important to the Poo-uli's decline than vulnerability arising from the species' nesting behavior. Meyers, J.M., W.J. Arendt, & G.D. Lindsey (1996). Survival of radio-collared nestling Puerto Rican Parrots. Wilson Bulletin, 108: 159-163. A remnant population of the critically endangered Puerto Rican Parrot ( Amazona vittata ) survives in the Luquillo Mountains of northeastern Puerto Rico. Verifying that at least two of the radio-collared parrots were alive demonstrates that this type of radio attachment may have little influence on j uvenile survival. Another study of 15 parrots of four Amazona species in Puerto Rico resulted in no mortalit ies as a consequence of similarly design radio- collars that remained attached for up to 1.8 years.

Kawena Pukui, noted authority on Hawaiian language and culture. The Po'ouli is listed as an Endange red Species by both federal and state governments. The state of Hawaii manages the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve to protect the bird's habitat, and a recovery program is attempting to improve the future of the fewer than 10 surviving Po'ouli.

The Band-rumped Storm-Petrel ranges throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, breeding away form continental areas on remote islands including the Hawaiian Archipelago where it is a candidate for listing because of its small local population size. With twice the body mass of the Band-rumped Storm-Petrel, Tristram's Storm-Petrel is one of the largest of all the storm-petrels, sedentary, breeding only in the remote northwestern Hawaii an Islands and small islands off Japan. Because of the secretive habits of these species, and remoteness and/or inaccessibility of their breeding sites, estimates of populations are out of date and inaccurate, making their protection difficult.

Akiapolaau used koa ( Acacia koa ) for foraging much more than expected based on koa availability, and most Akiapolaau occurred in old-growth koa and koa and ohia forests above the mosquito zone are critical to the survival of the species. Ainley, D.G., T.C. townsendi P. The Birds of North America , No. 297 (A. Poole & F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. The Townsend's Shearwater is confined to the Revillagigedo Islands off the western coast of Mexico, where its small population is jeopardized. Also threatened, the related Ne well's Shearwater, once widespread in the main Hawaiian Islands, has been reduced to a few remnant breeding coloni es. Habitat loss due for agriculture and development, urbanization, and predation from introduced mammals are signi ficant factors responsible for decreasing populations in these birds. Fancy, S.G. & C.J. Ralph (1997). 'Apapane (Himatione sanguinea). The Birds of North America , No. 296 (A. Poole & F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. [Apapane] The 'Apapane is the most abundant sp ecies of Hawaiian honeycreeper and is perhaps best known for its wideranging flights in search of localized blooms of 'hi'a ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) flowers, its primary food source. 'Apapane are common in mesic and wet forests above 1000 m elevation on the islands of Hawai'i, Maui, and Kaua'i, locally common at higher elevations on O'ahu; and rare or absent on L na'i and Moloka'i. Despite their seasonal high 4 densities and widespread distribution in higher-elevation forest s, no aspect of 'Apapane life history or biology has been well-studied. Fancy, S.G. & C.J. Ralph (1997).

[Iiwi; I'iwi] The 'I'iwi is one of the most spectacular of extant Hawaiian birds, with vermillion plumag e, black wings and tail, and long, decurved bill. 'I'iwi are common in mesic and wet forests above 1500 m elevation on the islands of Hawai'i, Maui, and Kaua'i, but their populations consist of less th an 50 birds on the lower-elevation islands of O'ahu and Moloka'i, and they are now extinct on L na'i. Habitat loss and modification becau se of development and agriculture, and introduction of disease vectors, avia n disease, mammalian predators, and alien plants all continue to threaten 'I'iwi populations, as well as those of other native Hawaiian birds. Fancy, S.G. (1997). A new approach for analyzing bird densities from variable circular-plot counts. Pacific Science , 51: 107-114. An approach for calculating bird densities from variable circ ular-plot counts is described. The approach differs from previous methods in that data from several surveys are pooled and detection distances are adjusted as if all distances were recorded by a single observer under a given set of fiel d conditions. Computer softwa re for entering and analyzing data by this method is described. Fancy, S.G., T.J. Snetsinger, & J.D. Jacobi (1 997). Translocation of the Biology , 4: 39-46. The Palila Loxioides bailleui is an endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper th at is restricted to high-elevation dry woodlands on Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii. The Palila's habitat is regenerating as a result of feral ungulate control, but the species is likely to be slow in recolonizing former range s because of strong site tenaci ty. Translocations of adult birds and release of captive-reared juvenile Palila, in co mbination with additional habitat restoration, may be an effective management tool for speeding the recovery of this species.

El Nino-Southern Oscillation vents (ENS O) are known to affect reproduction and su rvival of various bird species and other animals. Here, we report a short-term effect of the 1992-1992 ENSO drought on captu re rates, fat scores, and active nests of six resident Ha waiian forest bird species. Reynolds, M.H. & G.L.

Poole & F. Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. The Maui Parrotbill is an endangered Hawaiian honeycreeper that was first collected in 1892. No Hawaiian name for the species survives. The Maui Parrotbi ll was thought to be extinct until redisc overy in 1950. Currently restricted to the remote high-elevation rain forests of eastern Maui, fossil evidence indicates that this species may have occurred in all forest types, from arid woodl and at sea level to wet montane ra in forest at high elevation. Woodworth, B.L. (1997). Brood parasitism, nest predation, and season-long reproductive success of a tropical island endemic. The Condor, 99: 605-621. To determine the impact of the exotic Shiny Cowbird ( Molothrus latimeri ) reproductive success, I studied the demography of ma rked vireos in Gu\u00e1nica Forest, PR, in 1990-1993. The combination of restricted breeding season, high predati on and parasitism rates, large impact of parasitism on reproductive output, and low seasonal fecund ity of females suggests that, despite hi gh survival rates, the Puerto Rican Vireo is in danger of extirpation from portions of its range.

Known in the cage bird trade as the Japanese Hill-Robi n, Peking Robin, or Peking Nightingale, the Red-billed Leiothrix was first imported into the Hawaiian Islands in 1911 , with intentional releases to the w ild occurring after 1918. The Red-billed Leiothrix is found in a wide variety of habitats in the Hawaiian Islands, including both native and exotic forests from sea level to near mountain summits exce eding 4000 m in elevation. Leiothrix populations have fluctuated widely on different islands. Nelson, J.T. & A. Vitz The Japanese Bush-warbler is common on O'ahu, Lanai, Moloka'i, and Maui, and has been recently recorded on Kaua'i and Kaho'olawe, but has never been reported for the island of Hawa i'i. On 9 June 1997, we heard a loud song that we recognized a that of the Japanese Bush-warbler at Pu'u Wa'awa'a Wildlife Sa ntuary on the north slope of Hualalai Volcano, island of Hawai'i. The acoustic identification was confirmed visually. Simon, J.C. (1998). Nest re location using PVC spotters. Journal of Field Ornithology , 69: 644-646.

The ' kohekohe inhabits perpetually misty, high-elevation rain forest on the island of Maui in the Hawaiian Archipelago. The greatest threats to the ' kohekohe are a result of human activity, primarily deforestation and introductions of exotic species, which led to degradation of remaining native forests by feral ungulates, and introduced avian blood-borne disease and predation risks pr eviously unknown to Hawaiian forest birds. Fancy, S.G., M.R. Lusk, & D.J. Grout (1999). Status of the Mariana Crow population on Rota, Mariana Islands. Micronesica , 32: 3-10. We conducted a of the Crow ( Corvus kubaryi ) population on Rota, CNMI, in October- November 1995 to provide current information on numbers and distribution of this species. The apparent 56% decrease in population size may be a re sult of habitat loss from development a nd typhoons, as well as persecution, but other factors contributing to the decline cannot be identifie d until more is known about the ecology and demography of the Mariana Crow population.

Variable circular-plot (VCP) counts ar e statistically more sound than point counts because they are adjusted for the probability of detecting birds at differe nt distances and under different conditions . We conducted the first field test of the VCP method where the exact density of a forest bi rd was known as part of re-establishing the 'Oma'o Myadestes obscurus in former range. Excluding the first census, when three of the four detections were of the same individual, differences in VCP density estimates ranges from -34% to +24% even though 18 'Oma'o were detected per survey. 7 Woodworth, B.L. (1999). Mode ling population dynamics of a songbi rd exposed to parasitism and predation and evaluating alternative management options. Conservation Biology, 13: 67-76. I demonstrate the use of a two-step mo deling approach to determine the implica tions of parasitism and nest predation for the population dynamics of songbird populations and to quantitatively eval uate alternative options for their management. This modeling approach can be used to determine the reproductive health of a population over a range of parasitism and predation values, to test alternative hypotheses for the cause of an observed population decline, and to make a priori predictions about the out comes of specific management actions.

The Hawaiian Islands, with their unique geological histor y and geographic position, provide an excellent natural laboratory in which to evaluate currently competing biologica l (BSC) and phylogenetic (PSC) concepts of the species. A review of the taxonomic history and species limits in Hawa iian birds under both concepts reveals that BSC yields a species total remarkably close to that produced under th e PSC.

Bioacoustics / Sensory Systems Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles Helweg, D.A., H.L. three-dimensional aspect-dependent objects by an echolocating bottlenosed dolphin. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes , 22: 19-31. We examined the ability of a bottlenos e dolphin to recognize aspect-depe ndent objects using echolocation and compared the dolphin's recognition performance with ec ho identification using statistical and neural network classifiers. The results show that dolphins can uses varying acoustic propert ies to recognize c onstant objects and suggest that aspect-independent repr esentations may be formed by combin ing information gleaned form multiple echoes. Helweg, D.A., W.W.L. Au, H.L. Roitblat, & P.E. N achtigall (1996). Acoustic basis of recognition of aspect-dependent objects by an echolocating bottlenosed dolphin. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America , 99(4): 2409-2420. The relationships between acoustic features of object echoe s and the cognitive representations of the object formed by an echolocating dolphin will influence the ease with whic h the dolphin can recognize th e object. A blindfolded bottlenose dolphin learned to match aspect-dependent 3-D obje cts at haphazard orientations . The results suggest that the dolphin recognized the objects using a multidimensional representation and that dolphins can form stable representations of objects regardless of orientation. Helweg, D.A., D.H. Cato, P.F. Jenkins, C. Garrigue , & R. Macauley (1998). Geographic variation in South Pacific humpback whale songs. Behaviour, 135: 1-27. Every winter, (male) humpback whales produce long, complex songs. We comp ared songs recorded in winter migratory termini in Tonga, New Caledonia, Eastern Australi a, and on migration paths off Eastern Australia and New Zealand, in the winter of 1994. The re sults suggest some migratory exchange among widely se parate wintering regions of Area V, consistent with tag re covery data, but the time and location at which song sharing occurs remains speculative. 19 Houser, D.S., D.A. Helweg, & P.W. Moore (1999). Classification of dolphin echolocation clicks by energy and frequency distributions. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America , 106(3): 1579-1585. Dolphins demonstrate an adaptive control over echolocati on click production, but little is known of the manner or degree with which control is exercise. Seven click types were identified from a sample of echolocation clicks (N ~ 30,000) collected from a bottlenose dolphin performing object discrimination tasks. Differences in animal and task performance may influence click type and click train length. Au, W.W.L., A.S. Frankel, D.A. Helweg, & D.H. Cato (2001). Against the humpback whale sonar hypothesis. IEEE Journal of Ocean Engineering , 26(2): 295-300. A rebuttal to an article of Frazer and Mercado, who presen ted a sonar model for humpback whale song, is presented. This rebuttal considers the noise-limited form of the sonar equation, current understanding of humpback whale behavior, and the characteristics of hum pback whale songs, along with arguments fr om an evolutionary perspective. Arguments from all of these different aspects do not support the model of Frazer and Mercado. Findrarakoto, Y., H.C. Rosenbaum, & D.A. Helweg (2001). First description of humpback whale song from Antongil Bay, Madagascar. Marine Mammal Science , 17(1): 180-185. Recordings of whale song on humpback whale wintering grounds have been used to characterize geographical differences among populations. To our knowledge, this study represents the first song ev er recorded and described from Antongil Bay, located in northeastern Madagascar, with the first analysis of song structure form the tropical wintering grounds of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Houser, D.S., D.A. & P.W.B. model of the Mammals , sound could nega tively impact whal e species continue to escalate. Unfortunately, the auditory sensitivity of mysticete wh ales is unknown, impeding assessment of underwater sound exposure on these animals. In this study, through an approach integratin g biology, engineering, and computer modeling, the first predicted humpback whale audiogram was made and used to develop the first bandpass model of the humpback ear. Houser, D.S., D.A. Chellapilla, & Moore (2001). Optim evolutionary computation. Bioacoustics, 12: 57-78. Object classifiers that attempt to mimic dolphin echolocation require an auditory weighting function representative of dolphin peripheral auditory processing. An evolutionary program was used to fi t the frequency dependent output of a bank of bandpass filters to the auditory sensitivity of the bottlenose dolphin. This model will be applied to further investigate how dolphins use echoloca tion to discriminate among objects. Campbell, G.S., R.C. Gisiner, D.A. Helweg, & L.L.

Our objective was to develop a robust neural network to classify females based on their mother-pup contact calls. Acoustical identification of distinctive female acoustic si gnatures has several potentially important conservation applications for this endangered species, such as rapid survey of females present on a rookery. Dankiewicz, L.A., D.A. Helweg, modulated synthetic echo trains by an echolocating bottlenose dolphin. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 112(4), 1702-1708. Bottlenose dolphins have an acute ability to use object echoes to judge attributes such as size, shape, and material composition. The current study examined whether dolphins c ould discriminate synthetic echo trains with different AM envelopes. The results support multiple-echo processing in bottlenose dolphin echolocation, and provide additional theoretical justification for exploring synthetic aperture sonar concepts in models of animal echolocation. 20 Helweg, D.A., J.L. Rodgers, & W.L. Teeter (2002). Historical and contemporary covariation of ambient noise and baleen whale calls in Southern California waters. U.S. Navy Journal of Underwater Acoustics, 52(3), 595-607. Many species of baleen whales reside or migrate annually through California wate rs. During these times some species of vocalizing whales can be detected by hydrophone and iden tified by stereotypical species-s pecific calls.

Journal the Acoustical The dolphin, however, often uses many pulses to interrogate a targ et, and could use multipulse processing to combine the resulting echoes. An experiment to test multiecho processi ng in a dolphin measured detection of a stationary target when the number N of available target echoes was increased, us ing synthetic echoes. A rece iver that sums binary-quantized data samples from multiple echoes closely models the N dependence of the SNR required by the dolphin. Helweg, D.A., J.M. Zafra n, & R.L. Brill (2003). Discrimination of complex synthetic echoes by an echolocating bottlenose dolphin. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America , 113(2): 1138-1144. Bottlenose dolphins detect and discriminate underwater object s by interrogating the environment with their native echolocation capabilities. This study used synthetic echoes with complex hi ghlight structures to test whether high- amplitude initial highlights would interfere with discrimin ation of low-amplitude trailing highlights. The results suggest that the animal processed multiple echo highlights as separable analyzable features in the discrimination task, perhaps perceived through differences in spectr al rippling across the duration of the echoes.

The path of Hurricane Andrew by chance touched on the core of a complex mosaic of terrestrial vegetation comprised of an assemblage of plant species markedly different from th at found anywhere else in the continental United States. It is difficult to predict how th e opening of the canopy will affect animals a nd understory plants. Humans have increased the potential for chance extinctions of rare taxa. Snetsinger, T.J., S.G.

Diets of owls and feral alba ) from Hawaiian islands were examined to determine the incidence of rodent, bird, and insect remains in the diets of these predators. Rodents were the main prey, but the incidence of bird remains in diets of all three predators was high relative to studies conducted elsewhere in the world. 24 Stone, C.P. (1995). Toward ethical treatmen t of animals in ecosystems in Hawaii. Pacific Science , 49: 98-108. Human alienation from nature is evidenced by minimal understand ing of interrelationships in the wild and an emphasis on individual wild animals. Decisions about nature should consider a complex of human values including the economic, aesthetic, spiritual, ecological, and humane, along with a preservation ethic for the future. We need to \"outgrow\" narrow views of nature by better understanding huma n relationships to it through meaningful participation (hunting, management, scientif ic study, observation, etc.).

Medeiros, A. Durso, & L. Loope (20 00). Ranchers and biologists in Hawaii - keeping a business strong and protecting native for ests at Ulupalakua Ranch, Maui. Rangelands , October 2000: 33-35. The loss of ranchland to critical habitat has been a major concern to ranchers and other large landowners in recent years. On the island of Maui, a novel approach is in th e works which seems to have merit both for conservation of endangered species and for helping a landowner et hically manage an ecologically sensitive area.

Introduced rats ( Rattus spp. ) are damaging to native birds, insects, and plants in isla nd ecosystems. We controlled rodent populations in a montane rainforest on the island of Hawaii to determine feasibility, cost, and effectiveness of ground-based rodent control in a rugged remo te rainforest habitat. Rodent cont rol applied continuously for 4 months each year during the [avian] breeding season may be effective in protecting nesting forest birds, but will not provide protection to plants and invertebrate vul nerable to predation throughout the year, and it is not likely to protect avian food resources.

Diurnal pattern s of behavior and group structure of humpback whales ( We examined the behavior of humpback whales in Hawaiian wa ters in relation to time of day using visual observations from shore platforms and acoustic observations using hydr ophones. As humpbacks are not observed to feed in Hawaiian waters, we assumed that the data were free from the in fluence of diel cycles of pr ey availability. The results suggest that the whales were resting in the dawn hours, behavi or related to mating begins shortly after sunrise, and that male-male competition peaked in the afternoon. 29 Ballard, W.B., L.A.

In Tanzania, where tourist hunting is employed as a conser vation tool for habitat protec tion, information on population sizes and hunting offtake was used to assess the impact of t ourist hunting on mammal densit ies. In general, tourist hunting pressure was unrelated to local population sizes, but for most species, anim als were removed at a level of less than 10% of local population size, sugges ting that over-exploitation was unlikely.

African Journal of Ecology, 36: 303-320. We examined the effects of protection from human activities and effects of tourist hunting on densities of 21 large mammal species in Tanzania. Our analyses suggest that prohibition of human activity, back up by on-site enforcement, maintains ungulate populations at relatively high densities, a nd challenge the idea that5 enforcement is only effective when spending is high.

DNA fingerprinting of twelve comple te families from the Pu'u La 'au population revealed no evidence of extrapair fertiliz ation or intraspecific brood parasitism. We c onclude that present levels of inbreeding are low within both populations, and that proposed translocation of individuals from Pu'u La'au to Kanakaleonui appear appropriate from a genetic E.L.

Application of a PCR-based approach to identify sex in Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidinae). Pacific Conservation Biology , 6: 14-17. The application of molecular techniques to conservation genetics issues can pr ovide important guidance criteria for management of endangered species. The results from th is study establish that PCR-based approaches for sex determination can be applied with a high de gree of confidence to at least four sp ecies of Hawaiian honeycreepers. This provides a rapid, reliable me thod with which population managers can op timize sex rations within populations of endangered species that are subj ect to artificial manipulation.

The avian family Aegothelidae (Owlet-nightjars) are secretive nocturnal birds of the South Pacific. They are relatively poorly studied and their confusing morpholog ical variation has made it difficult to cluster in to hierarchical taxonomic units.

Although multiple factors have likely influenced the fate of Hawaiian birds, the relatively recent introduction of avian malaria is thought to be a major fact or limiting honeycreeper di stribution and abundance.We have initia ted genetic analyses of class II chain Mhc genes in four species of honeycreepers using methods that eliminate the possib lity of sequencing variants. Phylogenetic analyses group the honeycreeper Mhc se quences into two distinct clusters. Variation within one cluster is high, th e second cluster is nearly invariant.

Twelve linear models for estimating fe ral pig population density were genera ted from data on feral pig sign and densities collected in 5 habitat types in Hawaii. The model for all fresh sign encompassed variability in all habitats sampled and gave the most precise predictions across habitats . None of the models was us eful at popula tion densities ( colchicus and ant avifauna in high-elevation shrubland of Haleakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii. We studied the food habits, ecological niche, and e ffects of these alien game birds on the native biota in this Hawaiian ecosystem. The role of these alien birds in facilitating seed dispersal and germination of native plant species is beneficial in restoring degraded ecosystems. Wetterer, J.K (1997). Ants on Cecropia One of the best-known ant-plant relationships of the Neotropics is the association between Cecropia trees and \"Cecropia ants\" that live inside the Cecropia's hollow trunks. Although neither Cecropia trees nor ants are native to the Hawaiian Islands, one Cecropia species ( C. obtusifolia ) and about forty ant speci es (none in the genus Azteca ) have been introduced through human activity. This study was c onducted to determine which an ts, if any, associate with C. obtusifolia trees in Hawaii, and to evaluate the nature of these an-plant associations. Krushelnycky, P.D. & N.J. Reimer (1998). Ba it preferences by the Argentine Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Haleakala National Park, Hawaii. Environmental Entomology, 27(6): 1482-1487. The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile , has proven to be a threat to native arthropod species in Haleakala National Park, Maui, HI, and is also a potential threat to the park's native flora. Maxforce was concluded to be the best bait carrier for toxicant-based control at Haleakala National park because of its attractiveness and its ease for large-scale broadcast dispersal. Krushelnycky, P.D. & N.J. Reimer (1998). Efficacy of Maxforce bait for control of the Argentine Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in Hal eakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii. Environmental Entomology, 27(6): 1472-1481. In an effort to develop a chemical contro l strategy for the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile , in Haleakala National Park, Maxforce, which is form ulated with 0.9% hydramethylnon, was used in test plots to determine the efficacy of the ant bait in the field. Bait molding, qui ck mortality, and toxicant brea kdown from UV radiation created a short exposure time to the bait and t oxicant, which may have been the main obstacle to Hawai'i. Pacific Science , 52: 228-236. Although the Hawaiian Islands have no indi genous ants, more than 40 species of ants have become established there, where they have been implicated in the extermination of much of the native fauna. Ant surveys were conducted at high elevations (1680 - 3140 m) on the western slop of Mauna Kea Volcano on the island of Hawaii to determine the extent of ant infestation in those highland communi ties and particularly to evaluate the po tential threat of ants in the highlands to native Hawaiian species. Five speci es were collected. Ants were commo n up to 2000 m elevatio n, but densities quickly dropped off above that. 35 Kraus, F., E.W. Campbell, A. Allison, & T.K. Pratt (1999). Eleutherodactylus frog introductions to Hawaii. Herpetological Review , 30: 21-25. {Herpetofauna} As an oceanic archipelago isolated from continental sour ce areas, Hawaii lacks native terrestrial reptiles and amphibians. We report the recent establishment in Hawaii of three new species of frogs native to the Caribbean: Eleutherodactylus coqui, E. martinicensis, and E. planirostris . Control and eradication effo rts will be pointless until such time as relevant State officials actively pursue a progr am to ensure nursery materi al imported into Hawaii or offered for sale in-state is free of frogs or their eggs. Lindsey, G.D., S.M. Mosher, S.G. Fancy, & T.D. Smucker (1999). Population structure and movement of introduced rats in an Hawaiian rainforest. Pacific Conservation Biology , 5: 94-102. We studied populations of introduced rats in three areas in Ha waiian rainforests as part of a larger study to determine the factors limiting endangered bird populations. Species composition among 1264 rats live trapped was Black Rats Rattus rattus 60.8%, Polynesian Rats R. exulans 38.1%, and Norway Rats R. norvegicus 1.0%. Of 44 rats captured in trees, 43 were Black Rats and one was a Polynesian rat. Cole, F.R., L.L. Loope, A.C. Medeiros, C.E. Howe, & L.J. Anderson (2000). Food habits and impacts of introduced rodents in high-elevation shrubland of Haleakala National Park, Maui, Hawaii. Pacific Science, 54(4): 313-329. Mus musculus and Rattus rattus are ubiquitous consumers in the high-elevation shrubland of Haleakal National Park. These rodents, particularly Mus musculus , exert strong predation pressure on populations of arthropod species, including locally endemic species on upper Haleakal Volcano. Smucker, T.D., G.D.

Feral cat Felis catus home range in a Hawaiian montane wet forest and their diet in three habitats - montane wet forest, subalpine dry forest, and lowland dry forest - were dete rmined to provide baseline eco logical data and to assess potential impacts to native terre strial fauna. If large-scal e rat control is implemented in Hawaii, predator population structure and diet, and prey abundance should be assessed before, during and afte r rodent control, with particular attention given to the abilities of predators to exert subse quently higher predation upon native fauna, especially Hodges, A.C.

In Evolution, ecology, conservation and management of Ha waiian birds: a vanishing avifauna (J.M. Scott, S. Conant, & C. van Riper, III, eds.). Studies in Avian Biology, 22: 243-246. The invasive immigrant Argentine ant has spread to occupy roughly 120 ha., or 15%, of the nesting habitat of the endangered Hawaiian Dark-rumped Petrel in Haleakal National Park on the island of Maui, Hawai'i. The colony at Haleakal is responsible for most of the known reproduction of th e endemic seabird. At current levels, the Argentine ant is not believed to significantly influence the nes ting success rate of the Hawaiian Dark-rumped Petrel. Brenner, G.J., on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Pan-Pacific impor endemic Cydia spp. are poorly known. Cydia larvae are an important food to palila, an endange red Hawaiian bird that inhabits Sophora woodlands on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

Prey taken by Feral Cats ( Felis catus ) and Barn Owls (Tyto alba ) Area Reserve, Maui, Hawai'i. ' Elepaio , 62: 127,129-131. Native Hawaiian birds experienced an extraordinary peri od of extinction after immigration of people from around the world. This rapid decline was caused by factors includi ng habitat destruction and introduced avian disease and predators such as feral cats and the introduced Barn Owl. It would be important to monitor cat and owl populations 36 when rodent populations are controlled for conservation pur poses, to see if these predators decrease through emigration and mortality, or if instead they resort to preying more heavily on birds.

Limiting dispersal is a fundamental strategy in the control of invasive species, and in certa in situations containment of incipient populations may be an important management technique . To test the feasibility of slowing the rapid spread of two Argentine ant supercolonies in Ha leakala National Park , Hawaii, we applied ant bait and toxicant within an experimental plot situated along a s upercolony boundary. Foraging ant numbe rs at baited m onitoring stations decreased sharply within two weeks after treatment, and ant sp read was completely halted within the plot for at least one year.

American Scientist , 84: 468-478. The human species is noteworthy for its ability to forge into new environments and drastical ly alter them. Our mobile society is redistributing the species on the earth at a pace th at challenges ecosytems, threat ens human health and strains economies. Vitousek, P.M., C.M. D'Antonio, L.L. Loope, M. Rejmanek, & (1997). Introduced species: a significant component of human-caused global change. New Zealand Journal of Ecology, 21: 1-16. Biological invasions are a widespread and significant component of human-caused breakdown of the regional distinctiveness of Earth's flora and fauna - a substantial globa l change in and of itself. People and institutions working to understand, prevent, and control invasions are carry out so me of the most important - a nd potentially most effective - work on global environmental change. Ricciardi, A., W.W.M. Steiner, R.N. Mack, & D. Simberloff (2000). Towards a global information system for invasive species. Bioscience , 50(3): 239-244. Retrieving critical information about th e spread, impact, and control of invasi ve species has alwa ys been difficult because much of this information is buried in disciplinary j ournals from many different fields or in obscure government documents and technical reports that are not widely accessible. In October 1998 a workshop was convened to discuss the creation of an Internet-based global information system that would provide comprehensive and readily accessible information to aid monitoring, risk assessm ent, and control of invasive species. Loope, L.L., F.G. Howarth, F. Kraus, & T.K. Pratt (2 001). Newly emergent and future threats of alien species to Pacific birds and ecosystems. In Evolution, ecology, conservation and management of Hawaiian birds: a vanishing avifauna (J.M. Scott, S. Conant, & C. van Riper, III, eds.). Studies in Avian Biology , 22: 291-304. Although the devastating effects of established alien specie s to Pacific birds and ecos ystems are generally well recognized by the avian conservation community, we raise the und er appreciated issue of effe cts of incipient and future invasives. We touch upon a sampling of obviously severe pote ntial future threats, with the hope of raising awareness and resolve to fix the current woefully inadequate syst em for prevention of and rapid response to new invasions. Fornwall, M. & L. Loope (2004). Toward a comprehe nsive information system to assist invasive species management in Hawaii and Pacific islands. Weed Science , 52: 854-856. The need for coordinated regional and global electronic databa ses to assit prevention, earl y detection, rapid response, and control of biological invasions is well accepted. The Paci fic Basin Information Node , a node of the National Biological Information Infrastructure, has been increasingl y engaged in the invasive sp ecies enterprise since its establishment in 2001. Although initial emphasis has been on Hawaii, cooperative work with other Pacific islands and countries of the Pacific Rim is already underway and planned. Loope, L.L. (2004). The challenge of effectively addressing the threat of invasive species to the National Park System. Park Science , 22(2): 14-20. Ever-increasing transport of spec ies of all kinds is breaking down biogeographical boundaries with profound consequences for biodiversity loss worldw ide. Given the seeds of catastrophic loss already planted and those yet to come, invasive species pose a highly significant threat to the biodiversity of the U.S. National Park System in the early decades of the 21 st century. My attempt here is at a personal revi ew and synthesis of implications of trends in biological invasions for national parks, based on personal experience and analyses by others. 45 Loope, L.L., & D.A. Helweg (2004). Invasive species prevention for oceanic islands. Insula: International Journal of Island Affairs (February 2004) : 67-72. Humans have been moving species of animals and plan ts beyond their native ranges, both deliberately and inadvertently, and many of these species have become establ ished and spread. Invasive species pose the primary threat to biodiversity on most oceanic islands. New terrestrial and aquatic/marine invasive plant and animal species threaten to overwhelm Galapagos, Hawaii, New Ze aland and all Pacific islands with ecological and economic damage and social costs. Key prerequisites for progress include obtaining broad public s upport and the cooperation of agriculture and biodiversity interests. Books, Chapters, and Edited Volumes Loope, L.L. & C.P.

We used vari able circular plot counts during 28-31 January 1997 to estimate Palila population at 310 stations on 17 transects on Mauna Ke a that were used in 1996. The 1997 estimate of 4,395 \u00b1 625 SE Palila is higher than the mean estimate for the period 1980-1995 and similar to the 1996 estimate. Fancy, S.G., R.J. Craig, & C.W. Kessler (1998).

We studied the distribution, abundance, and act ivity patterns of the Hawaiian hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus semotus ) in the District of Puna, Hawaii Island, August - December 1993. The number of bats detected was independent of vegetation types (native, mixed, or introduced). Peaks in bat activity occurred at sunset an d 30 minutes before sunrise. Gray, E.M., P.C. Banko, Kea have fluctuated tremendously over the past 18 years. Our goal in this study was to continue censusing Palila populatio n numbers throughout their entire range, using the same methodology that has been used in previous censuses to fa cilitate comparison between year s. We found no significant difference in mean population sized per area when we compared population estimates from the nonbreeding season with estimates from the breeding season. Morin, M.P., C.T.

Using nucleic acid hybridiza tion, (PCR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), phytoplasmas were detected in Dodonaea viscosa afflicted with Dodonaea yellow di sease in Hawaii. These results, and the witches-broom symptoms of disease D. viscosa , suggest that phytoplasmas might be involved in the etiology of this disease in Hawaii.

Fonseca, D.M., C.T. Atkinson, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus , the vector malaria in Hawaii. Molecular Ecology , 7: 1617-1618. The southern house mosquito, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus , was introduced accidentally to Hawaii in 1826. There it eventually became the vector of avian malaria, Plasmodium relictum , a disease that severely limits the size and distribution of endemic forest bird populations in Hawaii. We are ex amining the population structure of Cx. quinquefasciatus and association with malaria parasites using microsat ellites as one of the genetic markers. Here, we describe the isolation, and characterization, of eight polymorphic Identification, inheritance and linkage of B-G-like genes and MHC class I genes in cranes. Journal of Heredity , 90: 152-159. We identified B-G-like genes in the whopping and Florida sandhill cranes and linked them to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Th is study supports the concept of a long-term association of polymorphic B-G- like genes with the MHC. It also establishes SSCP as a means for evaluating MHC genetic variability in cranes.

The introduction of avian and mosquitoes ( Culex quinquefasciatus ) to the Hawaiian Islands is believed to have played a major role in th e decline and extinction of na tive Hawaiian ( Himatione sanguinea ) ( Vestiaria coccinea ) infected under similar condition s with the same parasite isolate. We conclude that the current elevational and geographic distribution of Hawaiian honeycreepers is determined by rela tive susceptibility to avian malaria. Fonseca, D.M., D.A. LaPointe, & R.C.

In order to understand the dynamics of the disease in Hawaii and gain insights into the evol ution of vector-mediated parasite-host interactions in general we st udied the population genetics of Cx. quinquefasciatus in the Hawaiian Islands. The current distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes combined with the mi crosatellite information lead us to conclude that there have been several introductions and to speculate on some pr ocesses that may be responsible for the current population genetics of vectors of avian malaria in Hawaii.

Two strains of avian pox viruses were isolat ed from cutaneous lesions in Hawaiian crows ( Corvus hawaiiensis ) examined in 1994 and a third from a biopsy obtained in 1992 from an infected bird of the Apapane species ( Himatione sanguinea ) by inoculation of the chorioallantoic membranes of developing chicken embryos.

Pathogenicity, serological responses and diagnosis of experimental and natural malari al infections in native Islands typically have very low prevalences of infection with avian malaria ( Plasmodium relictum ) and it is not clear whether they share the sa me high susceptibility to this parasite that has been documented in native Hawaiian honeycreepers. We exposed four captive Omao to single infective mosquito bites and measured parasitemia, serological responses, and mortality over time. Hawaiian thrushes appear to have a high tolerance for malaria, with most i ndividuals developing chronic, low-level infections after exposure that cannot be diagnosed accurately by blood smears.

Five uninfected control am akihi exposed at the same time to infective mosquito bites developed acute infections with high parasitemias. Hawaiian honeycreepers that are capable of recovering from acute infections develop concomitant immunity to superinfection, making them functionally immune in areas where malaria transmission has become endemic.

Although a number of factors have contributed to the declin e and extinction of Hawaii's en demic terrestrial avifauna, introduced avian malaria ( Plasmodium relictum ) is probably the single most important factor preventing recovery of these birds in low-elevation habitats. We are investigati ng the natural evolution of disease resistance in some low- elevation native bird populations, to perfe ct genetic methods for id entifying individuals with a greater immunological capacity to survive malarial infection. 60 Benning, T.L., D.A. LaPointe, C.T. Atkinson, & P.M. Vitousek (2002). Interactions of climate change with biological invasions and land use in the Ha waiian Islands: Modeling the fate of endemic birds using a geographic information system. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 99(22): 14246-14249. The Hawaiian honeycreepers represent a superb illustration of evolutionary radiation, with a single colonization event giving rise to 19 extant and at least 10 extinct species. They also represent a dram atic example of anthropogenic extinction. Landscape analyses of thre e high-elevation forest refuges show that anthropogenic climate change is likely to combine with past land-use changes, biological invasions, and avian disease introductions to drive several of the remaining species to extinction, especially on the islands of Kauai and Hawaii. Jarvi, S.I., J.J. Schultz, & C.T. Atkinson (2002). PCR diagnostics underestimate the prevalence of avian malaria ( Plasmodium 88: 153-158. This study compares the sensitivity of several polymerase chain reaction (P CR)-based methods for diagnosing avian malaria ( Plasmodium relictum ) in captive Hawaiian honeycreepers using microscopy and a recently developed immunoblotting technique. Individually, none of the diagnosti c methods was 100% accurate in detecting subpatent infections, although serological methods were significantly more sensitive (97%) than either nested PCR (61-84%) or microscopy (27%). The use of PCR as a sole means of detection of circulating parasites may significantly underestimate true prevalence. Jarvi, S.I., M.E.M. & (2003). Detection of avian malaria ( Plasmodium spp.) in native land birds of American Samoa. Conservation Genetics , 4: 629-637. This study documents the presence of Plasmodium spp in landbirds of central Polyne sia. Blood samples collected from eight native and introduced species from the island of Tutu ila, American Samoa were ev aluated for the presence of Plasmodium spp by nested rDNA PCR, serology and/or microscopy. High pr evalence of apparently chronic infections, the relative stability of the native land bird communities, an d the presence of mosquito vectors which are considered endemic and capable of transmitting avian Plasmodia , suggest that these parasites ar e indigenous to Samoa and have a long coevolutionary history with their hosts.

LaPointe, & M.D. dynamics of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) along an elevational gradient in Hawaii. Journal of Medical Entomology , 41(6): 1157-1170. We present a population model to understand the effects of temperature and rainfall on the population dynamics of the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, along an elevational gradient in Hawaii. We use a novel approach to model the effects of temperature on populatio n growth by dynamically incorporating developmental rate into the transition matrix, by using phys iolgical ages of immatures instead of chronological age or stages. The predictions of our model indicate th e importance of abiotic conditions on mo squito dynamics and have important implications for the managemet of disease transmitted by Cx. quinquefasciatus in Hawaii and elsewhere.

Prevalence and differential host specif icity of two avian blood parasite genera in the Australo-Papuan region. Molecular Ecology , 13: 3829-3844. The degree to which widespread avian blood parasites in the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus pose a threat to novel hosts depends in part on the degr ee to which they are constrainted to a particular host or host family. We examined the host distribution and host-specificity of thes e parasites in birds from two relatively understudied and isolated locations: Australia and Papua New Guinea. Re sults support previous evidence of strong host-family 61 specificity in Haemoproteus and suggest that lineages of Plasmodium are more likely to form evolutionarily-stable associations with novel hosts.
