In the spirit of this commitment, we introduced Community Health Workers in fiscal year (FY) 2022 . These frontline health care ambassadors serve an important role in our communities, helping people identify and remove their social barriers to health care. These services are especially vital after so many people abandoned health screenings and other important care during the COVID pandemic out of fear, or lack of personal contact or communication. With the expansion of COVID- 19 vaccines and subsequent boosters aimed at reaching new age groups, we continue our campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of being vaccinated and having access to these vaccines, especially among the vulnerable populations. We've also expanded effective treatments for all patients. As we continue to encourage vaccination across all groups and communities, we hope to realize improved population health, without disparities, in these at-risk communities. The Benefits of the 340B Program With the valuable help of savings and revenue generated from contract pharmacy partners, which is then made available to Samaritan Hospital through the 340B program, SPHP invested more than $110 million in community health in FY 22. These efforts included preventive services, uncompensated care, community partnerships, and other efforts to meet the health needs of the uninsured, low-income, and other at-risk populations. Thanks to these resources, we were able to reach an additional 9,000 people in FY 22 compared to the previous fiscal year. Our services benefited victims of crime, homeless people who needed treatment or temporary housing while ill, and people with food insecurities. At SPHP, we remain steadfast in our Mission to serve as \"a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities\" and address social influencers of health; not only as a caring community member, but as a catalyst for change. We continue to promote optimal health for our poor and vulnerable populations by connecting social and clinical care, addressing social needs, dismantling systemic racism, and reducing health inequities. We are thankful for the opportunities and partnerships that help us invest in our communities and optimize wellness in the Capital Region and surrounding areas. The 340B program at Samaritan Hospital provides valuable resources to SPHP in its efforts to provide needed care to at-risk populations in our local communities.
