Here are 4 foods and 2 recipes to support your immune system. The concept of food as medicine is as old as time, and it is a core principle of Traditional Chinese Medicine. One of the best things you can do during the cold winter months or when you feel like you may be getting sick is to eat certain foods that can boost your immune system. Having a strong digestive system is very important in Traditional Chinese Medicine for supporting your immune system, as that is where your body draws its energy to support all of its functions, including immunity. Ginger and Green Onion In Traditional Chinese Medicine, both ginger and green onions are viewed as warming foods that are good for fighting off the seeping cold and dampness of fall and winter. It is often the invasion of cold and damp that weakens your immune system and makes you more susceptible to colds, the flu, and other infections. By eating more ginger and green onion when it's cold and wet out, you can boost your immune system and hopefully fend off any illness. Cinnamon and Brown Sugar Like ginger and green onions, cinnamon and brown sugar are also seen as warming foods that can help support your immune system. Cinnamon can help circulation and balance blood sugar levels, as well as have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, both white sugar and brown sugar are considered a \"qi tonic\", but brown sugar is considered more warming making it better for immune support. Both cinnamon and brown sugar should be used in moderation. Try these recipes that include ginger, green onion, cinnamon, or brown sugar on a cold day or when you start to feel the slightest bit sick. Generally, food-as-medicine work best as preventative measures, not when you are already feeling sick or unwell.
