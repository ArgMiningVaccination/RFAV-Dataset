Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of patients older than age 60 years at 3 university-based primary care clinics in the southeastern United States. Participants provided information for age, race, sex, education level, history of having \"shingles\" or knowing someone else who had shingles, past vaccinations, and factors influencing their decision to receive the HZ vaccine. Results: We surveyed 403 patients (49% African American [AA], 47% white). The prevalence of HZ was 12.4% overall and was significantly different among races (8% AA, 17% white; P = .01). Only 29% of patients (16% AA, 42% white; P < .001) were aware that the HZ vaccine was recommended. The HZ vaccination rate was 7.7% (2% AA, 14% white; P < .001). Only 13.7% of all study subjects reported having any communication with their medical providers regarding the HZ vaccine. Physician recommendation and media had the greatest influence on patients who received the vaccine. Of those who had not been vaccinated, 70% had never heard about it and 59% were interested in receiving the vaccine after the survey. Conclusion: There is a large difference in self-reported HZ and vaccination rates among races. The HZ vaccination rate was low overall, but most patients were interested in receiving the vaccine after the survey. More public awareness and education is needed to improve rates of HZ vaccination.", "sitename": "American Board of Family Medicine", "date": "2013-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Research ArticleOriginal Research Herpes Zoster Knowledge, Prevalence, and Vaccination Rate by Race Tae Joon Lee, Stella Hayes, Doyle M.
