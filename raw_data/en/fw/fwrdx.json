What is Herbal Medicine? Herbal medicines are made up of active ingredients made from plants, including leaves, roots and flowers. Herbs can be taken in many forms. They can be ground and blended into supplement powders, combined to make delicious herbal teas or extracted to form tinctures. Nature has been the basis for effective medical treatments throughout history. Some herbs, such as Andrographis, have been proven over thousands of years to be effective at fighting respiratory infections. [The NHS is now exploring whether it should be prescribed](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/03/19/nhs-trial-ayurvedic-herbal-remedy-cut-antibiotics-coughs-colds/), in some cases, instead of antibiotics. What is a Medical Herbalist? Medical herbalists are experts in herbal medicine. Medical Herbalists create remedies from plants whose traditional uses are often backed up by modern scientific research and clinical trials. A Medical Herbalist will have a BSc or equivalent in Herbal Medicine. They will have studied elements of conventional medicine alongside plant-based medicine, and are trained to a high level of diagnostic standards. Medical Herbalists look at health from a holistic perspective. They aim to treat the underlying cause of disease, not just the symptoms, taking the individual into account. They can prescribe herbal remedies to be used alongside other medication and treatments. Zen Maitri's team of medical herbalists are based in Chiswick, West London. It includes members of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists (NIMH). Where Can I Get Herbal Medicine? Just like conventional drugs and pharmaceuticals, herbs and herbal medicine can have side effects and must be prescribed carefully. Because of that, it's important to get your herbal medicine - particularly bespoke teas, tinctures, and powders - from a qualified and experienced professional.

Choosing when to see a medical herbalist doesn't have to be a decision similar to choosing when to see your local GP. That's because much of the positive impacts herbal medicine can provide is preventative. For example, our team can provide natural supplements that support your immunity and reduce the likelihood of you becoming ill in the first place. So in short, you should see a medical herbalist at any time, whether you are struggling with a health concern, or whether you just want some pointers on how you can live better, today. There's a whole world of herbs with different medicinal properties, which medical herbalists are trained to use. Herbs are both gentle and effective for helping with a variety of ailments including immunity issues, digestive problems, hormone imbalances, problems related to joints and much more. For example, it's well established that turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory, that peppermint is great for supporting digestion, and that cinnamon can help with the management of blood sugar.
