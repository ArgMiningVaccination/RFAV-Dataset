Beginning his medical career as an army paramedic, he then went on to become a Physical Therapist. In Israel, he founded a Sports Medicine Institute and spearheaded one of the first research teams, exploring the effects of Glucosamine Sulfate in the treatment of lower back pain. Another important research into the management of lower back pain and pregnancy that he conducted, was the first of its kind and essentially led him to his sub specialty of Women's Health and Pediatrics. Dr. Laub's quest to treat the person as a whole and the underlying cause of disease, inspired him to study Chiropractic in Canada. Returning to Israel, he directed the Chiropractic division of an integrative medicine department in a major hospital, while running a private practice. Upon moving to the United States, he taught Chiropractic at University of Bridgeport. He then went on to found West Hartford Chiropractic and Wellness, a multi-disciplinary practice where he unites the best of alternative and allopathic medicine. Dr. Laub uses a 'whole person approach'. This approach to wellness means looking for underlying causes of any disturbance or disruption (which may or may not be the cause of the symptoms at the time) and making whatever interventions and lifestyle adjustments that would optimize the conditions for normal function. Using this unique approach, Dr. Laub is able to help you accelerate and/or maintain your journey to good health. - Dr.Brandon Allen, DCChiropractic Physician Being a former high level athlete, Dr. Allen takes a unique approach to chiropractic and the art of the adjustment.
