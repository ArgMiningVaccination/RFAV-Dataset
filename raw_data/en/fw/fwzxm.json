Ramey, DVM Highlights: Practitioners often must balance short-term success versus long-term health of the horse. Informed consent should be obtained from all parties prior to treatment. Questionable conduct can create significant legal liability.Veterinarians who work with competition horses face unique ethical challenges. In human medicine, where issues concerning ethics and competitive sports have been regularly discussed, there is no universally accepted code of ethics; however, some organizations have adopted ethical codes. For example, the International Federation of Sports Medicine declares, \"It is the responsibility of the sports medicine physician to determine whether the injured athletes should continue training or participating in com-petition.\" In the heat of competition, with money, reputa-tions and prizes at stake, an equine veterinarian can be placed in a difficult spot. Conflict of interest The equine veterinarian's primary duty is to the horse; however, the goals of taking care of the horse's health and having it compete may sometimes be at odds. Conflicts of interest arise when the horse's ability to compete and its health may not be promoted by the same intervention (if it is promoted at all). Employed by the owner, trainer or rider (OTR), the professional success of the sports medicine vet-erinarian may rely on keeping the horse in competition, which may also mean advocating for short-term success at the risk of long-term detriment. Desires to optimize perfor-mance may be balanced against concerns about whether a horse can compete safely. Attempting to enhance a horse's ability to perform in the short-term may not be in the horse's best interest in the long term. These conflicts may influence the veterinarian's actions, for which the veterinar-ian ultimately can be held accountable. Autonomy Autonomy refers to the capacity of an individual to make rational, uncoerced decisions. Autonomous decisions are free from controlling interferences, made with reliable information. The competitiveness of equine sport and the expectations put on equine athletes may increase the prob-ability of bad decision-making. Desire for fame and/or reward also weighs on decisions. A horse's long-term health should never be ignored in the interest of helping to keep it competing. Informed consent Informed consent means an adequate level of relevant information is available to allow a free and autonomous choice. It also assumes that the OTR has the expertise to balance the pros and cons of their choices. In order to act ethically, as well as to protect against aggrieved hindsight, veterinarians should obtain appropriate informed consent from all parties before treatment. Veterinarians should involve all parties in decision-making, establish goals of care and, importantly, document the process. Even so, important questions remain. For example, should the vet-erinarian transfer risk assessment from the OTR, and what are the potential repercussions if that transfer is done? Return to competition After an injury, the veterinarian may also be involved in decisions on whether the horse continues to compete and when it can return to competition. In most cases, all parties want to return the horse to competition as soon as possible. The burden of responsibility on the veterinarian in such cases is considerable because of the possibility of bad outcomes. External factors can influence the decision of what's best for the horse. The veterinarian may be the only person whose primary concern is both the horse's short- and long-term health. Consider a show horse with a mild suspensory ligament strain. Rest may be the best option for the horse, with a lower risk of increased injury; however, rest might mean the horse misses an important show. The horse may gain value if it wins, or the rider may gain points toward a year-end award. What happens if the veterinarian decides for the horse? The OTR can make it difficult for a veterinarian to safeguard a horse's welfare. Horse health care decisions are not always the veterinarian's decision to make, and the Ethics: Equine sports medicine fraught with ethical dilemmas Dr. Scott Palmer continued on page IVIV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017 AAEP publishes guidelines for race day injury management A comprehensive set of guidelines for the emergency race- day management of injured Thoroughbreds has been published at www.aaep.org. Created by the AAEP's Racing Committee, the Thoroughbred Race Day Injury Management Guidelines detail protocols for appropriate preparation, response and management associated with on-track injuries. The document examines recommended staffing/personnel; automotive equipment, including items that should be stocked in the equine ambulance or chase vehicle; con-tents of emergency bags carried by paddock and track veterinarians; incident communication standards; injury management duties and responsibilities by injury type, track surface or track location; and key messages to con-vey when discussing serious injuries with the media or general public. Ethics , continued from page III veterinarian may be faced with the choice of either accepting the OTR's decision(s) or walking away. Awareness of these conflicts is the first step to acting ethically. Advertising and sponsorship Advertising and sponsorship are ubiquitous in equestrian events. Ethically, advertising should always be truthful and not make false or misleading claims; however, advertisers may fail to provide information about the risks of treatment or the fact that a product has not been shown to be effective. Even the sobriquet of \"sports medicine veteri-narian\" has ethical implications if it is used for public relations. Research in progress and the lack of evidence-based medicineMany unanswered questions hinder informed decision-making. How can fully informed consent be obtained given the high degree of uncertainty for some sports medicine therapies? Should veterinarians err on the side of using treatments of proven effectiveness, or should decisions be based on the latest medical promise? The rapid technological evolution of sports medicine and the small sample of horses available for research collectively contribute to a lack of evidence-based medicine. Long-term follow-up is also needed to test treatments for efficacy. Ethically, the level of evidence for a therapy must be com- municated to the OTR. Furthermore, conflicts of interest can arise when the veterinarian owns (and has to pay for) the product or service that is being recommended. Ethical veterinarians should operate according to their best assessment of the current data, taking into account the relative risks and benefits of different strategies and the evidence for them. Outside influences should not affect health care decisions made for the horse. Drugs and performance enhancement: Risks and regulationsRules regarding the use of performance-enhancing drugs are rather explicitly stated by some equestrian sport orga-nizations but are conspicuously absent in others. It's unethical to use a prohibited substance; however, just because a prohibited substance is not used does not also mean that using any other substance is ethically appropri-ate. Efforts to keep drug use in performance horses are undermined when a substance is used because, \"It doesn't test.\" The veterinarian should not use any drug that is likely to adversely affect the horse's health. Conclusions Many ethical issues permeate equine sports medicine. Ethics and law are also closely related, and there is potential for significant legal liability in cases involving valuable horses when ethical conduct can be called into question. Decisions made in a competitive environment can mean the difference between a horse with a long, successful career or a short one, perhaps even one requiring euthanasia. A better understanding of what drives the decisions made by owners, trainers and riders is critical, as are educational efforts to help everyone better understand the long-term consequences of the decisions made on behalf of competition horses.

Dr. Scott PalmerEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017 V By Bruce Whittle, DVM The practice of veterinary medicine is predominantly regulated at the state level by a board of veterinary medicine in each state. The purpose for licensure of veter-inarians by these entities is to protect the public from unqualified individuals who would provide veterinary medical services. The protection of the public is the primary reason these boards exist. In most states, the veterinary practice act is made up of statutes\u2014laws enacted by the state legislature and signed by the governor\u2014and regulations typically proposed by the veterinary medical board to further clarify the statutes. The regulations are enacted through an abbreviated rule-making process that usually does not require passage by the entire legislature. In recent years, attacks on what constitutes the practice of veterinary medicine in each state have become more frequent. In 2016, Kansas and Indiana both had legisla-tive challenges to their veterinary practice acts that would have allowed non-veterinarians to provide equine dentistry services. Neither of the bills advanced in the respective legislatures but a similar bill already has been filed for 2017 in the Indiana legislature. Similarly, a proposed rule change ongoing in Massachusetts and initiated by the Massachusetts Board of Veterinary Examiners would exempt non-veterinarians floating horses' teeth from the practice of veterinary medicine. Meanwhile, positive developments on another hot scope of practice issue\u2014use of compounded medications by veterinarians\u2014occurred in 2016 with passage of laws in Louisiana and Ohio as well as proposal of bills in Maryland and Massachusetts to strengthen veterinarians' ability to provide sufficient care for their patients. These are just a few of the many issues that were introduced in various states last year and/or may be brought up again in 2017. The primary role of the AAEP in scope of practice issues is to provide resources to state veterinary medical associ-ations (VMAs) and engage members dealing with equine legislative issues. In 2016, the AAEP formed a standing State Legislative Issues subcommittee of the Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council to deal with these issues. This follows the AAEP's establishment in 2014 of member veterinarians as state liaisons to serve as conduits between the AAEP and state and provincial VMAs to facilitate information transfer. If you are interested in serving as a state or provincial liaison, contact AAEP Director of Industry Relations Keith Kleine at kkleine@aaep.org or (859) 233-0147. The AVMA is another important resource for state VMAs dealing with scope of practice issues, with a section of its website dedicated to the subject: www.avma.org/advocacy/stateandlocal/pages/default.aspx Challenges to the scope of veterinary practice will likely continue. Veterinarians can either complain or be active in their VMAs and become involved in the legislative or regulatory process. Without veterinarian involvement at the state and provincial level, we will likely see an erosion of the scope of veterinary practice to the collective detriment of us all.

He serves as vice chair of the AAEP's Welfare and Public Policy Advisory Council and is a past president of the Missouri Veterinary Medical Association.Public Policy: Help preserve and strengthen the scope of veterinary practice Equine dentistry among issues in states' crosshairs November 17-21, you in ConventionVI EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017 Do you know of a colleague or group consistently going above and beyond in their service to the profession or well-being of horses?

Touch Point: Senior horses present care, service opportunity Geriatric horse care presents an opportunity to grow your client services, according to the AAEP's market research. While the majority of horse owners and trainers in our 2012 survey said their usage of their primary veterinarian will likely stay the same over the next few years, 5% of respondents said they anticipate using their veterinarian more often. The reason for increased veterinary needs? Aging horses will require more medical attention. With horses often living well into their 20s and beyond, equine practitioners who are attentive to the unique needs of their older patients often build a successful\u2014and appre-ciative\u2014client niche within their practice. As clients learn about the special medical requirements of their older animals, the veterinarian as care provider and advisor becomes an even more valuable partner. Visit the Touch website at touch.aaep.org for client education materials about the care of aging horses for use in your practice newsletter or website as well as case models about building a geriatric wellness program.

Antimicrobial prescriptions were made in 207,325 cases, of which 7.5% were for reserved antimicrobials. Of these, 9856 for clarithromycin. Of all antimicrobials prescribed, 44.7%were done so during a period of hospitalisation, and 46.6% of reserved antimicrobials were prescribed hospitalisation. Only 3.3% of antimicrobial prescriptions were associated with a culture and sensitivity result, with only a slightly higher percentage of reserved antimicrobials being informed by culture and sensitivity (5.2%). There were fluctuations in the use of individual antimicrobials with enro floxacin and clarithromycin prescriptions apparently on the increase. A strong seasonal association between clarithromycin and summer months was found, thought to be due to its use for Rhodococcus equi infections in foals. The increasing use of this drug in the latter years of the study may indicate that it is superseding erythromycin as the macrolide of choice in these foals. Veterinary surgeons in certain practices were more likely to prescribe reserved antimicrobials than in other practices. The low uptake of culture and sensitivity may be due to a desire to avoid additional expense for the client and the delay in obtaining results; however, this is especially important in new infections and where use of reserved antimicrobials is being considered. Use of certain reserved antimicrobials is stable or increasing; however, this is rarely informed by a culture and sensitivity result. There is a continued need to modify the prescribing habits of equine vets in regard to the use of reserved antimicrobials. Hindlimb proximal suspensory desmitis In this study Matthew Brokken and colleagues in the USAevaluated the effects of a new microfracture and ligamentsplitting procedure on ligament healing and examined theusefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging formonitoring ligament healing over time using a collagenasemodel of hindlimb proximal suspensory desmitis . The six healthy adult horses used in this study were free of lameness with normal hindlimb proximal suspensory ligaments(PSLs). The origin of both hindlimb PSLs were injected withcollagenase and underwent MR imaging 2 weeks later,followed by the microfracture and ligament splittingprocedure on one limb, with the opposite limb serving as thesham-operated control. Serial lameness and MR examinationswere performed. Horses were euthanised 210 days aftersurgery, the PSLs harvested, and histology, biochemistry andgene expression performed on both PSLs. Collagenase lesions viewed on MR images appeared similar to those seen clinically. Serial MR images demonstratedresolution of abnormal signal intensity and tissue formation in the microfracture sites within the third metatarsal bone. Treated limbs had histological evidence of connective tissue appearing to originate from the small perforations and blending into the ligament but no statistical differences were identi ed. Gene expression for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein and decorin were signi cantly increased in treated compared with control limbs. The microfracture and ligament splitting procedure did incite a tissue response but further clinical investigation is necessary to determine if this tissue remodelling at the bone - ligament interface translates to improved clinical outcome. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to follow healing in horses with hindlimb proximal suspensory desmitis. Magic angle effect in the SDFT Recognition of artefacts is an essential component of theaccurate interpretation of diagnostic images. This study byCeri Sherlock and Tim Mair investigated the presence ofmagic angle effect in the super cial digital Tesla magnet with high-resolution sequences used in clinical equine practice. The limbswere imaged in a neutral position and positions thatsimulated the horse 'leaning in ','leaning out ', and internally and externally rotating the distal limb. Signal intensity changes in the SDFT were described and compared. The simulated 'leaning in 'and external rotation positions resulted in increased signal intensity in the axial and middle thirds of the lateral half of the SDFT on sequences with short echo times. The simulated 'leaning out 'and internal rotation positions resulted in increased signal intensity in the axial and middle thirds of the medial half of the SDFT on sequences with short echo times. These signal intensity changes did not occur or were only mild and inconsistent on T2 fast spin echo sequences with longer echo times. The increases in signal intensity in the SDFT are consistent with a position-induced magic angle artefact that has been noted in clinical cases. Attention to positioning of the equine distal limb is essential during clinical imaging; radiologists should be aware of position-induced artefacts to ensure accurate image interpretation. Hindlimb lameness This retrospective case series by Sylvia Maliye and JohnMarshall at the University of Glasgow characterises anddescribes the compensatory load redistribution that resultsfrom unilateral hindlimb lameness in horses . Following a review of medical records, 37 client-owned horses were identi ed with unilateral hindlimb lameness that responded positively (by objective assessment) to diagnostic local anaesthesia during lameness evaluation. The horses had all been evaluated before and after diagnostic local anaesthesia with an inertial sensor-based lameness diagnosis system. The / AE / FEBRUARY 2017head and pelvic movement asymmetry before (baseline)and after diagnostic local anaesthesia were compared. Theeffect of group on baseline pelvic movement asymmetryvariables was analysed statistically. Maximum pelvic height signi cantly decreased from the baseline value after diagnostic local anaesthesia in each ofthe three lameness groups and in all horses combined.Minimum pelvic height signi cantly decreased after the procedure in both the hindlimb only and the hindlimb and ipsilateral forelimb not the hindlimb lameness group. Head movement asymmetry was signi cantly decreased after diagnostic local anaesthesia for horses with hindlimb and ipsilateral forelimb lameness and for all horses combined, but not for those with hindlimb lameness only or those with hindlimb and contralateral forelimb lameness. Results supported that hindlimb lameness cause compensatory load redistribution evidenced as ipsilateral forelimb lameness. In this population of horses, contralateral forelimb lameness was not compensatory and likely re flected true lameness. Further studies are needed to investigate the source of the contralateral forelimb lameness in such horses. Surgical site infection following colic surgery In this study S. Darnaud and colleagues in Italy and the USAinvestigated whether horse age and incision length areassociated with surgical site infection (SSI) following equinecolic surgery . The authors believed that age and incision length were more strongly associated with SSI following colic surgery thanskin closure or wound protection method. Therefore, theobjective of this observational clinical cohort study was toidentify the risks for SSI in horses undergoing colic surgery. Thedata collected included pre-, intra-, and post-operativevariables. The nal multivariable model included breed, incision length, surgical procedure classi cation, and post-operative (PO) colic. Warmbloods, American breeds and Thoroughbreds more commonly had SSI than other breeds. A higher SSI rate was associated with incision lengths >27 cm, heavily contaminated procedures, and horses with PO colic. Surgical site infection appeared to be more common after heavily contaminated procedures and in horses with PO colic, which probably resulted in more incisional contamination and trauma. Some breeds appeared to have higher odds of SSI.Age was not associated with SSI. The risk of developing SSI was higher for horses with an incision >27 cm; therefore, surgeons are encouraged to use the minimum incision length required to accomplish the necessary abdominal exploration and bowel manipulation in the safest manner possible. Omeprazole pharmacodynamics This study by Ben Sykes and colleagues in Australia and theUK investigated the effects of dose and diet on thepharmacodynamics of omeprazole in the horse .The effects of two doses of omeprazole and two dietary regimes on the pharmacodynamics of omeprazole were studied in six horses that had percutaneous gastrotomy tubes tted. A hay only diet was compared with a high grain/low bre diet designed to replicate that of a racehorse in training. Once adapted to the diet, the intragastric pH of each horse was monitored for six consecutive days and measurements were taken from two locations within the stomach 5 cm apart. The percentage time that pH exceeded 4 was considered to be the conditions under which squamous ulceration healing occurs and a 1 mg/kg bwt dose of omeprazole (GastroGard paste) was compared to a 4 mg/kg bwt dose once daily. An effect of both diet and dose was evident with pH values typically higher at the higher (4 mg/kg bwt) dose and in high grain/low b r ed i e t .T h eo v e r a l le f cacy of omeprazole in raising intragastric pH was good under the high grain/low bre conditions but relatively poor with the hay diet. When comparing Day 5 with Day 1 of treatment, the pH values were higher at location 2 at both doses and on both diets. Based on these results the authors recommend that on a roughage-only diet, omeprazole should be used at 4 mg/kg bwt in horses and that a period of fasting before administration of omeprazole may be bene cial in these horses. The differences in results obtained at two different sampling locations within the stomach may be attributable to regional pocketing of acid, and future studies investigating acid suppression should involve sampling at multiple locations.Omeprazole is more effective at increasing gastric pH on high grain/low bre. The use of singular dosing recommendations that encompass all horse types and management conditions may not be appropriate and dosing recommendations that take into account the diet of the horse are needed.

Take Amigo's. Amigo was a successful 9-year-old competitive endurance horse until, during a pasture accident, a large tree limb penetrated his left thoracic cavity. At the referral hospital, his prognosis for survival was given as 2% and he arrested shortly after arrival. But Amigo didn't die that day. He survived, only to develop severe pleuropneumonia which left him completely inappetent. For 28 days, Purina\u00ae Well-Gel was enterally administered. The highly digestible, fi ber-added complete enteral diet provided Amigo with essential nutrients and energy, high-quality protein to help maintain muscle mass, and digestible fi ber to support hindgut function. It gave him a chance for survival. Seven years later he's a healthy, active 16-year-old horse.So we can say that Purina \u00ae Well-Gel meets 100% of a horse's daily NRC requirement for protein, vitamins and minerals* , supplying the complete nutrition needed for a complete recovery.

Barakzai Chine House Veterinary Hospital, that affect the nasal cavity of the horse can be accessed via the nostril or via a frontonasal sinus flap butoccasionally, surgical access to the mid-portion of the nasalcavity is necessary. This case report describes the use of acentrally based, 3-sided rhinotomy which provided goodaccess to the ipsilateral nasal cavity and allowed for removalof abnormal tissue/foreign material in two horses. The nasalbone flap was preserved and only relatively mildintraoperative haemorrhage occurred which was controlledwith nasal packing. Horses recovered well from surgery with anexcellent long-term cosmetic result. Introduction Lesions of the nasal cavity inaccessible via the nostrils andamenable to surgical excision are relatively rare in the horseand thus surgical access to the nasal cavity is requiredinfrequently. Rhinotomy using a centrally based dorsal nasalflap, which provides access to both nasal cavities, has beendescribed as an option for accessing toperform or near total nasal septum resection(Shoemaker et al . 2005). However, in most cases where the nasal septum is not involved, unilateral lesions are morecommon. The caudal aspect of the nasal cavity can also beapproached using frontonasal (sinus) (Blackford et al . 1985); however, this can often result in significant haemorrhage(Blackford et al . 1985) and access is fairly limited. This case series aims to describe 2 cases where surgical access to one nasal cavity was obtained using a 3-sided,dorsally-hinged nasal bone flap (rhinotomy), with the boneflap retained and replaced after extirpation of the mass orforeign material. Surgical technique used in both cases Surgery was performed with the horses under generalanaesthesia, in lateral recumbency with the affected sideuppermost. The site and size of the nasal flap was adjusted rostrocaudally according to the location and size of the lesionbut the rostral aspect of the flap was positioned at least 2 cmcaudal to the naso-incisive notch in order to maintain stabilityof the flap post operatively. Skin, subcutaneous tissue andperiosteum were sharply incised to make a dorsally-hingedflap varying between 5-8 cm in length, depending on theanticipated size of the lesion and care was taken to maintainthe periosteal attachments to the underlying bone. Anoscillating bone saw was used to cut the rostral, lateral andcaudal sides of a rectangular bone flap in the nasal bone,leaving the dorsal aspect intact. Osteotomes were theninserted into the lateral aspect of the cut bone and used to lever the flap dorsally so that it was elevated, but still hinged inthe midline ( Fig 1 ). The nasal cavity was accessed and abnormal tissue and foreign material removed as detailed in specific cases below.The nasal cavity was then packed to control haemorrhagewith a long (2 m) open weave gauze bandage which exitedvia the ipsilateral nostril. This packing was removed 24 h postoperatively. The bone flap was repositioned in the parent bone and held in place using two 6 metric stainless steel cerclage wirespassed through 1 mm drill holes made in the 2 free corners ofthe nasal bone flap and corresponding sites in the parentbone. The ends of the wire were cut short and bent so thatthey were orientated with the free end pushed into theosteotomy cut. The periosteum and subcutaneous tissue wereclosed together using 3.5 metric polyglactin 910 in a simplecontinuous pattern. The skin was closed using staples ( Fig 2 ). No external dressing was applied. Individual case details Case 1 was a 9-year-old Thoroughbred wit h a 6 week history of unilateral (right) nasal discharge. Endoscopy per nasum revealed a light beige coloured mass in the ventro-lateralaspect of the right middle meatus. Only the dorsal aspect ofthe mass could be visualised ( Fig 3 ) and it was impossible to direct the endoscope into this aspect of the meatus further asthe nasal meatus is very narrow here and only an 8 mmdiameter endoscope was available. The attachments of themass to the nasal mucosa and/or conchae could not bevisualised. confirmed a discrete roundedheterogenous radiopaque mass within the nasal cavity at the Fig 1: Intraoperative view of dorsally-hinged rhinotomy flap in Case 1. Rostral is to the left, caudal to the right. \u00a9 2014 EVJ Ltd61 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017level of the apex of cheek tooth 107 ( Fig 4 ). Transendoscopic biopsy of the mass was not performed as it was thoughtunlikely to yield a representative sample. It was felt very unlikelythat the mass could be removed per nasum , given its size, radiopacity, immobility when prodded with transendoscopicforceps and the unknown nature of its attachment to the nasalmucosa. The horse underwent a nasal bone flap (5 cm length)under general anaesthesia where a solid peduculated mass(Fig 5 ) was easily removed from the nasal cavity. The mass was identified histologically as a calcified nasal granuloma. Case 2 was a 12-year-old pony with a history of having had a maxillary cheek tooth repulsed prior to being purchased bythe current owner. It presented wit h a 2 year history of malodorous unilateral nasal discharge and slowly enlargingright-sided facial swelling. Oral examination revealed that 207was not present and a wide (approximately 4-5 mm) diastemawas present between 206 and 208. This diastema was very deep and a 4 cm long probe could be inserted up to the hub.Endoscopy of the nasal cavity was unrewarding as the nasalmeatuses were occluded within 10 cm of the nares by diffuseconchal swelling. The pony underwent a standing computedtomography (CT) scan which confirmed the presence of anoronasal fistula with complete destruction of the nasalconchae in the ipsilateral nasal cavity between 206 and 208and the entire nasal cavity filled with mixed soft tissue and gasattenuating material, consistent with the appearance of food(Fig 6 ). Additionally there were 2 hyperattenuating structures within the nasal cavity, thought to be dental remnants orcalcified areas of conchae. The pony had a rhinotomy flap (8 cm length) performed under general anaesthesia and large amounts of putrid foodmaterial and inspissated pus were removed ( Fig 7 ), which were contained within a greatly expanded ventral concha.Two dental fragments were identified within the food materialand were also removed ( Fig 8 ). The rostroventral aspect of the conchal bone was surgically fenestrated to facilitate postoperative drainage. Due to the very contaminated nature of Fig 2: Post operative appearance of rhinotomy flap in Case 2 . Fig 3: Light coloured mass in the ventro-lateral aspect of the middle meatus of Case 1 (arrow).

Thediastema between 206 and 208 was packed with bonecement from the oral aspect and the nasal flap closed asdescribed above. Results of treatment Case 1 developed nasofrontal suture periostitis ( Fig 9 )a t3 - 4 weeks post operatively which reduced in size over thefollowing 6 months. The surgical site was reported to havehealed well and there was no nasal discharge. One yearafter surgery the horse developed signs of lower respiratorytract disease and was re-examined at the hospital for investigation of this. There was no link to the previous nasalsurgery. Two and a half years after surgery the horse wasdoing well and showing no further clinical signs associatedwith the nasal cavity. Case 2 recovered uneventfully from surgery and nasal discharge had reduced markedly by week 3 post operatively.The surgical site appeared to be healing well. Around 4 weekspost operatively this pony developed a swelling at the medialcanthus of the eye, which subsequently burst out and drainedpus for 2-3 weeks. This area was quite remote from the surgerysite and a second standing CT scan revealed a small bonysequestrum of the lacrimal bone. We do not know why thissequestrum developed but it is possible that trauma duringrecovery from anaesthesia or during transport may be thecause. The area of previous nasal cavity obstruction lookedclear of foreign material, there was thickening of the nasalbone around and ventral to the flap site and the bone cementplug was still in place ( Fig 10 ). After removal of this small bone sequestrum under standing sedation and local anaesthesia,discharge ceased and telephone follow-up with the owner at2 years post operatively revealed complete resolution ofclinical signs. Fig 6: Multiplanar reconstructions of the preoperative CT scan of Case 2 . The oronasal fistula can be seen associated with previously repulsed 207 (left). Mixed attenuating material fills the left nasalcavity and is pushing the nasal septum to the contralateral side. Atthe level of rostral 208 (right), a hyperattenuating structure is alsopresent. The previous repulsion site can be seen in the maxillarybone. Fig 7: Intraoperative view of Case 2 showing food material being removed from the nasal cavity via rhinotomy.

The surgical site has healed well with only a faint scar visible (greenarrows) but a localised EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017Discussion There are few descriptions of techniques that allow surgical access to the nasal cavity of the horse to allow removal ofabnormal tissues or foreign material from this otherwiseinaccessible area. Blackford et al . (1985) describe a triangulated flap technique that was principally used toaccess the paranasal sinuses; however, they do describethat the caudal nasal cavity and nasal aspect of theethmoturbinates could also be accessed by 'disruptingthe internal plate of the frontal bone'. This bone that makes upthe floor of the frontal sinus can be penetrated with a glovedfinger or blunt surgical instrument and rongeurs or a chisel thenused to remove bone and provide access to the caudal nasalcavity. Removal of this bone plate is usually associated withconsiderable haemorrhage. The technique described in these 2 cases provided good access to the nasal cavity and although haemorrhageinvariably occurred, it was generally of limited volume (lessthan 2 l), was readily stopped by packing the nasal cavityand neither horse required blood transfusion or showedclinical signs of hypovolaemia in the immediate postoperative period. A search of the literature revealed onlyone description of a similar technique (Dixon and Head1999), where an intranasal melanoma was removed via arhinotomy flap performed under general anaesthesia. As thiswas one of 28 cases described, no further details of surgicaltechnique are given (Dixon and Head 1999). Whilst manycases of nasal neoplasia are invasive and extensive, theremay be some discrete lesions that are amenable to excisionif good surgical access is available. Livesey et al . (1984) describe making a 2.5 cm trephine opening through thenasal bone to access a 'pale haemorrhagic tumour thatoccluded the left nasal cavity', but this surgical approach did not allow adequate visualisation of the boundaries of thelesion and the horse was subjected to euthanasia. The masswas confirmed at post mortem to be fibrous dysplasia. The nasal flap made in Case 2 provided excellent access to the nasal cavity for treatment of a dental-related lesion and thusthe technique described is not limited to the removal ofintranasal masses. Surgery was performed under general anaesthesia in this case series for 2 reasons: firstly, it was thought that elevation ofthe thick nasal bone flap would likely be met with significantreaction from a sedated patient and secondly, adequatedesensitisation of the nasal mucosa, particularly within thenarrow dorsal meatus where the flap enters the nasal cavity,would be difficult. Combined, these factors might makesurgery difficult to complete in the standing patient. However,having now had experience of making nasal bone flaps, it isthe author's opinion that standing nasal flap surgery might bean option in amenable patients and may reduceintraoperative haemorrhage, obviating the requirement topack the nasal cavity. Minor complications occurred in both cases, including nasofrontal suture exostosis and a bony sequestrum distant tothe surgical site but in the long-term the cosmetic result forboth cases was excellent. Suture exostosis is a 2001; Woodford and Lane 2006; Dixon et al . 2012) and is usually self-resolving as occurred in Case 1 . In conclusion, a dorsally-hinged nasal bone flap allows good surgical access to the nasal cavity and gives anexcellent cosmetic result.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of acci-dental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associ- ated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal im-pairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be mon-itored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some min- erals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and po-tassium, immediately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skel-eton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphos-phonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lac-tating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the to-tal dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; how-ever, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing. Other signs reported were lip licking, yawning, head shaking, injection site swelling, and hives/pruritus. Distributed by: Dechra Veterinary Products 866-933-2472 \u00a9 Dechra Ltd.

Bolz, M. Bucheli,A .E Jackson* Equine Department; andSection of Diagnostic was referred to the EquineDepartment, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, because ofrecurrent unilateral nasal discharge 3 months after partialremoval of a large cyst from the left maxillary and frontalsinuses. Endoscopic, radiographic and tomographicexaminations showed that the remnant of the cyst, whichoriginally had extended from the left maxillary and frontalsinuses into the left nasal cavity, had expanded and wasobliterating the left middle nasal meatus. A direct surgicalapproach to the cyst through the left nasal and maxillary bonesrostral to the facial crest was chosen, which allowed evaluationand removal of the entire cyst. Endoscopic examination 3 dayspost operatively showed no remnants of the cyst, and the marewas discharged in good health. Re-examination one year latershowed no recurrence of the cyst. Introduction The anatomical relationship between the equine paranasalsinuses and the nasal cavity is complicated (Brinkschulte et All equine paranasal sinuses communicate with themiddle nasal referred to as thenasomaxillary aperture (Waibl 2004). Diseases of the paranasalsinuses are common include various neoplasms, polyps,ethmoidal abscesses, progressive ethmoid haematomas, sinuscysts 1999; Waguespack and Taintor 2011; Dixon et al. 2012 a). Sinus cysts are expansive lesions that constitute the third most common sinus disease after primary and secondarysinusitis (Woodford and Lane 2006). Paranasal sinus cystspredominantly occur in the maxillary sinus or ventral concha(Rush and Mair 2004) but also have been described in thefrontal sinus, bilaterally in the frontal and maxillary sinuses aswell as in the nasal cavity (Lane et al. 1987; Woodford and Lane 2006; Dixon et al. 2012a). The latter is a relatively rare site for cysts in horses and thus surgical access to the nasalcavity for their removal is not often required. Rhinotomythrough a nasal bone to access lesions within the nasal cavitywas recently described in 2 horses (Barakzai 2017). Here describe the clinical, radiographic and computed tomographic (CT) ndings, treatment and outcome in a mare with a large cyst that extended from the maxillary sinus into thenasal cavity. Case details History A 21-year-old Polish Trakehner mare was presented to theEquine Department, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich,with unilateral left nasal discharge. Before admission, the horse had been treated with sulfadimidine/trimethoprim (Rota-TS 1; mg/kg bwt q. 12 h) for 6 days with no improvement in clinical status. The horse had been treated at our clinic for the same condition 3 months previously. At that time, clinical, endoscopic, radiographic and CT examination had shown a large space-occupying lesion in the left maxillary and frontal sinuses that extended into the nasal cavity via the sinonasal ostium, which was enlarged. The mass had been removed from the sinus systems under general anaesthesia using a standard maxillary and frontal sinus flap approach. However, complete removal of the mass from the nasal cavity was not possible because of massive intraoperative haemorrhage. A diagnosis of a sinus cyst was made based on the histological examination of the excised tissue. Clinical ndings and further investigation The mare had mucopurulent discharge from the left nostriland there was mild swelling in the region of the left facialcrest. The left mandibular lymph node was enlarged.Examination of the mouth showed normal ndings. Endoscopic examination of the left nasal cavity showed amass, which extended from a point that was 21 cm caudalto the external nares to the nasopharynx ( Fig 1 ). Radiographic a dorsoventral, left dorsal 30 \u00b0-right ventral oblique and a lateral projection centred on the maxilla. A well-delineated softtissue opacity was visible in the nasal region ( Fig 2 ). The lesion was well-de ned rostrally and extended from the middle of tooth 207 to the ethmoturbinates. It was concluded that thesinus cyst, partially removed in a previous operation, nowextended into the nasal cavity. To assess the extent andexact location of the mass, a CT examination using a 40-slicehelical CT scanner (Siemens, Somatom Sensation Open) wascarried out the following day with the horse under generalanaesthesia. An indwelling catheter was placed in a jugularvein and the horse was premedicated with penicillin bwt i.v.). An orotracheal with \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd65 fluran].8The CT images showed a (approximately 8 cm), well-de ned, space- occupying lesion of homogenous corpuscular fluid density (approximately 30 Houns eld units). The cyst extended from a point medial to the origin of the left infraorbital canalcaudally to the level of tooth 207 rostrally, occupied thecaudal part of the nasal cavity, extended to the ventralnasal meatus and completely obliterated left ventral nasal concha and as a result ofexpansion caused deformation compression of thedorsal nasal concha ( Fig 3 ). The wall of the left infraorbital canal was mildly thickened and deformed but remainedintact. The left sphenopalatine sinus and the rostral left maxillary sinus were both lled with material of similar density (approximately 30 -50 Houns eld units), and the left frontal sinus contained a very small amount of fluid. Additionally, there was almost complete destruction of the left cranialethmoturbinate. Taken together, these ndings indicated thatthe sinus cyst that had been incompletely removed 3 months previously from the nasal cavity had progressed. Surgical details Immediately after CT examination, the anaesthetised horsewas placed in right lateral recumbency on the operatingtable. The surgical area was clipped and prepared foraseptic surgery. A direct approach through the left nasal andmaxillary bones was chosen because the cyst in the left nasalcavity had obliterated the dorsal concha and had extendedto the nasal and maxillary bones. A rectangular bone flap was made dorsal to the infraorbital foramen with the caudalmargin at the level of the rostral end of the facial crest toavoid injury to the infraorbital nerve ( Fig 4 ). After incision of the skin, blunt dissection was used to displace the nasolabialand levator labii superioris muscles ventrally. The periosteum was then elevated and a bone flap (4 93 cm) was created using a chisel and hammer ( Fig 5 ). Removal of the small bone flap allowed direct access to the dorsal meatus and inspection of the rostral part of the nasal cyst, which could then be isolated digitally. A long clamp was used to detach the cyst stump dorsocaudally and the cyst was removed in toto through the opening in the bone ( Fig 6 ). All of the cyst was located in the nasal cavity and it had displaced the ventral concha ventrally and the dorsal concha dorsally. Visual inspection of the nasal cavity through the bone flap showed that both conchae were displaced but intact. The bleeding was minimal ( <1 l), and the nasal cavity was packed with gauze, which exited the nostril. The subcutaneous tissues were sutured using a simple continuous suture pattern and the skin was closed using staples. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. Penicillin G (30,000 iu/kg bwt q. 12 h) and gentamicin (4 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h) were given i.v. for 3 days and phenylbutazone (Butasan 320 mg/ml solution for oral application 62.2 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h) was given orally for one week. The gauze tamponade was removed through the left nostril 2 days post operatively. Examination of the incision showed that it was dry and not painful, and the mare was in good general health. Endoscopic examination of the left nasal cavity showed a considerable amount of space in the middle nasal meatus and no remnants of the cyst. The horse was discharged from the clinic 5 days after surgery with instructions to continue oral administration of trimethoprim/sulfadimidine (20 mg/kg bwt, q.12 h) for another 5 days and to restrict exercise to walking for 3 weeks followed by resumption of normal exercise. A follow-up examination by the primary care veterinarian one year after surgery showed that the mare was healthy with no signs of nasal cyst recurrence. Discussion Sinus cysts can arise in the region of the nasomaxillaryaperture and therefore may expand into the nasal meatus(Rush and Mair 2004) making surgical removal of the entirecyst dif cult. This was the situation in our case, and a direct surgical approach to the left nasal meatus allowed successfulremoval of a large nasal cyst that had recurred after aprevious operation. This approach allowed removal of theentire cyst and avoided post operative complications. Sinus cysts occur most frequently in the maxillary and frontal sinuses, and common surgical techniques includefrontal or maxillary sinus bone flap osteotomy under general A BC Fig 1: Endoscopic view of the mass (A) in the left middle nasal meatus. The mass is dorsal to the ventral concha (B) and ventralto the dorsal concha (C) and extends to the nasopharynx. Fig 2: Right to left lateral radiographic view centred on themaxillary sinus showing a discrete large soft tissue density in thenasal and sinus regions (arrows). The rostral extent of the masswas 21 cm caudal to the nares. \u00a92016 (Woodford and Lane 2006; Dixon et al. 2012a) or in the standing horse (Dixon et al. 2012b). A wide single caudally-based frontonasal bone flap has been used to access the right and left frontal sinuses simultaneously for thetreatment of bilateral paranasal sinus diseases in the standinghorse (Easley and Freeman 2013). Less invasive sinoscopicremoval of bilateral cysts from the frontal and caudalmaxillary sinuses has been reported; the triangulationtechnique allowed for visual inspection of the frontal andmaxillary sinuses in their entirety (Silva et al. 2009). These surgical techniques permit good access to cysts located in all the sinus systems but only limited access to the nasal cavity. This was exempli ed in our case, in which a cyst had been removed previously from the maxillary and frontal sinus but not from the nasal cavity, using a bone flap technique under general anaesthesia. A dorsal nasal bone flap approach to access both cavities was described for segmental or near-total septum resection (Shoemaker et al. 2005), and a large frontonasal sinus osteotomy with fenestration of the nasal conchae was used to access the caudal nasal cavity in horses (Blackford et al. 1985). Although the latter technique carries the risk of intraoperative haemorrhage (Blackford et al. 1985), modern devices that provide haemostasis, such as bipolar, vessel- sealing device (LigaSure), can be used to cut the conchae. Removal of abnormal tissue and foreign material from the nasal cavity of 2 horses was achieved via a nasal bone flap, which was associated with only mild intraoperative haemorrhage (Barakzai 2017). We used a similar approach that involved making a bone flap over the nasal and maxillary bones and rostral to the facial crest. This provided direct access to the cyst in the middle nasal meatus and was associated with minimal haemorrhage because penetration of the dorsal and ventral conchae could be avoided. Important anatomic structures to consider when using this approach are the nasolabial and levator labii superioris muscles, which are displaced ventrally, and the infraorbital nerve. Damage to this nerve and potential associated complications are avoided by placing the bone flap dorsal to the infraorbital canal. Headshaking because of presumptive trigeminal neuritis was reported as a complication of paranasal sinus surgery in 5 horses (Gilsenan et al. 2014). In another study, 16 of 19 horses that had undergone neurectomy of the infraorbital nerve had nasal irritation, which resulted in self-in flicted trauma to the ipsilateral nostril, 3 -8 weeks post operatively (Mair 1999). Another possible complication is intraoperative haemorrhage; a) b) c)Fig 3: a) Transverse computed tomographic image of the skull at the level of 210 (bone algorithm, WW2343, WL112).

The lesion is extending from the 207 to the rostral-mostaspect of the ethmoturbinates (arrows). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd67 EQUINE / AE / FEBRUARY 2017however, since the cyst in the present case was located inthe nasal cavity, it could be entirely removed, withoutdamaging the conchae, thus with minimal bleeding. Although direct extirpation through the nostril using long instruments would be feasible for smaller cysts, this methodwould not have been suitable in the present case becauseof the size and extent of the cyst. On radiographs, the extent of the cyst could be assessed but the exact location and the involvement of the differentcompartments of the nasal cavity could not be veri ed. Computed tomography is useful for the diagnosis ofnasal and paranasal sinus disorders largely because thesinuses and adjacent bones can be evaluated without anatomic superimposition (Tietje et al. 1996). However, exact differentiation of soft tissue structures is not always straightforward, which was exempli ed in the present case. Determination of the origin and exact extent of the cyst in the nasal cavity and whether it had extended into the rostral maxillary sinus or had involved the conchae could be achieved only during surgery. Some authors have postulated that total extirpation of the sinus cyst lining is rarely feasible and that partial extirpation appears to be very effective and does not result in cyst regrowth (Silva et al. 2009; Dixon et al. 2012b ).In the present case, a large portion of the cyst was left in the nasal cavity after the rst surgery, leading to subsequent expansion 3 months later. Moreover, we have encountered 4 other ACB Fig 5: Bone flap over the left nasal and maxillary bones rostral to the facial crest (B) and dorsal to the infraorbital foramen (C)showing the nasal part 6: Extirpation of the sinonasal cyst through the bone flap.

We believe that regrowth is best preventedby complete or near-complete removal of the entire cystlining and content. For instance, when a maxillary cyst hasexpanded into the nasal cavity and cannot be removedcompletely via a maxillary flap, a second flap accessing the nasal cavity should be created. Conclusion A direct approach to the nasal cavity through a bone flap over the nasal and the maxillary bones rostral to the facial crestappears to be a good technique for the removal of large cystsin the nasal meatus, especially when the dorsal concha isdisplaced toward the nasal bone. This approach, possiblycombined with a standard maxillary sinus flap, appears to be ideal for removal of large nasal cysts or cysts that extendbeyond the maxillary sinus and for reducing the risk ofrecurrence. A larger case series is needed to con rm our results. Authors 'declaration of interest No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Smith Rossdale and Partners, Rossdales Equine Hospital, author email: lewis.smith@rossdales.com Keywords: horse; surgery Relative to other domestic species the equine head isrostrocaudally elongated. In terms of surgical access, the headis highly vascular with many easily injured, but vital structuressuch as salivary ducts, cranial nerves and major arteries.Although the long narrow nature of the equine head makesflexible endoscopy invaluable for examination of the upper respiratory tract, space-occupying lesions such as thosedescribed by Barakzai (2017) and Bolz et al. (2017) make passage of an endoscope impossible. The superimposition ofstructures in the equine head means that radiographicexamination may be unrewarding, confusing or frustrating. Asdemonstrated by these two case reports computertomographic examination of the equine head is invaluable toallow accurate de nition of surgical lesions and the planning of novel surgical solutions (Barakzai 2017; Bolz et al. 2017). The nasal passages cavities divided by the nasal septum. These cavities extend for between 20 -30 cm and are divided into four narrow meatuses by two nasalconchae. Dorsal and ventral and meatus. The via the external nares. aspectof nares leads to the blind-ended diverticulumwithin the nasoincisive notch. The shape of the dorsolateralaspect of the nares is given by the alar cartilages. the external nares when exercising (Holcombe and Ducharme2008). At the caudal aspect of the nasal passages the paranasal sinuses drain via a collection of conduits into themiddle meatus via the nasomaxillary drainage angle. Thenasolacrimal duct runs from the medial canthus of the eye ina rostral direction to an opening about 5 cm from theentrance of the nostrils. The opening lies on the ventralaspect of the external nares in horses and into the dorsalaspect of the nostril in donkeys. Dividing the two maxillary sinuses the infraorbital canal fuses with the medial wall of the rostral maxillary sinus andborders the lateral margin of the middle meatus. Access to the rostral 10 cm of the nasal passages is usually straightforward, either via the external nares or byincision into the lateral alae of the external nares. The caudalaspect of the nasal passages can be accessed via anendoscope passed up the contralateral nasal passage andretro flexed in the nasophaynx or access gained via a surgical approach through the conchofrontal sinus or ventromedialdorsal conchal sinus. Surgical access to the 'middle third 'of the nasal passages is more dif cult. The nasal bone is the origin of the levator nasolabilais which then tranverses ventrorostally over the maxillary levator labiisuperioris originates between the maxillary and lacrimal bones and runs along the bones lateral margin. Other than these freely mobile muscles, there is only skin overlying the nasal bone, making a bone flap an attractive option. The ventral margins of the flap are bordered by the nasolacrimal duct and infraorbital nerve before it exits from the infraorbital foramen ( Fig 1 ). As long as these two structures are avoided, the description of a 'rhinotomy 'or'direct approach 'using a dorsally-hinged bone flap is an elegant solution for removal of lesions in this region.

Smyth, A. L. Allenand J. L. Carmalt* Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan; andDepartment of Veterinary Pathology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, disease (DJD) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) have been reported infrequently, with the majority of cases describing the disease as a consequence of an earlier traumatic event. A case of clinically signi cant TMJ-DJD due to a nontraumatic event has not been published. This retrospective case report describes a case of bilateral, DJD of the TMJ. Case management, subsequent review and interpretation of the clinical records, tangential radiographic views of each TMJ, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, and post mortem histological examination of the TMJs were performed. The horse exhibited both quidding and a 'clicking 'sound during mastication; episodes of intermittent colic were also prevalent in the horse 's history. Computed tomography illustrated bilateral mineralisation of the rostral aspect of both intra-articular discs. Treatment, by intra- articular injection of corticosteroid, resulted in temporaryresolution of both the quidding and the 'clicking 'sound, as well as the recurrent episodes of colic. Repeated treatment over time was required. Ultimately the horse was subjected to euthanasia for reasons other than disease of the TMJ. The development of TMJ-DJD may not be con ned to traumatic events. Age-related degeneration of this joint may occur and manifest through quidding and abnormal sounds noted during mastication. Introduction Degenerative joint disease (DJD) or osteoarthritis of the equine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is an infrequently recognised and studied condition. The cause and clinical signi cance of TMJ-DJD have yet to be fully understood. Due to the nondescript signs, it is possible that cases of TMJ-DJD are either missed or incorrectly diagnosed (May et al. 2001; Rodriguez et al. 2010). The diagnostic methods of choice for this nebulous disease include physical examination, palpation, arthrocentesis, and medical imaging, for which only the latter 2 have been consistently reported as generating useful diagnostic information. Clinical presentations include problems during mastication (dysphagia, or quidding, i.e. dropping food from the mouth), behavioural issues such as ghting the bit or changes in head carriage, and occasionally head-shaking (Warmerdam et al. 1997; Weller et al. 2002; Carmalt and Wilson al. 2005; Barnett 2014; Jorgensen al. 2014). maydevelop masseter muscles, bony enlargement the TMJ, weight loss and dental malocclusions (Baker 2002; Nagy and Simhofer 2006). The small size of the joint space and the complexity of overlapping anatomic structures in the equine head can complicate the interpretation of radiographs of the TMJ (Wyn-Jones 1985). As such, newer (tangential and rostral 45 \u00b0ventral-caudodorsal oblique), projections of this region have recently been described (Ramzan et al. 2008; Ebling et al. 2009; Townsend et al. 2009). Even with these new techniques, the incident angle will have to be perfect to enable visualisation of small, but possibly important irregularities in the joint due to its undulant surface (Rodriguez et al. 2010). Ultrasound has been used with some success, but the information gained is limited to the lateral and super cial aspects of the joint (Rodriguez et al. 2007). The combination of nonspeci c clinical signs and the insidious onset of DJD may confound equine veterinarians and frustrate owners, preventing advanced diagnostic imaging(computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) from being performed. In both horses and people, a common cause of TMJ-DJD is trauma, which can lead to fracture of the mandibular condyle, disrupting the articular surface (May et al. 2001; Carmalt and Wilson 2005; Rodriguez et al. 2010; He et al. 2013). A putative link between equine TMJ disease and dental malocclusion has been made, but remains unsubstantiated (May 1996). To the authors 'knowledge, this report is the rst to describe degenerative changes of the TMJ that are unrelated to any known trauma, or sepsis. Instead it follows a pattern of disease and response to treatment commonly seen in appendicular joints with DJD. Case history An 18-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse mare was referred tothe Veterinary Medical Center at the Western College ofVeterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, because of colic. The mare had a history of intermittent colic episodes spanning 7 years, with 8 episodes occurring over the last year alone. Over the previous 3 years, the mare had also been examined multiple times for behavioural issues, reportedly quidding, becoming very agitated and dif cult to ride. The horse had developed a hypersensitivity to touch on the right hand side of its face, headshaking and ghting the bit during riding. At the onset of adverse reaction to being touched an ophthalmic examination had been performed, revealing mild incipient cataracts and a 'nonophthalmic 'sensitivity to the \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd72 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017periocular region of the right side, but no other ocular cause of the apparent discomfort exhibited by the mare. On presentation for colic, the horse had lost approximately 60 kg over the previous year. The owner noted that the horse, while masticating, would emit an audible clicking noise often dropping feed (quidding) as she ate. Neither of these abnormalities was noted at the time of admission for colic. The horse was also reported to have been off feed for the entire day, and passing looser than normal faeces. Assessment of vital parameters revealed a heart rate of 42 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min and a rectal temperature of 38 \u00b0C. The mucous membranes were pink and moist and the capillary re ll time was noted as <3 s. Packed cell volume and total protein were 35% and 66 g/l, respectively. Rectal examination revealed no abnormal ndings. Diagnosis The presenting bout of colic was tentatively diagnosed as being caused by a large colon impaction and treated by the administration of water (5 l), mineral oil (2 l) and electrolyte powder via a nasogastric tube, which required intravenous sedation of the horse using a combination of xylazine injection)3. Following resolution of the colic symptoms, a complete oral examination was performed. Focal overgrowths (hooks) were present on the rostral aspect of the 106 and 206 teeth as were slight overgrowths on the lingual aspect of the mandibular cheek teeth and the buccal aspect of the maxillary cheek teeth. The incisors were in normal occlusion and mandibular excursion to the left and right was normal. Odontoplasty was performed, which did not subsequently alter the behavioural issues during riding, or the sensitivity to touch on the right hand side of the face. Standard radiographic (dorsal-ventral, lateral and oblique)views of the head, including speci c tangential projections of the TMJs, were performed (Townsend et al. 2009). No abnormalities of the soft tissue, bony, sinonasal, or dental structures (including the TMJs), were found. Despite the absence of palpable joint effusion ultrasound examination of the joint was performed and no abnormalities were detected. A CT (Aquilion 16)4examination of the head, using 1 mm slices, was performed under general anaesthesia. This examination showed osteophytosis of the medial aspect of the mandibular condyles in the region of the insertion of the medial pterygoid muscles, as well as the presence of two distinct regions of soft tissue mineralisation within the rostral aspect of both intra-articular discs ( Fig 1 ). The mineralisation of the articular disc of the left TMJ was 11 9695 mm in size (mediolateral by dorsoventral by rostrocaudal dimensions) whereas the right was 10 9695 mm. The left TMJ showed mild subchondral bone sclerosis on the medial aspect of the mandibular condyle and osteophytosis on the lateral aspect of the zygomatic process of the left temporal bone. No evidence of fracture or subluxation of either mandibular condyle was noted. Treatment Following CT, an arthrocentesis of each TMJ was performed, a synovial fluid sample obtained, and each joint injected with 60 mg of methylprednisolone acetate (Depomedrol)5. The choice of intra-articular medication was based on the presumptive need for long-term therapy, which would be afforded by this steroid choice. Both synovial fluid samples were placed in EDTA tubes, despite which they clotted and were unsuitable for laboratory analysis. Local analgesia was not performed to localise the clinical signs further because the clicking sound and quidding during mastication were not present at the time of examination making the diagnosis of a 'positive 'block impossible to determine. a) b) c) Fig 1: A computed tomographic series of images (a: transverse, b: dorsal and planes) of increased linear attenuation suggestive of mineralised tissue (arrow) in the rostral aspect of the intra-articular disc of the right temporomandibular jointof an 18-year-old Tennessee Walking horse mare. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd73 a) b) c)EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017Outcome The owner was contacted one week post injection; the head shaking, masticatory clicking and quidding had ceased. Communication with the owner indicated that the horse had regained the weight lost over the previous year and there were no further reports of episodic colic. Ten months post injection, the episodes of colic, quidding and the masticatory click had returned. Additionally, the horse had become ataxic (in the owner 's opinion). At this time, a second injection of the intra-articular corticosteroids was administered (60 mg methylprednisolone acetate5). A neurological examination by the attending veterinarian was inconclusiveand did not differentiate between 'true 'ataxia and weakness. The response to intra-articular treatment was shortlived, lasting approximately 4 months and no improvement inthe 'ataxia 'was seen following treatment. At the end of 4 months, the horse refused to eat and became recumbent.At this point, due to the poor prognosis, the owner elected tosubject the horse to euthanasia. Post mortem ndings A full post mortem examination was performed by the attending pathologist, but failed to nd any abnormality in the gastrointestinal tract or the spinal cord to account for the colic episodes or signs of ataxia. The TMJs were not opened for gross examination as this would have destroyed the integrity of the joints. Instead the head (and brain) were subjected to MRI (Siemens MAGNETOM Symphony)6and subsequently frozen. proton were performed and con rmed the CT ndings regarding the presence of themineralised portion of the intra-articular disc ( Fig 2 ). No abnormalities of the brain could be seen. The skull, including the TMJs was then sectioned in the sagittal plane, into multiple 4 -5 mm thick slabs, using a bandsaw. Sections were xed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalci ed in 20% formic acid, and routinely processed (i.e. embedded in paraf n, cut at 4 lm, mounted on glass slides, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and cover slipped, for routine microscopic examination).

Fig 4: A large focus of chondro-osseous metaplasia at the attachment of the intra-articular disc to the joint capsule of theleft temporomandibular AE / FEBRUARY 2017histological sections of both TMJs, by a consulting veterinary pathologist (A.L.A.), revealed similar changes in each. There were foci of chondroid metaplasia within the body of intra- and foci of chondro-osseous metaplasia of the intra-articular disc at the attachment to the joint capsule (Figs 3, 4 and 5 ). The articular cartilage of both the mandibular fossa of the temporal bone and the condylar process of the mandible exhibited extensive degenerative changes. There was a general decrease in basophilic staining of the extracellular matrix, interpreted to be a loss of proteoglycan, a decrease in the number of chondrocytes, which was dramatic in some areas ( Fig 6 ) and many clustersor clones of chondrocytes, also referred to as chondrones (Fig 7 ). Discussion The most common cause of TMJ disease, in both man and horses, is trauma (Hurtig et al. 1984; Patterson et al. 1989; Leighty et al. 1993; Warmerdam et al. 1997; He et al. 2013). In horses, these injuries often occur in combination with fracture, subluxation, or both, of the mandibular condyle and subsequent sepsis through the introduction of bacteria into the joint space or surrounding tissue (Barber et al. 1985; Patterson et al. 1989; Warmerdam et al. 1997; Weller Wilson 2005; Nagy and Simhofer 2006; Barnett et al. 2014). In the present case, there was no history or evidence to suggest trauma. CT examination revealed bilateral mineralisation of the intra-articular discs and periarticular osteophyte formation. The failure of the radiographs to highlight the presence of the osteophytoses seen on CT, emphasises the utility of using advanced imaging techniques (MRI and CT). In order to adequately visualise these small changes radiographically, a very precise angle would have been required. Even the smallest variation would create overlap, obscuring the bony projections from view. Medial osteophytosis has been noted in other, older horses by the senior author (J.L.C.), but osteophytosis of thelateral aspect of the joint is not common. A few reports postulating the link between dental pathology (speci cally pertaining to incisors) and equine TMJ disease have been published, but the causal relationship has yet to be determined (May 1996; Carmalt et al. 2003; Carmalt 2014). The horse in this report showed little evidence to suggest that dental disease was the cause, or the sequelae, of TMJ-DJD. Historical oral examinations performed at the time of diagnosis of TMJ-DJD yielded little beyond that noted in the majority of horses undergoing regular oral examination. The clinical signs that accompany cases of TMJ-DJD, while subtle, are paramount to understanding the extent of its effect on a horse 's overall health. The chewing motion inFig 5: A large focus of chondro-osseous metaplasia at the synovial surface of the intra-articular disc, at the attachment tothe joint capsule, of the right temporomandibular joint.

There is a generalised decrease inbasophilic staining of the surface cartilage, interpreted as loss ofproteoglycan, and a dramatic decrease in the mandibular fossa of thetemporal bone. There are many clusters or ofchondrocytes, referred to as AE / FEBRUARY 2017horses has been theorised to act like an auger, with each piece of feed given a single opportunity to pass over a grinding surface (Collinson 1994). Once passed, the tongue and palatine ridges, act as a one way conduit to direct feed toward the back of the oral cavity. Episodes of quidding are suggested to be a failure of the auger-like action of the mouth, to grind the feed down to a size manageable for swallowing. As a result, the horse rejects the feed to prevent choking. If pain is associated with the chewing process, the horse may try to reduce the overall number of chewing cycles, leading to larger particles of feed at the back of the oral cavity. Together with the loss of feed through excessive quidding, the pain of mastication may have been suf cient to prevent this horse from eating as readily, leading to the weight loss appreciated in physical examination. It may also be argued that the recurrent episodes of colic could have been related to inef cient or ineffective mastication that, in turn, may have predisposed the horse to large colon impaction colic. While an attractive theory, previous published work looking at the effect of dental pathology on faecal particle size in horses with large colon impaction does not support this argument (Carmalt and Allen 2006; Gunnarsdottir et al. 2014). It is possible that well-nourished horses have the privilege of being more selective in their forage choice and despite oral or TMJ pain, continue to chew their feed, whereas horses that are malnourished may be more ravenous, swallowing the feed that is not properlyprocessed. Headshaking during riding has been reported as a clinical sign associated with diseases of the TMJ (May et al. 2001; Devine et al. 2005). The use of a bit in the mouth of the horse allows rider control by placing pressure on the mandible, pulling it in the caudal direction (Cook 1999; Geyer and Weishaupt 2006). In the 'collected 'position (neck flexion), the mandible must slide forward. It is possible that in flammation in the TMJs will create pain during these times and manifest asheadshaking (Geyer and Weishaupt 2006). It is extremelyimportant to note that the correlation between TMJ diseaseand impaction colic or headshaking or even the presence ofdental disease is speculative as there are no data to supportthese associations at present. The cause of the ataxia, and ultimately recumbency, remains obscure. While MRI imaging of the brain did notreveal any abnormalities, it is recognised that subtle brainlesions, especially without the use of contrast, can remainundiagnosed. As such, a complete histological examinationof this anatomical structure is the gold standard. Theaetiology of the ataxia and repeated colic episodes couldnot be found. In retrospect, it is possible that the clinicalsigns interpreted as colic were actually the manifestation ofan anorexic horse that had the urge to eat but could notopen its mouth, due to pain. It is also possible that the'ataxia 'was truly weakness associated with weight-loss and an inability to eat effectively. It is suspected that a combination of age, prolonged anorexia, depression and weakness ultimately led to the horse becoming recumbent. In reality, however, these justi cations remain conjecture on the part of the authors. The histological examination of the TMJs gave de nitive evidence of degeneration of the articular cartilage andintra-articular discs in this horse in the absence of sepsis. These ndings correlate with the clinical history of adegenerative joint and the need for repeated intermittent intra-articular medications to ameliorate the apparent discomfort exhibited by the horse. The problem is that the literature contains no evidence supporting age-related degeneration of the equine TMJ as occurs in other joints. It is possible that the horse in the present report had normal age- related TMJ degeneration associated with 'wear and tear 'of the joint and concurrent pain from a local region that was mitigated by diffusion of the steroid from the joint following injection. Work is currently underway to further investigate therelationship between age and histological evidence of DJD in the equine TMJ. In conclusion, the authors report the investigation and treatment of bilateral TMJ-DJD of an aged horse that responded to intra-articular medication in a manner akin to other appendicular joints.

Transcutaneous abdominalultrasonography revealed a cavitary, thick walled, mass-likelesion that appeared continuous with the small intestine. Thethick walls of the mass-like lesion were of heterogeneousechogenicity with hyperechoic foci extending from thehyperechoic luminal surface to within the wall and there wasloss of normal wall layering. These ndings were con rmed grossly at exploratory celiotomy and histopathological examination of affected tissues con rmed lymphoma. The ultrasound ndings facilitated a preoperative presumptive diagnosis that allowed informed decision-making and aided case management. Case history A 21-year-old retired New Forest pony mare presented forevaluation of intermittent lethargy and colic of approximately3 weeks 'duration. The mare had demonstrated infrequent (<5), short-lived ( <24 h duration) episodes of lethargy during the preceding year but the severity and frequency of the lethargic episodes had increased in the preceding few weeks. Clinical ndings On presentation, the mare was depressed and in poor bodycondition but vital signs were within normal limits. Nasogastricintubation yielded 3 l of net re flux. Abdominocentesis was attempted but no fluid was obtained. Rectal examination revealed the presence of multiple loops of distended smallintestine and a painful mass (approximately 15 cm diameter)in the right caudoventral abdomen. Serum biochemistry and routine haematology were performed. Pertinent abnormalities included increased serumactivities of urea (10.6 mmol/l; RR 2.8 -7.3 mmol/l) g/l; considered consistent with flammation. Diagnosis Transcutaneous B mode abdominal ultrasonography (LogiqP5/A5/A5Pro) 1with an electronic curved array (convex) probe with a frequency range of 1.5 -4.6 MHz was performed and con rmed the presence of several loops of moderately distended (approximately 5 cm diameter) hypomotile smallintestine. Additionally, a 15 cm diameter cavitary mass-like lesion was noted in the right ventral abdomen ( Fig 1 ). The mass-like lesion predominantly hypoechoic centre containing small hyperechoic motile foci consistent with luminal contents of small intestine (hypoechoic fluid with motile hyperechoic foci of ingesta and gas). In the longitudinal plane, the hypoechoic centre appeared continuous with small intestinal luminal contents. The walls of the mass-like lesion were irregularly thickened (up to 4.5 cm) and of heterogeneous echogenicity, including hyperechoic foci extending from the hyperechoic luminal surface to within the wall and there was loss of normal wall layering ( Fig 2 ). Treatment and outcome A routine exploratory celiotomy was performed undergeneral anaesthesia. Distended loops of small intestine wereevident immediately on abdominal exploration. A rm but compressible approximately 18 cm diameter mass associatedwith the jejunum was exteriorised ( Fig 3 ). The mass was con rmed to be an abnormal focal patent dilatation of the jejunum. At the focal jejunal dilatation, there were 2 areas ofoff-white coloured serosal surface with grey peripheries andthere was patchy adherence of omentum to the serosalsurfaces. An additional approximately 11 cm diametersimilarly appearing rm but compressible jejunal dilatation was also identi ed approximately 1 m oral to the rst abnormality identi ed. There were multiple variably sized (0.5 - 5 cm diameter) nodular masses within the mesentery of the area of the jejunal dilatations. The remainder of the abdomen was evaluated and no gross abnormalities were identi ed. The horse was subjected to euthanasia humanely under general anaesthesia in light of the suspicion of neoplasia with local metastases that were not amenable to resection. The affected area of jejunum was removed post mortem and examined. There was marked thickening and loss of normal mural layering at both areas of jejunal dilatation. Areas of the mucosal surface were discoloured and necrotic and there were diverticula lled with the aspect of the jejunal dilatations ( Fig 4 ). The masses within the mesentery appeared grossly as lymphoidtissue with caseous centres. Histopathological examination of samples of the affected and nonaffected small intestine and mesenteric masses wasperformed; no other organ samples were submitted forhistopathological examination. At the abnormal areas ofjejunum, normal mural structure was obliterated by clustersand sheets of neoplastic round cells ( Fig 5 ), with areas of \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd78EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017necrosis and abundant degenerate neutrophilic in ltration. Although no normal mucosa was present, bacterialcolonisation was extensive at the luminal side of the intestineand in places extended into the mass. The mesentericmasses were consistent with lymph nodes in ltrated by neoplastic round cells. Neoplastic cells were also noted toinltrate adjacent connective tissue representing local metastases. The jejunum distant (minimum 60 cm) from themasses appeared unaffected.No evidence of metachromatic granules was evident on staining with toluidine blue making a diagnosis of mast cell tumour unlikely. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to further characterise the neoplastic round cells. The neoplastic cells were diffusely positive for CD3, consistent with a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma. Scattered clusters of Pax-5 positive cells (in ltrating B lymphocytes) and numerous HLA-DR and lysozyme positive cells (inltrating macrophages) were also present throughout the section. Discussion Although the 5 wall layers of the small intestine (mucosalinterface, mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa) are Fig 2: Transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound image (2 MHz frequency probe) of a cavitary mass-like within the right ventralabdomen. There are hyperechoic foci within the wall of the cavitarymass (white arrowheads) and the luminal surface is hyperechoicand irregularly thickened (white rimmed arrowheads). White arrowsmark the serosal surface. The predominantly hypoechoic centre of the mass-like lesion communicated with luminal contents of ultrasonographically normal small intestine.

In this case, the gross asymmetrical thickening of the wall was readily identi ed ultrasonographically as were the echogenicity changeswithin the wall. The irregular hyperechogenicities at themucosal surface extending into the wall were consistent withthe gross identi cation of necrosis (Navas de Solis et al. 2012). Grossly, mucosal ulceration, possibly with necrotic centres, has previously been noted in horses with lymphoma (Roberts and Pinsent 1975; Wilson et al. 1985; Herraez et al. 2001; Pinkerton et al. 2002; Sanz et al. 2010). Hyperechogenicities within the small intestinal wall have been noted in horses with clostridial enteritis due to necrosis and gas formation (Reef 1998) and foals with necrotising gastrointestinal disease (Navas de Solis et al. 2012). Additionally, wider, more organised linear hyperechoicdefects in the bowel wall have been noted in a horse with a pseudodiverticulum (Navas de Solis et al. 2014). Thickening and echogenicity changes could not be identi ed on ultrasound images in a speci c wall layer in this case; however, on gross and histopathological examination, there was marked disruption of the normal small intestinal layering that would have precluded ultrasonographic differentiation of the layers. Ultrasonographic abnormalities of speci c wall layers have aided diagnosis of some conditions in horses including muscularis hypertrophy (Dechant et al. 2008). The focal, asymmetric increased thickness of the bowel wall was considered compatible with in ltrative bowel disease such as focal enteritis or neoplasia (Platt 1987). The marked focal dilatation that altered the small intestinal diameter was considered more likely to be compatible with neoplasia. Lymphoma is the most common neoplasia recognised in the equine intestine (Taylor et al. 2006). When recognised in the gastrointestinal system, lymphoma may bealimentary in origin or may be noted as a component ofmulticentric or generalised disease. However, it may bedifcult to differentiate between the 2 disease forms. Alimentary lymphoma accounts for 19% of all equinelymphoma diagnosed (Taylor et al. 2006). Horses with alimentary lymphoma tend to be older with a mean age of 16 years (Taylor et al. 2006) compatible with this case. Lymphoma is more commonly identi ed in the small intestine compared with the large intestine and clinical signs vary depending on whether the lesions are diffusely in ltrative (weight loss and small intestinal malabsorption) or focal intestinal or mesenteric masses (weight loss and abdominal pain) or combinations of lesions (Taylor et al. 2006). Focal lesions are more common in older horses as seen in this case (Taylor et al. 2006). Pseudodiverticula have been previously identi ed grossly in horses with lymphoma (Mair et al. 2011). Although these pseudodiverticula measured up to 10 cm diameter they were not identi ed ultrasongraphically (Mair et al. 2011). The lesion in this case may have represented a pseudodiverticulum dened as a mucosal outpouching through the muscularis but the circumferential loss of structure and increase in diameter is suggestive of a focal intestinal dilatation. Additionally, pseudodiverticula recognised in horses with lymphoma have been noted on the antimesenteric border attributed to the location of the Peyer 's patches (Mair et al. 2011) in contrast to this lesion which affected the intestine circumferentially. Denition of the mass-like lesion, identi cation of mesenteric involvement and diagnosis of the smaller mass may have been improved with transrectal ultrasonography. Transrectal ultrasongraphy avoids the transmission ofultrasound waves through the retroperitoneal fat, may decrease the necessary depth of penetration and can be achieved with higher frequency transducers compared to transcutaneous ultrasonography (Navas de Solis et al. 2014). Transrectal ultrasonography was not utilised in this case as it was considered unlikely to alter case management but has been utilised to identify muscular hypertrophy and pseudodiverticula (Navas de Solis et al. 2014). Ultrasonography of this case revealing a small intestinal mass compatible with lymphoma contributed to informed client decision-making regarding the treatment. Ante mortem diagnosis of cases with intestinal neoplasia has been reported in up to 38% of cases utilising abdominal ultrasonography, peritoneal fluid cytology and surgical biopsy (Taylor et al. 2006). With the increasing availability of diagnostic ultrasound machines in veterinary medicine with new technological features that improve image quality (O'Brien and Holmes 2007), the importance of equine abdominal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of abdominal disorders is likely to rise further.

Feige and B. Ohnesorge Clinic for Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Foundation, Hannover, referred for evaluationof headshaking to the Clinic for Horses, University of VeterinaryMedicine Hannover. Based on clinical signs and computedtomography -as well as magnetic resonance imaging - ndings, otitis media was diagnosed. Medical treatment including trimethoprim potentiated sulfadimethoxine andmeloxicam for 3 weeks did not result in cessation of clinicalsigns. Therefore, the tympanic cavity was openedtransendoscopically using an Nd:YAG-laser via the gutturalpouch according to surgical procedures in human and smallanimal medicine, leading to a considerable improvement ofclinical signs. Introduction The term 'otitis media 'is used to describe an in flammatory process of the middle ear. It occurs infrequently in horses and develops slowly. In an early stage of disease, headshaking orheadtossing can be a predominant clinical sign (Blythe 1997). Recommended treatment for otitis media in horses is a long- term application of antimicrobials and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ampicillin, potentiated sulfa drugs or cephalosporins may be selected. In cases of involvement of bony structures such as temporohyoid osteoarthropathy, a 30-day regimen is advised (Blythe 1997). Surgical management of otitis media in dogs includes myringotomy, flushing of the lateral modi ed ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy for management of otitis media has also been described in an Alpaca (Sumner et al. 2012). In man, mastoiditis, an in flammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid process, is a complication of acute otitis media. Mastoidectomy is indicated, if medical treatment and centesis of otitis media are not successful. The mastoid process is debrided and the tympanic cavity is opened using a retroauricular approach under general anaesthesia (Fickweiler et al. 2007). In horses, this surgical procedure to cure otitis media nonresponsive to medical treatment has not been described in the literature. This report describes the successful treatment of a Warmblood gelding presented with otitis media nonresponsive to medical treatment using a surgical approach according to the procedure of mastoidectomy in human medicine to facilitate lavage and draining of the middle ear.Case history An 8-year-old Warmblood gelding was referred to the Clinicfor Horses, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover,Germany, for evaluation of headshaking. Clinical signs started8 weeks prior to presentation. The horse showed headshakingduring riding, lungeing or hand walking. Modi cation of the tack and the use of a facemask resulted in no improvement.The gelding appeared dull and the owner reported signs offacial pain expression subjectively described as 'migraine-like face '. The horse also showed abnormal behaviour when out at pasture (separation from the herd and waiting at thefence to be let inside the stable). An endoscopy of the upperairway showed no abnormal ndings. Initial treatment with oral meloxicam for 1 week improved headshaking at rst but, after cessation of treatment, clinical signs reappeared. Oral antimicrobials (trimethoprim potentiated sulfonamide) and dexamethasone i.v. were added to the treatment plan by the referring veterinarian, but resulted in no improvement. Clinical ndings On initial presentation, clinical examination was normal;however, after some days the gelding showed an intermittentobtunded mentation. Facial pain expression, reported by theowner as 'migraine-like face ', could be detected during periods of obtundation. The ears were held moderately stif fly and turned backwards, the eyelids were obviously partiallyclosed, comparable to a horse grimace scale for pain assessment (Dalla Costa et al. 2014) of 3/12. When lunged the gelding showed vertical headshaking and rubbing of the nose on the ground consistent with a headshaking grade following a 0 -3 point scale (Roberts et al. 2016) of 2/3. Use of a facemask and nosecover resulted in no improvement.Endoscopy of the upper respiratory tract including theguttural pouches and ophthalmic examination were normal.Examination of the oral cavity showed low grade hooks andramps of the molar teeth, which were corrected understanding sedation. Endoscopy of the external ear canalshowed no signs of mite infection or in flammation, but the distal end of the external ear canal and the tympanicmembrane could not be visualised properly. Clinicalpathology revealed low grade leucopenia (4.5 910 9white blood cells/l, reference range 5.0 -10.09109white blood cells/l), not thought to be clinically signi cant. Radiographs of the skull were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed under general anaesthesia in lateral recumbency with a multislice CT scanner (Brilliance CT - Big isoflurane3in oxygen. The left tympanic cavity was obscured by an opacity without bony erosion of the ear ossicle. Houns eld units were 102, suggestive of a soft-tissue opacity ( Fig 1 ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed during the same general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency with a 3 T (Philips Achieva 3.0T)6MR scanner including T2 Turbo spin echo sequences sagittal and transverse planes, a fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence in transverse planes, and 3D T1 weighted sequences. In the left tympanic cavity, a well de ned increased signal intensity in both T1 and T2 weighted images could be detected ( Fig 2 ). Based on the clinical, CT and MRI ndings, left sided otitis media was diagnosed. Treatment Based on the diagnosis of otitis media the mg/kg bwt s.i.d.) for 3 weeks. Because clinical signs did not improve sufciently, the horse was readmitted about 2 weeks after discharge. Although the owner reported an initial slight improvement at home, facial pain score (grade 3/12) (Dalla Costa et al. 2014) and headshaking (grade 2/3) (Roberts et al. 2016) were unchanged at readmission. CT showed no improvement in comparison to the prior CT images. CT andendoscopic examination showed a perforated tympanic membrane. The tympanic cavity was therefore lavaged under general anaesthesia (protocol described above) with sterile saline via the external ear canal into the guttural pouch using an 8 gauge Catheter (Equicath)5. During this procedure, the fluid could be endoscopically observed flowing into the guttural pouch. Further CT during the same general anaesthesia revealed a reduction in size of the soft tissue opacity in the tympanic bulla after flushing and the used saline contained some plaques. The horse received cefquinome 1.1 mg/kg bwt s.i.d.) for 9 days. As this procedure did not result in an improvement of clinical signs, a second lavage of the tympanic cavity under general anaesthesia was performed 6 weeks later but resulted neither in an improvement of clinical signs nor of the CT ndings seen directly after lavage. According to surgical procedures in human (mastoidectomy) and small animal medicine (lateral or ventral osteotomy of the tympanic cavity) the tympanic cavity was and opened a 8100) 10via ). The location for the laser procedure had previously been determined during the CT after marking the region of presumptive incision site with a metal endoscopic biopsy device in the guttural pouch. The guttural pouch (Olympus HD)11and incised at the region of interest with a 600 lm Nd:YAG-laser bre. A bare bre in a noncontact procedure (40 impulses, 8 W, lasting 2 s) was Fig 1: Transverse CT image of the head at the level of the ears.

This was followed by 40 impulses lasting 1 s with a power of 15 Wusing a contact procedure to penetrate the bony structures(Fig 3b ). To extend the created opening further, 60 impulses lasting 1 s with 10 W were applied. During the procedure,lavage of the tympanic bulla with sterile saline via externalear canal into the guttural pouch was possible. At the end ofthe procedure, the created opening allowed inspection ofthe inside of the tympanic bulla ( Figs 3c and 4). Post of cefquinome (Cobactan 91 mg/kg mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.) for 5 days. The horse also received a continuous rate infusion of lidocaine12(0.05 during the rst 24 h post operation, because of expected severe pain. Anaesthesia and recovery were uneventful. Outcome For the rst 5 days after surgery the horse showed a low grade head tilt to the left side. Despite this, neurologicalexamination was without any abnormal ndings. Twenty-four hours after surgery the horse showed a leucopenia (3.2 910 9/ l). The white blood cell count was within the reference rangethe following day. There was an improvement of clinical signsduring hospitalisation. The horse was bright and alert with nofacial pain expression (horse grimace scale for painassessment [Dalla Costa et al. 2014] of 0/12) could be kept out on pasture and showed only low grade intermittentheadshaking after half an hour of work (headshaking grade[Roberts et al. 2016] of 1/3). The gelding was discharged from the hospital 3 weeks after the surgical procedure. Six monthsafter surgery the horse was on pasture without any signs ofheadshaking, facial pain expression or abnormal behaviour.The horse could be lunged and handwalked withoutheadshaking as reported by the owner. Discussion Otitis media may have 2 distinct clinical presentationsdepending on the stage of disease. In an early stage ofdisease, headshaking or headtossing, resistance to the bit, earrubbing, resentment of manipulation of the head, or pain onpressure at the base of the ear can be the predominantclinical signs (Blythe 1997). Clinical signs of otitis media in amore advanced stage especially when the surrounding bonystructures are affected may include head tilt, nystagmus,falling, circling, ataxia, muzzle deviation, decreasedlacrimation, (Watrous Blythe In the presentedcase, despite the intermittent obtundation and headshaking,none of these clinical signs were present. The improvement ofthe clinical signs while the horse was treated with NSAIDs madethe diagnosis of trigeminal mediated headshaking less likely. The diagnosis of otitis media can be established on the basis of clinical signs, radiographic ndings, endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches and tympanocentesis (Hassel et al. 1995). Endoscopic examination of the guttural pouches is a more sensitive procedure than skull radiography for the detection of early osseous changes of the temporohyoid joint due to otitis media/interna (Hassel et al. 1995). A potential sequela is a a) b) c) Fig 3: a) Endoscopic view of the medial compartment of the left guttural pouch at the beginning of surgery. The laserendoscpicbre points to the region of the tympanic cavity near the temporohyoid joint. The stylohyoid is located on the right side of thepicture. First thermal injuries were set at the region of interest. b)Endoscopic view of the medial compartment of the left gutturalpouch at an advanced stage of surgery with carbonation of the soft tissue and bone. c) Endoscopic view of the medial compartment of the left guttural pouch 1 week after surgery with mucus exudationaround of the the adjacent bony totemporohyoid osteoarthropathy (Blythe 1997). In thepresented case, headshaking and facial pain expression incombination with no abnormalities of the surrounding bonystructures in the endoscopy as well as in CT and MRIexamination, lead to the diagnosis of otitis media. Recommended treatment for otitis media in horses is long-term administration of antimicrobials and NSAIDs.Broadspectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, potentiatedsulfa drugs or cephalosporins may be selected case, treatment with trimethoprim potentiatedsulfadimethoxine 7and meloxicam for 3 weeks followed by a treatment with cefquinome and flunixin meglumine did not result in a suf cient improvement of clinical signs. Trimethoprim potentiated sulfadimethoxine7as a broad spectrum and rst-line anti-infective drug was chosen, because no involvement of bony structures was suspected due to CT and MRI ndings and an oral application over 3 weeks period was preferred. Potentiated sulfonamides were also used in children with chronic active otitis media (van der Veen et al. 2007). A possible limitation of this medical treatment regime is the treatment length. In cases of involvement of bony structures such as temporohyoid osteoarthropathy, a 30-day regimen is advised (Blythe 1997). Tympanocentesis was not performed, therefore culture was not available. CT ndings and endoscopy of the external ear canal suggested a rupture of the tympanic membrane, leading to a contamination of the sample from the external ear. A cephalosporin was used, because it is recommended in literature as an alternative for potentiated sulfa drugs inhorses with otitis media (Blythe 1997) and culture was not available. In human medicine, cephalosporins are recommended if the initial antimicrobial treatment is ineffective (Thomas et al. 2014).Due to the damaged tympanic membrane, lavage of the tympanic cavity with saline via the external ear canal was possible but the horse showed insuf cient improvement of clinical signs. According to the procedures described for man (mastoidectomy) and small animals (lateral or ventral osteotomy of the tympanic bulla) the tympanic cavity of the gelding was opened transendoscopically using an Nd:YAG- laser via the guttural pouch under general anaesthesia to facilitate flushing and draining of the middle ear. In man, mastoidectomy is indicated if medical treatment and centesis were unsuccessful. During human mastoidectomy and osteotomy of the tympanic cavity in alpacas and small animals, an incision of the overlying soft tissue is necessary to reach the tympanic cavity (Sharp 1990; Fickweiler et al. 2007; Sumner et al. 2012). Humans, alpacas and small animals have no guttural pouches, therefore a laserendosopic approach is not possible. The guttural pouch in horses is an extended part of the auditory tube that belongs to the middle ear. It connects the tympanic cavity to the pharynx, providing pressure equalisation and drainage of secretion from the middle ear (Wissdorf et al. 2010). In this case, laserendoscopic treatment was chosen because the guttural pouch provides a direct approach to the tympanic cavity and soft tissue structures (skin, nerves and vessels) can be protected from unnecessary damage. Possible complications described in human medicine after mastoidectomy include facial paresis, vertigo, deafness,meningitis and brain abscess (Cody et al. 1964; Fickweiler et al. 2007). Facial nerve paralysis occurs in 10 -15% of dogs with lateral osteotomy of the tympanic bulla and may be temporary or permanent (Mason et al. 1988). Opening the middle ear into the guttural pouch might also result in exposure to pathogens from the upper respiratory tract resulting in recurrent infection of the tympanic cavity. However, in the presented case, anaesthesia and recovery as well as the follow-up period of 3 weeks in hospital were, despite a low grade head tilt and leucopenia, uneventful. Nevertheless, the complications in human and veterinary medicine mentioned above could be conceivable after this described intervention in horses. A limitation of this case report is the follow-up period, because the outcome 6 months after surgery is only a subjective evaluation by the owner. In conclusion, this is the rst report in literature of a laserendoscopic approach to open the tympanic cavity using an Nd:YAG-laser via guttural pouch under general anaesthesia for treatment of otitis media in a horse. Further studies are required to evaluate this technique even in the standing, sedated horse for treatment of otitis media, which is resistant to medical treatment.

Theseverity of the clinical signs varies widely, and depends onwhich structures are involved and the extent of the defect. Inmost cases, affected horses present with abnormal respiratorynoise during exercise and poor performance. Manifestation ofthe disease in foals is very rare. This case report describes anunusual presentation of ELD in a neonatal foal. The foalpresented with severe respiratory distress and dysplasia was suspected on endoscopy andlater con rmed on post mortem examination of the larynx. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst report describing ELD as a cause of respiratory distress in a neonatal foal. Introduction The extrinsic and intrinsic structures of the larynx develop fromthe fourth and sixth branchial arches, respectively (Hast 1972).Hypoplasia or aplasia of acongenital syndrome equine laryngeal dysplasia (ELD)(Barakzai 2016), also known as cricopharyngeal-laryngealdysplasia (Dixon et al. 1993), or, if only the fourth branchial arch is affected, fourth branchial arch defect (4-BAD) (Lane2001; Smith and Mair 2009; Men /C19endez et al. 2013). Structures derived from the fourth branchial arch include the thyroid cartilage, cricothyroid articulation, and sphincter muscles). or dysplasia of some or all of the above-mentioned structures may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, the right side being more frequentlyaffected than the left (Lane 2001). Laryngeal dysplasia has been diagnosed in various breeds including Thoroughbreds (Dixon et al. 1993; Lane 2001; Garrett et al. 2009), Hanovarians (Klein et al. 1989), Purebred Spanish Horses (Men /C19endez et al. 2013), Welsh Ponies (Smith and Mair 2009), Tennessee Walking Horses and American Saddlebred Horses (Garrett et al. 2009). There is a large variation in the severity of clinical signs depending upon the structures affected. Based on a large case study in mature horses, the most common clinical sign is exercise-induced respiratory noise and, in more severely affected cases, abnormal respiratory noise can also be detected at rest (Lane 2001). Additionally, poor performance, chronic eructation due to aerophagia, mild dysphagia, nasal discharge, coughing and repeated tympanic colic have been reported (Dixon et al. 1993; Lane 2001; Smith and Mair2009; Cou \u20acetil and Hawkins 2013; Men /C19endez et al. 2013). Due to the nature of the clinical signs, the majority of cases of ELD are diagnosed in mature horses (Lane 2001). This case report describes an atypical presentation of ELD in a neonatal foal that was characterised by severerespiratory distress immediately after birth. Case details Clinical history A 12-hour-old American Standardbred foal was presented tothe University of Helsinki Equine Teaching Hospital with ahistory of weakness, apathy, respiratory distress andrecumbency since birth. Pregnancy and parturition werenormal. Clinical ndings On presentation the foal was lethargic and was without asuckling re flex. On physical examination the mucous membranes were bright pink with a mildly delayed capillaryrell time and a rectal temperature of 38.0 \u00b0C. The heart and respiratory rates were 126 beats/min and 20 breaths/min,respectively. The respiratory distress was characterised byflared nostrils, paradoxical motion of the rib cage, extended neck and head posture, and inspiratory stridor, and wassuggestive of an upper airway obstruction. Lung sounds werepronounced on thoracic auscultation, and inspiratorycrackles could be heard over the right and left hemithoraces. A venous blood sample was obtained on admission and submitted for a blood culture, blood gas analysis, completeblood count and serum biochemistry. The results of thecomplete blood count revealed mild Serum biochemistry hypoglycaemia (4.7 mmol/l; 12.4 mmol/l), and blood gas analysis revealed hypoxaemia, hypercapnia and a severe mixed acidosis 9.0 mmol/l). Resting endoscopy of the upper respiratory was performed, and oedema of the arytenoid cartilages, dorsal displacement of soft palate, detected ( Figs 1 and 2). The endoscopic ndings were characteristic of laryngeal dysplasia and palpation of thelarynx con rmed a palpable gap on the right side of the larynx between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. Furtherante mortem diagnostics to con rm the diagnosis were not performed due to cost limitations. Treatment and outcome On admission, an intravenous catheter was placed in the leftjugular vein and fluid therapy was instituted (lactated Ringer 's 120 ml/kg bwt/day and glucose received supplemental oxygen via nasal insuf flation (10 l/ min). Despite intensive treatment, the foal remaineddepressed and without a suckling re flex. The foal continued to have severe dyspnoea with loud inspiratory crackles on thoracic auscultation. Placement of a temporary tracheostomy tube was discussed with the owners. However, the foal was intended to be used for racing purposes, and because of the poor long-term prognosis as a racehorse, the owner elected to subject the foal to euthanasia on the second day after presentation without further treatment. Post mortem ndings Pulmonary oedema and equine laryngeal dysplasia due toabnormal development of the fourth and sixth branchialarches was con rmed at necropsy. There was no evidence of inhalation pneumonia. On examination of the larynx, the rightwing of the thyroid cartilage was abnormally developedcompared to the left wing ( Fig 3a and c); the thyroid lamina extended dorsally preventing visualisation of the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage on the right side and thecaudal cornu of the thyroid cartilage was aplastic, resulting in a wide space between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages (Fig 3 ). Apart from the hypoplastic articular process, the cricoid cartilage was normal in appearance in all other respects, the position of the cricoid cartilage was normal and there was no rotation present. The extrinsic laryngeal muscles were all normal in appearance except for the hypoplastic right thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscles. Furthermore, the right cricothyroid muscle was absent and the right cricoarytenoideus dorsalis and transverse arytenoideus muscles were hypoplastic ( Fig 3b and d). Due to the grossly abnormal thyroid cartilage, the right cricoarytenoideus lateralis muscle was exposed through the gap between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages ( Fig 3d ). The remaining intrinsic laryngeal muscles, and the hyopharyngeus and stylopharyngeus muscles were normal in appearance and position. Post mortem computed tomography and 3- dimensional modelling of the larynx were also performed in order to characterise the anatomical abnormalities further (Fig 4 ). Discussion In man, the branchial apparatus starts to develop in thefourth week of gestation (Moore et al. 2013). It is comprised of 6 paired pharyngeal (branchial) mesodermal arches, separated from each other by ectodermal and endodermal invaginations, known as the branchial grooves (clefts) and branchial pouches, respectively. Each branchial arch gives rise to speci c arterial, cartilaginous, nervous and muscular derivatives (Moore et al. 2013). The superior laryngeal nerve, the wing of the thyroid cartilage, the cricothyroid articulation, and cricothyroid, thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscles all originate from the fourth branchial arch (Lane 2001; Moore et al. 2013). In horses, it is believed that hypoplasia or aplasia, uni- or bilaterally, of one or more of these structures produces a syndrome called a fourth branchial arch defect (Lane 2001). The intrinsic laryngeal muscles, including the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis and transverse arytenoideus muscles, originate from the sixth branchial arch. When taking into account the pathological changes identi ed in the larynx of the foal in this report, it is likely that both the fourth and sixth branchial arches were affected, prompting a diagnosis of equine laryngeal dysplasia (Garrett et al. 2009; Barakzai 2016).

There are no reports of laryngeal dysplasia in neonatal foals. In human infants, respiratory distress is the most common clinical manifestation of fourth branchial arch anomaly (Nicoucar et al. 2009). In a large case series offourth branchial arch anomalies in human patients, 29 of 45 neonates suffered from respiratory distress on presentation (Nicoucar et al. 2009). Respiratory distress has been associated with a complete fourth brachial stula extending inferiorly into the mediastinum, a large cystic mass with an opening into the pyriform sinus and acute enlargement of a a) b)c) d) Fig 3: Reconstructed models and post mortem specimens illustrating the difference between the normal laryngeal structures on the left side (left) and the abnormal laryngeal structures on the right side of the larynx (right): reconstructed model of the normal laryngealstructures (a), post mortem specimen of the normal laryngeal structures on the left side (b), reconstructed model of the laryngeal structures affected by laryngeal dysplasia on the right side (c), post mortem specimen of the laryngeal structures affected by laryngeal dysplasia on the right side (d).

There was no evidence of any of these malformations in the foal in thisreport and tracheal compression was not detected onendoscopy. The cause of the respiratory distress in this casewas probably due to laryngeal obstruction and secondarynegative pressure pulmonary oedema caused by forcedinspiration against a restricted rima glottis . Many of the laryngeal abnormalities related to ELD in horses can be recognised by endoscopic examination atrest. These include rostral displacement of thepalatopharyngeal arch, uni- or bilateral laryngeal immobility,vocal fold collapse and an open proximal oesophagus(Cou \u20acetil and Hawkins 2013). Although resting endoscopy of the larynx is essential for the evaluation of disorders in theupper respiratory tract; the diagnosis of ELD can also bemade by laryngeal palpation (Lane 2001). The anatomy ofthe larynx in affected horses is typically abnormal, with anenlargement of the cricothyroid space due to atrophy of thecricothyroid muscle and a defect in the wing of the thyroid,either uni- or bilaterally (Cou \u20acetil and Hawkins 2013). In a large study of mature horses, a de nitive nding of 4-BAD was made in 55 of 58 cases by palpation alone (Lane 2001).Ultrasonographic examination is widely used in the diagnosisof laryngeal dysplasia, and provides information about theaffected structures and the severity of the defect (Garrettet al. 2009). Furthermore, unsedated plain lateral radiographs may reveal an air column in the proximal oesophagus,calci cation of the arytenoid cartilages and rostral the palatopharyngeal arch as a soft tissuedensity rostral to the corniculate process (Smith and Mair2009; Men /C19endez et al. 2013). Magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging can be used to provide additional information and permit accurate ante mortem diagnosis of laryngeal dysplasia (Garrett et Transverse computed tomography the level of the muscular processes of the arytenoid cartilage shows abnormal dorsal extension of the laminae of the thyroid cartilage on the affected side whereas with 3-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography images, it is possible to visualise a wide space between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages on the affected side. High-speed treadmill or overground endoscopy can be performed to assess the impact of ELD on performance and to detect dynamic variations of the laryngeal structures (Lane 2001; Davidson et al. 2011). Unfortunately, further diagnostics were not performed in this case as the owners elected euthanasia shortly after endoscopic con rmation of ELD. Respiratory disease is one of the most important causes of death among neonatal foals (Carr 2007). It is essential to differentiate ELD from more common causes of respiratory distress based on a history, full clinical examination and ancillary diagnostic tests. In neonatal foals, prematurity, inadequate colostral transfer, viral and bacterial respiratory infections, systemic in flammatory response syndrome, septic shock, persistent pulmonary hypertension, severe birth asphyxia, fractured ribs, meconium aspiration, aspiration pneumonia due to pharyngeal dysfunction and the other congenital upper respiratory tract abnormalities like subepiglottic or pharyngeal cysts, choanal atresia and tracheal and Divers 2008;Holcombe et al. 2012; Cou \u20acetil and Hawkins 2013). Ancillary diagnostic tests should include arterial blood gas analysis, acomplete blood count, serum biochemistry, blood thoracic radiography, thoracic airway endoscopy and a transtracheal wash submitted for cytology and culture. Care should be taken when considering endoscopy in neonates with respiratory distress, and the foal should be adequately stabilised before this procedure is attempted. In human neonates presented with respiratory distress, laryngoscopy, oesophagoscopy, barium oesophagogram andcomputed tomography of the neck and chest are commonlyperformed to diagnose changes associated with fourthbranchial anomalies. Further studies are needed to estimatethe diagnostic value of these methods in neonatal foalssuffering from respiratory distress associated with ELD. Treatment of this case was symptomatic until the diagnosis was con rmed. Supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal insuf flation is warranted during the initial work-up irrespective of the cause of respiratory distress (Carr 2007). In addition toclinical signs, the results of a blood gas analysis should guidethe oxygen supplementation and, if hypoxaemia is present,nasal oxygen insuf flation should be continued in order to maintain a PaO 2of 60 mmHg or better (Palmer 2005; Carr 2007). In the case of an upper airway obstruction, an emergency tracheotomy is indicated to ensure a patent airway and enable assisted ventilation if required (Lavoie and Divers 2008). For a neonatal foal, tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and a ventilation rate of 10 breaths/min are recommended (Jokisalo and Corley 2014). Moreover, additional therapeutic interventions are based on the results of ancillary diagnostictests, and include among others bronchodilators, surfactant and antimicrobial treatment (Lavoie and Divers 2008). In the human literature, many fourth branchial arch anomalies are managed surgically, including surgical resection of the cyst and endoscopic et al. 2009; Evans et al. 2010; Watson et al. 2013). It is impossible to say whether these methods are applicable in neonatal foals if similar malformations are detected. In mature horses, if surgery is considered, it is essential to evaluate all the affected structures carefully using a high-speed treadmill or overground endoscopy examination to avoid an inappropriate surgical intervention and to differentiate ELD from right laryngeal neuropathy (Lane 2001; Davidson et al. 2011). Because of the severe congenital de cits associated with ELD, prosthetic laryngoplasty has been unsuccessful in the majority of cases (Lane 2001). More positive outcomes have been reported in horses treated with ventriculocordectomy combined with laser thermoplasty of the palatopharyngeal arch or a partial arytenoidectomy (Garrett et al. 2009; Men /C19endez et al. 2013). Additionally, if signi cant axial deviation of aryepiglottic folds is detected during high-speed treadmill endoscopy, aryepiglottic fold resection is indicated (Davidson et al. 2011). A permanent tracheostomy is indicated for noncompeting horses and brood mares if other surgical techniques are not appropriate (Chesen and Rakestraw 2008). Bearing in mind the possible heredity nature of ELD, breeding of affected horses should be considered carefully (Men /C19endez et al. 2013). Severely affected horses are subjected to euthanasia. Consequently, management of ELD should be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account the clinical manifestation of the condition and the intended use of thehorse, as there is no one proven effective surgical cure and treated horses are unlikely to become athletes. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd90 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017In conclusion, ELD is a rare cause of respiratory distress in foals. Endoscopy should be performed on all foals presenting with respiratory distress to rule out congenital defects, however care should be given to stabilise these individuals before endoscopy is carried out. If right-sided laryngeal immobility is detected, ELD should be considered. Palpation of the larynx may also be useful and should be included in the examination. Treatment should only be considered after careful consideration about the intended use of the horse and the extent of the congenital anomalies.

H. Franklinand K. J. Allen* School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, Australia; andEquine Sports Medicine Centre, kate.allen@bristol.ac.uk Keywords: horse; endoscopy; exercise; upper respiratory tract Summary Dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT) obstructions occurcommonly in the equine athlete. During the past 25 years,veterinary diagnostic capabilities have improved greatly withthe ability to perform endoscopy during exercise and thus tovisualise upper airway function during various types ofexercise. After correctly reproducing and diagnosing an URTobstruction, the veterinary surgeon must consider thefunctional signi cance of the endoscopic ndings for that individual athlete. This is the third paper in this series andfocuses on the diagnosis of URT obstructions, their relationshipto the exercise test and their functional signi cance. Introduction Numerous forms of dynamic upper respiratory tract (URT)collapse have now been reported and in many cases (up toapproximately 50%) these are complex in nature, withmultiple structures collapsing concurrently (Kannegieter andDore 1995; Lumsden et al. Dart et et al. 2001; Durando et al. 2002; Parente et al. 2002; Tan et al. 2005; Franklin et al. 2006; Lane et al. 2006a). It is well known that in the majority of horses the URT appears normal during a restingendoscopic examination and the obstruction only becomesevident during exercise (Kannegieter and Dore 1995; Parenteand Martin et Lane et al. 2006b; Barakzai and Dixon 2011; Kelly et al. 2013). During strenuous exercise there are dramatic increases in airflow coupled with large changes in airway pressures within the equine respiratory tract. With increasing speed, minute ventilation increases, from <100 l/min at rest to nearly 2000 l/ min during strenuous exercise and peak air flows of /C670-80 l/s have been recorded (Butler et al. 1993). These high air flows are associated with high airway pressures that are generated primarily by diaphragmatic movement. In other athletic species, e.g. man and greyhounds, a switch to oral breathing during exercise helps to overcome the high resistance to airflow produced by the nasal passages. The horse however is an obligate nasal breather, so the prevalence of dynamic URT obstructions is considerably higher in this species. Computational models have shown that during inhalation the most negative pressures and highest air flow turbulence occur at the floor of the rostral aspect of the nasopharynx and within the larynx (Rakesh et al. 2008). The pharynx and larynx is an area of the upper respiratory tract that requires muscle activity to maintain patency. Therefore it is perhaps not surprising to nd that these are the areas where dynamic airway collapse occurs most commonly. Dynamic collapse ofthe URT is thought to occur when the soft tissue structure(s) are unable to withstand the inspiratory pressures, either as a result of neuromuscular pathology or fatigue or conformational change of the URT musculature. Exercise tests As discussed in the rst article in this series (Allen et al . 2016), exercising endoscopy can be undertaken on a high-speed treadmill or in the eld. There are advantages and disadvantages to both systems. High-speed treadmill exercise testing is well controlled and the exercise can readily be standardised between horses. In some centres, it has been possible for additional respiratory measurements to be made concurrently in order to provide information about the functional consequences of any URT collapse observed. However, during overground endoscopy, the effect of tack and rider can more readily be accounted for. This is particularly valuable in sports horses where different head and neck positions can easily be achieved (Allen et al. 2011; Van Erck 2011). From a clinical perspective, the key factor is the ability to replicate the presenting complaint during the exercise test. Therefore for many horses, in particular racehorses, the exercise test may need to replicate competition/racing conditions. For some racehorses, overground endoscopy tests might need to be performed at a racetrack in order to reproduce the distances and speedscovered during racing. In the UK, many training gallops are substantially shorter than the distance that races are performed over and hence may be unsuitable for testing purposes for some horses, resulting in under diagnosis of some URT conditions, notably dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP) (Allen and Franklin 2010). During exercising endoscopy, consideration of the effects of the rider and in particular consideration of head and neck position is important. Head and neck position has been shown to be an important predisposing factor for several forms of URT collapse, due to alterations in laryngohyoid position and/or more compliant airway walls (Petsche et al. 1995; Strand et al. 2009, 2012; Fjordbakk et al. 2012). Head and neck flexion is common in sports horses but is less of an issue in Thoroughbred racehorses, which tend to run with the head in an extended position. Standardbreds may have their head and neck position altered using check reins. In both Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses, head and neck flexion is most likely to occur when horses pull hard and are restrained in the early stages of a race (Strand et al. 2009). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd92 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017Respiratory sounds and breathing pattern Abnormal respiratory noise during exercise is the mostcommon clinical presentation for URT dysfunction. In theexercising horse there are temporal associations betweenrespiration and locomotion. Trotters and pacers can vary theratio to locomotion and respiration are synchronised(Evans and Silverman 1994; Cotrel et al. 2006), whereas during canter and gallop, the timing of the respiratory cycleis closely related to limb movements with most horsesadopting a breathing pattern of one breath every one stride(Attenburrow 1982). This locomotor-respiratory coupling (LRC)is a breathing strategy that is thought to have bothmechanical and energetic advantages (Boggs 2002). It issuggested that flexion and extension of the back is the primary mechanical link between locomotion and respiration(Alexander 1989; Frevert et al. 1990; Young et al. 1992; Simons 1999). During canter, inspiration occurs during the suspension phase of the gait, when the horse is entirely off the ground, oronly supported by the hindlimbs and expiration starts when the nonlead forelimb touches the ground (Bramble and Carrier 1983). In the normal horse at canter and gallop, expiratory sounds are approximately 2.5 times the amplitude of inspiratory sounds. Thus when listening to a normal horse exercise in the eld, expiratory sounds are more clearly audible than inspiratory sounds (Derksen et al. 2001; Franklin et al. 2003). The majority of airway obstructions cause an abnormal inspiratory noise. It has been shown that with arytenoid cartilage collapse for example, inspiratory sounds increase so that they become of equal amplitude to expiratory sounds (Derksen et al. 2001). Dorsal displacement of the soft palate, an expiratory obstruction, produces a low frequency sound inthe 20 -90 Hz range, which corresponds to the vibrations of the caudal border of the soft palate (Franklin et al. 2003). When sound is produced at the lower end of this range it may not be audible by the human ear. Dynamic URT obstructions may also be associated with changes in breathing pattern. During exercise, horses can intermittently swallow. During this time, respiration is suspended for one stride. Swallows can readily be identi ed during exercising endoscopy. In normal racehorses it has been shown that the frequency of swallowing decreases with increasing speed (Pigott et al. 2010). Frequent swallowing during exercise has been associated with soft palate dysfunction (Franklin 2002; Pigott et al. 2010). A transient locomotor-respiratory decoupling occurs during 'big respiratory cycles '(BRCs), when a single breath of a larger tidal volume is taken over 2 strides (Jolly et al. 1995). BRCs are suggested to be a normal feature during exercise and it is hypothesised that they result from a negative feedbackmechanism providing a transient readjustment of the end expiratory lung volume or an improvement of pulmonary gas exchange (Jolly et al. 1995; Curtis et al. 2006). It has been suggested that the frequency of BRCs during exercise is highly dependent on the individual horse but may also be inversely associated with tness levels. A more sustained alteration in breathing pattern has also been described whereby horses adopt a 2:1 LRC (i.e. each breath is taken over two strides) at canter/gallop. It has been suggested that disorders of the upper and lower respiratory tract may result in loss of the normal 1:1 breathing patternleading to an abnormal 2:1 breathing pattern (Weishaupt et al. 1998; Fitzharris et al. 2015). Exercising endoscopy There are numerous commercially available endoscopesystems suitable for overground ( Fig 1 ) and treadmill endoscopy. Considering that inspiratory time may be as shortas 0.25 s during gallop, an important factor is the ability toanalyse recordings in slow motion and frame by frame, inorder to identify the severity of the obstruction correctly. Types of dynamic upper respiratory tract obstructions Nostrils Alar fold collapseThe alar fold divides the external nares into the nasaldiverticulum and the opening to the nasal passages. Duringinspiration, the alar fold should be elevated by the transversus nasi muscle (Foerner 1967), thereby closing off the nasal diverticulum. It has been proposed that dysfunction of thetransversus nasi muscle (Schumacher and Dixon 2007) or excessive size of the alar folds (Hawkins et al. 1995) allows air to enter the nasal diverticulum and obstruct the nasal cavity(Schumacher and Dixon 2007). This is termed alar foldcollapse and causes a continuous vibrating/buzzing noisetypically during both inspiration and expiration. Alar foldcollapse is not usually diagnosed by exercising endoscopybut is diagnosed on the basis of typical sounds withcon rmation made by the placement of nasal mattress sutures resulting in the elimination of such sounds. Thecondition is fairly uncommon and should not be confusedwith 'high blowing ', which is caused by nostril fluttering during expiration. 'High blowing 'is considered normal and is most commonly heard at low canter speeds, disappearing as speed increases. Nasopharynx Dorsal displacement of the soft palateDorsal displacement of the soft palate occurs when thecaudal border of the soft palate becomes displaced to aposition above the epiglottis resulting in obstruction of therima glottidis (Fig 2 ) (Parente et al. 2002; Franklin et al. 2004; Fig 1: Image showing of a \u00a92015 FEBRUARY 2017Lane et al. 2006a). Palatal dysfunction is the most common condition observed during exercising endoscopicexaminations (Morris and Seeherman 1991; Kannegieter andDore 1995; Martin et 2000; Franklin et al. 2006; Lane et al. 2006a). However, the prevalence of DDSP may well beunderestimated. It has been suggested that DDSP is thecondition most dif cult to replicate during treadmill examination and the authors believe this is also the case withoverground endoscopy, especially in racehorses. In manyracehorses, DDSP only occurs when the horse fatigues andtherefore strenuous exercise tests are often required tocon rm the diagnosis. The aetiopathogenesis of DDSP is not completely understood. Intrinsic factors such asneuromuscular dysfunction of the palatinus and palatopharyngeus muscles and extrinsic factors such as tongue and laryngohyoid position have been proposed(Holcombe et al. 1998; Ducharme et al. 2003). The majority of horses make a 'gurgling 'expiratory noise during displacement (Martin et al. 2000; Franklin et al. 2004; Lane et al. 2006a). However, in up to 30% of horses no abnormal noise is recognised (Ahern 1999; Martin et al. 2000; Parente et al. 2002). In particular, it has been reported that DDSP in sports horses seldom causes abnormal respiratory noise which may be due to lower air flows at the slower speeds (Van Erck 2011). Recently a high prevalence of DDSP has also been noted in horses that have previously undergone a prosthetic laryngoplasty, although the cause remains unclear (Compostella et al. 2012; Barnett et al. 2014). Palatal instability Palatal instability (PI) describes progressive dorso-ventral billowing movements of the caudal portion of the soft palate (Fig 3 ), with flattening of the ventral surface of the epiglottis against the dorsal surface of the soft palate (Kannegieterand Dore 1995; Ahern 1999; Tan et al. 2005; Lane et al. 2006a) and is associated with soft/low grade inspiratory noise.PI may or may not progress to DDSP (Lane et al. 2006a). Several studies have con rmed that horses with DDSP have preceding PI, indicating that these are manifestations of thesame condition (Lane et al. 2006a; Strand et al. 2009; Van Erck 2011). However, the duration of PI prior to displacement may vary considerably between horses (Allen and Franklin 2013a). The severity of PI can be graded according to the degree of obstruction of the rima glottidis by the billowing soft palate. Recent studies have reported signi cant associations between the stability of the soft palate, epiglottic conformation and Axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds (ADAF). Furthermore, development of DDSPwas associated with increased severity of PI and ADAF and with changes in epiglottic conformation (Strand and Skjerve 2012; Allen and Franklin 2013a,b). Rostral soft palate collapse Collapse of the rostral aspect of the soft palate has been described as a cause of abnormal inspiratory noise at relatively low exercise intensities and appears to have an increased prevalence in ponies (Allen et al. 2007). In that study, endoscopy during exercise revealed severe billowing of the rostral aspect of the soft palate, which obscured much of the nasopharynx ( Fig 4 ). Little billowing of the caudal soft palate was apparent and the condition did not progress to DDSP (Allen et al. 2007). Although the cause is unknown, it has been suggested that abnormalities of the tensor velipalatini , the hamulus of the pterygoid or the palatine aponeurosis may be involved (Allen et al. 2007). Pharyngeal wall collapse Dynamic pharyngeal wall collapse may involve either the lateral ( Fig 5 ) or dorsal 1993; Boyle et al. 2006) or is termed circumferential (Fig 7 ) if the soft palate is also involved. The severity of pharyngeal wall collapse has been described according to the degree of obstruction of the rima glottidis (Boyle et al. 2006; Strand et al. 2012). All forms of pharyngeal wall collapse cause abnormal inspiratory sounds, which are similar to those produced by horses with laryngeal collapse. The cause of pharyngeal collapse remains uncertain. Dorsal pharyngeal wall collapse has been associated with neuromuscular dysfunction of the stylopharyngeus muscle Fig 2: Endoscopy image obtained during gallop in a racehorse showing dorsal displacement of the soft palate. Fig 3: Endoscopy image obtained during gallop in a racehorseshowing billowing of the soft palate around the epiglottis. Theepiglottis becomes obscured by the soft palate. In addition, mildaxial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds can be seen. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd94 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017(Tessier et al. 2004). Considering the anatomy, lateral pharyngeal wall collapse probably occurs due to dysfunctionof the pharyngeal constrictor muscles ( palatopharyngeus orpterygopharyngeus ). However, no experimental studies have been performed to con rm this. Circumferential pharyngeal wall collapse may result from neuromuscular dysfunction of several upper airway dilator muscles, or occur as a result of abnormalities in sensory neurons of the laryngeal mucosa (Holcombe et al. 2001). The prevalence of pharyngeal wall collapse is highest in sport horses, where it appears to be associated with increased head-neck flexion (Franklin et al. 2006; Davidson et al. 2007; Van Erck 2011; Barton et al. 2014). This is likely to be a result of loss of longitudinal tension on the pharyngeal walls when the horse is in head and neck flexion. Larynx Arytenoid cartilage collapsePartial and complete arytenoid cartilage collapse can beobserved during exercise (Rakestraw et al. 1991; Lane et al. Fig 4: Endoscopy image obtained during canter in a show pony making a loud harsh inspiratory noise. Repositioning of theendoscope more rostral than usual allowed the severe palatalbillowing to be observed. In this case, virtually the entirenasopharynx was obscured by the soft palate. Fig 5: Endoscopy image from an event horse during canter in anarena. Marked pharyngeal wall collapse was observed, primarilyfrom the lateral pharyngeal walls. This markedly obscured theairway and compressed the larynx. Fig 6: Endoscopy image from a racehorse at gallop showingdorsal pharyngeal wall collapse. The arytenoid cartilagesbecome obscured by the dorsal pharyngeal wall. Fig 7: Severe and dramatic circumferential pharyngeal wallcollapse seen immediately post exercise in a racehorse. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd95 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 20172006a) and are common disorders irrespective of the athleticdiscipline but have an increased prevalence in larger breeds.Complete arytenoid cartilage collapse describes dynamicmovement of the corniculate process of the arytenoidcartilage toward the midline of the rima glottidis during inspiration ( Fig 8 ) (Lane et al. 2006a). Ipsilateral vocal cord collapse (VCC) invariably accompanies arytenoid cartilagecollapse, as a result of passive movement when thearytenoid is not fully dilated. Bilateral VCC may also beobserved. Partial arytenoid cartilage collapse describes thecondition where the arytenoid cartilage is not fully abductedduring strenuous exercise and lies between full abductionand the resting position, but there is no tendency for furtherdynamic collapse towards the midline during inspiration(Rakestraw et al. 1991; Lane et al. 2006a). The abnormal respiratory noise occurs during inspiration and is typically described as a roaring or whistling sound, depending on the severity. Left sided dysfunction is most common and most frequently occurs as a result of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy, which causes neurogenic A distal axonopathy has been con rmed but the cause of this is not established (Hahn et al. 2008). The length and complexity of the pathway of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve compared to the right isthought to explain the common unilateral clinicalappearance (Hahn and Mayhew 2007). However, histologicalchanges have been identi ed bilaterally (Hahn and Mayhew 2007). Right-sided arytenoid cartilage collapse occurs much less frequently and when present is most commonly associatedwith fourth branchial arch defects (Lane 2007). Otherpotential causes ingestion ofneurotoxins, guttural pouch abscessation or or iatrogenic damage to therecurrent laryngeal nerve as a result of trauma or perivascularinjection of the jugular vein (Goulden and Anderson 1981;Dixon et al. 2001). Inability to abduct one or other arytenoid cartilage during exercise is also seen with arytenoidchondropathy. However, this condition is infrequentlyobserved in the UK compared to the USA.Vocal cord collapseDynamic collapse of one or both vocal folds occurs duringinspiration and also causes an inspiratory 'whistling 'noise (Attenburow 1983). It is most frequently observed inconjunction with arytenoid cartilage collapse (Lane et al. 2006a). However, it may also occur as a single entity(Kannegieter and Dore 1995; Dart et al. 2001; Tan et al. 2005; Franklin et al. 2006; Lane et al. 2006a). It is uncertain whether VCC represents an early stage of, or a different manifestationof recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (Franklin et al. 2006). Experimentally, it has been shown that VCC might occursubsequent to cricothyroid muscle dysfunction followingdamage to the external branch of the cranial laryngealnerve (Holcombe et al. 2006). In some horses, buckling of the vocal cord is seen; in others, ballooning of the ventriclebehind the vocal cord is most evident ( Fig 9 ). Bilateral arytenoid cartilage and vocal fold collapseThis disorder has been most commonly reported in Norwegiantrotters but has been observed infrequently in other breeds,including Standardbreds ( Fig 10 ) (Strand et al. 2004, 2012). The condition appears to be associated with head-neckflexion (Strand et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2014). Arytenoid function appears normal when the head and neck isextended. Therefore it is unlikely that bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropathy could be present and a recent histopathology study did not support a neuromuscular component to the pathogenesis (Fjordbakk et al. 2015). It is Fig 8: Endoscopy image obtained during canter in a sports horse showing complete left arytenoid cartilage collapse, mild bilateralvocal cord collapse and very mild right side axial deviation ofthe aryepiglottic fold Fig 9: Endoscopy image obtained at gallop in a racehorseshowing bilateral vocal cord/ventricle collapse. Courtesy of MrGeoffrey Lane. \u00a92015 Ltd96 EQUINE EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017hypothesised that this abnormality occurs as a result ofincreased airway impedance during head flexion or a positional change of the larynx during head flexion (Strand et al. 2004; Fjordbakk et al. 2008, 2012). The condition also causes a loud inspiratory noise.Collapse of the apex of the corniculate process of thearytenoid cartilageCollapse of the apex of one or both of the corniculateprocesses of the arytenoid cartilage (also called ventroaxialluxation of the apex of the corniculate process orventromedial arytenoid displacement or arytenoidsubluxation) may occur whilst abduction of the ventralaspect of the corniculate process is maintained ( Fig 11 ). In many cases it is observed in conjunction with other forms ofupper airway collapse, particularly ADAF and VCC (Dartet al. 2005). In earlier reports, collapse was reported to involve the apex and body of the left corniculate process ofthe arytenoid cartilage, which were displaced underneaththe apex of the right (Dart et al. 2005). It was speculated that the left arytenoid transversus muscle was unable to support the dorsal apposition between the arytenoid cartilages (Dartet al. 2005) or that the transverse arytenoid ligament might be excessively wide (Barakzai et al. 2007). However, more recently, bilateral ventromedial collapse was reported inStandardbred horses examined during qualifying races (Priestet al. 2012). It is currently unclear if these different forms of 'arytenoid subluxation 'are related. Ventrorostral displacement of the dorsal a condition whereby the dorsal laryngeal mucosaobscures the interarytenoid notch and dorsoaxial portion of corniculate process of the arytenoid cartilages during exercise ( Fig 12 ) (Pollock et al. 2013). Currently it has only been reported in Thoroughbreds, and in the majority wasassociated with other concurrent laryngeal obstructions (Pollock et al. 2013). Axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds This describes a common condition where the aryepiglotticfolds deviate axially into the rima glottidis during inspiration (Fig 13 ) (Kannegieter and Dore 1995; King et al. 2001). This results in an inspiratory noise, typically described as a whistle. Although the condition can occur as a single entity it is also Fig 10: Endoscopy image from a Standardbred racehorse at the start of exercise. The horse was pulling hard against the driverand as a consequence had head and neck flexion. Bilateral arytenoid cartilage collapse was seen only during the time ofhead and neck flexion. Fig 12: Image from a showing obscuring a Standardbred racehorse atgallop showing of the left arytenoid cartilage 'sub- luxating 'under the right. In this horse axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds and vocal cord collapse can also be seen. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd97 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017commonly observed in conjunction with other upper airwaydisorders particularly palatal dysfunction and arytenoidcartilage 2013a,b). The aryepiglottic folds should remain tenseduring inspiration and it is thought that if loss of abduction ofthe arytenoid or elevation of soft palate occurs, this maypredispose to ADAF (Dart et al. 2001). Severity of ADAF is graded mild -severe, where mild ADAF is de ned as when the folds remain abaxial to the vocal cords. Moderate ADAF is dened as axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds less than halfway between the vocal cord and midline, whereas severe ADAF is de ned as collapse of the aryepiglottic folds more than halfway between the vocal cord and midline (King et al. 2001). Epiglottic retroversion This is an uncommon condition, which occurs in mature horses when the epiglottis becomes retroverted dorsally and caudally to obscure the ) (Parente al. 1998; Terr /C19on-Canedo and Franklin 2013). Af flicted horses are reported to make an intermittent harsh inspiratory or 'grunting 'noise. The cause remains unknown. Experimentally the condition can be induced after bilateral blockade of the hypoglossal nerve as it passes through the guttural pouches (Holcombe et al. 1997) and close to the ceratohyoid bone (Cheetham et al. 2009). It is possible that this nerve may be damaged as a result of trauma or URT in flammation, leading to dysfunction of the hyoepiglotticus muscle. Poll flexion appears to be an exacerbating factor, especially in nonracehorses (Terr /C19on-Canedo and Franklin entrapmentEpiglottic subepiglottic mucosa and aryepiglottal foldssuch that the margins of the epiglottis can no longer be seen(Fig 15 ). In the majority of cases, EE may be diagnosed duringa resting endoscopic examination. However, on occasion intermittent EE may only become apparent during strenuous exercise (Morris and Seeherman 1991; Kannegieter and Dore 1995). During exercise, horses make a loud vibrant noise during both inspiration and expiration as a result of vibrations of the subepiglottal tissue that envelops the epiglottis. Some horses with intermittent EE also experience DDSP during exercise (Haynes 1983; Kannegieter and Dore 1995). The underlying cause of EE is unclear in many cases, although insome horses it has been associated with in flammation of the subepiglottic or aryepiglottic tissue, 1983; Linford et al. 1983). Fig 13: Image from Thoroughbred racehorse at gallop showing severe axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds. Fig 14: Endoscopy image from an event horse at canter showingepiglottic retroversion. Fig 15: Cricotracheal membrane collapseThis uncommon condition is associated with abnormalinspiratory noise. During inspiration the cricotrachealmembrane prolapses into the lumen ( Fig 16 ), and a clear difference in the size of the cricotracheal membrane shouldbe seen between inspiration and expiration. The aetiology isunknown but suggested to occur if the cricotracheal spaceexcessively large (Goulden 1977).Tracheal collapseTracheal collapse occurs primarily in small pony breeds, but isoften unnoticed due to their more sedentary lifestyle. It canbe caused by flaccidity of the dorsal tracheal ligaments, deformity of the tracheal cartilages or separation of trachealmucosa from the dorsal ligament. Respiratory noise can beobserved at rest and/or during exercise. Resting endoscopyof the trachea reveals collapse during inspiration, which mayworsen when nostrils are temporarily occluded. Endoscopy ofthe trachea during treadmill exercise to con rm dynamic tracheal collapse has been reported (Tetens et al. 2000). Functional signi cance of dynamic upper respiratory tract obstructions Assessment Once an upper airway obstruction has been correctlyidenti ed, the next step is to evaluate the functional signi cance of that obstruction to the individual horse. At some clinics it has been possible to make concurrentmeasures of flow rates, airway pressures, airway impedance, tidal volumes, flow volume loops and oxygen consumption, in order to provide an objective measure of the functional signi cance of an obstruction. More commonly in clinical practice, however, the veterinary surgeon must subjectively interpret the signi cance of the endoscopic ndings based on previously published studies and prior experience. How upper airway obstructions affect exercise tolerance The functional signi cance of any dynamic URT obstruction depends on the severity of the condition and the type ofwork that the horse is expected to perform. In the normalhealthy Thoroughbred undergoing strenuous exercise, therespiratory system is considered to be the limiting factor forperformance. Therefore URT collapse is likely to bedetrimental to athletic performance. The effect of anyobstruction is likely to be far greater in racehorses than innonracehorses that are performing less strenuous exercise,e.g. dressage and showjumping. The oxygen consumptionand work of breathing associated with these disciplines islower and horses are working at a lower fraction of their totalrespiratory capacity. Nevertheless, even in racehorses the true effect of an obstruction on race performance is not well understood. Ithas been suggested that the effect on racing performance isgreater the longer the race length because of the greateraerobic contribution to energy production. However, it shouldbe understood that even in so-called 'sprint 'races of ve furlongs ( ~1000 m) energy production is still primarily aerobic (>70%) (Eaton et al. 1995) and thus URT obstructions would be likely to limit performance even at these shorter distances.It is likely that URT obstruction affects exercise tolerance through several complex mechanisms. In general, URT obstructions are thought to affect athletic performance by increasing the resistance to air flow, leading to either a reduction in air flow or an increase in airway pressures required to maintain that air flow (Rehder et al. 1995; Franklin et al. 2002; Weishaupt 2005). A reduction in air flow reduces alveolar ventilation, which subsequently affects arterial oxygenation (Bayly et al. 1984; Durando et al. 2002; Boyle et al. 2006) and oxygen uptake (Franklin et al. 2002), whereas an increase in airway pressures results in increased work ofbreathing. It has been questioned as to whether URT obstructions during exercise may ultimately lead to premature diaphragmatic fatigue (Manohar et al. 1988). Diaphragmatic fatigue has been identi ed in human athletes during high- intensity exercise. This phenomenon is thought to affect exercise tolerance through several mechanisms including a reduction in ventilation, an alteration in breathing mechanics, an increased sensation of dyspnoea and through a respiratory muscle fatigue-induced metabore flex (Romer and Polkey 2008). The respiratory muscle metabore flex is a cardiovascular re flex, originating within the respiratory muscle, which induces a sympathetically-mediated vasoconstriction of limb locomotor muscle vasculature. This exacerbates peripheral fatigue and leads to a reduction in performance (Harms et al. 1997, 2000; Janssens et al. 2010; McConnell 2011). To what extent diaphragmatic fatigue occurs during strenuous exercise in the normal Thoroughbred racehorse and whether it is exacerbated by URT obstructions remains unclear. It is assumed that for a given piece of exercise an upper airway obstruction could result in a lower tidal volume, lower minute ventilation, more severe hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, a lower maximal oxygen consumption, higherblood lactates, and a greater degree of respiratory muscle Fig 16: Endoscopy image of a racehorse at gallop showing cricotracheal membrane collapse. Courtesy of Mr Lewis Smith,Rossdales Equine Hospital. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd99 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017fatigue than the same level of exercise without an upperairway obstruction. However, it is dif cult to extrapolate these alterations to the actual effect on race performance andrace times. It has also been suggested (although as yetunproven) that an upper airway obstruction may have aproportionally greater effect on performance in better horses(i.e. those with highest oxygen consumption) as they arealready more likely to be limited by the respiratory system(Ehrlich et al. 1995). Those horses with a low oxygen consumption may be less affected because these horses arelimited by their cardiac output rather than by ventilatorylimitations. There are differences between published studies on the functional effects of URT obstructions. These may be due todifferences in the methods of quantifying respiratory function,horse populations, exercise intensities and study design.Generally speaking, the documented detrimental effects aregreater from studies using research horses where measuresare obtained in the same horse with and without induceddisease rather than studies using a clinical populationcomparing groups with disease and those without becauseof the high population variability. The most commonly performed measurement across the studies is measurement of airway pressures. During strenuousexercise, ACC has been shown to result in a 63% increase intransupper airway pressures (pressure difference betweentrachea and mask). More negative tracheal inspiratorypressures also occur with bilateral ACC during head flexion (~47% more negative), rostral palatal 1997, 1998, 2001; Tessier et al. 2004; Strand et al. 2009). Whereas with DDSP the most signi cant effect is seen upon tracheal expiratory pressures (~40-156% more positive) (Rehder et al. 1995; Holcombe et al. 1998). During exercise, experimentally induced ACC has also been documented to decrease minute ventilation by 21% (Lumsden et al. 1993) and decrease peak oxygen consumption by 15% (Ehrlich et al. 1995). Naturally occurring DDSP results in a 13% reduction in minute ventilation and 10% reduction in maximal oxygen consumption (Franklin et al. 2002). Palatal instability was also shown to have a negative impact on measures of ventilation and gas exchange but overall results in less severe airway limitations than those of DDSP (Allen and Franklin 2013b). Severe dorsal and circumferential pharyngeal wall collapse (experimentally induced) was shown to decrease minute ventilation by 23% (Holcombe et al. 2001) and is also reported to be the condition most commonly associated with blood gas abnormalities (Durando et al. 2002). The functional consequences of other forms of URT obstructions have not been documented. The above mechanisms only describe the direct respiratory implications of upper airway obstructions but it is plausible that there are further indirect effects that can affect athletic performance. Respiratory muscle fatigue in human athletes intensi es effort perceptions and is thought to further reduce athletic performance through this mechanism. Effort perception cannot be investigated in equine athletes.However, it is possible that upper airway obstructions mayaffect the horse 's attitude and willingness to work.Conclusions The ability to diagnose URT disorders has improved over thelast few years, particularly with the advent of overgroundendoscopy. This is enabling us to learn more about URTfunction during ridden exercise and has begun to show theeffect of rider and driver interactions. While diagnosticcapabilities have improved, research should now focus ontreatment and prevention of these conditions. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

The soft palate is stable and both the soft palate and epiglottis retain good conformation. The microphone has been placed between the horse 's nostrils and so compared to listening in the eld greater inspiratory noise can be heard. Supplementary Item 2: Alar fold collapse. At the start of this recording high blowing can be detected. However as the recording continues a clear switch to a buzzing noise will be noted which was con rmed to be generated from the alar folds. Supplementary Item 3: DDSP in slow motion. Greater vibration of the soft palate can be seen during expiration compared to inspiration. This shows why the 'gurgling 'noise is most typically detected on expiration. DDSP subtle noise. This recording is of a horse which experiences DDSP. There is only a slight change in the noise when DDSP occurs. Prior to DDSP, palatal instability and mild ADAF can be seen. DDSP gurgle noise. This recording is of a horse which experiences DDSPand in this instance a more obvious gurgling noise can be detected. Prior to DDSP, it can be seen that there is slight arytenoid asymmetry, palatal instability and very mild ADAF. Supplementary Item 4: PI leading to DDSP. In comparison to the video showing normal upper respiratory tract function this video shows an example of palatal instability.

Davis North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Raleigh, USA. Corresponding author email: jdavis@ncsu.edu Keywords: horse; anti-in flammatory drug Summary Right colitis is a disease characterised bymucosal ulceration and oedema that is localised to the rightdorsal colon. It is considered one of the more severe adverseeffects associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly phenylbutazone. Diagnosis is typically made based on a history of NSAID administration, the presence of hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia, as well as ultrasound evidence of thickening and oedema of the right dorsal colon wall. Denitive diagnosis is made at surgery or necropsy. Treatment involves discontinuation of NSAID therapy, dietary management, and mucosal protectants such as misoprostol and sucralfate. Prognosis is dependent upon early recognition and appropriate treatment. Horses on prolonged courses of NSAIDs should have frequent monitoring of serum total protein and albumin concentrations, as this is one of the earliest and most consistent clinicopathological ndings. Introduction Nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed class of medications in humanand veterinary medicine. They are used for the relief of acuteor chronic, mild to moderate pain and in flammation, as well as for their antipyretic effects. As late as the 1980s, NSAIDswere considered nontoxic in horses (Snow et al. 1981). Widespread use of these drugs for decades in equids andmany other species has disproven this, however. Numeroustoxicities are now associated with this class of drugs, includingrenal toxicity, blood dyscrasias, haemostatic abnormalities,teratogenicity and hepatic disease (Mathews 2002;Harirforoosh et al. 2013). In horses in particular, gastroduodenal ulceration, renal papillary necrosis and rightdorsal colitis (RDC) are the main syndromes associated withNSAID administration. The purpose of this review is to take anin depth look at the literature regarding RDC as it relates toNSAID use in horses as well as to summarise cases thatpresented to the North Carolina State University College ofVeterinary Medicine (NCSU-CVM) between 2003 and 2014.Thirty- ve cases from the literature and an additional 28 cases from NCSU-CVM were identi ed and included in this review. Cases from NCSU-CVM were chosen based on a history of NSAID usage, as well as ultrasonographic evidence of oedema in the wall of the right dorsal colon, and a low protein concentration based on hydration status. The results will be used to attempt to further classify the syndrome, and summarise the current thoughts regarding pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis.Drugs implicated It is commonly believed that only phenylbutazone isassociated with the development of RDC, and then only withoral administration. Although phenylbutazone has been thedrug most associated with RDC (Karcher et al. 1990) and is considered the most toxigenic among commerciallyavailable NSAIDs for equids (MacAllister et al. 1993; Mozaffari et al. 2010), other drugs have been known to cause this syndrome. Both flunixin meglumine and meloxicam have been reported to cause RDC (Karcher et al. 1990; Cohen et al. 1995; Noble et al. 2012), and combination therapy with 2 or more NSAIDs may predispose to this disease (Karcher et al. 1990; Reed et al. 2006; Keegan et al. 2008). A review of the literature (Karcher et al. 1990; Simmons et al. 1990; Cohen et al. 1995; Hough et al. 1999; East et al. 2000; Jones 2003; Galvin et al. 2004; Conwell and Stratford 2010; Lane et al. 2010) as well as cases of presumed RDC that presented to the NCSU-CVM reveal that, of the 60 cases where theNSAID usage was documented, 31 were attributed tophenylbutazone, 15 to flunixin meglumine, and 14 to a combination of 2 or more NSAIDs administered concurrentlyor sequentially. Examination of adverse drug experiences reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration Center forVeterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM) (FDA-CVM 2015) for NSAIDsapproved for use in horses, revealed that the frequency ofcolic and diarrhoea, 2 clinical signs commonly associatedwith RDC, reported with phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine are similar ( Table 1 ). Based on these data, adverse experiences are least likely with ketoprofen. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rocoxib, also labelled for use in horses in the USA is considered to be safer for the gastrointestinal tract than nonspeci c inhibitors, based on toxicology data reported for licensed products (Equioxx package insert). The FDA-CVM website reports adverse drug experiences consistent with gastrointestinal disease for this drug when administered orally to horses, as well. Kivett et al. (2014) showed that combination therapy with phenylbutazone and rocoxib did result in increased creatinine as well as decreased protein in horses receiving licensed doses over a 10-day period. Further clinical experience with COX-2 inhibitors in horses is necessary todetermine the true safety pro le of these drugs in clinical cases. To date, there are no published reports implicating other groups of drugs as a cause of RDC in the horse. However, given that corticosteroids can also inhibit prostaglandin production through the cyclooxygenase pathway, it is possible that this group of drugs may also be involved. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd104 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017Pathophysiology The aetiology of RDC and why the lesions are con ned to this area of the intestine in clinical cases is largely unknown.NSAIDs work via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX)enzymes, which prevent the production of prostanoids fromthe arachidonic acid pathway (Marshall and Blikslager 2011).Some of these prostanoids, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)are not only involved in the harmful effects of in flammation, they are also necessary for standard physiological duties suchas maintaining blood flow to the gastrointestinal mucosa and the kidney. It is commonly considered that toxicity secondary to NSAID administration, including gastroduodenal ulceration, RDC and renal papillary necrosis, would be related to a decrease in mucosal blood flow secondary to decreased PGE2 resulting in an inability to restore mucosal barrier function (Marshall and Blikslager 2011). Studies to con rm this have been so far unsuccessful. Investigations into the pathophysiology of ulceration in the gastric glandular mucosa (Marshall and Blikslager 2011; Martinez Aranzales et al. 2015), as well as the right dorsal colon (Meschter et al. 1990a; McConnico et al. 2008) have shown no signi cant decreases in PGE2 production in mucosal biopsy samples at either site. In vivo studies of the right dorsal colon have shown that long-term phenylbutazone administration actually increases arterial blood flow compared to controls (McConnico et al. 2008). The difference in blood flow to the right dorsal colon is of unknown signi cance. It may represent a diffuse, generalised in flammatory response with progression of disease, or it may be a response to the chronic instrumentation used in that particular study. Another possible explanation is that chronic NSAID use leads to induction ofangiogenesis and subsequent perpetuation of chronic inflammation in the colon. Some effects of NSAIDs that may explain their ulcerative effects on gastrointestinal mucosa have been reported, however. Martinez Aranzeles et al. (2015) showed that in the gastric glandular mucosa, phenylbutazone exposureresults in a trend towards increased oxidant activityconcurrent with a decreased antioxidant activity, indicatingoxidative stress may play a role in ulcer development. Inparticular, nitric oxide was decreased in phenylbutazonetreated groups. This may be signi cant in that nitric oxide and PGE2 have a synergistic effect with respect to mucosal protection (Barrison and Wolfe 1999) and the decreases in both caused by phenylbutazone may potentiate the risk of ulceration in the stomach. Further work is necessary in this area to determine the signi cance in the right dorsal colon mucosa.An alteration in the pro le of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), namely a decrease in acetic acid concentrations, in the rightdorsal colon has been shown to occur following long-termdosing of horses with phenylbutazone (McConnico et al. 2008). Volatile fatty acids are a product of bacterialfermentation and may have either pro- or anti-in flammatory properties, depending on the particular VFA. Changes in VFAconcentrations have been correlated with Argenzio and 1991).Additionally, VFAs are responsible for water absorption in thedistal colon in horses, and alterations may result in dehydrationand contribute to the diarrhoea seen in some cases of RDC inthis species (Argenzio et al. 1974). The signi cance of the decrease in acetic acid in the horses of the McConnico et al. study (2008) report requires further study. Other in vitro studies have attempted to determine differences in the response of the right dorsal colon in ischaemia and in response to NSAIDs. The right dorsal colon appears to be more susceptible to ischaemia when compared to the pelvic flexure or the small intestine (Cook et al. 2013). Signi cant decreases in transepithelial resistance were seen in the right dorsal colon following only 1 h of ischaemia, whereas no changes were noted in the pelvic flexure following a similar time period. Additionally, phenylbutazone has been shown to have a unique effect on the lipooxygenase (LOX) pathway in the right dorsal colon (Cook 2014). Colonic mucosa harvested from horsessubjected to euthanasia after receiving phenylbutazone at 2 mg/kg bwt/day for at least 30 days showed an increased production of 15-LOX mRNA expression in the right dorsal colon compared to the caecum, ventral colons, pelvic flexure and the left dorsal colon. Decreased 5-LOX mRNA expression was found in all sites of treated horses compared to the right dorsal colon of control horses, with subsequently higher concentrations of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a 5-LOX metabolite, in the right dorsal colon of control horses. No difference in prostanoid production (thromboxane B2 and PGE2) was noted between the sites. These ndings are interesting not only because of the differences shown, but also because 5-LOX is necessary for the production of the anti-in flammatory compounds known as lipoxins. Since horses with RDC may develop a chronic in flammatory bowel disease with continued protein loss, this may be a signi cant pathway. Phenylbutazone also affects mucosal integrity, anion transport systems, and apoptosis in the right dorsal colon (Richter et al. 2002), although it is unknown if this is speci c to the right dorsal colon. Another potential cause of NSAID induced damage to the right dorsal colon is throughTABLE 1: Summary of adverse drug events reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine for nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs labelled for use in the horse the USA Phenylbutazone Flunixin meglumine Ketoprofen Firocoxib Oral Parenteral Oral Parenteral Colic 4 7 - 9 - 6 Diarrhoea 2 11 2 1 - 4 Weight loss -- - 1 -- Depression, lethargy or anorexia - 10 3 12 - 4 Oedema - 1 - 6 - 3 Fever - 1 - 24 1 1 Death 7 12 3 37 1 2 \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd105 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017inhibition of restitution after injury. This has been studied in anin vitro hypochlorous acid model of colonic mucosa injury (R\u20acotting et al. 2004); however, a signi cant effect of phenylbutazone and indomethacin on recovery of barrierfunction was not found. Anatomically, the right dorsal colon has 3 bands ( and 3 sacculations ( haustra coli ) (Yildiz et al. 2001). It is the shortest section of the ascending colon and functions asa major site of fluid secretion and absorption, with an overall net secretion occurring in the dorsal colons (Argenzio et al. 1974). Currently, it is unknown if or how the anatomy plays arole in pathophysiology of RDC; however, it is possible thatthe narrowing of the colon in this area may lead to increasedmucosal contact with NSAIDs. Certain NSAIDs, such asphenylbutazone, are known to adhere to roughage, andfeeding roughage leads to an increased transit time in thecolon (Maitho et al. 1986). Therefore, increased time for contact and increased physical contact can occur,potentially predisposing this area to disease. Predisposing factors While all these factors may explain at least in part, theunderlying pathophysiology, it does not explain why somehorses develop disease while receiving NSAIDs, and others donot, regardless of the dose or drug administered. Forexample, in one study using doses of phenylbutazone(8.8 mg/kg bwt/day), 2 horses developed a necrotisingenterocolitis while the other 10 horses did not even thoughfeeding, water availability and management practices werestandardised (McConnico et al. 2008). Toxicity with NSAIDs is said to occur more frequently in animals that are off feed and dehydrated, have pre-existing gastrointestinal disease, or are critically ill (Cook and Blikslager 2015). Caution is advised when using NSAIDs in cases that t these categories. Administration of phenylbutazone at standard doses (6 mg/ kg bwt/day) to healthy horses with concurrent 50% water restriction can induce disease in as little as 5 days (Karcher et al. 1990). This emphasises the importance of dehydration in the development of disease. Another explanation for the individual susceptibilities may be pharmacogenomic variations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NSAIDs in horses, as has been documented in man (Rollason et al. 2014). Polymorphisms in associated with alterations in pharmacokinetic pro les, and potential differences in susceptibility to adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding. It is currently unknown whether or not these types of polymorphisms, or others, contribute to adverse effects of NSAIDs in horses. Pathology Administration of large doses of phenylbutazone (13.46 mg/kg in horses after only 2 doses(Meschter et al. 1990b). In this study, the right ventral colon became affected rst and most severely, and lesions were seen to a varying degree in the right dorsal colon, left dorsalcolon, caecum and in some horses diffusely throughout thecolon. In none of the horses was the right dorsal colon theonly area of the intestine affected. Histopathologically, the lesions were characterised by sloughing of the super cial epithelium, necrosis of the lamina propria , and degeneration of the capillary walls with associated microthrombosis. Extensive neutrophilic in ltration, red blood cell extravasation and oedema were also noted. Similar gross lesions were seen in ponies treated with phenylbutazone at 10 mg/kg bwt/day orally for 8 -10 days, with ulcerations noted in the colon, caecum, oral cavity and occasionally the stomach (Snow et al. 1981). This study did not note the particular areas of the colon affected. Whether the lesions induced with an overdose of phenylbutazone are similar to those induced in clinical disease remains to be seen. Dosing of phenylbutazone at 6 mg/kg bwt/day orally to 2 horses for a total of 5 days, along with concurrent water restriction, led to the clinical syndrome of RDC, with ulceration con ned to the right dorsal colon, but without the vascular lesions previously identi ed (Karcher et al. 1990). In clinical cases, gross lesions involve haemorrhage on the serosal surface, along with ulceration in the mucosa and oedema of the colon wall (Figs 1 -3). Histopathological ndings con rm mucosal ulceration with varying degrees of granulation tissue, oedema and a mixed in flammatory in ltrate ( Fig 3 ). Full necropsy examination often reveals other areas affected, including the oral cavity, stomach and kidneys ( Fig 1 ). Clinical presentation Multiple reports of experimental NSAID toxicity are availablein the literature (Snow et al. 1981; MacAllister 1983; Traub et al. 1983; Collins et al. et al. 2008; Mozaffari et al. 2010). Clinical presentation in these reports varied greatly from none detectable to sudden death due to colonrupture and septic shock. Toxicity can be induced usingeither oral or intravenous dosing. A review of the literature, as well as clinical cases presented to the NCSU-CVM in 2003 -2014 reveal that colic and diarrhoea are the most common clinical signs associatedwith disease ( Table 2 ). Colic can range from mild and intermittent due to chronic disease and colonic stricture(Hough et al. 1999) to severe colic with acute disease. Similarly, diarrhoea may be chronic and mild, or may presentas acute and watery diarrhoea with systemic dehydrationand signs of sepsis. Depression, lethargy and partial anorexiamay be the only clinical signs noted. Weight loss in chroniccases, and oedema with severe hypoproteinaemia are alsonoted. Right dorsal colitis is often thought of as a disease of younger horses (Cohen 2002). Based on the cases reviewedfor this report, this impression is true. While the ages rangedbetween 8 months and 30 years, the median age was6 years, and 60 of 63 cases were aged 15 years. The most likely explanation for this predisposition is that younger horsesare more likely to be in work and therefore more likely todevelop lameness and other issues requiring NSAID therapy.Ponies and foals are also thought to be predisposed to thedisease (Snow 1981; Snow et al. 1981; Traub et al. 1983). While these smaller animals may be predisposed to overdoseof NSAIDs due to dif culties with estimating weight and properly dosing some formulations (i.e. 1 g phenylbutazonetablets), only 9 of 63 cases reported here were pony breedsor animals aged <1 year. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd106 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017Diagnosis History The use of a NSAID is a common history element for diagnosisof RDC; however, the drug used, the doses administered andthe duration of treatment have varied considerably amongreported clinical cases. There are some reports of RDC thatdo not have a documented history of NSAID usage (Karcheret al. 1990; Cohen et al. 1995). The possibility remains in those cases that NSAID use was performed, but not admitted to, by the owner or trainer, or that NSAID use occurred previously but was withdrawn prior to the development of clinical signs.Although there are no current reports of RDC occurring due to other con rmed causes, it remains a possibility that ulcers con ned to the right dorsal colon may occur without NSAID use. Overdoses of NSAIDs are not necessary for the development of disease, although they may predispose the horse. Other predisposing factors proposed include the formulation of the drug administered (Snow et al. 1981), although both oral and parenteral (i.m. and i.v.) drug administration have been reported to cause disease (Karcher et al. 1990). Traub et al. (1983) did report a difference in the incidence of oral, gastric and colonic ulcers in foals receiving phenylbutazone powder in molasses compared with foals receiving the drug in capsular form. Phenylbutazone, and to a lesser extent flunixin meglumine, can have a direct cytotoxic effect on mucosa, which may allow for ulceration in areas in which they come into direct contact with oraldosing. Clinicopathologic changes Bloodwork reveals evidence of a protein losing enteropathy.Hypoproteinaemia characterised by hypoalbuminaemia isthe most frequently reported and consistent abnormality.Panhypoproteinaemia with hypoglobulinaemia is often seenin severe or chronic disease. Hypocalcaemia mayaccompany the hypoalbuminaemia. In experimental NSAIDtoxicity, it has been noted that hypoproteinaemia andhypoalbuminaemia, sometimes profound, can occur in horseseven without any post mortem ndings of colonic ulceration (Snow et al. 1981). Therefore monitoring serum proteins in horses on NSAIDs may provide the rst indication of toxicity and stopping therapy or at least reducing the dose at thisstage may be key in preventing and/or treating RDC.Interpretation of protein values must take into account thehydration status of the horse. Dehydrated horses may haveprotein and albumin concentrations within the referencerange but inappropriately low based on the packed cellvolume. Concentrations may drop as early as 3 days afterdrug administration is begun (McConnico et al. 2008) and the return of concentrations to normal may take anextended time ( Fig 4 ). In the author 's experience, fluctuations in protein and albumin levels may occur throughout thecourse of disease, based on timing of exogenous colloidadministration and progression of disease.

Fig 2: Oedema within the right dorsal colon wall accompaniedby mucosal EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2017hypoproteinaemia is present with minimal response totreatment, other disease processes should be investigated.Monitoring should be performed until concentrations areback in the normal range. Other abnormalities commonly noted are in fluenced by the presence of diarrhoea and sepsis, including electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, and white blood cell changes. Azotaemia is present in some cases and may re flect general dehydration, or be another manifestation of NSAID toxicity and renal papillary necrosis. Prevalence of selected bloodwork abnormalities in cases of RDC are documented in Table 2 . Speci c diagnostic tests Ultrasonography is considered the most useful tool fordiagnosing RDC (Jones et al. 2003). The right dorsal colon can be imaged most frequently in the right 11 -13th intercostal space, below the margin of the lung and axial tothe liver. In normal horses, the colon wall thickness measures<0.6 cm (most commonly 0.3 -0.4 cm or less) and appearshomogenously hyperechoic (Jones et al. 2003). Horses with RDC had signi cantly increased right dorsal colon wall thickness with a distinct hypoechoic layer, representing oedema and cellular in ltrate, bordered by hyperechoic layers on both the serosal and mucosal sides ( Fig 5 ). The presence of this hypoechoic layer in a colon wall with normal measured thickness may be an early indicator of RDC and warrants further monitoring. In the author 's experience, with early cases, colon wall thickness may not increase above normal for up to 72 h after the initial clinical signs. Further con rmation of RDC can be obtained by measuring the wall thickness of the right ventral colon for comparison. Horses with RDC had a mean ratio of right dorsal to right ventral colon wall thickness of 2.46, compared to a ratio of 1.01 in normal horses (Jones et al. 2003). Visualisation of the right ventral colon is also useful, as the colon can be diffuselythickened with other causes of infectious or in flammatory colitis, again resulting in a ratio closer to one. Ultrasonography can also be used for monitoring progression of the disease. If the colon wall thickness is decreasing and the echogenicity a) b) Fig 3: a) Mucosal surface of the right dorsal colon in a horse with acute right dorsal colitis.

Nuclear scintigraphy has also been reported as a diagnostic tool for RDC (East et al. 2000), although the requirement for expensive equipment and time make it less convenient than ultrasound for diagnosis. With this procedure, blood is collected from the horse and subjected to in vitro white blood cell radiolabelling. The radiolabelled blood is then re-injected and a nuclear study performed at 20 h after injection. Horses with RDC showed an increased linear uptake in the area of the right dorsal colon compared to a control horse. Right dorsal colitis cases may present with frank or digested blood in the stool, making faecal occult blood a potential adjunctive test. Clinical experience shows this test is not sensitive or speci c enough to diagnose RDC by itself. For example, Galvin et al. (2004) reported a positive faecal occult blood test in 3 of 3 horses, whereas Cohen et al. (1995) reported a positive result in only one of 3 horses and MacAllister et al. (1993) reported a negative result in all horses, despite signi cant pathology. Tests marketed for the detection of albumin and haemoglobin in the faeces of horses can help differentiate issues in the foregut from the hindgut (SUCCEED Equine Fecal Blood Test; Freedom Health, LLC, Aurora, Ohio, USA). The presence of either in the faeces may be an indicator of RDC, although it does not differentiate RDC from other infectious, in flammatory or parasitic causes (Kerbyson et al. 2014). Positive results can also be obtained for up to 24 horses after rectal examination, necessitating that this test be performed prior to or a day after this diagnostic. Positive results may also be found inhorses that have recently had endoscopy or dentistry, during ovulation in mares, in horses with exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage, or those that have had other more invasive GI procedures such as biopsy or colic surgery. A large-scalenecroscopic study of horses revealed that use of a guaiac- based faecal occult blood test, which detects haemoglobin, reported an overall accuracy of 64% in detecting colonic Fig 4: Time course for resolution of hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminaemia in a clinical case of right dorsal colitis. Thesecondary decrease in protein and albumin concentrationsprobably represents the decline in exogenously administeredcolloid support; however, continued monitoring is necessary toensure it is not due to exacerbation of right dorsal colitis ordevelopment of secondary disease.

This study alsosuggested a positive guaiac-based faecal occult blood testin the absence of endoscopic evidence of gastric ulcerswould be sensitive and speci c for colonic ulcers of any origin. Taking into account the bene ts and limitations of detecting faecal occult blood and its components, this testshould be interpreted with caution. A thorough work-up for other causes of colitis or chronic colic should accompany the work-up. Diagnostics forcommon infectious agents should be performed in thesecases, as comorbidities are a possibility. Salmonella has been cultured from the faeces of horses with RDC in 2 of 11 cases(Karcher et al. 1990) and 2 of 5 cases (Cohen et al. 1995) in the literature. Faecal McMaster 's evaluation may also reveal concurrent parasitic infestations. It is currently not clear what role these concurrent issues play in disease development. Chronic or recurrent impactions may be palpable, either due to altered motility in the RDC or from a stricture in chronic cases (Hough et al. 1999). Treatment Despite increased monitoring and recognition of the disease,treatment of RDC is sometimes unrewarding, even withaggressive medical and surgical management. The mainprinciples of medical treatment involve stopping NSAIDadministration, dietary management and prostaglandinreplacement therapy. Surgical interventions require resectionand bypass of the affected segment of the colon. Thesemanagement techniques are discussed in more detail below. Medical management Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is essential in treatment ofRDC. However, this is often dif cult, as the case was being treated initially with NSAIDs for management of pain andinflammation. Pain management in these cases therefore becomes quite a challenge. One poorly understood area ofpain control is the use of COX-2 speci c inhibitors such as rocoxib. The COX-2 speci c inhibitors were developed to counteract the damaging effects of the COX-2 enzyme, while allowing continued activity of the constitutively expressed 'housekeeping 'enzyme COX-1. Cyclooxygenase-2 speci c inhibitors have an increased safety pro le in normal horses, particularly with respect to the gastrointestinal tract. Doses as high as 12.5 times the label dose administered for 92 days did not result in colonic ulcerations or erosions. However, there was no pre-existing disease in those cases. It is now fairly well established that COX-2 has a 'housekeeping ' function in the process of healing gastrointestinal ulcers, and inhibition may result in delayed healing (Blikslager et al. 1997; Brzozowski et al. 2001; Konturek et al. 2005; Morton et al. 2009). Additionally, expression of COX-2 has been identi ed in a variety of nonin flammatory tissues, such as the kidney (Whelton 1999). Since horses with RDC may already be at risk of renal disease due to dehydration and the nephrotoxic effects of NSAIDs, inhibition of COX-2 is contraindicated. Based on this information, the use of COX-2 selective inhibitors in horses with RDC is not recommended. Where they may be useful is in horses that have recovered from a previous bout of RDC. These horses may have an inherent increased sensitivity to NSAIDs, and a COX-2 selective drug like rocoxib may be a safer choice.Pain control in horses with RDC is therefore often accomplished using opioids, a-2 agonists or i.m.) can be given as needed for pain control. If this is not suf cient, constant rate infusion doses can be administered consistent pain relief (Cruz et al. 2004; Sellon et al. 2004). Lidocaine (1.3 mg/kg bwt i.v. loading dose followed by 0.05 mg/kg bwt/min constant rate infusion) may have the added bene t of being anti-in flammatory in the small intestine and colon (Cook et al. 2009, 2013). Lidocaine had a bene cial effect on transepithelial resistance in the right dorsal colon, but not the pelvic flexure, following 1 h of ischaemia. Other methods of pain management revolve around treatment of the initial disease that required NSAID therapy (i.e. arthritis, laminitis, colic). Horses with severe painmay bene t from combinations of analgesic drugs such as 'trifusion 'of morphine 2011). One of the mainstays of treatment of RDC includes dietary management directed toward providing a low-bulkdiet in the form of a complete pelleted concentrate andrestricting or eliminating ingestion of roughage (Cohen et al. 1995). The aims of this approach are to decrease themechanical and physiological load in the colon. Additionalrecommendations include feeding smaller meals morefrequently (4 -6 times daily) and allowing restricted grazing. The duration of dietary changes is typically prolonged, with 3-6 months recommended. A better way to judge when hay and roughage can be added back into the diet is to monitor serum albumin concentrations, and to restrict roughage until albumin has returned to normal. Feeding psyllium mucilloid may promote colonic healing in horses with RDC. In other animal species, psyllium mucilloid has been demonstrated to increase the concentration of short-chain fatty acids of the large bowel and promote colonic mucosal repair (Argenzio 1981). Corn oil may also be added to the diet as a potential mucosal protective treatment. Corn oil has been shown to signi cantly increase the PGE2 concentration in the gastric contents of healthy mature ponies (Cargile et al. 2004). The effects on the colonic mucosa are currently unknown, but as some horses with RDC may experience signi cant weight loss, corn oil can be recommended as an additional source of calories for these cases, particularly during the period of hay restriction. Symptoms and lesions associated with experimental phenylbutazone toxicosis were shown to be prevented with coadministration of a synthetic PGE2 in ponies (Collins and Tyler 1985), therefore exogenous PGE may provide a bene cial therapeutic effect in cases of RDC. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, can be administered orally starting at doses ranging from 2 -5lg/kg bwt every 6 - 12 h. The lower end of the dose range is often used to start with, as some horses will develop signs of abdominal discomfort or diarrhoea following administration. If lower doses are tolerated, higher doses administered less frequently can be used. While misoprostol is often administered in these cases to supplement depletedresources of PGE, it may have other bene cial anti- inflammatory effects as well. In vitro studies have shown that \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd110 EQUINE useful as modulator ofinflammatory cytokine production. Sucralfate is a cytoprotective agent used in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers in people and horses. It is alsofrequently used in the treatment of RDC and there is someevidence supporting its use. Experimental intoxication withphenylbutazone (10 mg/kg bwt/day) in foals resulted incolonic ulceration in 6 out of 7 foals on phenylbutazonealone, compared to only one out of 7 foals treated withphenylbutazone and sucralfate combined (Geor et al. 1989). In that study, the H2 antagonist, ranitidine, showed a similar protective effect to sucralfate when administered intravenously. Many horses with RDC are treated concurrently with other antiulcer medications for presumed or con rmed concurrent gastric ulceration. Metronidazole is an antibiotic with anti-in flammatory effects demonstrated in other species. It is frequently used for the treatment of NSAID enteropathies in man, and has been shown to prevent leucocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in mesenteric vessels of rats with indomethacin induced intestinal injury (Wallace et al. 1993; Yamada et al. 1993; Arndt et al. 1994). In vitro evaluation of metronidazole 's effects on the equine right dorsal colon mucosa revealed that coadministration of metronidazole reduced the increased tissue permeabilityinduced by flunixin meglumine alone (Shell et al. 2014). It therefore may be useful as an adjunctive therapy in RDC aswell, as long as treatment does not affect the horse 's appetite. Other treatments are more general in nature and should be administered as needed based on the individual case.Crystalloid fluids can be used for treatment of horses exhibiting signs of hypovolaemia. However, affected horsesalso suffer from hypoproteinaemia and require concurrenttreatment with colloids to platelet andrenal function (Schusser et al. 2007; Epstein et al. 2014). Plasma may also be bene cial as a colloid, as well as for treating signs of endotoxaemia. Cryotherapy for laminitisprophylaxis in those cases is recommended. Administration ofmineral oil or activated charcoal in cases of an acuteoverdose of NSAIDs may be bene cial in preventing further drug absorption. Surgical management Surgical intervention is often tried only when medicalmanagement fails to resolve clinical signs, or when stricturesform as a complication of the disease, leading to chroniccolic issues. Surgical resection of the right dorsal colon isdifcult and often requires resection of a rib, during which time the thoracic cavity may be entered (Andrews andRobertson 1988; Simmons et al. 1990; Lane et al. 2010). During the procedure, the remaining right dorsal colon is bypassed by anastomosis to the transverse or small colon, although persistent signs of hypoproteinaemia and mild colic are reported (Andrews and Robertson 1988; Simmons et al. 1990). A newer technique describes resection with subsequent anastomosis of the diaphragmatic flexure to the small colon (Lane et al. 2010). These techniques used a lateral approach,rather than the standard ventral approach for colic surgery. Horses that present with surgical colic indications that are taken to surgery without previous diagnosis would require a second surgical approach for treatment of RDC. Prognosis Prognosis in cases of RDC is dependent on early recognition,aggressive treatment, and the development of complicationsincluding colonic rupture or stricture formation ( Fig 6 ). Earlier reports of RDC had a near 100% mortality rate (Karcher et al. 1990), possibly due to an inability to recognise the syndrome and continued NSAID therapy. Once the syndrome wasclassi ed, and treatments described, the chance of successful medical and surgical management improved (Simmons et al. 1990; Cohen et al. 1995; Lane et al. 2010). The mortality rate of horses seen at NCSU-CVM within the last 11 year period, was <20%. This improved survival rate can be attributed to a protocol of increased monitoring of serum albumin and ultrasonographic examination of the right dorsal colon wall in horses receiving NSAIDs, which can lead to earlier diagnosis. Based on the currently available information, the overall mortality rate for this disease is approximately 40% ( Table 2 ). Prevention As previously stated, early recognition is key to a successfuloutcome. Recommendations for preventing and/or detectingearly disease include at least weekly monitoring of serumtotal protein and albumin in horses being treated with NSAIDsfor longer periods of time. Those horses that developdecreases in protein or albumin should be removed fromNSAID therapy and an ultrasonographic examinationperformed. If the right dorsal colon wall is thickened or has ahypoechoic appearance, dietary changes and misoprostoltherapy should be instituted. Serial serum protein andultrasound examinations should then be performed untilvalues return to normal. For horses being treated at home byowners, it is important that they understand the appropriatedosing units for the formulation used and the potentialadverse effects that may occur. Owner instructions shouldinclude a statement to the effect that if any pertinent clinicalsigns are noted (colic, soft stool or diarrhoea, oedema,anorexia, etc.), they should discontinue use of the drug andcontact the veterinarian. This will hopefully allow for earlyrecognition, appropriate treatment and prevention of clinicalRDC.
