Many factors have been attributed to imbalance of T -cell with Th1/Th2 balance and Th17/Treg balance that leads to inflammation. Th1 (T helper cells 1) fight viruses and Th2 up regulates the antibody production. Th17 is implicated in autoimmune inflammation and Treg is inhibitor of inflammation. So one approach is balancing Th1/Th2, gut healing, nutrient therapy, and herb extract for autoimmunity and inflammation. Nutritional support Studies suggest that many nutrients and anti-oxidants are able to support this balance and modulate immunity. For example, it was found that vitamin A upregulates Treg cell and decrease risk of autoimmunity. Through an epidemiological, genetic, and environmental assessment a personalized protocol is created. In certain forms of autoimmunity the optimal levels of vitamin D are absolutely necessary to better function. Gut Health Correcting the gut dysbiosis and removing the environmental triggers are important steps. In certain studies, microbiome like porphyromonas gingivalis and Proteus Mirabilis was strongly associated with RA and Ankylossing spondylitis is associated with Klebsiella pneumonia. Gut healing with elimination of the overgrowth yeast, fungus, and bacteria are at the base of reducing autoimmunity. Reducing inflammation with botanicals Autoimmune conditions like R.A, M.S, psoriasis, Ankylosis Spondylitis are characterized by increased inflammation and the purpose is to reduce that inflammation.
