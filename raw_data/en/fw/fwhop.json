I bought the Oatmeal and Honey Butter and it smells really nice. A little goes a long way. Makes your skin feel smooth and gives it sort of healthy glow. The powerful body scrub is great. My kids are using it up. I haven't tried sacred Botanical as yet but I'm sure I would like it too, as it smells devine. I love the soap it smells so beautiful and I love the way my skin feels softer and not as dry. I will buy it again. Thank you Amazing! Not \"only\" gorgeous visuals but a highly effective and soothing soap with such gentle. lean scent. I used the soap on my body where I suffer from psorisis, and in the face. The deep cleansing of the bar is serious and calming. It left my skin feeling hydrated with an unmatched glow. Thank you I absolutely love your products.
