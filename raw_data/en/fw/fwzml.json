REED and KATHLEEN MYERS* MORE THAN 10 million aged persons are cov- ered under policies or contracts of private health insurance organizations for benefits that comple- ment the benefits under the Federal program of health insurance for the aged (Medicare). This article describes the coverage offered by the various types of health insurance organizations. BLUE CROSS AND BLUE SHIELD PLANS Before the establishment of Medicare, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans together covered approximately 6 million aged persons for hospital care and a slightly smaller number for surgery and in-hospital physician visits. About 60 percent of those covered came under nongroup contracts, and 40 percent were under group contracts. As of January 1, 1967-6 months after Medi- care began operations-these plans covered nearly 5 million aged persons for hospital care and at least 4.5 million for physician services, two-thirds of them under nongroup contracts and the rest under group c0ntracts.l All Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have offered benefits complementary to Medicare on a group basis and virtually all on a nongroup basis. Benefits under the two types of contracts are similar. and includes all but two of the '75 Blue Cross plans in the United States and all but eight of the 73 Blue Shield plans in this country. The other plans either had not issued contracts by this date or had not sent copies of these contracts to the central organizations. Of the 135 nongroup contracts included in the analysis, 49 were issued separately by Blue Cross plans, 38 separately by Blue Shield plans, and 48 jointly by cooperating or paired Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Eighty-one of the 106 plans or pairs of plans offering contracts issued only one contract, 22 issued two contracts, 2 offered three contracts, and 1 issued four contracts. Where a Blue Cross plan has offered a contract independently, the benefits generally complement the hospital insurance program (Part A of Medi- care). Where a Blue Shield plan has issued a contract independently, the benefits complement the supplementary medical insurance program (Part B) . Contracts issued jointly by cooperating or paired Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans com- plement both Part A and Part B. Also offering contracts that supplement both parts of the pro- gram are those Blue Cross plans not affiliated with a Blue Shield plan and those Blue Shield plans not affiliated with a Blue Cross plan that offer both hospital and medical benefits to their subscribers. The distribution of the 135 contracts by the part of Medicare complemented is as follows : Nongroup Contracts The following analysis of nongroup contracts is based upon copies of contracts of the individual plans supplied to the Office of Research and Statistics by the Blue Cross Association and the National Association of Blue Shield Plans. It relates to contracts received as of 3 anuary 1,196?, *Division of Long-Range Research and Program Studies, Ofike of Research and Statistics. 'These figures include a small number of the aged who retained their regular health insurance coverage because they wanted protection for dependents under age 65. WUElIN, AUWST I%7 Type of plan -. ~~~~ All plans..-.--m-w 135 43 25 87 ~~~~ Blue Cross ______________ 39 24 Blue Cross-Blue Shield-. 46 4 1 ii I In general, the contracts tend to fall into two groupsthose that provide a basic \"first dolIar\" coverage and those that use a \"major medical\" approach and cover a certain percentage of illness expense above a deductible amount. Of the total, a 112 are in the first group; 13 provide both basic and supplementary major medical benefits; and 10 are the comprehensive major medical type. Con.tracts complementary to Part A of Medi- care.-In all, 110 contracts complement in some way the hospital insurance provisions of Medi- care. Ten of these are of the comprehensive major medical t,ype and one provides a stipulated amount for each day of hospital confinement. Medicare's $40 in-hospital deductible is covered in full by 95 of the 99 contracts providing basic benefits; two other contracts cover the deductible in part. All but two contracts pay the $10 per day coinsurance amount for the 61st to the 90th day of hospital care. Fifty-three contracts pro- vide additional days of hospital care, generally 30 days, beyond the 90 provided under Medicare. Two plans--those for Massachusetts and Dela- ware-provide 275 additional days of hospital care under the more comprehensive of their con- tracts. Part A of Medicare covers hospital outpatient care for diagnostic studies but not for treatment. Virtually all the basic benefit contracts provide some outpatient benefits for care of accidental injury, Most of them stipulat,e that such care must be given within a certain number of hours (commonly 72) of the accident. Forty-two pro- vide outpatient care for emergency illness such as a stroke, sunstroke, heart attack, or diabetic coma. Eighty-six cont,racts cover outpatient care for minor surgery-that is, charges for use of the operating room. Forty-two contracts provide some benefits for one or more types of therapy on an outspatient basis. Radiation therapy is most commonly pro- vided, and physical therapy is next in frequency. A few contracts cover shock therapy or cobalt therapy. Twelve contracts cover all types of therapy that the hospital is equipped to provide on an outpatient basis. These benefits are usually limited to continued care of the condition for which the patient had been hospitalized. Fifty-nine of the basic benefit contracts pro- vide for full payment of Medicare's $20 deducti- ble for outpatient diagnostic studies, and three more pay part of this deductible. Fifty-five con- tracts cover the 20-percent coinsurance. Benefits in extended-care facilit,ies are provided by 41 contracts. Of these contracts, 35 pay the $5 a day for the 21st to t.he 100th day of care and 13 pay all or part of the cost of additional days of care beyond 100. Most of these 13 contracts provide a dollar allowance ($5-$12) against the cost, of care for a specified number of days (30- 260). A few pay the full cost of care for an addi- tional 20 or 60 days, and some provide additional days but require the patient to pay $5 a day toward the cost. Prescribed drugs outside the hospital are cov- ered to some extent under nine of the basic benefit contracts, all of which pay 80 percent of the charges incurred for drugs above a deductible of $10 to $25, within a specified period after dis- charge from the hospital. Under most contracts the drug must have been prescribed in connection with the condition for which the patient was hospitalized. Private-duty nursing is covered to some extent under five of the 99 contracts. The benefit pro- vided is 80 percent of the charges incurred up to specified maximums in terms of dollars, hours of nursing, or both. Most of the 13 contracts that offer both basic and supplementary benefits provide additional coverage of hospital care and some care in ex- tended-care facilities by paying a specified portion of the cost (usually 80 percent) above a deduct- ible-typically, $100. Contracts complementary to Part B of Medi- care.--Ninety-two contracts provide some cover- age that complements the medical benefits under Medicare. Of these, 22 that cover physician services only on a major medical basis are dis- cussed later. Eight other contracts provide only an indemnity allowance ($3, $4, or $5) for each day of care while the person was in the hospital. The remaining 62 contracts pay all or part of the $50 deductible for medical insurance and all or part of the coinsurance amount for surgery and in- hospital physician visits. Thirty-three of these contracts provide full coverage of both the de- ductible and coinsurance amounts, 21 cover fully only the coinsurance amount, five cover fully only the deductible, and the rest pay part of one or the other or both. Thirty-one of t,he 62 contracts also pay the deductible or coinsurance amounts for X-ray diagnosis and radiation therapy in the ofice and/ or hospital outpatient department. Some of these 4 SOCIAL SECURITY contracts also cover the deductible and coinsur- ance on emergency care charges for visits either to a hospital outpatient department or to a physi- cian's office or for both types of visits. Twelve contracts cover all types of physician services, including office and home calls. Of these, four pay both the deductible and coinsurance amounts; five pay just the coinsurance; the rest pay some part of either the deductible or coinsurance or both. Contracts tying a \"major medical\" approach.- A major medical approach is used in part or in whole by 23 contracts, one of which covers only hospital care. Twelve of the remaining 22 pro- vide some basic benefits complementary to Part, A of Medicare-that is, they pay all or part, of the $40 deductible and the 20-percent coinsurance amount; they then cover expense for additional hospital care and charges for physician services and appliances on a major medical basis, paying 80 percent of the charges above a deductible (generally $100). The payment that the insured person makes out of pocket for the deductible and coinsurance amounts under Part H of Medi- care is included as reimbursable expense. Thus, after the deductibles are taken care of, Medicare and the complementary coverage together would pay 96 percent of physicians' reasonable charges -80 percent through Medicare and 80 percent of t.he remaining 20 percent through the comple- mentary coverage. Ten contracts provide all their benefits on a major medical basis, paying 80 percent (in one case, 75 percent) of covered expense above a deductible of $100 (in a few cases, $50). Covered expense includes expenses not paid or reimbursed by Medicare for hospital care, physician services, and, to some extent, drugs (six plans), appliances (six plans), private-duty nursing (six plans), and care in extended-care facilities (four plans). Maximum lifetime benefits under these plans, as well as under the supplementary major medical plans, are in most cases $10,000. Coverage outside the United States.-Most con- tracts provide for some coverage of medical care expenses outside the United States. Medicare does not cover these expenses at all. Ninety-eight of the 135 contracts provide at least some coverage, and 31 of these provide less coverage outside the IJnited States than they do within the country by paying only a specified percent of covered charges or by imposing limits on the number of days of hospital care or the aggregate dollar amount of benefits. A few stipulate that benefits will not be furnished if the subscriber has been out of the United States for more than a specified period, say 6 months. Exclusions and limitations.-Almost half (59) of the 135 contracts exclude benefits for pre- existing conditions until after a certain number of months of enrollment. Under the majority of these contracts this waiting period is 6 months; under the others, 3, IO, 11, or 12 months. A few contracts impose a waiting period for benefits for other specified conditions, notably care for hem- orrhoids, hernias, and diseases not common to both sexes. Probably most of the holders of these nongroup complementary contracts had Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage before Medicare and they would not be affected b;r such restrictions. Many contracts limit benefit days for care of mental illness or for care in psychiatric hospitals to fewer than the number provided for general illness. Fifteen contracts exclude all benefits for care in mental and tuberculosis hospitals. A'ubscription churges.-Most contracts issued singly by Blue Cross, mainly complementing Part I\\ of Medicare, cost between $2 and $3 a month. This is also the most frequent charge for the separate Blue Shield contracts complementing Part B. Most contracts written jointly by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and complementing both parts of Medicare cost between $4 and $6 a month. The following tabulation shows the monthly nongroup subscription charges for these con- tracts : Contracta wmplementing- Monthly cast Total number of Information on cost not available; contract subsequently withdrawn. EULLETIN, AUGUST 1967 5 Many aged persons with Blue Cross-Blue Shield complementary coverage complain that they are paying for these contracts almost as much as they were paying for t,heir Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage before Medicare. In some cases, this is true. The explanation is probably not that these complementary contracts are overpriced, but that before Medicare the aged members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans were being heavily subsi- dized by the younger members. The 40 percent of all aged members of these plans who had group coverage in many cases had been paying only one-third to one-half the cost of the care utilized. Aged persons who were formerly covered under group conversion contracts, on which the plans generally lost money, were also being heavily subsidized by the younger members. Under the present complementary contracts the aged, for the first time, are being asked to pay their own way. The subscription charges for the complemen- tary contracts are distinctly lower than the rates at which the Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans offered initial nongroup enrollment to older persons before Medicare. In 1962-63 the Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans made a national effort to offer a good level of protection to older people. Under the initial nongroup enrollment programs offered, the combined Blue Cross-Blue Shield charges ranged from $6.00 t,o over $16.00 per month, with a majority costing between $8.00 and $14.50 per mont,h.* Financial experience alone can measure whether the present nongroup complementary contracts are fairly priced. Group Contracts The complementary benefits made available to aged persons under group contracts are similar to those under nongroup contracts. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans tailor their contracts to provide what groups, especially large groups, desire. Generally, the employer or union wants to provide identical benefits for all members of the group. Where the group's benefits were 'Louis S. Reed, Blue Gross-Blue Shield Nongroup Cov- erage for OZder People, Research Report No. 4, Office of Research and Statistics, Social Security Administration, 1963. broader than benefits under Medicare in impor- tant respects-for example, full hospital care for 180 or 365 days and service benefits (at least for those under a specified income level) for surgery and in-hospital physician visits-the general prac- tice, the Blue Cross Association reports, has been for the group to provide the same benefits to older employees and covered annuitants, with Medicare benefits \"carved out.\" Under this ar- rangement, Medicare is in effect the primary car- rier for aged members, and the group plan simply pays for t,he benefits not paid for by Medicare. Under this arrangement in large experience-rated groups, no price is put upon the complementary coverage provided to older members. The experi- ence on them is simply melded into that for the group as a whole. Where the group's coverage was generally less extensive than that of Medicare, some employers terminated coverage for older members, and the plan then made its nongroup complementary cov- erage available to these persons on a direct-pay- ment basis. In other cases, particularly in moderate or smaller groups with benefits not markedly greater than those under Medicare, the employer or union continued its former coverage for t,he younger members and provided to t.he older mem- bers, on a group basis, benefits identical with the plan's nongrodp complementary coverage, de- scribed above. In such a case, the subscription rate for the older person was generally somewhat less t,han the plan's nongroup rate. Summary In general, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield complementary coverage mainly fills in the gaps between Medicare and the usual Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage. Only to a moderate degree do the plans offer benefits that go beyond those that had been previously offered. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans have moved steadily toward the provision of more compre- hensive benefits-X-ray and laboratory service outside the hospital, physician's office and home visits, visiting-nurse service, nursing-home care, and drugs. In some cases this broadening of benefits has been accomplished by extension of 6 SOCIAL SECURITY basic benefits, in other cases through extended- benefit or supplementary major medical pro- grams. The complementary coverage shows a cautious continuation of this trend. Although most of the contracts do not depart from familiar territory, a few do go far toward providing comprehensive health coverage. Notable in this respect is the most comprehensive of the t,hree contracts offered jointly by the Massachu- setts Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. This contract, provides-in addition to paying the de- ductible and coinsurance amounts under Part A of Medicare and for surgery, in-hospital physi- cian visim, and continued physician care in the office and in the home after hospitalization-275 added days of hospital care, an allowance of $8 a day for 265 additional days' care in extended- care facilities, and some coverage of charges for drugs and private-duty nursing and for care out,- side the United States. One feature of these complementary contracts requires additional comment-their complexity. Many aged persons would find it difficult to understand what t,he contracts offer. Contracts that must exclude Medicare benefits, fill in gaps, or extend additional benefits probably cannot fail to be complex. INSURANCE COMPANIES Before Medicare, insurance companies covered approximately 6.2 million persons aged 65 and over for hospital expense-about one-third of them under group policies and two-thirds under individual policies, with some having both types.3 On the basis of its 1967 surveys of insurance companies, the Health Insurance Association of America estimates that at the end of 1966, 4.9 million aged persons had hospital expense pro- tection from insurance companies-2 million un- der group policies and 2.9 million under individ- ual policies. The Association concludes tenta- tively that few aged persons have both group and individual coverage or more than one indi- vidual policy. 'The Health Insurance Association of America has estimated that, at the end of 1963, 2.6 million aged persons were insured under group policies and 4.4 million under individual policies. Adjustment for persons holding more than one policy brought the net number of different persons covered to 6.2 million. Individual Policies Most of the larger writers of individual health insurance policies have continued to offer some coverage to older persons. One very large com- pany has offered such coverage only to persons who were previously insured by it whose coverage was reduced or terminated with the introduction of Medicare. Insurance companies have liquidated the cooperative programs (the \"State 65\" plans) that they had in a few States for offering cover- age to older persons before Medicare. These plans had about 250,000 aged persons enrolled on the eve of Medicare.4 A recently published report of the Health In- surance Institute describes new individual health insurance policies made available, as of July 1966, to persons aged 65 and over.5 The report lists 59 companies that have offered \"hospital-patient income plans.\" The common feature of these plans is that they pay the insured person a stated amount for each day of a hospital confinement, which \"may be used to pay for hospital services not covered by Medicare or to take care of the many personal expenses of a hospitalization.\" Typical benefit amounts are $5 or $10 a day, $50 to $100 a week, and $100 to $500 a month. Most of the plans provide benefits for up to a year, a few for 6 months or 90 days. A number of companies, in recognition of the coinsurance under Medicare after 60 days of hospitalization, pay a smaller amount for l-60 days of hospitaliza- tion and then a larger amount for each day thereafter. A few plans pay the $40 deductible. Most commonly, the plans pay a flat amount per day or week for each day of hospitalization. More than half of the companies provide, under one policy or another, additional benefits that are generally optional at a higher rate. Most common are benefits for nursing-home care, for which benefits of $5.00 or $7.50 a day for 60 or 90 days are frequently paid. A number of compa- nies otl'er other benefits-reimbursement of surgi- cal expense, for example, and, less frequently, benefits for outpatient care or private-duty nursing.

'Report on New Health Ineurance Policies of Insurance Companies Available to Those 65 and Over-ae of July 1, 1966. BULLETIN, AUGUST 1967 7 About half the companies have no age limits for applicants for insurance; others have an entrance age limit of 70, 75, or 80. In general, only aged persons considered to be in reasonably good health would be accepted or known health conditions would be waived. Some policies are guaranteed renewable for life; some are renew- able at the option of the company ; others are continuable unless terminated for all residents of the State. Nine companies afe listed as providing \"medi- cal expense reimbursement plans (while in-or-out of the hospital).\" These plans provide a stated dollar amount for each day of hospital care or a stated percentage of hospital expense during the hospital stay, with benefits arranged so that the plan does not pay charges covered by Medicare. Most of the plans provide fairly comprehensive benefits, generally on a major medical basis and pay 80 percent of covered expense above the Medicare deductibles plus a $50 or $100 deducti- ble. After the deductibles are satisfied, these plans together with Medicare would pay 96 percent of the reasonable charges for physician services, for example. The principal offerings of three of the largest writers of individual accident and health insur- ance--Mutual of Omaha, Bankers Life and Cas- ualty, and Continental Casualty-are described in some detail below. Company A's principal plan provides a benefit of $100 a week for 26 weeks at an annual premium of $111.60 ($9.30 a month), $122.40, or $133.32, depending on State of residence. Riders changing the benefits to $50 or $150 a week are available at equivalent rates. Preexisting conditions are covered after one year. The policy is offered to all aged persons irrespective of state of health, and the company may not refuse to renew the policy or may not change the premium unless like action is taken for all persons of the same classifi- cation in the State. Another policy, available at a cost of $57 a year, pays the first $40 of hospital expense ; $10 a day for the 61st to the 90th day; $25 a day for hospital room and board and 80 percent of ex- pense for ancillary services for care after t'he 90th day; $5 a day for care in extended-care facilities from the 21st to 100th day; and the first $20 and 20 percent of subsequent charges for outpatient hospital diagnostic services. Company B insures the majority of its aged policyholders under a policy that pays for each hospital confinement in a general hospital the first $40 of hospital expense, $10 a day of covered ex- pense for the 61st through 90t.h day, and 80 per- cent, of covered expense from the 91st through 365th day-all subject to a lifetime benefit maxi- mum of $10,000 per insured person. Covered expenses are hospital board and room up to $25 a day and other necessary hospital services, not including services of physicians. Before Medi- care became effective, this policy was originally offered to all aged policyholders, who were urged to change over to it. The charge is $3 a mont.h for persons aged 65-69, $3.50 for those aged 70-74, and $4 a month for t.hose aged 75 and over. The policy is guaranteed renewable at rates that apply to all persons of specified aged groups in the State of residence. Other featured policies pay $50 a week or $100 a week during hospitalization. Preexisting and a few specified conditions, including mental illness and heart disease, are excluded. Standard risks bet)ween age 65 and age 69 pay a premium of $8.80 a month, and the premium goes up $1 a month for each next older B-year age group. Per- sons with known health conditions-overweight, diabetes, heart trouble, and the like-may be accepted at higher premiums. Company C has two principal plans, one of which pays $70 a week for 52 weeks at a cost of $8 per month and another that pays $110 a week for 52 weeks at a cost of $12.50 per month. The insured is covered immediately for accident or sickness, but for preexisting conditions there is a 6-month waiting period. Hospital care for mental illness is excluded except for the first 13 weeks of confinement with a 26-week lifetime maximum. Benefits for out-of-hospital drugs, out-of-hospital private-duty nursing, and nurs- ing-home care are available at an additional cost. Policies paying a stipulated amount per day of hospitalization have the advantage of adminis- trative simplicity-the company need not find out what Medicare has paid or will pay. Such policies are also readily understood by the pros- pective purchaser or policyholder. They have the drawback that under some circumstances they may encourage excessive hospital utilization, since the insured person gets a specified amount for each day he stays in the hospital. SOCIAL SRCURITY Group Coverage All or virtually all companies writ,ing group health insurance are offering coverage comple- mentary to Medicare. They must offer such cover- age if insured groups are to be retained or new groups to be acquired. Under group insurance a company will write virtually any plan that a large employer or union welfare fund desires. In general the em- ployer or union wants to provide benefits to aged active employees and t)heir dependents (and to retired aged employees and their dependents, if that is desired) that will usually equal those available to younger employees. It is generally felt that aged covered persons should not suffer, because of Medicare, any loss of benefits formerly available to them under the general program. Thus, where the group% coverage is broader than that of Medicare in significant respects, the em- ployer or welfare fund will wish to supplement Medicare benefits to bring them up to the level of those for active employees. Naturally the form of this supplementation tends to depend on the general nature of the group's plan-that is, whether it provides basic (first dollar) benefits, comprehensive major medical benefits, or some combination of basic plus supplementary major medical benefits. Where the group's overall coverage is less extensive than that of Medicare and the employer does not wish to \"beef it up\" to make it more or less comparable with Medicare, the employer will usually terminate coverage for aged persons. Most companies have developed coverage of a more or less standard pattern, supplementing either their basic or their major medical plans. One large company offers, to groups having a 70-day basic hospital plan, coverage supplement- ing the hospital benefits of Medicare that pays the $40 deductible and the coinsurance amount for the 61st to 70th day; the initial premium for this coverage is 91 cents a month. A 120-day hospital plan can be supplemented by coverage that pays the deductible, $10 for the 61st to 90th day, and a daily benefit in amounts ranging from $10 to $35 for the 91st to 120th day; t,he initial charge varies from $1.18 to $1.39 a month depend- ing on the amount of the daily benefit. In both cases, as is the general pract,ice for large groups, after, the cost for this coverage would be experi- enced-rated with that for the group as a whole. For groups with a basic surgical coverage, coverage complementary to the medical benefits of Medicare is available that pays 30 percent of the scheduled amount, under the present surgical schedule; the initial premium varies from 24 cents a month for a $150 surgical schedule to 5% cents a month for a $500 schedule. For groups having a comprehensive major medical expense plan (but no basic coverage), the standard complementary coverage offered pays 80 percent of covered expenses, after an initial deductible of $50, $100, or $150 for private- duty registered nurses, out-of-hospital prescribed drugs, and the first three pints of blood. The initial premium ranges from $3.78 to $2.65 per month depending upon the deductible. The as- sumption here, clearly, is that Medicare coverage of all other types of expense is good enough and requires no supplementation. It will be noted that claims under all these plans can be adminis- tered without reference to what the aged person has received or will receive under Medicare. Another large company usually recommends a major medical type of coverage that pays 75 or 80 percent of covered expenses beyond those paid by Medicare and a calendar-year deductible of perhaps $100. Covered medical expenses include nursing, drug, hospital, and physician charges. There is a lifetime benefit maximum of $5,000, subject to restoration on the basis of proof of insurability. Prices vary with the geographical area, but a typical first-yetlr premium is about $7 a month. One major company's standard Medicare sup- plement pays 80 percent of covered medical ex- penses above a $50 deductible in any calendar year and up to a maximum benefit of $5,000. Covered medical expenses include essentially all inpatient hospital expenses not covered by Medi- care, charges for private-duty nurses, and ex- penses for drugs and medicine. Optional, more comprehensive benefit features available include coverage of physician charges, to the extent that such charges are not paid by Medicare because of application of the medical benefit deductible; do-percent coinsurance charges for physician services under the medical insurance part of Medicare; actual hospital charges for outpatient services; coverage of private-room charges up to certain amounts. The charges for the standard BULLETIN, AUGUST 1967 9 Medicare supplement begin at about $2.69 in the lowest-cost area with a $100 deductible and go as high as $13.80 in the highest-cost area, with a $10,000 benefit maximum and the most com- prehensive benefit features available. All companies will also provide complementary coverage on a \"benefit offset\" formula, under which expenses paid by Medicare are deducted from similar benefits payable under the group's regular health insurance plan. The insurance companies have not encouraged this approach because it presents difficult claims administration problems. Many companies have bought this ap- proach, however, because of their bargaining agreements or other reasons. Another approach followed by some policy- holders is to continue existing benefit plans with- out change for persons aged 65 and over. These policyholders rely on the application of the \"government exclusion\" clauses or \"coordination with other benefits\" provisions to integrate the benefits of their existing plans with those pro- vided by Medicare. In plans with a \"government exclusion\" clause, the described benefits of the plan apply to all expenses not paid for by Medi- care. When a plan relies on the \"coordination\" provision the regular benefits that would have been payable in the absence of Medicare are reduced only to the extent necessary to prevent the individual from collecting more than 100 percent of all medical expenses covered either by Medicare or the policyholder's plan. Both these arrangements are rather liberal and result in a combined plan (Medicare and the policyholder's) that provides benefits at a level approaching lOO-percent reimbursement of most medical ex- penses. INDEPENDENT PLANS Before Medicare, the \"independent\" health in- surance plans (all plans other than Blue Cross, Blue Shield, and insurance companies) covered at least 435,000 persons aged 65 and over for hospital care and about 500,000 for one or more types of physician services.G 'These estimates are based on the 1966 survey of the larger independent plans, made by the Office of Research and Statistics, in which the plans were asked to report the number of persons aged 65 and over who were covered at the end of lQ66. Preliminary data from the 1967 survey of the larger independent plans indicate that the num- ber of aged persons covered at the end of 1966 was smaller by 10-20 percent. About one-third of those covered are members of community plans, and about two-thirds belong to employer- employee-union plans. Community Group-Practice Plans About 75 percent of the total enrollment in the community plans is in eight large group- practice plans-the Kaiser Health Plans of Northern and Southern California, Oregon, and Hawaii ; the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York ; Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (Seattle, Washington) ; Community Health Association (Detroit) ; and Group Health Association (Washington, D. C.) . All these plans provide comprehensive cover- age of hospital care and physician service.? Some also provide (to all or some of their subscribers) other benefits-visiting-nurse service, for ex- ample, drugs, and private-duty nursing in the hospital. In general, these plans offer to aged persons their regular benefits with the Medicare benefits \"carved out,\" usually at rates lower than those paid by other subscribers, and the plans are reimbursed by Medicare for their estimated costs in providing those services for which Medi- care assumes responsibility. The Northern California Kaiser plan provides to aged subscribers entitled to hospital and medi- cal benefits under Medicare, with the subscriber paying the $3 monthly supplementary medical insurance charge : (a) all necessary physician services at a charge of $1 for each office visit and a charge for each home visit equal to 20 percent of the prevailing rates; (b) all necessary hospital care for up to 111 days of care in each spell of illness ; (c) physicial checkups, hearing tests, and eye examinations for glasses at a charge of $1 per visit; (d) out-of-hospital prescribed drugs at. reduced charges ; (e) immunizations at no charge; (f) prescribed private-duty nursing dur- ing covered hospitalization ; (g) post-hospital care in extended-care facilities at no charge for 50 days (with the plan paying the $5 a day for the 'One plan-the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York-does not provide hospital care, but subscribers are required to have this coverage from other sources. 10 21st-50th days) and at $5 a day for the remain- ing 50 days; (h) 200 home health services at no charge; and (i) 80 percent of charges for appli- ances and rental of durable medical equipment. The plan is reimbursed by Medicare for its estimated costs in furnishing that part of these services to which the subscriber is entitled under Medicare. The charge of this complementary coverage is $5.60 a month for group subscribers -slightly more for individual subscribers. The other Kaiser plans have roughly similar arrange- ments. The Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York provides complete physician service to its subscribers, including service in extended-care facilities, physical checkups, immunizations, and eye examinations. Aged persons who are covered for both parts of Medicare and have complemen- tary coverage are entitled to the same services, for which the charge is $1.50 a month for group enrollees, $5.45 per quarter for direct-payment enrollees who enrolled before Medicare, and $9.95 per quarter for individuals who enrolled after the start of Medicare. Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound provides its regular benefits to persons aged 65 and over. These benefits include complete hos- pital care for 180 days ; complete physician serv- ices in the hospital, clinic, home, and extended- care facility ; all out-of-hospital prescription drugs; special-duty nursing in the hospital; and authorized ambulance service in the area. The charge for the complementary coverage is $6 a month to Cooperative members and $6.75 to others. The plan's regular subscription charges for adult members are $9 a month, and its charges to persons aged 65 and over who are not covered by both parts of Medicare are $13.50 a month. Community Individual Practice Plans There is only one large plan of this nature- Group Health Insurance, Inc. (New York City). Its most popular types of coverage are the \"semi- private\" and \"family doctor\" plans. The first covers surgery, in-hospital medical visits, diag- nostic X-ray and laboratory examinations in the office, home, and hospital, and visiting-nurse service. Participating physicians (almost 10,000 in the metropolitan area) agree to accept the plan's payments as full payment if, in case of hospitalization, the subscriber usas ward or semi- private accommodations. The family doctor plan provides the same services plus physician's office and home visits, including preventive care. Par- ticipating \"family doctors\" (usually general practitioners) accept the plan's payments for office and home calls ($4 and $6, respectively) as full payment for their services; other physi- cians may charge extra. The regular rate for the individual subscriber is $1.65 a month for the semiprivate plan and $3.90 for the family doctor plan. Both plans are offered on a group basis, and groups of more than 100 members are experience-rated after the first year. Groups may elect to have their aged members who are eligible for both parts of Medicare re- ceive complementary coverage--in effect, the benefits described above with relevant Medicare benefits \"carved out.\" In the first year, the group's rates are reduced by 1 percent if the aged persons are covered at the so-called \"Medicare reasonable charge\" level and by lv2 percent if aged persons are covered at the plan level of pay- ment; after the first year, the rates are based on the experience of the group as a whole. Employer-Employee-Union Plans About 500 plans are operated by employers, union-management welfare funds, employee bene- fit associations, and unions. Some 20 of the larger plans have about one-half the total enrollment. The complementary programs of a few of the larger ones are described here. The United Mine Workers Welfare and Retire- ment Fund provides, in combination with Medi- care, fairly comprehensive medical care to aged beneficiaries. The beneficiaries must have enrolled for Medicare's medical benefits in order to receive any UMW health benefits, which include un- limited care in hospitals and nursing homes, physician services in the office, home, and hospital (including routine physical examinations and im- munizations) , outpatient diagnostic service, out- of-hospital prescription drugs, and eyeglasses for cataract cases. These benefits are considerably broader than those furnished to beneficiaries under age 65 by the plan. The plan is considered by Medicare to be a group-practice plan and is reimbursed for its costs in providing Part B bene- fits to aged beneficiaries. BUUETIN, AUGUST 1967 11 The Health Plan of the National Association of Letter Carriers-serving about 24,000 aged persons-is one of the employee organization plans providing benefits under the Federal em- ployees health benefits plan. Most of the aged persons served are not eligible for hospital care under Medicare ; some have enrolled for medical benefits under the program and some have not. This plan pays the first $3,000 of hospital charges for room and board, the first $1,000 of other hospital charges, and 80 percent of all subsequent charges. It pays actual charges up t'o specified scheduled allowances for surgery ($400 maxi- mum) and, after the member has paid the next $200 of the surgical charge, 80 percent of the balance of any additional customary and reason- able charges. For all other medical expense (physicians' charges for other types of services, prescribed drugs, private-duty nursing, artificial limbs, etc.) it, pays, in each calendar year, 80 per- cent of charges above a $50 deductible, up to a maximum of $15,000. Aged persons, notwithstanding eligibility for Medicare benefits, pay the same rates as younger members and receive the same benefits. (Under the Federal Employees Healt,h Benefits Act, ap- proved plans may offer benefim at only two rates--one for the employee or annuitant alone and another for the employee or annuitant and family. Special contracts at 'special rates for those enrolled under either or bot,h parts of Medi- care therefore cannot be offered by any plan.) In general, the plan totals all expenses of an ill- ness, subtracts the amount,s that Medicare will pay, and pays the lesser of the balance or what it would have to pay if it were not for Medicare. The plan of a large tire and rubber company (like that of three other large companies in the industry, which also self-insure for hospital, surgical, and in-hospital medical benefits) pro- vides that benefits covered by both Medicare and the company's hospitalization plan will be paid by Medicare. Benefits payable under the company plan but not provided by Medicare continue to be paid under the company plan, so that, as the com- pany explains to the plan members, \"under no circumstances will the total benefits from Medi- care and the company plan be less than the bene- fits you (the retired employee) would have received under the company plan without Medi- care.\" The same provision is made with respect to surgical and in-hospital medical benefits. The company encourages employees to enroll for Part B of Medicare to take advantage of the extra benefits provided by it. A similar pattern is followed by various other large company plans or union self-insured pro- grams that provide physician services on a fee- for-service basis. They \"carve out\" or fill in and add t,o the Medicare benefits so that the benefits for the aged enrollees are never less than those for younger employees. The pattern under the various employer- employee-union plans that provide benefim through group practice (such as those of the railroad associations) is similar to the community group-practice plans previously described. In general, the aged person is entitled to the plan's regular benefits and the plan is reimbursed for its costs in providing that share of the benefim for which Medicare is responsible. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFIT PROGRAMS This account of complementary coverage to Medicare would not be complete without some discussion of the complementary coverage pro- vided under the health benefit programs of the Federal Government for its active or retired employees. Special problems exist in such cover- age because Medicare does not cover certain Federal employees and annuitants and their de- pendents? and because the provisions of the Federal employee programs are established through legislation. Under t.he Federal Employees Health Benefits Act t,hat, covers active employees and those who have retired since the inaugurat,ion of t,he plan in 1960 (almost 7.5 million persons), employees have a choice among 36 approved plans: A Govern- ment-wide service benefit plan offered by Blue (Iross-Blue Shield, a Government-wide indemnity plan offered by a large group of insurance com- panies and managed by the Aetna Life Insurance Company, 15 plans of employee organizations, 'Hospital insurance under Medicare covers all persons aged 65 and over who are or would be eligible for old-age benefits and transitionally all other aged persons except those enrolled in a health benetlts plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act or who were so enrolled on February 16, 1965, or could have enrolled at that time or subsequently. 12 SOCIAL SECURITY 12 local group-practice plans, and 7 local indi- vidual practice plans. The existing legislation authorizes the Civil Service Commission to per- mit each approved plan to offer two levels of benefits (a high option and a low option) on a dual rate basis-that is, a rate for the employee (or annuitant) alone and a rate for the employee (or annuitant ) and dependents. As Medicare began operations, there were about 125,000 employees or annuitants covered under this Federal employees' program who were aged 65 and over, many of whose spouses had also reached that age. About 40 percent of these persons, the Civil Service Commission est,imates, were eligible for hospital benefits under Medicare because of private employment and 60 percent were not eligible ; all could enroll for medical benefits under Part B of Medicare. Under the Act, the Civil Service Commission could not permit approved plans to offer separate benefit packages to those aged 65 and over. To assist aged annuit,ants in determining what action they should take with respect to Medicare-that is, whether they should enroll for Part B of Medicare, continue their coverage under the Federal employees' program, or drop that cover- age-the Commission informed annuitants of the considerations to be kept in mind in making their decisions: Whether the annuitant was eligi- ble for Part A of Medicare ; whether he had dependents under age 65 for whom he wished to retain the coverage of the Federal employees' program ; and the relative costs and scope of his Federal employee plan in comparison with those of the two parts of Medicare. Medicare pays its benefits irrespective of other coverage and is thus always the primary carrier. The Commission contracted with approved plans that, in settling claims for persons eligible for Medicare, they were to pay expenses not covered by Medicare up to the limits of their benefit coverage but not more than 100 percent of covered expenses. Under the retired Federa.l employees health benefits program (the program for employee annuitants who had retired before the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act was passed and their survivor annuitants) approximately 300,000 persons were covered before Medicare. The great majority of these annuitants were over age 65 and eligible for hospital benefits under Medicare and eligible to enroll for medical benefits under that program. Within the program for retired Federal em- ployees, eligible annuitants have a choice between a \"uniform plan\" and any private health insur- ance plan that they elect. Toward the cost of either plan the Government contributes $3.50 a month for a person enrolling for himself alone and $7 for a person enrolling for himself and his dependents. Under the \"uniform plan\" enrollees are offered a choice of three specific contracts: a \"basic coverage\" only (providing very limited indem- nity payments for hospital care and surgery) ; a \"major medical\" coverage that excludes benefits payable under the basic coverage ; and a \"basic plus major medical benefit\" coverage. The cost of the basic coverage for a single person is $7.50 ; for the major medical coverage, it is $7; and for both contracts the cost is $14.50 a month. The Civil Service C'ommission also wrote to annuitants under this program, suggesting that they enroll in both parts of Medicare. The annuitants' attention was drawn to the considera- tions they should take into account in deciding whether to drop the uniform plan, drop their private plan, or switch from the uniform plan to a private plan (or vice versa). Most annuitants under this program who had private plans had Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage and could advantageously, in most, cases, change to a non- group complementary coverage. For those who remained with the uniform plan, t,here could, of course, be no change in benefits, but the Civil Service Commission contracted, as for the plans under the health benefits program for active Federal employees, that the plan would reimburse covered persons for covered expenses beyond t,hose paid for by Medicare up to the limit of what, the plan would have paid out if Medicare had not existed, but not more than 100 percent of covered expenses. Under the contractual arrangements, both the plans for active Federal employees and those for the retired Federal employees complement the Medicare. coverage (up to 100 percent of allowable expense), regardless of whether the employee is enrolled under only one or both parts of Medicare and regardless of whether he has a spouse or other dependent who is under age 65 and therefore not eligible for Medicare. WLLETIN, AUGUST 1967 13 The problems of optimum coordination of Medicare benefits and benefits available under the Federal employee health benefit programs can- not be solved without legislative changes in the acts governing the Federal employee programs or Medicare, or both. The Civil Service Com- mission has proposed legislation for changes in the Federal employee health benefit programs that would aid in the achievement of this objective. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Most private health insurance organizations have offered contracts to the aged that comple- ment Medicare. This complementary coverage has been widely purchased or otherwise obtained by older persons. Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans now have about 87 percent as many aged persons enrolled as they had before Medicare. Insurance companies had about 80 percent, as many aged persons enrolled at the end of 1966 as were en- rolled before Medicare. The number of persons aged 65 and over that are covered by the inde- pendent plans is between 80 percent and 90 per- cent of that before Medicare. Probably more than 10 million aged persons now have some type of private complementary health insurance. It may be assumed that most of these had private insurance coverage before Medicare. In addition to those covered under private programs a considerable number of aged persons have or soon will have some protection complementary to Medicare under public pro- grams. Some 2.1 million needy aged persons are re- cipients of old-age assistance and thus eligible for the medical care that is available to them in their States. Additional numbers of aged per- sons with low incomes are eligible for medical care under the 29 State medical assistance pro- grams now in operation (as of May 10, 196'7) ; others will become eligible as additional States establish these programs. Through private health insurance or public programs, therefore, well over 60 percent of all aged persons now have or soon will have some provision for medical costs in addition to that which they have under Medicare. In general, Blue Cross and Blue Shield have offered complementary coverage to aged persons that fills in and adds on to the Medicare coverage to bring it closer to the level of protection offered to younger persons. A few plans have made available to aged persons a fairly comprehensive health coverage, but most have not ventured be- yond familiar areas. Insurance companies under their individual business have sold many policies providing stipu- lated payments for each day of hospital confine- ment. Such policies can be easily administered, but in some situations they may encourage over- utilization of hospital care. Insurance companies under group policies have tilled in or added on to the benefits provided under Medicare in various ways-by providing t,ypes of benefits not covered, by making the Medicare deductible and coinsurance amounts reimbursable expenses under major medical policies, or by \"carving out\" Medicare benefits from the regular group coverage. The independent plans have generally comple- mented Medicare by providing their regular bene- tits with benefits under Medicare \"carved out,.\" Plans that provide comprehensive coverage of physician services through group practice have continued this coverage for older persons and generally are reimbursed by Medicare on a cost basis for their expenses in providing that share of the services for which Medicare would be responsible. In large degree these complementary contracts are tilling in the deductibles and coinsurance amounts that the covered person has to pay under Medicare. One reason for the presence of these deductible and coinsurance features in the Medi- care program was that they would reduce the cost of the program to the Government. Un- doubtedly, another reason was the belief of some legislators that these features would be helpful in protecting the program against unnecessary utilization and excessive charges-that they would deter unnecessary hospital admissions, shorten hospital stays, and give covered persons an interest in obtaining physician services at reasonable costs. The growth of coverage complementary to health insurance for the aged under the Social Security Act, the extent to which the supple- ments alter hospital utilization or other cosm, and the implications of the developments for the program imelf call for continuing study. 14 SOCIAL SECURITY "}
