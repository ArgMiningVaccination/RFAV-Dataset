Dr. Edward Ehlinger welcomed participants to the virtual meeting . Dr. Ehlinger spoke about current events, such as the United Nations ' International Day of Peace and the first day of Sukkot and remind ed Committee members that both peace and stable housing are social determinant s of health that are especially important for mothers, infants, and children. Dr. Ehlinger also spoke about the dichotomy of the current state of public health, in which there is great opportunity to effect change in the public health system, but also great challenge in working amongst seemingly incompatible perspectives. He suggested that SACIM has an opportunity to model respectful and responsible discourse when discussing controversial topics. He asked Committee members to remain grounded in SACIM's values as they discuss and develop recommendations, and to be bold in advancing those recommendations forward. Recognition of David de la Cruz Edward Ehlinger, M.D ., M.S.P.H., SACIM Acting Chair Dr. Ehlinger recognized Dr. David de la Cruz for his 15 years of service as SACIM's DFO, and Dr. de la Cruz thanked Dr. Ehlinger and Committee members for the honor of serving. He commented that o ver the last 15 years, he has seen how SACIM supports a population that does not have a voice, representing them at the highest levels of HHS and beyond. He said that it is noble to serve this community and increase visibility on the policies and programs that can make an important difference. He encouraged Committee members to not be satisfied with the status quo or a \"no\" answer, but to be persistent in providing a voice to this often unheard and unseen population. Welcome and Comments by HHS Leadership Diana Espinosa, M.P.P., Acting HRSA Administrator Ms. Diana Espinosa, HRSA Deputy Administrator and Acting Administrator , thanked Committee members for their work, especially in the last 18 months as they stayed active and engaged despite the challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic. Ms. Espinoza stated that SACIM provides a respected voice of counsel to HRSA, which shares SACIM's goals of preventing infant and maternal mortality and improving the health of all mothers and children. She noted that SACIM's commitment to eliminate health disparities and achieve better maternal and infant health outcomes in vulnerable populations is very much aligned with the priorities of HRSA and the HHS Secretary. Ms. Espinosa provided an update on HRSA's recent activities that aligned with SACIM's recent recommendations to the Secretary. She noted the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disproportionately impact health workers serving rural areas and communities of color . In response, HRSA received $100 million through the American Rescue Plan to fund efforts to The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 2 reduce burnout and promote mental health among health workers, including not only physicians and nurses, but also paraprofessionals, public safety officers, and others on the front line of delivering care to vulnerable populations. Additional efforts that she said HRSA has s upported in response to the pandemic include a strengthening of telehealth services in rural and underserved communities and support for pediatric mental health care access. Ms. Espinosa said HRSA is also responding to the recommendation to support pregnant women, mothers, infants, and children at the border and are striving to keep families together and safe. HRSA considers health equity to be core to their mission and will continue to emphasize health equity throughout all of their bureaus. Examples she noted from MCHB included providing supplemental funding for Healthy Start grantees for community -based doulas and infant health equity efforts. Dr. Espinosa then introduced the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health. Rachel L. Levine, M .D., Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Dr. Rachel Levine thanked HRSA and MCHB for their dedication and leadership in the critical mission to reduce infant mortality and improv e the health status of pregnant women and infants. She talked about the challenges that the COVID -19 pandemic created for public health and medical professionals and encouraged all to receive the COVID -19 vaccination and become spokespersons for the safety and effectiveness of the vaccination program. Dr. Levine stated p regnant women are at higher risk for severe illness related to COVID-19 than non-pregnant women. Further, p regnant women with COVID-19 were also at high risk for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. She cited t he CDC analysis of their V- Safe program data which indicated that there was no increased risk of miscarriage among those who received a vaccination in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Miscar riage typically occurs in 11-16 percent of pregnancies, and the rate for those who received the COVID -19 vaccination was only around 13 percent. Additionally, she shared that data suggested there was no safety concern for pregnant women, or their babies, vaccinated later in pregnancy. Combined, these data show that the benefit of the COVID -19 vaccination outweigh any known risk, and t he increased circulation of the Delta variant has made the need for pregnant women to receive a vaccination more urgent than ever. Dr. Levine said ensuring a healthier future for all means that health disparities must be addressed , and that health equity was a priority for HRSA and also for the Office of the Assistant Secretary (OAS). COVID-19 had disproportionately impacted communities of color, especially the Black, Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native communities. She shared how the Biden-Harris Administration was pursuing a comprehensive approach to advance health equity for all, including the creation of the COVID -19 Health Equity Task Force , which would develop recommendations for President Biden. Other updates Dr. Levine shared were t he Office on Women's Health (OWH) was working to expand av ailable maternal health data , creating a network of at least 200 hospitals that would deploy evidence- based best practices for maternity care and analyze outcomes to understand the clinical and non- clinical factors that contribute d to health disparities . OWH would use these findings to scale advances in care for mothers and infants across the nation. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 3 The Office of Minority Health (OMH) and CDC's Division of Reproductive Health launched a series of partnerships to support state maternal mortality review te ams. They were also expanding the reach of the Hear Her campaign to include American Indian/Alaska Native women. Dr. Levine closed by mentio ning efforts to develop a standard definition of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Discussion Dr. Ehlinger stated that the Committee had sent COVID -related recommendations to the former Secretary last summer and then more recent ones this past August. He asked how SACIM recommendations reach the S ecretary . Dr. Levine responded that they often come through the HHS Office of Women's Health, and in addition OAS worked closely with HRSA. Ms. Espinosa also answered that HRSA closely collaborates with the OAS and could look back to recomm endations made in the previous administration because they were still relevant. Ms. Espinosa suggested that they could find a way to build in some regular, routine, structured way of making sure that the Office of the Secretary had an opportunity to engage in the recommendations going forward. Dr. Ehlinger asked how the OAS might leverage SACIM and vice versa. Dr. Levine answered that one impactful action to take now is to advocate for COVID -19 vaccination, specifically for pregnant women. Dr. Levine explained that far too many pregnant women get COVID-19 and suffer medical complications, which has a potential negative impact on their babies. Dr. Tara Sander Lee asked how HRSA and HHS plan on increasing vaccination rates at the border. Dr. Levine stated that there is an all -government response at the border, including from officers of the Public Health Service Commission , who have the important role of addressing COVID-19 vaccination at the border. Dr. Ehlinger asked what could be done to restore the credibility of public health in general, when it is currently under attack. Dr. Levine answered that it is important to view public health professionals as frontline workers who need the same level of support, collaboration, and coordination as clinical frontline professionals. Dr. Magda Peck asked for advice on handling the politici zation of data when there is doubt and pushback on the messaging of science. Dr. Levine agreed that the politicization of the COVID - 19 response has been a signifi cant challenge and stated the pandemic response is a public health issue, not a political issue. She shared the Biden -Harris Administration was letting the public health and medical professionals lead the way through regular communication and collaboration. She also said t he CDC had been transparent with their data, and t he data was driving public health decisions. Finally, Dr. Levine commented that t here wa s always an opportunity to improve communication about data and decision-making and they would continue to strive for that. She additionally noted the Surgeon General also had a program to address misinformation in social media. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 4 Discussion of July 2021 Recommendations Submitted to HHS Secretary Edward Ehlinger, SACIM Acting Chair Dr. Ehlinger asked Committee members to ref lect on how they have shared the August recommendations with partners in the public health and medical care fields. He shared the recommendations with all organizations representing maternal and child health, such as the Association for State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) , the American Public Health Association, and with his senators and r epresentatives. Dr. Magda Peck said that she has engaged with her partners at the local level, such as CityMatCH. However, she noted that many organizations fail to understand the purpose and power of SACIM, therefore Committee members also need to communicate the importance of their efforts more generally. She said that the current structure of the Committee allows for greater diffusion of work and faster turnaround on recommendations. Dr. Belinda Pettiford said she shared the recommendations with the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs ( AMCHP ), the National Healthy Start Association, and within her own s tate. She noted, however, that bandwidth has been limited due to the pandemic and the recommendations have not been a priority. Dr. Ehlinger added that there is a need for more efforts to proactively market and broadcast the importance of the Committee's work. Mr. Lee Wilson said he has since received feedback from the Office of the Secretary to move forward with programmatic review and engagement within the department and across agencies (i.e., CDC, NIH, FDA, CMS) for application and interpretation of t he recommendations. Dr. Peck voiced interest in alignment with other Federal advisory committees related to maternal and infant mortality prevention, including opportunities to leverage parallel efforts occurring within HHS or across the government more broadly. Dr. Warren said some of this happens at the bureau level and through engagement with other agencies and departments across the federal government. Dr. Paul Wise said his approach was to strengthen accountability and follow-up on the recommendations within HHS and beyond. He shared that he wanted to be able to gauge which recommendations were taken and which were not. He stated that i f no action was taken on some, the Committee ha d a responsibility to understand why agencies may have chosen inaction despite the strength of the recommendations. Update from the Maternal & Child Health Bureau Michael Warren, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.A.P., MCHB, HRSA Dr. Michael Warren provided an update from MCHB, which included a summary of the recent $350 million for maternal and child health: $342 million was allocated to the Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) ; and supplements were given to Healthy Start grantees, including 25 awards of $125,000 each for doula programs and 21 awards of $80,000 each to support the development of infant health equity action plans. He shared that the goal of the infant health equity action plans was to help Healthy Start sites engage new partners in the community and integrate a renewed focus on addressing social and structural determinants of health. The last supplement he described was for the State Systems Development Initiative (SSDI) which i ncluded award s to 10 states of $60,000 each to enhance the quality, timeliness, and accuracy of their maternal health data. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 5 Dr. Warren then shared that the President's proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 included several efforts related to the work of th is Committee. The re was a $5 million increase for the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) program , and a $30 million increase for the state maternal health innovation progr am. He described these as grants to states to support the development of a Maternal Health Task Force to leverage data from maternal mortality review committees, vital statistics, and other datasets to identify and respond to areas of need. Dr. Warren also highlighted t he President's budget proposed a $1 million supplement to the Maternal Mental Health Hotline that would be in addition to the $3 million p reviously allocated for this . He shared that the proposed budget also contained several new initiatives, including $25 million for a pregnancy medical home demonstration project, $5 million for implicit bias training grants for health providers, and $1 million for a National Academy of Medicine study. To conclude, Dr. Warren highlighted ongoing work of the Infant Health Equity Initiative, which aimed to eliminate excess infant deaths among communities of color and other marginalized populations and reach equity in infant mortality by 2030. Besides engaging a contractor to support planning, he shared that the initiative had convened federal partners internal to HHS and external to HHS , such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The meeti ngs had yielded important information about ongoing and upcoming plans across the government, as well as alignment of investments across HHS. Dr. Warren also reviewed the work happening with HHS region 5, which has the highest rates of Black infant mortality and the highest absolute gap between Black and White infant mortality. A virtual infant mortality summit for that region was scheduled for early November 2021, which he could report back on at the December 2021 meeting. Update from the Bureau of Health Workforce Sheila P radia Williams, RPh, M.B.A., Senior Advisor, Bureau of Health Workforce, HRSA CAPT Sheila P radia Williams provided an update on recent activities at the Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) in HRSA. She explained that the mission of the Bureau is to improve the health of underserved communities and populations by strengthening the health workforce and connecting that workforce to communities in need. She shared that BHW funds grant and direct service programs that seek to impact health professionals from education to training to service. CAPT Williams shared that i n 2021 and 2022, BHW had been emphasizing the importance of health equity. She explained that t he COVID -19 pandemic in particular had spurred priority areas in behavioral and community health with a thematic focus on health equity, diversity, and provider resilience. BHW aimed to affect change by impacting access to care, supply of providers, and distribution. She reported that much of this work was supported by the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis . CAPT Williams highlighted BHW's efforts to enhance health care quality through education and training programs that support ed evidence -based, cultu rally competent, patient- centered care. CAPT Williams highlighted several programs at BHW seek ing to increase workforce diversity. One was the Area Health Education Centers Program , which was designed to advance academic improvement-based partnership through longitudinal training and pipeline building among underserved communities. She explained that the longitudinal component involves revisiting The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 6 these individuals over the course of their professional education. Another effort CAPT Williams shared was the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students Program , a grant program that funds health profession schools to provide scholarships to students with economic need. She also mentioned t he Careers Opportunities Program , a pipeline program that used nontraditional methods to funnel disadvantaged individuals (e.g., financial need, language barriers) from high school through college and into a professions program. She shared that The Centers of Excellence Program focused on developing and strengthening institutions' capacity to diversify the health workforce in dentistry, public health, pharmacy, behavioral and mental health, and family medicine. Other programs she mentioned included the Nursing Workforce Diversity Program and the Loan Repayment and Scholarship Programs. CAPT Williams described BHW's allocation of $200 million in additional funds from the American Rescue Plan. She shared that to improve and distribute the supply of maternal care providers, BHW dedicated $10 million for women's health nur se practitioners, obstetrics and gynecology nurse practitioners, certified midwives, and OB/GYN registered nurses. Additionally, she shared that in 2021 they added nurse midwifery as an eligible discipline in the National Health Service Corps Student to Service Loan Repayment Program. In the summer of 2021, she shared that BHW allocated $16 million to a new effort, called Primary Care Training an d Enhancement (PCTE), a community prevention and maternal health program. She explained that PCTE trains primary care physicians in maternal care, clinical services, or population health to improve maternal outcomes and incr ease maternal health care expertise among primary care physicians. Through the National Center for Workforce Analysis, CAPT Williams said BHW has projected upcoming changes in the workforce that would inform the development of new policies and programs. She shared that they project ed that by 2030, the supply of OB/GYNS would decrease by 7 percent, while certified midwives, women's health nurse practitioners, and women's health physician assistants would increase by 32 percent, 89 percent, and 56 percent, respectively. Importantly, she explained that these increases were not expected to occur uniformly: some states and regions would have an oversupply (up to 157 percent of need) and others would have an undersupply (as low as 57 percent of need). Update from the Office of Minority Health Juliet Bui, M.P.A., M.S.W., HHS/Office of Minority Health Ms. Juliet Bui highlighted HHS Office of Minority Health (OMH) fiscal year 2021 grant initiatives relevant to the Committee. The first was a \"Framework to Address Health Disparities Through Collaborative Policy Efforts\" initiative (MP -CPI-21-003, MP- CPI-21-004) to identify and address policies that created or perpetuated health disparities by contributing to structural racism. She explained that t he initiative was comprised of a coordinating center and demonstration project sites that work together to demonstr ate the effectiveness of a methodological framework for identifying these policies. Another grant initiative she discussed was the Minority Leaders Development Program (MP- CPI-21-008), which will support a fellowship program at HHS for early- career indiv iduals to provide training focused on health equity issues and to develop the skills and competencies The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 7 necessary for federal leadership. She shared that t he program will support efforts to promote diversity in senior positions at HHS agencies. Ms. Bui als o mentioned the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity project (MP- CPI-21-007) which will support education, service, policy development, and research related to advancing sustainable solutions to address health disparities among American India n/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations. Last, she shared that the Accessing Social Determinants of Health Data through Local Data Intermediaries initiative (MP -CPI-21-002) will seek to demonstrate the capacity of existing loca l data intermediaries to facilitate community stakeholder access to and use of social determinants of health data. She explained that t he initiative will work to increase community stakeholders' skill and capacity to use and apply these data to reduce heal th disparities in all racial/ethnic minority populations. She concluded by stating that these projects were anticipated to begin September 30, 2021. Discussion Dr. Steve Calvin, as a recipient of a National Health Service Corps scholarship in the 1970s, expressed gratitude to CAPT Williams for her work. He asked how HRSA is communicating these opportunities to potential scholarship recipients. He also wondered about suppor t for the Nursing Workforce Diversity program. CAPT Williams answered that HRSA does conduct engagement activities through social media, schools, health care associations, and virtual job fairs. In terms of support for nurse practitioners and midwives, she explained that BHW grants did not have direct service components, but they did have grants to institutions to strengthen their ability to recruit and train. She shared that she anticipated expansion in the future in the number of programs and institutional capacity to advance the nursing workforce. Dr. Janelle Palacios asked about plans to expand the Primary Care Training and Enhancement- Community Prevention and Maternal Health (PCTE- CPMH ) model to emergency department staff. Additionally, she wanted to know about linkages to primary care and academic health centers for vulnerable women and infants living in rural communities. CAPT Williams said th e programs focus ed on residency and fellowship training for family medicine and primary care, but there were no specific mechanisms for emergency medicine. She added that each proposal specified a different way to link vulnerable, complicated patients to primary care. In light of the ongoing influx of refugees and immigrants, Dr. Ehlinger asked whether HRSA was looking to engage foreign- trained physicians in clinical practice. CAPT Williams said that BHW grant programs typically required trainees to be U. S. citizens or permanent residents. There were no particular programs specifically focused on foreign-trained physicians. An attendee asked about work at BHW to optimize dispersion of limited resources across states in the context of COVID-19. CAPT Williams replied that the pandemic emphasized the importance of training and licensing nurses to practice in multiple states. She shared that from a workforce perspective, BHW planned to encourage promotion of these efforts to state associations and licensure g roups. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 8 Dr. Palacios asked about funding or nurse midwifery schools and if there was demographic tracking upon entry into a school (e.g., proportion of self-identified minority students and proportion who graduate). CAPT Williams confirmed that diversity programs collect some of this information during the application process. She shared that i nstitutions may receive priority points based on meeting certain benchmarks for students from underrepresented minorities, of disadvantaged status, or from rural and underserved backgrounds. She further detailed that performance measures have also enabled BHW to track and collect program data, such as enrollment and graduation rate. She explained that they have developed a scorecard to compare certain performance metrics such as diversity of trainees and efforts to retain, support, and graduate them. Race Concordant Care and Other Strategies to Advance Racial Equity in Maternal and Infant Health Belinda Pe ttiford race- concordant care as a possible way to reduce disparities in birth outcomes. As the Co -Chair of the Health Equity Workgroup, she shared the workgroup 's focus on race -concordant care was based on its impacts on access to and utilization of care from relationship -building. The workgroup also recogniz ed that communities should have the option to select providers who look like them and understand their specific needs. She explained that while the majority of the U.S. population already had access to race- concordant care, BIPOC populations typically did not. She then introduced t he panel of speakers who would provide an overview of race-concordant care, the importance of respectful care, and methods to strengthen the diversity of women's health care workforce pipelines. William McDade . M.D., Ph.D., Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Dr. William McDade explained that race-concordant care is care by a provider who shares the patient's racial/ethnic identity. He stated that p atients may have sought out physicians of the same race/ethnicity for comfort, language concordance, safety, trust, and a shared worldview. He similarly stated that p hysicians may have chosen to disproportionately care for patients of their same race/ethnicity as a result of race-conscious professionalism, a sense of societal contribution, and recognition of the unique role they can play in their patients' lives. He cited a study from Johns Hopkins that suggested that race-concordant care enables physicians and patients to find common personal beliefs, values, and styles of communication. Dr. McDade informed the Committee that the benefits of race- concordant care were well known. He explained that perceived personal similarities between patient and physician increase trust, satisfaction, and adherence to medical advice. He additionally stated that c linical access improved among individuals who would rather forego care than receive it in a dehumanizing or disrespectful environment. Dr. McDade also cited an Oakland study that found that cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality decreased by 19 and 10 percent, re spectively, when Black men were seen by a Black doctor compared to a White doctor. He also cited another study that found that Black newborns were up to 56 percent more likely to survive when treated by a Black doctor. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 9 However, Dr. McDade cautioned against dependence on race- concordance care to eliminate health disparities given that inequities are driven not just by medical factors but by social determinants of health , including lack of access to healthy food, community and interpersonal violence, pollution and toxicity, housing insecurity, poverty, inadequate transportation, and other key environmental factors that mediate a person's health outcomes. He stated that a ccordingly, efforts to improve the workforce are insufficient. He shared that data from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) indicate d that the percentage of Black residents in the workforce has not changed at all in the last 15 years, and the percentage of Latinx individuals has changed insignificantly. To increase the proportion of health care workers from these historically marginalized groups, he said that workforce efforts must change. ACGME has been working to educate and deploy medical students from underrepresented groups, who are disproportionately likely to report that they plan to practice in an underserved community. Dr. McDade reiterated that communication, trust, safety; fair performance measures; and incentives for non-marginalized physicians to work in underserved areas were key for improving health outcomes in marginalized populations. Patricia Loftman , C.N.M, ML.M., M.S., FACNM, Chair , BILPOC Committee, New York Midwives ; Member, New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene Maternal Mortality Review Committee Ms. Patricia Loftman provided a midwifery perspective on race- concordant care. She emphasized that maternal mortality remains a key indicator of inequity, which has been more strongly impacted by social determinants of health than by behaviors and clinical care. To illustrate the importance of race -concordant care in maternal health outcomes, she presented data from the Listening and Giving Voice to Mothers survey conducted by a research group called the Birth place Lab. The data Ms. Loftman shared showed that women of color have consistently reported disrespectful care from obstetrical provide rs, and many mothers have described several discriminatory practices during childbirth and their hospital stay. The data showed that one in six women reported being mistreated during childbirth, including violations of physical privacy and threats to withhold treatment. It further detailed that these mistreatments were more commonly experienced by Indigenous, Latinx, and Black women. It showed that nearly one in three Black women who gave birth in a hospital reported interest in home birth for subsequent delivery, and 28 percent said they experienced more mistreatment in a hospital setting than in community settings. Ms. Loftman noted that the midwifery community was small, compris ed only 13,500 midwives across the country, 90 percent of whom were White. She noted that of the 40 available Midwifery Education Programs, 87 percent were headed by White service directors, and 75 percent of faculty were White. To increase the number of midwives of color, she stated that the field needed to migrate away from predominantly White academic institutions and into historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). To improve diversity along the midwifery pipeline, Ms. Loftman said there was a need to increase the number of students who graduate to become practitioners, to increase faculty in The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 10 midwifery education programs, address practitioner retention upon graduation, and strengthen funding for research on race-concordant outcomes. She suggested that e fforts to address workforce diversity could include federal legislation for workforce diversification, such as the MOMS Act and the Momnibus Bill. Critically, she stated, funding must include accountability metrics to ensure that students of color are equitably enrolled, graduated, and employed. Discussion Dr. Pe ttiford asked about specific recommendations for SACIM to strengthen and diversify the current pipeline. Dr. McDade cited legislation prepared by the House Ways and Means Committees, which aimed to enhance the pipeline of individuals from underrepresented minority backgrounds. An attendee pointed out the focus on certified nurse midwives rather than certified professional midwives and certified midwives. Ms. Loftman said that the American College of Nurse Midwives ( ACNM ) represented certified midwives and certified nurse midwives, while certified professional midwives may have fallen by the wayside because they did not work in hospital settings. Ms. Loftman explained that they were only legal in 38 states, so SACIM could support legalization of certified professional midwives in all 50 states. She suggested that doulas were another opportunity to improve the pipeline into midwifery education. Dr. Palacios wondered about the activities the Committee should address in the next two or three decades to preemp tively address the anticipated shortage of nurses, physicians, and midwives. Dr. McDade said the first step was to address the wealth gap with respect to underrepresented minority groups and the majority community. He emphasized the importance of early education and noted a need to build infrastructure to improve preparation for higher education. Otherwise, he stated, the Committee can work to expose people to job-sharing opportunities and research participation to broaden the pipeline. Ms. Loftman agreed and said efforts should increase the visibility of midwives and especially midwives of color. S he said a goal should be to enable any certified professional midwife student who graduates from an accredited formal education to be legal in the state in which they would like to practice. Dr. Colleen Malloy asked about the overlap between violence and reduced life expectancy in underserved communities. Dr. McDade responded that social determinants of health more strongly impact ed poor outcomes in African American communities than did gun violence. He stated that w hile peaks in violence have contributed somewhat, low li fe expectancy in these communities largely ha d preceded rampant gun violence and was more likely attributable to lack of access to care, quality food, education, and transportation. Dr . Malloy also pointed out some concerns about the study that race discor dance in a Florida neonatal unit was associated with higher mortality among Black babies. She stated that t he physician rated (by photographic identification of race) for race concordance with the infant was the admitting doctor, who may or may not have provided the majority of care for that infant's stay. Dr. McDade agreed that the study had its limitations and added that there was a need to collect race/ethnicity information from practitioners for a more direct analysis of the impact of race concordance. Dr. Wanda Barfield noted that the Committee should acknowledge historical missteps and systemic obstacles to pipeline diversity, particularly student debt. Ms. Loftman answered that The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 11 most midwifery students qualif ied for national health training for loan repayment, which eliminate d this barrier. She said that other obstacles were more challenging, and policy makers should revisit important legislation like the Bakke Decision. Dr. McDade agreed that there was a need for federal support for students in post-bac programs, whose quality of work may have suffer ed from concurrent employment to pay for the program. Data to Action: Strengthening MCH-Related Sentinel Event Review Approaches, Systems, and Uses Magda Peck, Sc.D. , SACIM Member - Facilitator/Moderator Dr. Peck opened the Data to Action panel by talking about how data to action is defined as data that was used for accountability, advocacy, and impact. The panel was focused on maternal, infant, and child mortality reviews, which was a methodology that looked at each event to consider the different determinants of health involved in the outcome, what changes may have prevented the outcome, and at what levels those changes needed to occur. Dr. Peck shared that in December 2019, SACIM re ceived a comprehensive briefing on maternal and infant mortality reviews from MCHB and CDC, which included how mortality review methods were being adapted for morbidity reviews. She reported that a s a result of these presentations, SACIM included recommendations spe cific to mortality and morbidity reviews in their recommendations to the Secretary . The presentations on this panel took a deeper dive into the comprehensive, coordinated, and community -engaged case review systems designed to yield data for action. Dr. Peck asked the panelists to address how to align data for the greatest impact, what was needed to strengthen their case review tools, what success would look like, and how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the review process. Julie Zaharatos, M.P.H., Division of Reproductive Health, CDC Ms. Julie Zaharatos talked about the Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs) at the Maternal and Infant Health Branch of CDC and the state- and local -level s of the maternal mortality review process. She explained that the purpose of the reviews was to gain insight about maternal mortality through a better understanding of the medical and nonmedical contributors to these deaths and to develop and prioritize recommendations to prevent deaths in the future. She shared that t he sources of data included death c ertificates ; medical, social services, and mental health records; autopsy findings; and, in some cases, informant interviews. She reported that t he MMRCs include representatives from public health, clinical, and community sectors. Ms. Zaharatos shared tha t in 2016, the CDC began to work with the existing 20 MMRCs in the U.S. Since then, CDC has helped the existing MMRCs build better data systems, stood up 25 new state and local committees, and created training and networking opportunities. She stated that t here were currently 50 state and local MMRCs. Of these 50 MMRCs, 48 used the Maternal Mortality Review Information Application (MMRIA or \"Maria\"), a CDC data system that provided a common data language that facilitate d a more comprehensive d ata collection and, ultimately, improved prevention efforts. She reported that in 2021, CDC received Congressionally-appropriated funds to fund 30 review programs through their Erase Maternal Mortality Program , which has support ed mortality review documentation opportunities, training, The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 12 and other technical assistance. Ms. Zaharatos shared that t hese funds were leveraged during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide virtual opportunities for peer learning. Ms. Zaharatos reviewed some existing MMRC data on pregnancy- related deaths by race, which show ed racial disparities. She stated that this data supported the development and prioritization of interventions that specifica lly address ed these disparities. She offered the example of how MMRIA collected both quantitative and qualitative data on risk factors, such as mental health, domestic violence, incarceration, and substance use, as well as instances of racial discrimination and bias. She noted that this data can lead to change. She explained that s tates were reporting on their MMRIA data , which led to the development and implementation of state-level policy recommendations, such a s extended Medicaid coverage. She further shared how CDC had invested in data quality processes, ensuring that data collection was consistent, accurate, and timely. They also worked towards ensuring that MMRCs had diverse representation in both clinical and community expertise and experience. CDC intended to invest more in routine qualitative data review processes, including informant interviews specifically from patients and family perceptions of providers and systems. They developed a next-of-kin interview guide that was currently implemented by a few MMRCs. Ms. Zaharatos explained that t hese interviews are critical in identifying the important role of discrimination and bias in maternal mortality . CDC worked with government and university partners in the development of the Community Vital Signs dashboard, which helps identify community -level indicators of risk and disparities. They anticipated that MMRIA users w ould have access to Community Vital Signs by September 2022. Ms. Zaharatos cl osed by talking about the CDC's work with the National Indian Health Board to ensure that MMRCs have tribal representation to represent the specific cultures and needs of tribal- led communities. Sara Kinsman , M.D., Ph.D., Director, Division of Child, Adolescent and Family Health, HRSA/ MCHB Dr. Sara Kinsman presented on the MCHB's Natio nal Fetal , Infant and Child Death Review Program , which has been in place for over 30 years and provides critical insight for both the MCHB Title V Block Grant and the Healthy Start programs. The goal of the Fetal Infant Mortality Review (FMIR) has been to increase the number of first birthdays and the goal of the Child Death Review (CDR) has been to keep children alive\u2014both accomplished through the identification of individual, clinical, and community risk factors and the development of recommendations for change. She explained that CDR is a multidisciplinary process to better understand why children die and develop prevention efforts to reduce those fatalities. The reviews cover ed child deaths from infancy to age 17. She reported that t here were approximately 1,300 CDRs in the U.S. across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. and nine of these states were currently developing tribal CDR teams . She shared that s tate legislation impacted the types of fatalities reviewed and certain aspects of the review process. Certain states , she noted, mandated or permit ted state or local CDR review teams , including if the CDR review was led by the state health department, social service agencies, medical examiners, attorneys general, or hospitals. She stated that s ome states ' The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 13 reviews were funded by MCHB Title V Block Grants and others by the CDC Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) or Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) C ase R egistry funds. Dr. Kinsman highlighted that c ase selection also varie d by state\u2014certain types of death, such as SUID, were more often reviewed than others, such as foster care or medical deaths. She explained that t he agency leading the CDR typically entered data into the National Fatality Review Reporting System and the CDR team then analyzed the data to determine risk and preven tion approaches. Dr. Kinsman said that FI MR is a more intensive community -based, action -oriented process of reviewing de-identified fetal and infant death cases towards developing recommendations for improved care systems and services. She explained that the de- identified data was an important component of ensuring that FIM R was focused on system changes. There were currently 154 FMIR across 27 states, territories, and Washington, D.C. She reported that most were led by state or local health departments , authorized through local legislative mandates, and funded by MCHB Title V Block Grants and the Healthy Start program. She shared that case selection varied by community \u2014for instance some communities focus ed on perinatal HIV and others focus ed on sleep -related deaths. She explained that FI MRs looked at de- identified data from multiple sources including medical, prenat al, home visiting, and WIC records. She shared that t here was also a family interview to include the perspectives of the parents, families, and caregivers on the challenges that may have led to the infant death. Despite the valuable insights these intervie ws offer, she noted, they have been challenging to conduct immediately after an infant death . She stated that FI MRs have been unable to successfully complete most of their attempted interviews. Dr. Kinsman explained that the FI MR Case Review Team analyzed the data and developed recommendations, which were then sent to a Community Action T eam to prioritize and implement through systems or policy changes. FIMR data was entered into the National Fatality Review -Case Review Reporting System . She reported that since 2000, there have been approximately 250,000 cases entered into the system, which represent ed about a third of all infant deaths. There has been an effort over the last two years to improve data quality and create standardized reports. She highlighted how this aggregate data helped support a national approach towards reducing infant mortality and racial disparities . For instance, she shared that the data showed that certain infant sleeping practices can contribute to sleep- related infant deaths. Dr. Kinsman reviewed the new Child Dynamic Analysis and Statistics H UB (Child Dash), which summarize d information from child death reviews across state. She also talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the review process, including a move to virtual settings, inclusion of COVID -19 as a direct or indirect cause of death , and self- care resources for case review coordinators. DAY TWO: Wednesday, September 22 , 2021 SACIM Organizational Issues Vanessa Lee, Designated Federal Official, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources & Services Administration The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 14 Lee Wilson , Division Director, MCHB/Division of Healthy Start and Perinatal Services , HRSA Ms. Lee provided several administrative and operational updates regarding the charter, bylaws, and new mem bership. She shared that the Committee charter w ould be renewed by its expiration date on September 30, 2021, and a federal register notice would follow to inform the public . All committee members w ould receive a copy of the new charter. Mr. Wilson added that the Committee's role continues to include address ing maternal health, which had been added to the previous Charter. Ms. Lee shared that the Bylaws were also in the approval process, having been on hold briefly to ensure consistency with the new charter. Ms. Lee noted that the charter allow ed up to 21 members to the Committee, and MCHB had been working for nearly a year to fill the remaining positions. MCHB was still waiting for background vetting and approval on recommended nominees. M r. Wilson said that the final stage included ethics provisions to identify possible conflicts of interest or financial issues to be addressed or recused. He added that all nominees under consideration at this point had been contacted. Mr. Wilson addressed efforts to promote diversity among new members and shared that MCHB was carefully considering factors such as nominees' professional expertise, gender, race/ethnicity, and several other factors to ensure adequate representation in the Committee. Ms. Lee added the factors included early -career professionals and members from the community or those with lived experience, which had been suggested by current Committee members as a need . Dr. Peck asked how many members were expected to onboard by December 2021 and how many would leave. She also wondered when current members w ould undergo a second ethics review by HRSA. Ms. Lee answered that, if all nominees currently being vetted were approved, the Committee would welcome nine new members. Mr. Wilson said the ultimate goal was to reach the full complement of 21 members, although these efforts would be staggered to mitigate dramatic changes in Committee composition over time. They also shared that the ethics review occurred annually, and some members might undergo a review prior to the end of their terms next summer. Health of Indigenous Mothers and Infants and Their Communities: Context, Current Conditions, Challenges Janelle Palacios, Ph.D., C.N.M., R.N., SACIM Member -- Facilitator The began with an invocation from Wak \u00edya Sky LaPointe from Minnesota. He was an indigenous human rights advocate and co- convener of the Mni Ki Wakan. He centered Lakota knowledge, language, and ways of life in his work to advance human rights and water justice, particularly in his work in partnership with indigenous peoples and with youth. Dr. Palacios acknowledged the ancestral land upon which she stands, paying homage to the ancestors who were displaced by federal, state, and local policies. She then presented a visual storytelling of Indigenous history to contextualize the panel that followed . She emphasized that storywork was an important way to understand and improve maternal- infant birth outcomes The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 15 among Native people and reminded the Committee that Native people remain resilient in the face of immense hardships. Her presentation reviewed background data. She shared that Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates than White women during pregnancy or after birth, and their outcomes worsen ed as they aged. She also highlighted that Indigenous infants experienced the highest rates of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Dr. Palacios explained that reproducti ve and perinatal health among Indigenous people was substantially mediated by traumatic childhood experiences, which also were associated with increased risk for long- term negative health effects such as smoking, alcoholism, substance use, suicide attempts, depression, diabetes, obesity, and other conditions. Furthermore, she shared that as the number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increased, so did the risk for negative health outcomes throughout the lifespan\u2014including fertility problems , such as recurrent miscarriages. She explained that m any ACEs have been related to historical trauma, a cumulative multi- generational experience of emotional and psychological injury to communities and their decedents as experienced by a specific culture or racial/ ethnic group. Dr. Palacios then illustrated these concepts by presenting vignettes of maternal-infant morbidity and mortality from four women in her life: her grandmother, her mother, her great aunt, and her best friend. S he explained that the estimated size of the Indigenous population prior to Western contact in 1492 was roughly 60 million people, similar to the population of Europe at the time, however 1600, only about 4 million Indigenous people remained. Those who survived, s he noted, were forcibly r emoved from their homelands and pushed farther west by legislation, such as the Indian Removal Act in 1830, which culminated in a winter death march known as the Trail of Tears. She also shared that g overnment policies also effectively eliminated the U.S. bison population to control Indigenous people's food resources. Dr. Palacios also discussed other traumatic historical events such as the Dawes Act, the massacre at Wounded Knee, and boarding schools. She explained how Indian boarding schools forced students to assimilate to Western culture and force d detribalization. She detailed how t hese children were subject to verbal, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse , and were cut off from their families and communities. She noted that the Indian Relocation Act of 1950 further decentralized families and led to rapid dissolutio n of tribes. Dr. Palacios stated that t hese policies and procedures devastated \u2014and continued to devastate\u2014 Native American populations. She reported that in 2015, Indigenous children were overrepresented in the foster care population relative to any othe r ethnic identity. She further shared that Natives were nearly twice as likely to live in poverty than the rest of the U.S. population, and their median household income was $10,000 less. She explained that life expectancy was 5.5 years less than the U.S. general population, and unintentional injuries, suicide, and homicide were the three highest causes of mortality among young Indigenous women. She noted that in 2016 alone, 5,712 Indigenous women and girls were reported murdered or missing, and about 84 pe rcent of Indigenous women have experienced violence in their lifetimes, and more than half have experienced sexual violence. Finally, she reported that non-Native men perpetrate d 96 percent of rapes of Indigenous women but were rarely prosecuted. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 16 Dr. Palacios also emphasized that the U.S. government's pedigree- based approach to Native identity was fundamentally incompatible with Indigenous people's understanding of tribal membership. She noted, however, government- defined tribal membership has dictate d a Native person's ability to own land and access other resources. Consequently, she explained, at this time more than 300,000 Indigenous people were underhoused or homeless, and about one-third of reservation housing was overcrowded. She further detailed that only one in ten families have stable, reliable internet connection, and one in three reservation- based families live without plumbing. She also discussed the Indian Health Service ( IHS), which was intended to serve Indigenous peoples but has been involved in eugenics campaigns that forcibly sterilized more than 3,000 Native women from 1973 to 1976. Dr. Palacios reported that experts hypothesize that 25 to 40 percent of the Native childbearing population had been sterilized at this time. Dr. Palacio s highlighted other pressing issues among Indigenous peoples, including mass incarceration and the COVID -19 pandemic. She shared that r ecently, Native women giving birth at a hospital were racially profiled by household proximity to a reservation, and they were forcibly separated from their newborns, even on reservations with no active COVID- 19 cases. She explained that the top three causes of maternal mortality among Indigenous women were hemorrhage, cardiomyopathies, and hypertensive disorders. She also h ighlighted that N ative American women travel ed significantly farther than White women to access obstetric care, and they were twenty times more likely to give birth at a facility that lack ed an obstetrics unit. Dr. Palacios concluded by reiterating that a history of severe trauma has facilitated a breakdown of traditional Indigenous family values, increased alcohol and substance use as self-medication, rising rates of mental disorders and suicide, and rampant child abuse and domestic violence. She concluded by stating that a ll efforts to effectively address these health disparities among Native people must consider the violence and abuse perpetrated upon them over centuries of Western expansion. Susan Stemmler , M.P.H., Ph.D., FNP, CNM, CA Midwife, Liai son Women's Health in IHS/Tribal Communities, American College of Nurse- Midwives Dr. Susan Stemmler was the first person of American Indian ancestry to serve as the American College of Nurse-Midwives liaison to ACOG. She shared that ACOG recently celebrated its 50 th anniversary as a contractor with IHS for evaluation of women's health care across all 12 area s of the IHS but particularly those that provide direct services to Native women. Dr. Stemmler shared that data indicated that 78 percent of Native Americans now reside in cities, and youth were disproportionately represented among this urban population. She stated that while people that lived on their native lands had access to IHS facilities for health care, those that lived in urban areas had fewer available resources. The A ffordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Native people's ability to sign up for health care, but Dr. Stemmler posited that the IHS may now be in jeopardy in areas where non- tribal site health care was available. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 17 She briefly told the story of a young pregnant Native woman named Jean Bear who had to drive 82 miles to the nearest hospital with prenatal care and delivery services. Dr. Stemmler explained that the IHS facility on Ms. Bear's reservation stopped delivering babies in 1970, and many other sites have closed maternal and childcare services since. After finding she was pregnant with twins, Ms. Bear had to drive more than 300 miles total to receive adequate care. Dr. Stemmler highlighted how Jean Bear's story underscored the importance of transportation to health care, childcare, and support for women living in rural areas who were seeki ng important pregnancy- related services. In her work with ACOG, Dr. Stemmler visited facilities in IHS areas, where she identified a substantial number of fundamental issues. She reported that r ural IHS facilities suffered a provider shortage, inconsistent recordkeeping and update of medical procedures, poor community outreach, and few professional linkages with local health care facilities. Dr. Stemmler also reported that in urban IHS facilities, care delivery was complicated by non - uniformity of services, inconsistent community linkages, and limited 638 Federally Qualified Health Centers ( FQHC ) options. Dr. Stemmler reviewed urgent needs in maternal and child health care in Native communities. She stated that they needed earlier linkage to prenatal care; enhanced perinatal education and community involvement strategies; and efforts to address pressing concerns such as obesity, diabetes, and substance use. Dr. Stemmler emphasized that at -home nurse visits at days 1, 3, and 7 postpartum were key for promoting health among new mothers. To care for providers, Dr. Stemmler recommended the use of professional collaborative care, professional in-service, telemedicine, and contingency plans for early delivery. She stated that there has been a troubling dearth of Native midwives, and that health care professionals who need to support their families rarely receive opportunities to grow within the profession beyond work at community hospitals. Last ly, Dr. Stemmler pointed out that geographic hurdles (e.g., large snowdrifts in Montana) can challenge patient transfer across facilities. Linda Bane Frizzell, Ph.D., Associate Professor, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota Dr. Linda Bane Frizzell began by acknowledging that she stands on Dakota land. Her presentation focused on policies and procedures that have shaped Native life in recent years. First, she explained that the federal government recognizes 575 tribes and 74 states. She shared that in the mid -1970s, Public Law 03-638 required every tribe to have a constitution, which discarded millennia of cultural traditions, judicial systems, and education practices. She explained that because tribes have constitutions and operate with their own governmental policies and procedures, American Indians and Alaska Natives are identified as a political group rather than a racial/ethnic group. She noted that t his is beneficial in that tribes have stronger capacity to directly meet the needs of their people. Dr. Bane Frizzell then discussed health services provided by tribal governments. She shared that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was a missed opportunity to apply for direct funding, which tribes typically prefer. She explained that curre ntly 50 states had different quote-covered The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 18 services, and tribal advocates were working to encourage CMS to establish a core set for behavioral health. She detailed o ther important legislation that included the Indian Self- Determination Education Act and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which were both submitted in the late 1990s. Notably, she pointed out that the Indian Health Care Improvement Act has established a pseudo- national license for health providers to conduct telehealth in any area. She explained that in 2010 Native populations were added to the Affordable Care Act but were considered \"domestic dependent nations.\" Dr. Bane Frizzell then reviewed the basic infrastructure of the I HS, a federal agency established in 1955. She shared that IHS serve d federally recognized tribes and tribal organizations at 31 hospitals, 83 health centers, 2 school health centers, and 31 health stations, while the Urban Indian Health Program (UIHP) consist ed of 35 non-profit 501(c)3 programs nationwide. She stated that n early half of UIHPs received Medicaid reimbursement as Federally Qualified Health Centers. Dr. Bane Frizzell pointed out that the IHS receives an insufficient amount of money to meet Native people's needs. Despite ongoing problems with IHS data, Dr. Bane Frizzell stressed that there remained clear evidence that significant health disparities still existed among Native populations. She cited that homicide and other forms of violence remained rampant, and drug trafficking was an ongoing concern. She additionally pointed out that poverty, gang activity, and repeated losses have led to significant trauma among Native youth. She also noted that N ative p opulations suffer ed inordinately high infant mortality rates; lack ed consistent access to fresh, healthy foods; and lagged in basic health education. She concluded by emphasizing that Native people continued to demonstrate immense resilience in the face of ongoing hardship. Financing of Care for Pregnant and Postpartum Individuals Steve Calvin , M.D., SACIM Member Dr. Calvin said that, despite being a world leader in technological advances and spending more than an y other developed nation on health care, the U.S. consistently lag ged behind other developed nations in terms of maternal and infant health outcomes. He said a mor e significant problem was that these outcomes demonstrate d significant disparities across race and geography. Dr. Calvin then reviewed how care was paid for. He cited that as of March 2021, 42 percent of pregnancy care was funded through Medicaid and 50 percent through private insurance. The remaining care was funded through self-pay or other means, such as military or IHS programs. Of tho se who had care funded by Medicaid, Dr. Calvin highlighted that over 65 percent were Black and less than 30 percent were White. Conversely, he pointed out, of those who had care funded by private insurance, less than 30 percent were Black and nearly 64 percent were White. Dr. Calvin concluded that Medicaid reform was therefore crucial towards addressing maternal and infant health disparities. Dr. Calvin recommended reviewing a 2020 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) , which showed the distribution of cost s across eight pregnancy-related conditions. He highlighted that the study showed that 42 percent of all U.S. births were paid for by Medicaid, but 70 percent of pregnancy and newborn care were paid for by private insurance and out- of-pocket payments. He suggested that t he implication of this finding was that there was significant private subsidization of the public program for pregnancy care . He additionally cited a Truven Health study that showed that two-thirds of the The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 19 amount spent on pregnancy was spent on facility fees , with the remaining spent on professional fees, imaging, labs, and pharmacy. Dr. Calvin shared that Medicaid eligibility range d across states from 138 to 326 percent of the federal poverty level. Further, he pointed out that there had been an accelerating transition from direct fee- for-service to managed care organizations (MCOs). He stated that Medicaid MCOs currently provided 69 percent of Medicaid care nationally, and that number was growing. He highlighted t he Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) report called Value Based Pay ment for Maternity Care in Medicaid Findings from Five States . The report indicated that performance value- based models incentivize d limited quality measures, focusing mostly on health screening, but not cost of care. In his perspective, Dr. Calvin said the solution for high value perinatal care was transparency in reporting; accountability through patient satisfaction and financial and outcome data requirements ; and culturally -competent , patient- focused care that was paid for by value. Discussion Dr. Ehlinger asked if MACPAC had recommendations that SACIM could use. Dr. Calvin answered that there were no specific recommendations in the report , but that it was an opportunity for SACIM to look at the data and develop recommendations. Dr. E hlinger also asked for clarification about the differen ces in percentages of pregnancies paid for by Medicaid. Dr. Calvin said 42 percent of pregnancies were paid for by Medicaid and 70 percent of total spending on pregnancy care was private. He explained that thi s indicate d a payer mix of public and commercial payments , with public payments paying significantly less. Dr. Barfield asked about the relative disincentives for delivery, which wa s tied to access to care issues because most of the cost was in the delivery event. She also asked about time limits in care for high -risk infants. Dr. Calvin answered that spending on neonatal care was the most complicated and depend ed on availability of neonatologists across the country. He stated that most spending on neonatal services wa s in the intensive care unit (ICU). Bundled payments, in some cases, he suggested, resulted in better outcomes for lower costs. He added that t here needed to be incentives for collaborative teams so that an anesthesiologist was not worried about being paid for an epidural or a perinatologist was not worried about being paid for the ultrasound. He concluded that t here instead should be a comprehensive package of care. Ms. Pettiford asked if enhanced reimbursement for pregnancy covered all of Medicaid or only clinical services. Dr. Calvin said that it is all of Medicaid, including centering pregnancy and doula services. Dr. Ehlinger asked if there was a way to extend enh anced care and financing for all, and in particular, for the American Indian population. Dr. Calvin responded that a voucher program could be helpful, but that it was important for that community to be able to choose care that best served them. Dr . Stemmle r added that the majority of people covered by the Affordable Car e Act do have an option to choose their health program, including the ability to receive care at IHS facilities. Dr. Bane Frizzell also responded that , historically, IHS used managed care that many perceived as rationed care. She shared that there had been a recent change in the system and now tribes c ould choose the care they wanted , and then bill and reimburse the facility. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 20 Public Comment Vanessa Lee, Designated Federal Official, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources & Services Administra tion Ms. Lee announced that the Committee received two written comments and one request for an oral public comment from Dr. Barbara Ostfeld . Ms. Lee introduced Dr. Ostfeld as a professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers University, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and the program director at the SIDS Center of New Jersey. Dr. Ostfeld addressed SUID and the potential impact of the pandemic on increasing SUID rates. She recommended that the impact of COVID-19 be measured not only in terms of morbidity a nd mortality of the disease itself but in terms of other adverse outcomes on individuals and their families. She also expressed concern about mounting evidence of significant racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Data indicated an increase in preterm bi rths among women diagnosed with COVID-19 in addition to changes in smoking habits, a decrease in breastfeeding, economic instability, and disruptions to prenatal care. She stated all of these factors ha d the potential to disrupt safe infant sleep practices. Dr. Peck thanked Dr. Ostfeld for her comments and noted data on this from the National Center for Fetal and Infant Mortality Review. Data to Action Discussion: Strengthening MCH-Related Sentinel Event Review Approaches, Systems and Uses Dr. Ehlinger briefly summarized the content of the previous day's Data to Action presentation and opened the session to questions and comments. Dr. Palacios began by asking about efforts to address the disproportionate impact of child loss on smaller communities, particularly tribal communities. Dr. Kinsman answered that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working closely with six tribal entities and the Casey Family Foundation to develop protocols that protect the community. She added that FIMR interviews were delivered by trained social workers who are skilled in bereavement and may offer opportunities for community healing. Dr. Palacios commented that law enforcement on tribal reservations was complicated. She pointed out missed opportunities for appropriate collection of information and evidence in this regard. Dr. Peck said the Data to Action Workgroup will remain mindful of this consideration. She stressed that t he goal is to develop qualitative and quantitative community-driven data from mature, well -aligned health case review systems. Dr. Bane Frizzell mentioned the 280 Law, which further complicated tribal law enforcement efforts. Dr. Peck asked about the alignment and interplay between FIMR and CDR, wondering how the Committee ca n further encourage integration of these data systems. Ms. Zaharatos said the two can be difficult to align. Dr. Kinsman said that the Maternal Mortality Review likely will inform important recommendations related to social determinants of health , and because the FIMR was de-identified, these reviews could also inform general ways to improve systems of care. Dr. Bane Frizzell reminded them to remain wary of data misclassification; for instance, any person using a tribal facility is coded as a Native person. Dr. Ehlinger asked about messaging to the general population about safe sleep practices. Dr. Kinsman replied that her team used the American Academy of Pediatrics' 17 recommended The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 21 behaviors for safe sleep and narrowed these down to three most common causes of infant death in Philadelphia. Dr. Kinsman shared that they created language and simple images for in-home providers to educate families. They also conducted a breastfeeding campaign. Dr. Ehlinger pointed out that messaging is a societal issue, and there was a need to change the narrative about what promotes health. Narrative Development: Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies, Healthy Society Edward Ehlinger, SACIM Acting Chair Dr. Ehlinger introduced the importance of narratives in public health efforts. He explained that President Lincoln intentionally ensured that his Emancipation Proclamation of 1862 would change the narrative of the Civil War from a struggle to preserve the Union to one focused on ending slavery. Critically, he stressed, one who influenced public sentiment was more powerful than one who enact ed statutes or pronounced decisions because public sentiment enabled successful execution of this legislation. Dr. Ehlinger also cited other powerful examples of narrative changes, such as the Think Before You Drink article that challenged narratives about fetal alcohol syndrome disorders (FASD) in Canada. He highlighted how the article pointed out that the current narrative about FASD in Indigenous communities focused entirely on personal choice with little regard for the societal injustices that created these conditions, such as settler -colonialism and historical trauma. Consequently, these narratives perpetuated existing disease inequiti es and prevented enactment of policies that address ed unmet needs of FASD-affected individuals. Dr. Ehlinger discussed an article published in the New York Times in August 2021 that discussed the 1910 Flexner Report, which encouraged regulations for medical education and adherence to professional standards. He stated that although the Flexner report revolutionized medicine, the author's recommendation to adopt a northern city training model resulted in closure of seven of the nine existing Black medical schools. He pointed out that from this narrative emerged the vision of an \"ideal doctor\" as a White wealthy man from a northern city\u2014a concept that has persisted for m ore than a century. Given the immense social and policy impact of health narratives, Dr. Ehlinger urged the committee to consider narrative development as a key activity. He would like the Committee to create a report analogous to the Flexner report that changes the narrative about the importance of mothers, babies, and families to the long-term success of the country. Next Steps Edward Ehlinger, SACIM Acting Chair Vanessa Lee, Designated Federal Official, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources & Services Administration Dr. Ehlinger asked Committee members to comment on next steps for mobilizing energy to make powerful change. Dr. Pettiford said they needed to include discussions about diversifying the workforce through financial support for individuals from underrepresented communities. Another member suggested giving more attention to advancements in detecting and treating The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM) September 21-22, 2021 22 congenital anomalies before birth. Dr. Ehlinger invited Dr. Lee to consider a presentation on this topic in the future. Dr. Palacios volunteered her time to the narrative reframing initiative. There was a history, particularly in Black and American Indian/Alaska Native communities, that would be relevant to thinking about public health messaging, such as for safe sleep or breastfeeding. Another member spoke about falling short in the diversity of the current health care workforce and the importance of race- concordant care. Dr. Peck added that the increasing effort to include the interview component of lived expe riences in mortality reviews was encouraging and that she would continue to push for strategic storytelling to inform the work. Dr. Malloy reiterated the importance of elevating pregnancy, and the role pregnant women play in society. She also suggested hearing from a speaker who has published on the link between surgical abortion and prematurity, which is a leading cause of infant mortality. Dr. Ehlinger said that looking at objective data on this issue would be helpful and asked Dr. Malloy to identify the data to raise the right questions. Mr. Wilson added that all topics that were raised by Committee members should be considered and explored. He asked Dr. Malloy to clarify the questions she would like raised for discussion at a future meeting in order to prepare background information and data, as well as identify expertise on the topic, for thorough consideration by the Committee. Dr. Malloy thanked them both and agreed to work on this. Adjourn In closing, Dr. Ehlinger asked Committee members to summarize their takeaways from the meeting and adjourned the meeting at 4:00 p.m. "}
